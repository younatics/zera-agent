"Silvio Berlusconi is at the centre of fresh controversy over claims he made a derogatory comment about Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Italian prime minister, 74, is accused of insulting his fellow European leader during a conversation with a newspaper editor. It has been suggested that, in a phone call in early July, Mr Berlusconi referred to 57-year-old Mrs Merkel as ‘an un****able fat ****’. Ladies' man: Silvio Berlusconi (right) shakes hands with Elvira Savino (left) deputy of his party on the day he faces accusations of insulting Angela Merkel . The alleged remarks were picked up by investigators probing a £660,000 blackmail plot against the Italian premier. Hints about the contents of the tapped conversation have been circulating in Italian newspapers for days. Though the alleged offensive comment has not been published, it has been posted on websites. Yesterday the storm moved to Germany . where the country’s best-selling paper Bild ran the story under the . headline, ‘Did Berlusconi insult our Chancellor Merkel?’. Insult: Chancellor Merkel listens to an audio recording as she tours the exhibition Border Experience: Everyday Life in a Divided Germany in Berlin . Mr Berlusconi’s spokesman last night said they had no comment. Il Giornale, the newspaper owned by his family, described the allegation as ‘gossip’. It is not the first time the Italian leader has been accused of insulting the chancellor. Two years ago he kept Mrs Merkel waiting at a summit while he chatted on his mobile telephone. The year before he ‘jumped’ out at her from behind a statue and shouted ‘peek a boo’ when she arrived in Italy for an official visit.

"Southampton will have to pay £5 million if they want to sign Feyenoord midfielder Tonny Vilhena, with the Dutch club reluctant to sell him for anything less. Feyenoord playing hard ball means that Saints boss Ronald Koeman and head of football development Les Reed face a tough decision as to whether to push the move through now or wait until the summer. Vilhena played regularly in Koeman's Feyeoord team last season when the Dutchman was in charge at De Kuip.

However, the 20-year-old has not enjoyed the same success under Koeman's replacement, Fred Rutten, and is keen to link up with his former boss at Southampton. But the south-coast club will have to meet Feyenoord's valuation with Vilhena having been a star of the Dutch Under-17 teams and is considered one of the country's brightest young talents. Koeman and Reed will decide on Sunday whether Southampton should up their bid to £5m, following the £3m departure of Jack Cork to Southampton.

"Too young: Cara Delevingne in a Mulberry advert . Mulberry handbags have long been a proud example of the best of British craftsmanship and are one of the most coveted designer brands. From the butter-soft leathers that give the Bayswater and the Alexa their characteristic luxuriant slouch to the discreet functionality of their classic Clipper holdalls, Mulberry is one of our most desired labels. But everything is not rosy in the company’s Somerset home. On the stock market, its share price fell by a quarter in recent days — from being worth £1.5 billion in its heyday, the value has dropped to around £400 million. Those stark figures hint at trouble afoot. And it’s no surprise: the classic Bayswater bag, beloved by middle-class mums everywhere, cost £495 five years ago. Now it is at least £895 for the basic edition, with most Bayswaters priced at more than £1,100. Not surprisingly, this has driven away many of the brand’s core fans. Fashion experts pinpoint the change to the arrival of a new French CEO 18 months ago. Bruno Guillon — hailing from the snootiest of French brands, Hermes — has been accused of having little understanding of Mulberry’s British character. He has determinedly driven the brand from upmarket, aspirational luxury to the stratospheric end of the price scale. Guillon is said to be determined to take Mulberry from its cosy, country roots into the same category as brands such as Chanel and Louis Vuitton. And it’s not just the classic Bayswater handbag. Today, Mulberry’s small Lily evening bag is £750 — six months ago, it was £595. Bruno Guillon - hailing from the snootiest of French brands, Hermes - has been accused of having little understanding of Mulberry's British character . An Alexa tote in oak buffalo is £1,100 — a couple of years ago, it was £795. In ostrich, rather than leather? That will be £4,500, thank you. The cheapest bag is a tiny Bayswater clutch at £495. Still want to buy into Mulberry? You can always pick up a leather keyring for £60. Top personal shopper Gabrielle Teare thinks Mulberry is out of the reach of the vast majority of shoppers, creating serious problems for the brand. Today, Mulberry's small Lily evening bag is £750 - six months ago, it was £595 . Her clients are busy spending their money at Dior — the irony being that while Mulberry reaches a level where its core British market can no longer afford it, its manufacturing quality and breadth of design simply are not up to scratch in the international luxury market. ‘Prices are off the scale,’ she says. ‘They compete with Dior and Hermes, but they’re just not as innovative.’ Mulberry is clearly no longer the cottage industry that founder Roger Saul began in Somerset in 1971 with a £500 gift from his father. Since a takeover in 2002, growth — and serious profit — has been high on the agenda. Mulberry issued it-bag after it-bag — the Roxanne, the Bayswater, the Alexa, the Del Rey — and courted the celebrities of the moment. Prices crept up of course, and then the Emerald City hove into view: Asia, the great hope of every luxury brand with Hong Kong dollar signs in its eyes. Yet, while they price their products for rich Chinese shoppers, Britain still represents the majority of Mulberry’s customer base, as well as providing its design DNA and international kudos. Indeed, a newly opened second Somerset factory is helping achieve the company’s aim of making half of its goods in Britain. But Mulberry’s British fanbase has noticed the change — the new bag they save up for over  a number of years has gone up by hundreds of pounds. And they’re turning their back on the brand as a result. Business experts, meanwhile, suggest Mulberry should reduce its bag prices to between £200 and £600, to compete with the middle-market likes of Coach and Michael Kors. The Del Rey (left) and Alexa Chung (right) bags: Could such young celebrities alienate grown-up customers . Not that there’s anything wrong in seeking new customers, but constantly raising prices to generate exclusivity surely underestimates the intelligence and tolerance of its customers. Mulberry’s obsession with celebrity may also be problematic: Teare believes that the young, hip likes of Cara Delevingne, Alexa Chung and Lana Del Rey, alienate its more ‘grown-up’ customers. It’s a fair point: the young might be more reckless spenders, but they  are less well-cushioned from hard times than their parents and grandparents, less equipped to recover, and have less cash to spend. So, where can Mulberry fans go if they can’t face the prices? I’d point to Jaeger, another British brand that suffered mixed fortunes as it aimed for a cooler international crowd, is now back on track as it targets a homegrown, older, more affluent market. If you love the Bayswater, £895, go for Jaeger’s Montalba Tote instead, at £299. Fans of the £1,100 Del Rey should take a look at the Penney, on sale in luscious tomato red at £149. And instead of a Clemmie clutch, £595, go for the Olivia box clutch at Jaeger, on sale for just £30. Jaeger understands that biting the hand that feeds you is an easy route to starvation. Mulberry might take note.","New CEO Bruno Guillon has determinedly driven the brand upmarket .

Decisive: People offer prayers for victims killed by the world's first atomic bombing of a city, during World War II in 1945, in front of a cenotaph with viewing through the Atomic Bomb Dome, at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima . Late last month, the last surviving member of the Enola Gay plane crew who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima died at a retirement home in Georgia, aged 93. Van Kirk was the navigator on the flight that dropped the first nuclear bomb used in warfare. He later told reporters that after seeing one atomic bomb explode in war, he never wanted to see another one used again. But he defended the use of the bomb, describing it as the lesser of two evils when compared to the continued aerial assault of the Japanese main islands and a planned U.S. invasion. 'The bomb really saved lives, in spite of the tremendous number of casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because the destruction that would have been caused in Japan otherwise would have been tremendous,' he said in an oral history for Georgia Public Broadcasting. Prelude: View of the atomic bomb, codenamed 'Little Boy,' as it is hoisted into the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress 'Enola Gay' on the North Field of Tinian airbase, North Marianas Islands, early August, 1945 .

USAF photograph . The US B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, carrying 12 crew members, dropped the atomic bomb, nicknamed ""Little Boy"", on Hiroshima in the closing days of World War Two. The death toll from the blast by the end of the year was estimated at about 140,000, out of the total of 350,000 who lived there at the time. Three days after the Hiroshima bombing, the United States dropped an atomic bomb nicknamed 'Fat Man' on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, bringing World War Two to an end. The Pennsylvania-born Van Kirk flew missions in Europe during the war and visited Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic blast there. Aftermath: This September 1945 file picture shows the remaining of the Hiroshima Prefectural Industry Promotion Building, known as the Atomic-Bomb Dome, which was later preserved as a monument .

Preservation: Hiroshima is now a modern success story and embraces Japan's re-integration into the community of nations . He studied chemical engineering after the war and became an executive with DuPont. He said the Hiroshima mission was relatively easy, with no anti-aircraft fire coming from the ground. The big worry was whether the plane would blow up after the bomb detonated, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting. He said that 43 seconds after the bomb was dropped, he saw a flash from the blast. A shockwave then came and shook the aircraft. The number of surviving victims, known as 'hibakusha,' was just more than 190,000 this year. Their average age is 79, and many of the attendants at the ceremony were their younger relatives and descendants. Hiroshima officials said 5,507 survivors died over the past year. Famous plane: The restored Enola Gay is pictured here. The plane famously flew to Japan in August 1945 where it dropped 'Little Boy' and helped usher in the end of World War II . The anniversary comes as Japan is divided over Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent Cabinet decision to allow the country's military to defend foreign countries and play greater roles overseas. To achieve the goal, Abe's Cabinet revised its interpretation of Japan's post-WWII pacifist constitution. Abe said at the event that as the sole country to suffer nuclear attacks, Japan has the duty to seek to eliminate nuclear weapons. But he did not mention his push for a more assertive defense posture.","Carolina Kennedy attended ceremony at Hiroshima where US nuclear bomb was detonated 59-years ago .

"In a major ruling on personal privacy that could see Australia’s privacy laws get an overhaul a Western Australian woman has won almost $50,000 in compensation from an ex-boyfriend who posted sexually explicit videos and photos of her on Facebook. Caroline Wilson took her ex-boyfriend and former co-worker Neil Ferguson to court over the 16 photos and two videos posted briefly on his Facebook page. Ms Wilson is a fly-in, fly-out worker at Fortescue Metals Group's Cloudbreak mine in the Pilbara. Mr Ferguson allegedly posted the content in retaliation after Ms Wilson broke up with him via a text message. Caroline Wilson's ex-boyfriend Neil Ferguson posted sexually explicit photos and videos on his Facebook page . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that in the expletive-laden text messages to Ms Wilson, Mr Ferguson said the photos were 'out for everyone to see ... Can't wait to watch you fold as a human being'. 'By posting the photographs and videos on his Facebook page, the defendant made them available to his approximately 300 'Facebook friends', many of whom worked at Cloudbreak,' West Australian Supreme Court Justice Robert Mitchell said. Ms Wilson was alerted to the posts by friends at about 5.20pm on August 5, 2013. They were deleted at about 7pm after she begged Mr Ferguson to remove them. The explict images were taken down two hours later after she begged Mr Ferguson to remove them . Barrie Goldsmith, Ms Wilson's lawyer, argued she was entitled to an injunction to restrain Mr Ferguson from re-posting the material, as well as compensation for distress and loss of wages. 9 News reported that West Australian Supreme Court Justice Robert Mitchell referred to a 2008 Victorian Court of Appeal decision in which a woman was compensated for emotional distress after her ex-partner distributed copies of sexually explicit video tapes of them both in 1996. Justice Mitchell said that due to technological advancements, it had only become easier and faster to spread similar content. Mr Ferguson allegedly posted the content in retaliation after Ms Wilson broke up with him via a text message . He ruled Ms Wilson was entitled to an injunction and $48,404 in compensation, including $35,000 for emotional distress and $13,404 for loss of wages while on leave. Mr Ferguson was sacked by the mining company over the incident. The Australian Law Reform Commission released a report in June setting out elements of a potential civil action for serious invasions of privacy which would allow compensation for emotional distress, but the Abbott government does not support the new law. The latest ruling may mean Australia's personal privacy laws could face a huge shake-up in the future . However, media law expert at the University of Sydney Law School, Associate professor David Rolph, told the Sydney Morning Herald that the case 'indicates that breach of confidence might provide a remedy for addressing a lot of personal privacy concerns'. 'My own view is that if privacy is a value that's worth protecting it's worth protecting directly and we should think about that in a broader, more comprehensive way,' he said. West Australian Supreme Court Justice Robert Mitchell said that due to technological advancements, it had only become easier and faster to spread this type of content .","Western Australian woman gets almost $50,000 in compensation after ex-boyfriend posts sexually explicit videos and photos of her on Facebook .

"Warner Bros. will cut the scenes featuring guns from the trailer of The Dark Knight Rises following the horrific shooting spree at a midnight showing in Colorado that left 12 cinema-goers dead. The studio's bosses met on . Friday at its Burbank, California offices to discuss whether to go ahead with the move in response to the massacre. A source told TMZ that executives are hoping to replace the old trailers as quickly as possible. However, the studio risks losing millions in what is regarded as the biggest release of the year so far - and which has been predicted to be one of the highest earning movies of all time. Speculation: A poster for The Dark Knight Rises is displayed at Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California.T he studio is considering whether to pull screenings following shootings at the film in Denver . Representatives for the movie studio did not immediately respond to MailOnline for comment. A lack of sensitivity could enrage the families of victims and alienate future viewers. Whether audiences members continue to . flock to the movie or not, The Dark Knight Rises will always be associated with . the violent gun attack. And Warner Brothers, which has made billions from selling violent movies to families and their children, faces the prospect of seeing the blockbuster sink at box offices across the country. The studio has already cancelled the . star-studded premiere in Paris on Friday night, and now bosses are . deciding whether to take further measures, an executive told The Wrap. It has also cancelled two versions of adverts for the film, Bloomberg reported. It seems a wise decision as one character, Bane, wears a face mask similar to the Denver shooter's in the trailer. And as horrifying details of the massacre emerge, the studio has also pulled the trailer for its forthcoming film, Gangster Squad, due to a scene that shows gunmen opening fire in a cinema. Losses: The company could lose millions if screenings do not go ahead for the biggest film of the year . Fate: Christian Bale stars as Batman in the Warner Bros film. The studio has already cancelled some ads . 'We will continue to monitor the . situation and adjust our security needs as necessary,' a spokesman from . Regal theatres added, among increased speculation that entire chains . could pull the film. The Dark Knight cinema massacre may have been inspired by a Batman comic book strip, it emerged on Friday. The bloodbath is a chilling copycat of . a 25-year-old Batman comic strip which features a deranged gunman . opening fire in a cinema. In the second issue of The Dark Knight . Returns, written by Frank Miller - the creative mind behind Sin City . and 300 - gunman Arnold Crimp opens fire in a pornographic theatre, . killing three people, after listening to Led Zepplin's classic track . 'Stairway to Heaven.' Text from the page reads: 'Arnold . Crimp fingers the cold steel thing in his pocket and stares at the movie . marquee and does not throw up. 'He thinks about Led Zeppelin and how they are trying to kill him. 'He had not known about Led Zeppelin until Father Don on TV had explained it last night. 'Father Don said that Led Zeppelin hid a prayer to Satan in their song Stairway to Heaven. 'They hid it very well. They recorded it backwards. 'Arnold Crimp took the album from the . record store where he worked until they fired him this afternoon and . transferred Stairway to Heaven to tape. 'Then he played the tape backwards. He played it forty-seven times until he was absolutely certain that Father Don was right.' Crimp then walks into a cinema, which is screening a pornographic film called My Sweet Satan, and opens fire. Holmes motives behind the massacre are . unknown, but if he was a fan of the Batman comics, then he may well . have read the issue featuring Crimp's killing-spree. Around 3,825 cinemas held screenings on midnight on Thursday - making a staggering $30.6 million - and the film was expected to reach 4,404 theaters across the country and 6,765 screens overseas. Box office analysts predicted it would make as much as $198 million in its first weekend, making it the best U.S. opening ever for a non-3D movie, The Wrap reported. The studio will no doubt feel the heat as the film, directed by Christopher Nolan, had a budget of $250 million and worldwide marketing expenses could drive the total cost up to $400 million. The studio has been Hollywood's King of Franchises for years, generating worldwide ticket sales of $12 billion from its Lord of the Rings, Batman and Harry Potter films. The Dark Knight Rises will be the last of the Batman franchise which began in 2005. Franchise films are especially important . to studios, which use big-budget movies to create theme park rides and sell toys and merchandise. But this recent tragedy could rattle their . earnings. Warner Bros. released a statement . earlier on Friday, which said: 'Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are . deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. 'We extend our . sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this . tragic time.' If screenings do go ahead, cinemas . and police departments across the country have vowed to protect cinema . goers from potential copy-cat attacks. In . New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said his department . would provide coverage at theaters where the film is playing. AMC Theatres said it would not accept . face-masks, costumes or fake guns inside theatres to make all . cinema-goers feel comfortable. Major movie theatre chain Carmike . Cinemas said it will use both uniformed security and plainclothes . officers on top of its hidden security procedures 'not in the sight of . our guests'. Captain Mike Parker of the LA Sheriff's Department added to E!: 'While the tragedy in Aurora, Colo., . appears to be an isolated incident, our vigilance has been raised. Scene of terror: The cinema in Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman killed 12 people and injured 59 at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises . 'The heightened alert includes increased patrols to create a more . visible presence at movie theatres and other places where people . congregate.' The Paris premier was originally . scheduled to take place on Friday night with Nolan and the film's stars . Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway in attendance. But . earlier in the day, workers took down a massive Batman mask mounted on the . front of a cinema along the Avenue des Champs-Elysees, where the . screening had been planned. Warner . Brothers also pulled an interview with French actress Marion Cotillard, . who features in the film, on TF1, the . country's most popular channel. They . have also cancelled the trailer for Gangster Squad due to footage . showing characters firing in a cinema - an erie premonition of the . shooting spree at the hands of James Holmes in Aurora. Shooting spree: James Holmes, pictured left and right in 2006, allegedly bought a ticket for the film before donning ballistic gear, throwing a smoke bomb into the audience and shooting at random . He is reported to have opened fire at a . cinema after buying a ticket to the midnight screening of the film and . killing 12 people, including a 12-year-old. The . footage, which occurs at around the two minute mark, shows several . gangsters shooting behind the big screen, before bursting through it, . taking aim at moviegoers. The clip shows those inside the theatre panicking and screaming as machine guns are shot. The . film stars Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone and . tells the story of the LAPD's fight with the East Coast Mafia to keep . them out of Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s. Although . Gangster Squad had been due to be shown before The Dark Knight Rises in . cinemas across the U.S., it had not been shown before today's shooting . in Aurora, the studio told E! News. It is just one example of the violence prevalent in movies fronted by Hollywood's biggest names. Tragic parallel: Warner Brothers has now pulled its trailer for Gangster Squad appearing before the Dark Knight Rises in cinemas across the country due to a scene where a gunman fires at an audience . There have been fears in the past that such films or TV shows could spark copycat attacks, including horrors such as Scream (1996) and dramas such as The Deer Hunter (1978). In 2004, Donald Gonzales, 25, claimed Nightmare on Elm Street inspired him to go on a three day killing rampage in the south of England that left four people dead. He said he hoped to be like the film's character Freddy Krueger. And in 2010, Andrew Conley, 17, from Indiana told police he identified with the lead character in Dexter, a TV series about a forensic expert who moonlights as a serial killer. He was charged with killing his 10-year-old brother. The films in the Batman franchise are similarly gory; in The Dark Knight, audiences watch as a man's face is filleted by a knife and a bomb is sewn into another man's stomach, before it explodes. Despite numerous brutal and gruesome scenes, children were allowed to view the film if they attended with their parents.","Warner Bros. said to be cutting scenes with guns from Dark Knight trailer .

However, Yuri Kuklachev has drawn criticism over his theatre from U.S. animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. A PETA spokesman told MailOnline it was worried about cats ‘forced to carry out uncomfortable and unnatural tricks, such as performing with burning torches and dragging a doll's pram’. He claimed: ‘Mindful members of the audience quickly realise that the cats' performances are driven by fear and enforcement and are neither voluntary nor enjoyable for the animals.’ The theatre went to Germany, and 'after examining the show, PETA Germany urged authorities to ban the performance and encouraged prospective audience members not to buy tickets', he said.

"A man who plotted to kill his ex-girlfriend and make it look like she was mauled by a bear tried to hire someone to kill her in a staged car crash. Clyde Gardner originally planned to kill a bear, skin it and wear the pelt while using its claws to kill the woman as she took out her rubbish. The 57-year-old junkyard owner’s plan included him wearing the bear's paws on his feet so no human footprints would be left behind. Jailed: Clyde Gardner, 57, originally planned to kill a bear, skin it and wear the pelt while using its claws to kill his ex-girlfriend as she took out her rubbish . Gardner had carefully watched his ex-girlfriend's movements, hiding in the woods with binoculars to learn her routines, prosecutors said. It began after she kicked him out of the house they shared in Malone, New York, near the Canadian border. But he abandoned his first plan. He then gave a friend a picture of the woman, her vehicle registration number and $500 toward a $15,000 bounty to kill her in a car crash. Gardner was an experienced demolition derby driver and advised the man how to make it look like an accident. Locator map: The planned attacks began after Gardner's ex-girlfriend kicked him out of the house they shared in Malone, New York, near the Canadian border . Gardner told him if the crash didn't kill the woman, he should take a piece of broken glass and slit her throat, Elizabeth Crawford, prosecuting, said. The acquaintance went to police, who sent him back wearing a hidden recorder to get Gardner on tape talking about the grisly plan. Gardner said at sentencing he was drunk and was going to call off the hit once he sobered up and realised what he had set in motion. He and the woman had been together about five years and had a child, but it was an abusive and violent relationship, prosecutors said. Spying: Gardner had carefully watched his ex-girlfriend's movements, hiding in the woods with binoculars to learn her routines, prosecutors said (file picture) The woman repeatedly broke up with him and kicked him out last autumn. The case was scheduled for trial in July but Gardner took a plea deal. Peter Dumas, defending, has not yet commented on the outcome.

"A woman who claimed a taxi driver sexually assaulted her at knifepoint in his cab has been jailed after he used a recording application on his smartphone to expose her lies. Astria Berwick, 27, slashed herself in the face with a knife in an effort to convince police that she had been attacked and groped by Mohammed Asif. The driver was arrested within three hours and taken to a police station in handcuffs. 'Outrageous behaviour': After travelling home from a night out in Mohammed Asif's taxi, Astria Berwick called police and falsely accused the father-of-two of sexually assaulting her in the cab . 'Wholly innocent': Mr Asif, 34, was able to prove his innocence thanks to an app on his mobile phone which captured an audio recording of Berwick's cab journey . He was stripped and spent a day in a . cell until officers  eventually listened to the recording and . discovered  Berwick was lying. Yesterday, as she started a 16-month . jail term for perverting the course of justice, Mr Asif, 34, said that . without the app he would now be the one in jail. The father of two said: ‘Nothing like . this has ever happened to me before, and I have never been involved with . the police. Now I am terrified if I pick a single lady up. ‘I think her sentence was too short. She could have completely ruined my life. She should have got three or . four years at the very least.’ Mr Asif used his Samsung Galaxy S2’s . voice recorder  to tape Berwick’s 11-mile  journey from Nottingham  to . her home in Bingham  after his base told him she appeared to be drunk . when making the 4.50pm booking in February. He said that while the journey went . smoothly, apart from when  he had to pull over in a lay-by to allow her . to vomit, Berwick argued about the £17 fare when he picked her up, which . he believes may be why  she made the allegation against him. After the journey, she thanked him twice. He started out to return to base, but was stopped by police. Officers told Mr Asif that Berwick . claimed he pounced on her from behind when she vomited by the side of . the road before cutting her with a knife. The taxi driver, who lives in Carlton Hills, Nottingham, was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. He said: ‘They took everything from . me, including  my clothes, and I was crying in the cell. I told them . there was a recording on my phone – I was saying “please check it”.’ Lies: Mr Asif, who told how he broke down in a police cell after he was falsely accused of sexual assault, said Berwick's lies had torn his life apart . ‘The woman only wanted  to pay £11 and had to go to  a cash machine to get more money. She wasn’t very happy. ‘I don’t record all my journeys, but the office told me she had been drinking and that I should ask for payment up front. ‘So I put my phone on the dashboard cradle and left it on. If I hadn’t, I would be in jail now, I am certain of that. ‘My son is 14 and my daughter is eight. They were crying when I came back and were asking why I had been arrested. ‘The police raided my house and searched my taxi looking for the knife which she says I used to cut her with. ‘She really has turned my life upside down.’ Berwick was jailed at Nottingham Crown . Court after she admitted perverting the course of justice. Judge . Michael Stokes QC said  she had pretended to be  the victim of sexual . assault for ‘some unaccountable reason’. He told her: ‘This was outrageous . behaviour by the defendant against a wholly innocent man who was saved . by the recording on his phone. ‘Had he not recorded the conversation . which demonstrated that nothing untoward had occurred, he would probably . still be in custody awaiting trial.’ On her Facebook page, Berwick says she . is ‘honest as I don’t like lying (that’s probably my downfall, too . honest)’ and ‘enjoys a good joke (sometimes at other people’s expense)’. She lists her favourite quotations as ‘do unto others as they would do unto you’, and ‘what comes around goes around’.","Astria Berwick, 27, falsely accused Mohammed Asif of attacking her in taxi .

"It was a fitting occasion for the 4th of July. A statue of Ronald Reagan was unveiled at the American Embassy in London yesterday to mark the centenary of the former U.S. president's birth. Foreign Secretary William Hague and former U.S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice watched as the 10ft bronze figure was revealed in Grosvenor Square. Sadly Mr Reagan's great political ally and . friend, former prime minister Baroness Thatcher, was unable to attend . due to her frailty. Fellow Americans: The Ronald Reagan statue unveiling ceremony in Grosvenor Square outside the American Embassy . Mr Hague paid tribute to the late president at the ceremony outside the U.S. embassy, hailing him 'a great American hero'. Speaking of Baroness Thatcher's absence, he added: 'She has asked me to say these words to you: ""Ronald Reagan was a great president and a great man - a true leader for our times. Through his strength and his conviction, he brought millions of people to freedom as the Iron Curtain finally came down.""' The statue of Mr Reagan was commissioned as part of a year of celebrations. It will stand alongside statues of other American presidents such as Franklin D Roosevelt and Dwight D Eisenhower, another Republican who served two terms. It is the sixth of a U.S. president in Central London. The others are George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy. Although the embassy is moving from . its central London home next year, the statues will remain at their . current Grosvenor Square location. Reagan revealed: Condoleezza Rice and William Hague, right, at the American Embassy . Miss Rice, who was representing the late president's widow Nancy Reagan, gave the keynote speech at a gala dinner for 700 people at The Guildhall later in the day. The statue was commissioned by the Reagan Memorial Fund Trust. Mr Reagan died in 2004 at the age of 93, having served as president between 1981 and 1989. The unveiling of the statue - which cost $1million - is part of a year-long series of events to mark the . centenary of Reagan's birth, organised by the Ronald Reagan Presidential . Foundation. In the weeks prior to the London unveiling, statues have been . unveiled and conferences convened in Krakow, Budapest and Prague.

True blues: A line-up of politicians in the sunshine at the American Embassy. Left to right, Alan Duncan, Iain Duncan Smith, Liam Fox and George Osborne . Friends: Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were notable political allies and great friends. Sadly she was too frail to attend the ceremony in Grosvenor Square . Ronald Wilson Reagan, born February 6, 1911, was the 40th president of the United States serving two terms, 1981–1989. He was the 33rd Governor of California, from 1967 to 1975, a job later taken by another actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He grew up in Illinois, and was educated at Eureka College where he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology. Upon graduation, Reagan first moved to Iowa to work as a radio broadcaster. His speciality was creating vivid accounts of football games. He began a career as an actor, first in films and later television, appearing in over 50 movies and leading to his adoption as the 'face' of Chesterfield cigarettes . Some of his most notable roles are in the American Football saga Knute Rockne: All American, which gave him the lifelong nickname 'The Gipper' from the character he played and also Kings Row, in which he uttered the . lines after his character's legs were amputated: 'Where's the . rest of me?'. Reagan served as president of the Screen . Actors Guild, and later spokesman for General Electric. Originally a member of the Democratic Party, he switched to the Republican Party in 1962. John Heubusch, executive director of the foundation, says the events are part . of fulfilling the mission 'to preserve and promote the president's legacy'. Westminster City Council made an exception to its usual rule refusing . permission for statues until ten years have passed since the subject's . death. Steve Summers, . chairman of Westminster City Council's planning applications sub-committee, said: 'Regardless of politics, nobody can dispute that . President Reagan was a true ally of this country.' As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed 'Reaganomics', advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government spending. In his first term, he survived an assassination attempt, took a hard line against trade unions, and ordered military actions in Grenada. He was re-elected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming it was 'Morning in America'. His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the Cold War, the 1986 bombing of Libya, and the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an 'evil empire', he  presided over a massive military build-up that the USSR bankrupted itself trying to keep up with. His negotiations with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev culminated in the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan left office in 1989 as the Berlin Wall came down and the Cold War ended, a seeming vindication of his policies. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier in the year . He died ten years later at the age of 93, on June 5, 2004. He ranks highly in public opinion polls of U.S. presidents, and is a conservative icon.

"Police on a quest to find the Holy Grail raided a rural pub where they believed it was illegally stashed only to find an informant  got it mixed up with an old salad bowl from the kitchen. The team of 12 officers and a sniffer dog shut down the Crown in Lea, Herefordshire, because they believed staff were hiding the priceless Nanteos Cup - stolen from a country house nearby. The wooden chalice is believed to be the vessel Christ drank from at the Last Supper and later used to collect his blood at crucifixion, giving it special healing powers. Quest to find the Holy Grail: The Nanteos Cup, left, believed to be from the Last Supper, was stolen last month. The case led police to a rural pub where 12 officers raided it but only found a salad bowl, right . Relic: The Nanteos Cup (pictured) is believed to have healing powers and is believed to be the Holy Grail used by Christ . The hunt for the Grail consumed King Arthur and his knights and even Indiana Jones. But West Mercia Police were forced to join the search for the priceless medieval artefact after it was the only item stolen in a raid at a remote country house in Herefordshire last month. Weeks after its disappearance police received 'intelligence' it was in the Crown pub, but all they found was wooden bowl used to serve salad to customers. Landlady Di Franklyn said: 'I was amazed to see so many police - they said they had been given information that this Holy Grail had been shown off by someone here. 'But if somebody had stolen something as priceless as the Holy Grail I don't think it would be on show in my pub. 'But the police were taking the information very seriously because there were so many of them including a police dog handler.' Crime scene: A dozen officers said they 'received intelligence' the Grail was seen here at the Crown in Lea, Herefordshire and believed staff may have been hiding it after its theft . Court order: Police went to magistrates to get a search warrant and said simply they believed the pub housed the Nanteos Cup . Legend has it that the cup has healing powers and was named after the vessel that Jesus drank out of during the Last Supper. Quest: Harrison Ford searched for the Grail in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . Staff at the  were not allowed to leave the premises during the search and a policeman stood guard during the early morning raid. Mrs Franklin, 54, said: 'I have been shown a picture of the missing cup - if it had been here we would have thrown it on the fire because it is not whole any more. 'The only thing here that looks like it is an old salad bowl.' The cup is said to have been brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea, the founder of a religious settlement in Glastonbury during the mediaeval period. The grail then came into the possession of a group of Somerset monks who later fled with the cup to Strata Florida Abbey, near Tregaron in in Ceredigion. For centuries the historic cup was kept at Nanteos Mansion in the village of at Rhydfelin near Aberystwyth. But it was stolen while being cared for by Fiona Mirylees, from Weston-under-Penyard, Herefordshire, whose family once owned the mansion in Wales. Police said the cup went missing after it had been loaned to a seriously-ill woman because of its healing powers. When the fragile dark wooden cup was stolen, sometime between Monday July 7 and Monday July 14 - the remaining pieces were not taken. West Mercia Police officers said the raid was carried out after they 'received intelligence' that the stolen cup had been seen in the pub. A spokesman said: 'We were told it was still there and so executed a search warrant to try and find it.' Holy moment: The Grail has been hunted for centuries as it was used by Christ on the eve of his death at the Last Supper, shown her in Leonardo da Vinci's painting . It is considered the most holy artefact in the Christian world. The search for the mythical religious artefact, known widely as the Holy Grail, has been hunted for since Jesus' death and even formed the plot for the Hollywood movie Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. According to legend, the grail may either have been the drinking vessel used at the Last Supper, or used following the crucifixion to gather Christ’s blood. But many believe it then made it was brought to Britain. Some believe it came to Glastonbury in the hands of  Joseph of Arimathea, when he founded an abbey there in the first century. Others say Joseph’s brother-in-law, Hebron, the ‘Fisher King’ of Arthurian legend, took the chalice to his son, Alain, in Britain. From there, the grail myth divides again. While some believe it was taken to Nova Scotia in the 1300s, others believe the Knights Templar became custodians of the grail. The Nanteos Cup was owned by the Powell family, who lived on the Nanteos estate, outside Aberystwyth, in the 19th century. It was kept behind glass at their Palladian mansion on the estate but in 1870 the vessel was exhibited at St David’s College, Lampeter, at a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society. By then, it already had a reputation for healing. The cup was said to have been given to a Major Mirylees, who took it to Herefordshire, after the last of the Powells died in the 1950s. Despite the Nanteos Cup’s long association with the legend of the Holy Grail, experts have repeatedly concluded that it is a 14th century example of a domestic vessel known as a mazer bowl made of wych elm, not the olive wood expected of a Middle Eastern artefact.","The Nanteos Cup - believed to be Christ's cup - was stolen a month ago .

"Saving fuel on flights is a weighty issue for airlines with rising oil prices eating into their profits. In a somewhat controversial move, . Ryanair spokesperson Stephen McNamara said Ryanair staff had been asked to consider their own body weight in a bid to reduce aircraft weight and avoid hefty industry costs. The budget airline has also announced it is to reduce the size of its in-flight magazine, serve less ice in drinks and encourage its staff not to pile on the pounds. Inspiration: Ryanair claims it encourages staff not to pile on the pounds with the lure of appearing in its annual calendar . Cut price airline: Ryanair announced it is to reduce the size of its in-flight magazine, left and serve less ice in drinks, right,  in a bid to makes savings . 'We cut costs wherever possible, and the changes will represent a significant reduction in weight,' Mr McNamara told the Daily Telegraph. 'We also considered removing armrests, but decided against it. We even encourage staff to watch their weight – with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar.' Ryanair revolution?: How the vertical airline seats might look - they were refused by an unnamed regulator in February this year . The latest policy will see the airline's in-flight magazine 'Let's Go with Ryanair' being reduced from an A4 to an A5 format and it will also double as a menu, which could save thousands of pounds in fuel thanks to the reduced amount of paper used. The low-cost carrier also estimates it will save more than £400,000 in printing costs. Other measures implemented include cutting the amount of ice taken on board a flight, and reducing the weight of trolleys and seats. In the past Ryanair has floated many controversial cost-saving ideas. One of them was to remove conventional seating and offering air passengers just standing room. Instead of being allocated a seat, Ryanair travellers would perch on a narrow shelf and lean against a flat padded backboard. A Boeing 737-800 would be fitted out with 15 rows of seats and 10 rows of standing berths and passengers would be restrained with a strap stretching over their shoulder, the budget airline said. Michael . O'Leary, the budget airline's chief executive, said the refitted . airplane would resemble a classic London Underground train with its . distinctive ball-and-strap fittings. The Ryanair boss said seated passengers . would be charged £25 per ticket and standing customers would pay between . £1 and £5 for their fares - it would boost the average . capacity of a flight from 189 passengers to 230. But in February, Ryanair announced that an unnamed regulator had halted its plan, by refusing an application for test flights. Every penny counts: In the past, Ryanair has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull, in bunks as well as calling for flights to have only one pilot instead of the usual two . Ideas: Irish budget airline Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary posing for photographers with a model airplane - his cost saving ideas frequently attract both publicity and attention . Mr O'Leary said he was undeterred by the refusal and declared 'I think ultimately it would happen.' The airline also faced an outcry in 2009 over plans to charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet, in a bid to limit loo facilities on the aircraft and . replace them with extra seats. The plans to ‘charge a pound to spend a penny’ have now been dropped, Mr O’Leary said last year. Ryanair . has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull, in bunks and . has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two. But it's not just Ryanair that is slimming down its aircraft as much as possible. Other . airlines have replaced glasswear in the first class cabins with . plastic, reduced the weight of metal cutlery and some have removed seat . phones, magazine racks and even rubbish bins. American . Airlines went one step further in the 1980s, when then-chief executive . Robert Crandall claimed he had saved the airline $40,000 by taking out . one olive from every salad served in first class. More recently, in 2009, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways, started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions. Ryanair . says that while it is trying to save on fuel, it will not pass on fuel . surcharges to customers as happens with other airlines such as BA and . Virgin Atlantic. 'Fuel . is an integral part of the fare – you can’t fly passengers anywhere . without it,' said Mr McNamara. 'We would rather make cost reductions and . charge passengers for other services.'","Ryanair spokesperson Stephen McNamara claimed that every little helped in reducing the weight of aircraft, including a svelte staff ."

More than 600 protesters, carrying banners and posters, marched across New Delhi to a central plaza near the Indian Parliament to hold a protest meeting. The Tibetan protest came as Chinese president Hu Jintao prepared to visit New Delhi for a summit meeting . Some carried posters saying 'Tibet is burning' and 'Tibet is not part of China'. Mr Hu was due to arrive today for a summit with India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa. Indian police have surrounded Tibetan enclaves in New Delhi and made hundreds of arrests. At the protest venue on Monday a big poster featuring Mr Hu's face with a bloody palm print on it said: 'Hu Jin Tao is unwelcome' at the summit. As speakers addressed the crowd, the protester set himself ablaze and ran across the venue. After witnessing the man set himself on fire, one onlooker, Tenzin Dorjee, said: 'This is what China faces unless they give freedom to Tibet.' At least 30 people in Tibet have set themselves on fire over the past year in protest at Chinese rule over their homeland. The Dalai Lama has blamed China's 'ruthless policy' for the self-immolations. China accuses the Dalai Lama of stirring up trouble. China says Tibet has always been part of its territory. Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries.","Protester ran 50m before collapsing in flames outside Indian Parliament .

"An iron tooth implant fitted 2,300 years ago could be earliest false tooth ever found in Western Europe. The dental implant was discovered in the timber burial chamber of an Iron Age woman who died in her twenties in Le Chene, northern France. Archaeologists believe the false tooth was added to improve the appearance of the corpse as the procedure would have been too painful to endure while alive. An iron tooth implant fitted 2,300 years ago could be earliest false tooth ever found in Western Europe. The dental implant (shown here second from the right) was discovered in the timber burial chamber of an Iron Age woman who died in her twenties in Le Chene, northern France . The implant came in the form of an iron pin found in place of an upper incisor tooth, from which a false tooth would have been attached. ‘The skeleton was very badly preserved,’ Guillaume Seguin, who excavated the young woman's skeleton in 2009, told the BBC. ‘But the teeth were in an anatomical position, with the molars, pre-molars, canines and incisors. Then there was this piece of metal. My first reaction was: what is this?’ The woman was buried in a well-furnished chamber, dating to the third century BC, near the graves of three other women. The implant, outlined in red, came in the form of an iron pin found in place of an incisor tooth, from which a false tooth would have been attached. This photo shows the teeth in position during excavation. The iron pin is visible on the left . The latest burials contained bronze jewellery, belt ornaments, coral and amber necklace and an iron currency bar showing features of the Celtic La Tene culture. This is a European Iron Age culture named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Neuenburgersee in Switzerland. The culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from 450 BCE to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BCE. It was famous for advanced forms of metalwork, including ornate jewellery and other decorative works. These are characterised by elegant curved forms and  geometric patterning. The burials contained bronze jewellery, belt ornaments, coral and amber necklace and an iron currency bar showing features of the Celtic La Tene culture. Celtic La Tene culture, which flourished across Central and Western Europe at the time, was famous for advanced forms of metalwork, including creating jewellery and other decorative works. Scientists believe the iron spike was pounded into the pulp canal of nerves and blood vessels to make sure it stayed in place. The procedure would have been excruciating had the lady been alive when it was performed. Iron corrodes inside the body, and one theory is that the lack of sterile conditions may have led to an infection that ended the young lady’s life. The grave was one of four female burials in an enclosure dating to the third century BC that were discovered dt in the Champagne-Ardenne region of Le Chene, northern France . Another possible scenario is that the dental implant was fitted after her death for aesthetic reasons. In the journal Antiquity, Mr Seguin, along with co-authors from the University of Bordeaux, wrote that the burials ‘convey the image of a social elite concerned about their appearance’. They also note that the date of the burials coincides with a period when the Celtic Gauls were in contact with the Etruscan civilisation of northern Italy, who were known for their dental mastery. The implant is 400 years older than one from another grave in France, found in the 1990s at Essonne. The young man in this grave lost all his top left molars and archaeologists believe the iron implant was probably added to help him chew. Five thousand-year-old prosthetic teeth used to improve the appearance of the dead have also been found in Egypt and the Near East.","Implant came in the form of an iron pin found in place of an upper incisor .

"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted British society has been shaped by migrant communities, but unveiled tougher action against illegal immigration . Nick Clegg today dramatically admitted he was wrong to offer an amnesty to illegal immigrants. The Lib Dem leader used his first . speech on immigration since the general election in 2010 to ditch his . party’s policy of allowing foreigners to ‘earn’ British citizenship by . living in the UK for a decade without being caught by the authorities. He said the policy, included in his . party’s last manifesto, risked undermining public confidence in the . entire immigration system. The Deputy Prime Minister instead . unveiled new plans to force foreigners arriving in Britain from ‘high . risk countries’ to pay a bond of more than £1,000 which will only be . repaid when they leave. But his attempt to reposition the Lib Dems as taking a tougher line on immigration was at odds with warnings last night from his Cabinet colleague Vince Cable. The Business Secretary claimed attempts to slash net immigration were 'unattainable' and risked causing 'enormous damage' to the economy. David Cameron is due to set out the Conservative approach to immigration on Monday, after Labour leader Ed Miliband admitted his party made mistakes when it was in government. Today Mr Clegg used a speech in central London to set out his vision of a ‘tolerant Britain, zero-tolerant of abuse’. He insisted that if immigrant workers . suddenly ‘downed tools, countless businesses and services would suffer’ and the NHS ‘would fall over’ - but warned borders were ‘grossly . mismanaged’ under Labour. Mr Clegg argued that cash penalties . for unscrupulous employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants because . they are cheaper must be increased. Currently, the maximum fine is . £10,000 per illegal worker. And he revealed he has asked the Home . Office to work up a ‘system of security bonds’ worth more than £1,000 . for people from ‘high risk’ countries, which could be piloted by the UK . Borders Agency (UKBA) as early as the end of the year. He told the CentreForum think tank: . ‘In certain cases, when a visa applicant is coming from a high risk . country in addition to satisfying the normal criteria UKBA would be able . to request a deposit – a kind of cash guarantee. ‘Once the visitor leaves Britain, the bond will be repaid.’ Scroll down for video . Mr Clegg said the Lib Dem policy of an amnesty risked undermining public confidence in the immigration system . He said the system would ‘need to be . well-targeted’ and he did not want to ‘penalise legitimate visa . applicants who will struggle to get hold of the money’. But the Deputy Prime Minister . dramatically ditched the Liberal Democrats’ long-held  but controversial . policy to offer an amnesty to illegal immigrants. He said: ‘At the last election we . suggested that any illegal immigrant who had been here for 10 years . should be able to earn their citizenship. ‘We called it an earned route to citizenship. Our opponents dubbed it an “amnesty”. British people needed to know that immigration rules are 'reasonable, just, and properly enforced, Mr Clegg told the CentreForum think tank . ‘We felt it was an honest and . pragmatic solution given the chaos in the Home Office and the obvious . failure by Labour to identify where thousands of illegal immigrants . were. ‘Better surely, we asked, to get them . to pay their taxes and make a proper contribution to our society, than . to continue to live in the shadows? ‘But, despite the policy’s aims, it was seen by many people as a reward for those who have broken the law. ‘And so it risked undermining public . confidence in the immigration system - the very public confidence that . is essential to a tolerant and open Britain. ‘That is why I am no longer convinced this specific policy should be retained in our manifesto for the next General Election.’ The speech comes as the Government . toughens its stance on immigration with a range of new measures aimed at . bringing down net migration to the tens of thousands. UKBA . officials will conduct interviews with more than 100,000 student visa . applicants from 'high-risk' countries outside the EU to crack down on . bogus students. And a . ;genuine entrepreneur' test has been introduced to tackle the rising . number of foreign nationals attempting to enter Britain by fudging their . bank accounts. But in the . wake of criticism from politicians and the higher education sector, some . immigration rules were recently loosened in a bid to give additional . flexibility to businesses and allow top international students to pursue . careers in Britain. Mr . Clegg said the immigration must 'command public confidence'. He added: . 'For a diverse society like ours to function successfully, for different . groups to integrate and co-exist, British citizens must believe that . the rules by which migrants come and settle here are reasonable, just, . and properly enforced. Prime Minister David Cameron also floated the idea of immigration bonds and Theresa May plans to announce a pilot scheme targeted at 'high risk' individuals . The . Daily Mail revealed in March that Home Secretary Theresa May was . planning immigration bonds as the next stage of reform, having succeeded . in cutting net migration to its lowest level for a decade. The . cash would only be repaid when people leave the country and demonstrate . that they have not drawn on particular services, such as non-urgent NHS . care or elements of the welfare state. Business Secretary Vince Cable warned attempts to reduce net migration were 'unattainable' Mrs . May plans to announce a pilot scheme targeted at ‘high risk’ individuals from ‘two or three nationalities’ starting later this year. They or family members already in the UK would be required to put up a . sum running into thousands of pounds as security that they will abide by . the rules. The 1999 Immigration & Asylum Act allows the UK to require a financial security from temporary migrants, which can be forfeited if they fail to leave the UK after the expiry of their visa. Prime Minister David Cameron also floated the idea of immigration bonds last year. One Tory source said Mr Clegg appeared to be ‘purloining Conservative ideas’ in an attempt to shift perceptions of his party’s position on a key issue. In another blow, Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable gave an interview pouring scorn on the Conservative aim of reducing net immigration from the hundreds to the tens of thousands. ‘It isn’t Government policy, it is Conservative policy. And it’s also not true because that policy purely relates to non-EU people. We have obviously no control over the European Union and that is actually where much of the movement comes,’ Mr Cable told The House magazine. ‘The reducing to under 100,000 is not Government policy and it would be unattainable without, if it was attainable enormous damage would be done, notably through overseas students, which is one of the biggest components.’ The Business Secretary said attempts to tighten the visa system had created the impression, particularly in India, that ‘Britain is closed’. Mr Clegg praised the diversity of the country's population and says that Britain is made up of rich and varied backgrounds . ‘We want overseas students, they are . good for us, they are not bad for us. They bring in lots of money. 'We . want to have lots of visitors from all over the world coming here . without hassle, an easy flexible visa system and we have lots of highly . specialised people in engineers, top managers who we need in our . companies and they’ve got to be able to come and go freely otherwise we . are not going to be able to compete internationally,’ Mr Cable added. ‘So I do have to keep banging the drum for that.’ Mr Clegg insisted that the Lib Dems ‘will never seek to outflank our opponents’ on immigration ‘because we think that’s what people want to hear’. ‘That kind of low populism patronises the British people. And it is an insult to the many migrants who have contributed to our country,’ he said. ‘British society has been shaped by migrant communities in ways more profound than any cliché about chicken tikka masala, or Notting Hill Carnival, or Polish builders can ever express. 'I’m the son of a Dutch mother - she, herself, raised in Indonesia; a half-Russian father; husband to a Spanish wife. Like millions of Brits, if you trace our blood lines back through the generations, you end up travelling around the globe.’ But he savaged Labour for leaving an immigration system in ‘disarray’. ‘I cannot stress enough just how chaotic it was. The first thing they did, after coming into office, was stop checking if people were leaving the country. They got rid of exit checks. They weren’t counting people in and they weren’t counting people out either,’ the Deputy Prime Minister added. ‘Since we came into government, net migration has fallen by a third. We’ve capped immigration from outside Europe. And within the EU, we have kept the transitional limits on Romania and Bulgaria, until the point where every member state has to remove them.' A Home Office source said: ‘We look forward to support for all our immigration policies and getting down to the tens of thousands.’","Deputy PM abandons giving UK citizenship to anyone here for 10 years .

"Abdullah Bakar, 48 from Croydon who died in a freak car accident while his Vauxhall Zafira was being towed by the AA . A minicab boss was killed in a freak accident when a car being towed by the AA broke free and collided with an oncoming vehicle. Abdullah Bakar called the emergency breakdown service when his minivan’s clutch stopped working while he was on his way to work. Unable to fix the Vauxhall Zafira by the side of the road, the AA patrolman began to tow the vehicle using a fixed rigid bar. This meant Mr Bakar, a father of seven, had to sit in the van and steer. Witnesses say the car suddenly veered to one side as it was travelling down a straight section of road. It hit a bank of earth on the verge and became detached from the AA vehicle before crashing head-on into a car driving the other way. Mr Bakar, 48, was taken by ambulance to hospital following the collision in Croydon, South London, but was pronounced dead at St George’s Hospital in Tooting. Police are investigating exactly what caused the minivan to break away from the AA vehicle. Mr Bakar came to Britain after fleeing war-torn Somalia in the early 1990s. He worked as a minicab driver and part-owned a firm that specialised in taking passengers to airports around London. Accident scene: The driver of the black Vauxhall Zafira died after it broke free from the AA van which was towing it in a freak accident in Croydon, south London . Staff at his company said he had taken more driving roles recently while he studied for ‘the Knowledge’ test of London streets so he could become a licensed black cab driver. Business colleague Usman Patel, 45, who runs Easy Cars in Battersea, South London, said Mr Bakar was a ‘wonderful family man’. ‘It is a very difficult time for us here as he was a very well-loved and respected man. 'We don’t even know what has happened as he was a very cautious driver and seems to have been towed at the time. Wreckage: The driver of the Vauxhall Zafira suffered a heart attack at the wheel and was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital . ‘It’s very upsetting as I think he has seven children and I’ve met his oldest boy who is 18. He was a wonderful family man who loved his children very much.’ A post-mortem examination held yesterday gave the cause of death as a head injury. A man travelling in the second car was taken to hospital before being released. Probe: Police cordoned off the road in south Croydon, London, while an investigation got underway following the crash on Tuesday morning . Naz Dagnell, who heard the crash just after 9am on Tuesday, said: ‘It was like a big thunder crash. Then I heard the sirens going up the road and saw the air ambulance. 'It’s really sad to hear of something like this happening so close to your doorstep.’ Mr Bakar’s family, who live in Croydon, were too upset to speak last night. A Met Police spokesman said: ‘It appears the victim was in a black Vauxhall Zafira which was being towed by a recovery vehicle on a rigid bar. Accident: The driver was being towed when his car broke free and crashed into a second vehicle . 'The car being towed then appeared to swerve before colliding with a bank at the side of the road and breaking free from the towing vehicle. ‘A second vehicle was subsequently in collision with the Vauxhall.’ An AA spokesman said: ‘Following the tragic incident involving an AA member, our thoughts are with the families and friends of those involved. 'The incident is under investigation so we are unable to comment further.’","Vauxhall Zafira driver's car was hit by oncoming vehicle in Croydon .

"Children's perplexed reactions to a Sony Walkman have been caught on camera, with the majority frustrated at operating clunky buttons over a touch screen. Los Angeles-based filmmakers Benny and Rafi Fine asked volunteers aged six to 13 to guess what the bulky device was, with suggestions including a 'walkie-talkie' or 'boombox'. 'What is this?' one nine-year-old girl quizzed as she investigated the Eighties-era cassette player, while another exclaimed 'I'm not going to give up, I'm a survivor,' as she determinedly tried to figure out how it worked. Scroll down for video . A walkie talkie? The perplexed reactions from today's youth as they see Sony Walkman for the first time have been captured in a new YouTube video . After being told that it is used for playing music, a YouTube video shows each child being handed a cassette tape. 'I never seen this.' nine-year-old Kacey exclaims, while Krischelle, also nine, says 'oooo' in intrigue. The next problem they encounter is how to insert the plastic audio case. Some give up after spending several minutes prodding an poking the Walkman but others successfully discover that the front opens up. Baffled: Los Angeles-based filmmakers Benny and Rafi Fine asked volunteers aged six to 13 to try and figure out how the bulky device worked . Historical artifact: Along with the Walkman, many of the children had never seen a cassette tape either . 'I feel like I'm Indiana Jones or something,' 12-year-old Elle rejoices as she solves the mystery. After the children have inserted the cassettes they are then confused why they can't hear any music. 'Ah this is a rip-off because . you want to listen but you can't because you don't have any headphones,' seven-year-old Evan says. So they can listen to their mix tapes, the young volunteers are given vintage headphones with foam pad ear covers. 'Ah my grandpa has these,' Jayka, 11, notes. Does it bite? This little girl eyes up the Walkman suspiciously - some suggested it was a 'walkie-talkie' Looking for clues: Some give up after spending several minutes prodding an poking the Walkman but others successfully discover that the front opens up . Still learning! Poor Maxim didn't figure out how to use the volume scroll before plugging in his foam pad earphones - like most of his peers he was confused by the number of different buttons on the device . Finally all of the children are seen smiling after getting the Walkman to work. Asked if they prefer the technology of today for music or the past, the majority say that they would opt for their iPhone or iPads any day. 'I feel so lazy saying this but you actually have to do stuff,' Elle says. Others are dismayed by the fact you can only play one tape at a time and also about the device's hefty size. The Sony Walkman, when it was first introduced in 1979, weighed 14oz compared to an iPhone 5 which weighs about 4oz. End of an era: Sony produced the cassette tape-playing Walkman until 2010 and now there are dozens of more high-tech products in the Walkman family . However, Maxim, aged seven, says the Walkman might have some cost and time-saving benefits. 'It actually . wouldn't take so long because on the iPad you have to go into the . internet find Pandora, you have to click that thing, you have to make it . play . . . and the iPad is $700. To date the YouTube film has been watched almost three million times since it was uploaded on April 13. Many older viewers have said it's 'depressing' how old the children's reactions make them feel.

"Active leader: CEO Kevin Clearly revealed the practices . Like a lot of companies plugging health foods and fitness supplements, Clif Bar projects a rugged, wholesome, pro-fitness image. But, it emerged, the California-based company takes its healthy message so seriously it even pays its employees to work out. Staff members are allowed two and a half hours of company time every week - or a half-hour a day - to hit the on-site gym. The facility is complete with personal trainers, daily classes, 'nutritional counselors' - and a boulder-climbing wall. Workers are also encouraged to switch off completely after working hours - and won't get a response from their CEO via phone or email if it's after 6.30pm. The push for a balanced, active lifestyle is being led by chief executive Kevin Cleary, who revealed some of his company's  practices in an interview with ABC News. He said: 'We have a great gym... We encourage everyone to get out and exercise.' 'There's a lot of times I'll go out for a run then I'll walk back through the company and I'm going to a meeting and I'm still sweating, because I'm squeezing the workout in.' And the family man - who lives with his wife and three sons near Clif Bar's HQ in Emeryville, California -  also said he leads by example in being out of contact after hours. He said: 'I don't send out emails at night. I don't send them out on the weekend. I may do work, but I won't send out an email. Earning their paycheck: Clif Bar employees get two-and-a-half hours a week to hit the gym on company time . Wholesome: The California-based company offers other healthy incentives for its workforce . 'I don't want to set the expectation that people should be working at 7 or 8 at night. I get home at 6:30. I put the phone in my home office. I leave it there, then I'm just dedicated to my kids' The company, which is privately-held, also offers employee benefits including the chance to have every second Friday off by putting in extra hours elsewhere, subsidies for leaving the car at home, and the chance to bring their dogs into work. Employees with seven years' service are also given a paid sabbatical vacation 'for personal growth and renewal'.","CEO Kevin Cleary revealed wholesome practices in interview .

"A mentally ill woman who is 23 weeks pregnant has the right to decide for herself if she wants an abortion, a judge ruled yesterday. The 37-year-old married woman, who suffers from bipolar disorder, wanted a termination but doctors responsible for her care said she was not capable of making such a decision because of her illness. But yesterday Mr Justice Holman defied the opinions of psychiatrists and the wishes of her mother and husband and said it would be a ‘total affront’  to say she did not have the capacity to make the decision for herself. Doctors have lost their case against a woman with a 'severe mental disorder' who they wanted to stop having an abortion . The woman - who said she was not . mentally ill but had suffered a 'nervous breakdown' - told the judge . that she wanted to divorce her husband and that he was 'completely . indifferent' when told of her pregnancy. She said about two months ago she had started to think, 'I don't really want the baby'. 'I have no real support from my . husband,' she said. 'It would never work. I don't really see a future in . terms of my relationship with (him).' Mr Justice Holman said he accepted that she was 'mentally unwell' but he said the question was whether she was 'incapable of making a decision' She said medication had turned her into a 'zombie' and she was very worried about her ability to care for the child. 'I have no money. I would not be able . to work. I would be starting in a council flat on my own,' she said. 'The situation I am in, the idea of me having a baby. I think it is just . crazy.' The woman added: 'I would not regret that I got rid of it.' She said she would try to commit suicide if she was unable to terminate the pregnancy. 'I would seek to kill myself and the . baby,' she said. 'I have pretty much had enough of the whole situation. The only way they could force me to have the pregnancy is by tying me . down and locking me up.' Mr Justice Holman heard evidence from . the woman, a consultant psychiatrist involved in her care, from a lawyer . representing her husband and from her mother. The psychiatrist said he was '100 per cent certain' that the woman lacked the capacity to make a decision about termination. A lawyer representing her husband, who was at the hearing, said he agreed with the psychiatrist's evaluation. In January this year, a pregnant woman with severe learning difficulties was told she would not be forced to have an abortion after the High Court ruled she had the mental capacity to decide if she wanted the baby. Doctors applied for an order to allow them to terminate her pregnancy claiming the child was endangering her life. But the judge ruled the mother must still have the right to decide despite having a 'significant learning impairment'. The woman, who was not named for legal reasons, was described as being in the 'bottom one per cent of the UK population' in terms of cognitive ability. Mr Justice Hedley said even if the pregnant woman did not have the capacity to care for the baby, society does. Her mother also agreed with the psychiatrist and said she feared that her daughter might later regret seeking a termination. Mr Justice Holman said in most cases . in the Court of Protection, which is part of the High Court and analyses . issues involving sick and vulnerable people, the views of psychiatrists . on mental capacity issues were 'determinative'. But he said that after hearing evidence from the woman he had reached a different view in this case. The judge said he accepted that she . was 'mentally unwell' but he said the question was whether she was . 'incapable of making a decision'. 'There is no doubt she has the capacity to make a decision,' said Mr Justice Holman. 'It would be a total affront to the . autonomy of this lady to conclude that she lacks capacity to the level . required to make this decision.' He said even if some thoughts and . views on her husband were 'skewed' or 'paranoid or delusional' she had . given many other reasons for her desire to terminate the pregnancy. The judge said the woman had said she was unhappy in detention and asked him to imagine being 'unhappy and pregnant'. 'It seems to me to be a perfectly understandable position for detained pregnant mother to take,' he added. 'It has not been established that she lacks capacity to make decisions about terminating the pregnancy.'","The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is 23 weeks pregnant .

"Israeli football team Maccabi Haifa's  game against French side Lille  had to be stopped after pro-Palestinian protesters stormed the pitch. Supporters of reportedly Turkish origin ran onto the field in the Austrian stadium where the game was played and headed for the Maccabi players, sparking ugly scenes. One of the players is seen to trip a fan before punches were thrown. The Maccabi players - some of whom retaliated - managed to leave the field unhurt. Maccabi .

Brawl: Protestors and Maccabi Haifa players clash after the game is stopped . A club statement given to the Jerusalem Post added: 'This didn't happen because of sport or football, it happened because we are a team which represents Israel.' The incident comes amid fears of growing . anti-Semitism in Europe at time when Israeli forces are locked in a . violent conflict with militant group Hamas in Gaza. There . was rioting in Paris at the weekend when a synagogue and Jewish-owned . businesses were attacked during a pro-Palestinian rally. Meanwhile, murderous slogans dating back to the days of Hitler have been chanted at similar events in Germany. Hitting back: Several Maccabi Haifa players were spotted fighting back after being attacked . Tension: Pro-Palestinian supporters attacked the Maccabi Haifa players . The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said this week: ‘They pursue the Jews in the streets of Berlin… as if we were in 1938.’ During the football match fight yesterday, banners calling for the liberation of Palestine were displayed by certain sections of the crowd. Lille . said on its Twitter feed that the referee called a halt to the game . after a group of youths, waving Palestinian flags and placards, ran onto . the pitch with just three minutes of the game . left. After a series of brief scuffles, the protestors were led away by security officers with the French side 2-0 ahead at the time. Making their point: Supporters were seen with banners demanding the freedom of Palestine . Apprehended: A security guard manages to pull down one of the protestors . Allon Sinai, a sports journalist for the Jerusalem Post, wrote: 'Punches and profanities were exchanged between the handful of youngsters, who waved Palestinian and Turkish flags throughout the match, and the Haifa players, who were mainly stunned by the scenes. 'The security stewards on hand were slow to react, but ultimately the situation calmed down, with several of the protesters being escorted out of the stadium and the Haifa players leaving the pitch unscathed.' Israel is currently engaged in hostilities with Hamas, a militant group that runs the Gaza Strip. Last month UEFA announced that Israeli clubs could not host European matches due to the 'unrest' in Israel. Germany condemns rise in anti-Semitism as three men jailed in France for rioting after pro-Palestinian protest descended into attack on synagogue and Jewish-owned businesses . Germany has condemned the anti-Semitic chants and threats heard at some of the protests against Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza, saying such behaviour will not be tolerated. As three men were jailed in France for rioting after a synagogue and Jewish-owned businesses were attacked during a pro-Palestinian rally in a Paris suburb, the German government has reassured Jewish people living in the country that they should feel safe. Georg Streiter, spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, told a news conference today: 'The chancellor and the government are happy to see the revival of Jewish life in Germany and will continue to campaign for the security of Jewish citizens.' Rioters face riot police, following a pro-Palestinian demonstration, in Sarcelles, north of Paris, on Sunday . The German media has expressed shock at the tenor of anti-Israel chants at some of the demonstrations. German anti-racist laws forbid incitement to racial hatred such as anti-Semitic slogans. The threats made at the protests were an 'attack on freedom and tolerance, and an attempt to destroy Germany's democracy', Streiter said. A French court meanwhile has jailed three men, aged 21 and 28, for between six and ten months after a pro-Palestinian rally descended into violence in Sarcelles, a northern suburb of Paris, at the weekend, the BBC has reported. The court also handed a fourth man a suspended sentence, while a minor was fined. Escalating violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has prompted a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism in Europe in the last few days. Murderous slogans dating back to the days of Hitler have been chanted at pro-Palestinian rallies in Germany. The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said: ‘They pursue the Jews in the streets of Berlin… as if we were in 1938.’ Participants of a pro-Gaza demonstration hold a poster depicting Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Berlin authorities announced yesterday they've banned  protesters from chanting anti-Semitic slogan . Jewish groups expressed disgust over the tide of anti-Semitic incidents and warned of ‘a new level of hatred and violence in all of Europe’. Foreign ministers from Germany, France and Italy yesterday issued a joint statement condemning the rise in anti-Semitic protests and violence and vowed to combat hostility against Jewish people. In Germany, there have been reports of protesters chanting ‘Jews to the gas chambers’. Police in Berlin have banned race-hate slogans that reappeared after being originally used in the days of the Nazis. Officers had to protect an Israeli tourist at the weekend after protesters spotted his yarmulke (a small, round cap) and reportedly charged towards him shouting ‘Jew! We’ll get you.’ Fourteen people were arrested in the western city of Essen on suspicion of planning an attack on a synagogue. The imam of a Berlin mosque was under investigation after allegedly calling on Muslims to murder ‘Zionist Jews’. In Paris, hundreds of protesters have attacked synagogues and set fire to shops in the suburb of Sarcelles, nicknamed Little Jerusalem. Posters urged anti-Israel demonstrators to join ‘a raid on the Jewish district’, saying: ‘Come equipped with hammers, fire extinguishers and batons.’ Witnesses said several hundred youths marched on a synagogue chanting ‘Death to Jews’ and were beaten back by riot police using tear gas. The protesters then targeted a shopping centre, a kosher grocery and a Jewish-owned chemist. Police said 19 people were arrested after the violence on Sunday. Eight synagogues in France were said to have been targeted in the last week. In the Netherlands, the home of the Dutch chief rabbi was attacked twice in one week. Authorities see a heightened risk for Israeli buildings and interests in Germany and are providing appropriate security, a spokesman for the interior ministry said. French youths defying a ban on a protest against Israel's Gaza offensive went on a rampage in a Paris suburb . The president of Germany's central council of Jews, Dieter Graumann, thanked German leaders for their support. But he added: 'Many in our community are feeling very insecure, anxious and completely shocked at the horrid anti-Jewish slogans, some of which have been chanted by large, wild crowds, calling for Jews to be ""gassed"", ""burned"" or ""slaughtered"".' French prime minister Manuel Valls condemned the violence in Paris as ‘intolerable’ and warned that France faced ‘a new form of anti-Semitism’. Roger Cukierman, of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said Jewish people were living in fear. He said: ‘They are not shouting “Death to the Israelis” on the streets of Paris. They are screaming “Death to the Jews”.’ Since the outbreak of violence between Israel and Hamas, participants at anti-Israel demonstrations across Germany have frequently used anti-Semitic slogans and also called for Jewish people to be gassed . French President Francois Hollande met . Jewish and Muslim leaders in the Elysee Palace on Monday and told them . that fighting anti-Semitism will be a ‘national cause’. France has around half a million Jewish residents, the biggest population in Europe, and around five million Muslims. The Jewish population of Germany has increased in the past two decades to around 250,000, most of them migrants from the former Soviet Union who came after German reunification. Israeli troops battled Hamas militants today near a southern Gaza Strip town as the top U.S. diplomat reported progress in efforts to broker a truce in a war that has so far killed at least 684 Palestinians and 31 Israelis. But neither side appeared close to backing down, after Palestinian rocket fire led several international airlines to cancel flights to Tel Aviv and Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters near the Gaza town of Khan Younis, forcing dozens of families to flee.","Protestors reportedly of Turkish origin attacked Maccabi players .

"George Osborne's budget has led experts to question the definition of bread . George Osborne's budget has left the taxman scratching his head after it prompted HM Revenue and Customs to launch a public consultation to discover the exact definition of bread. Last week the chancellor announced VAT of 20 per cent will be extended to all hot takeaway foods such as pasties and pies which are ‘above the ambient air temperature at the time they are provided to the customer’. However, as bread is considered a basic food, it is not subject to VAT whether it is warmed in the oven or served cold. But bakers have pointed out there is no exact definition of bread. For example, is a croissant considered a type of bread? Or a hot-cross bun? To find out, the government has launched a consultation which has even left retail experts puzzled. According to the consultation document: 'For a number of years, the borderline between hot takeaway food (standard-rated) and cold takeaway food (zero-rated) has been the subject of litigation, with some retailers arguing that the purpose of heating their food products is to improve their appearance or to comply with health and safety regulations, rather than to enable them to be consumed hot. 'So, although many retailers and takeaway outlets charge VAT on the sale of hot chicken products, hot pies and toasted sandwiches, some retailers and bakery chains sell similar products zero-rated.' Use your loaf: Bread is deemed a basic food and therefore not subject to VAT . Bakeries including Subway and Ainsleys . of Leeds have in the past appealed against charges on hot food because . they believe the products were not necessarily designed to be eaten hot. High street baker Greggs has already threatened to take legal action if HMRC tries to label its food as 'hot' and subject to VAT. A spokesman told the magazine, British Baker: 'We do not believe that our freshly baked savoury products should be subject to VAT and we will be making strong representation to the Government regarding the proposed changes.' But Mr Osborne said the extension was among a number that were necessary to end anomalies. Confusion: Should croissants, scones and hot-cross buns be subject to VAT? His decision will raise an extra £125million this year and £350million a year by 2016. But it means 18p will be added to the price of a 90p hot sausage roll and 30p to a £1.49 pasty. Greggs reported profits of more than £50million in both 2010 and 2011. The results were due in part to a rapid expansion that has seen the bakery chain increase its number of stores. It now boasts nearly 1,500 outlets in the UK – more than McDonalds. In 2009, a study found that annual sales of pies nationwide had reached £941million.","Confusion over which 'hot' foods will be liable for VAT .

"Dressed in tanned springbok skins peppered with elaborately embroidered 'owl eyes', the women of the Ju/'hoansi San tribe might not look tough but with their lives spent in the Kalahari Desert, one of the most inhospitable locations on Earth, that's precisely what they are. 'The San are thought to have lived in the area for more than 23,000 years,' explains photographer Eric Lafforgue who captured these incredible images during a visit to Namibia's Otjozondjupa region where many of the tribe still live. 'Most of them live by hunting in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy [around Otjozondjupa capital Tsumkwe or Tjumǃkui in the local language], which is supposed to be controlled although the San have special permission,' he continues. Colourful: The women of the San tribe make their colourful beads from ostrich egg shells and make extra money by selling them to tourists . Tougher than Bear Grylls! Most members of the San tribe, this woman among them, live on the fringes of the inhospitable Kalahari Desert . Useful: A woman carries a bi! bulb, which offer a useful source of drinkable, if extremely bitter, water - extremely handy during desert hunting expeditions . Colourful: San people adore their brightly coloured beads, some of which are made from polished ostrich shell, and sell them to tourists to make extra money . Nomads: The San remain semi-nomadic but once wandered through all of southern Africa before other people moving in from the north pushed them into the Kalahari . Family life: The majority of San people who have stuck to their traditional lifestyle live in villages of five or six families and share everything . 'They use traditional methods such as a bow and arrow tipped with the poisonous sap of the euphorbia plant. The arrow only needs to nick the animal's skin for the poison to enter the bloodstream and the hunters track it until the animal collapses from the poison.' So expert are the hunting skills of the San, men from the tribe were sought after by successive governments and co-opted into the army as trackers; most notoriously by South Africa's apartheid regime who used them to hunt down SWAPO rebels. 'They have a lot of superstitions about hunting,' adds Lafforgue. 'They say that if you walk face-first into a spider's web while hunting, you'll have bad luck, and if a man is a lazy hunter, he'll become a source of shame to the entire clan.' Although the men are no longer forced into the army, their hunting skills still prove valuable in the hostile Kalahari desert, as does the tribe's incredible knowledge of plants. Foraging is mostly done by the female half of the population, many of whom are expert gatherers and collect everything from ostrich eggs to plants, roots and insects. Elaborate: Much of the bead making work is done by older women who don't have the energy to forage and they make extra money from it by selling jewels to tourists . Tough: The Kalahari Desert covers 350,000sq miles of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa and experiences temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius during the day . Arid: The Kalahari is a semi-arid savannah and as a result, supports more plant and animal life than true deserts like the Namib in south-western Namibia . Camp: Women sit outside the grass and reed homes they inhabit when they're on their N!ore or family lands which many use as a retreat . Clever: San people know more than 300 different species of plants, many of which have medicinal purposes, whether treating rheumatism or combating hunger . Deadly: San hunters kill springboks, giraffes and other animals using poison tipped arrows and were once in high demand as army trackers . Tasty: A man cuts into an Oryx Cucumber, which the San call Tc’a. It's one of 100 species of edible plants included in Ju/'hoansi San's diet . Lucrative: A man shows off a sprig of hoodia; a plant traditionally used to stave off hunger pangs by the San and now marketed as a diet supplement in the West . Survival skills: A man holding a bi! bulb which contains drinkable, if very bitter water (left) and another man sat in front of a fire created without using matches . Eric travelled with guides from Exotic Travel and Safaris, which offers a 12-day tour that includes a visit to meet the San people plus accommodation, meals and transfers, with packages starting at £1,874 per person. For more information, see exotictravelsafaris.com . South African Airways offers return flights to Windhoek from London Heathrow via Johannesburg from £1,010. See flysaa.com for more. For further information on Namibia, please visit namibiatourism.com.na . For more of Eric's work both in Namibia and elsewhere, see ericlafforgue.com. One of the most helpful is a tuber called the bi! [milk] bulb, which soaks up rainfall and once dug up, emits streams of drinkable - if bitter- water when crushed. Even more valuable, both for survival and financially, is the hoodia plant which the San have long used as an appetite suppressant during long desert marches but is now being marketed as a weight loss supplement in the West. So effective is the substance, the Namibian government has had to pass a bill to prevent unscrupulous people from exploiting the San's knowledge of plants like hoodia, and another, devil's claw, which they use to treat rheumatism. In total, the Ju/'hoansi San use around 300 different plants, with 100 of those forming a regular part of the diet. 'The San menu is mostly antelope, small animals, fruit such as the Marula, nuts, berries, roots and Tsama melons,' adds Lafforgue. 'The children in particular love game meat. One little boy I met told me that his favourite food was giraffe!' While many of the San do continue to live traditional lifestyles, others have found jobs on farms and in tourism, and use their family's N!ore, or home patch of land, as a weekend retreat. Others choose to live in the style of their ancestors - even indulging in the traditional courtship ritual that can prove to be, quite literally, a pain in the bottom for the women of the tribe. 'If you want to reveal your love for a San woman, you take a little bow and shoot a tiny arrow into her bottom,' reveals Lafforgue. 'If the girl isn't interested, she’ll slap you. If she is, you have to ask her parents or grandparents for permission to marry her. Divorce doesn't exist in San culture.' And, as Lafforgue points out, neither does a passion for material things. 'You’ll never hear a San boasting about his exploits - people are part of an egalitarian society, so they never boast,' he explains. 'There's also a lack of emphasis on prestige or wealth in San culture - something unusual in Africa.' That's . how you do it! A San man squeezes the water from a bu! bulb during a . hunt out in the wilds of the forbidding Kalahari desert . Medicinal: . A hunter tucks into a piece of the Terminalia sericea plant which comes . in handy when you have a cold - the plant is either eaten or wrapped . around the head . Ouch! One of the men demonstrates how to use a tiny bow and arrow, which San men use to shoot women they've taken a shine to. If she slaps him, he's out of luck . Friendly: . Materialism doesn't exist in San culture and you'll never hear them . boasting or coveting lots of things as society is extremely egalitarian . Schoolgirl: . Many people have moved to towns such as Tsumkwe (Tjumǃkui in the local . language) so they can send their sons and daughters to school . Not . a fan of ice cream! When asked what his favourite food was by . photographer Eric Lafforgue, this young man replied that it was giraffe . Work: . Many San have swapped traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyles for work . as labourers on local farms, although many use their family lands as a . weekend retreat . Women's . work: While much of the hunting is done by men, women are in charge of . gathering edible roots, plants and insects as well as medicinal ones . Baffling: Counting beyond 10 is a mystery for most San, who don't have a translation for numbers beyond that and have to think hard about it if you ask . Thought to be more than 2,000 years old, the clicking sounds used by the San people might sound as if they've been chosen completely random to those unfamiliar with them but are actually four distinct sounds, each of which has a different meaning. Written, the main ones are /, =, !, and # plus another known as 'the Kiss' because it sounds similar. Bafflingly for those attempting to learn the language, the tribe as a whole speaks 20 different variants, each with clicks, but all different enough to be incomprehensible to speakers of a different dialect. The San's clicking language has also had an impact on the languages of other southern African tribes, among them the !Nama of Namibia and the !Xhosa of South Africa, both of which deploy clicks. Despite the complexity of their language, the San approach to numbers is simple in the extreme. 'San don't count beyond 10,' says Lafforgue. 'If you ask them how they say 26 or 52, they need to think about it.' Sadly, as Lafforgue explains, the language is in danger as San children who go to school, a step seen as hugely important by San parents, aren't taught in their mother tongue. 'Education is very important in San culture as unemployment is very high in the community,' explains Lafforgue. 'In primary school, San kids don't learn the San language as the teachers are Ovambo people.' Traditional: San live in small villages of around five or six shelters, each created using reeds, grasses and plants taken from the Kalahari . Convivial: A group of San sit around their fire at the end of a long day labouring on local farms or hunting in the Kalahari desert . Adorable: A youngster peeps out from within a Springbok skin wrap - the wraps are tied securely around the mother's neck and back . Care: Old people are taken care of by other members of their family and by members of the wider tribe who give them part of anything they gather or trap . Retreat: Although many San have moved into town to work, lots return to their family N!ore come weekends for a spot of rest and relaxation .","The San people live in Namibia and Botswana and are thought to have been around for more than 23,000 years .

"Sacred hairdo: The sine crenes hairstyle symbolised chastity and was worn by brides on their wedding day as well as the Vestal Virgins . The hairstyle of Ancient Rome's Vestal Virgins has been recreated on a modern head for the first time. A U.S. hairdresser has painstakingly 'reverse engineered' the 'do - thought to be Rome's oldest - and shown how it may have been carried out. The Vestal Virgins were the priestesses of Vesta, goddess of the hearth, and their sacred duty was to guard the fire in her temple, which was linked to the prosperity of Rome. Chosen before puberty and bound by a . vow of celibacy, their braided hairstyle, known as the sini crenes, was a . symbol of their chastity. Janet . Stephens, a Baltimore-based hairdresser and amateur archaeologist, has . unravelled the secrets of the Vestals' braids and recreated it for the . first time on a modern head. She . reported her findings last Friday at the annual meeting of the . Archaeological Institute of America in Seattle and published a YouTube . video detailing showing how it was replicated. 'In . ancient Rome's Temple of Vesta six virgins guarded a sacred flame,' she . said. 'During their 30 years service to the goddess, the vestal virgins . were constrained by strict vows of chastity. 'In . exchange, they enjoyed enormous prestige and legal privilege which was . denied to other Roman women. Their guardianship of Vesta's sacred flame . was believed to ensure the continued existence of the Roman state and . its people. 'Both brides and the Vestal Virgins wore an ancient hairstyle called the sine crenes which the Romans associated with chastity.' Since . her first inspiration after an 'accidental encounter' with an ancient . bust in a Baltimore museum, Ms Stephens has devoted the past seven years . to a detailed study of Roman hairdressing. In that time she has shown how many ancient hairstyles were achieved. But . the sine crenes presented her with particular challenges since the . Vestal Virgins are almost always presented wearing layered headdresses . which covered much of their braids. However, . hailed as it was by contemporary sources as the oldest hairstyle among . the ancient Romans, studying it gave her the opportunity to . recreate what is perhaps the oldest recorded hair fashion. Full regalia: Hairdresser and archaeologist Janet Stephens's attemps to recreate the sine crenes were complicated by the layered headdresses worn by the Vestal Virgins, like the one shown here . How to: Ms Stephens reported her findings last Friday at the annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in Seattle and published a YouTube video detailing showing how the sine crenes was replicated . Elaborate: Ms Stephens was able to complete . the full sine crenes in 35 to 40 minutes working alone with only Roman-style . tools. But she believes that several slaves working together could have . had it done in 10 minutes . Rome's Vestal Virgins, a group of six hand-picked women, held unparalleled positions of status as some of the city's most senior religious leaders. They had rank and a level of self-government denied to normal women and as priestesses of Vesta they were responsible for maintaining the soul of Rome. But their power and status came at a cost. Chosen from nobly born families at a young age, Vestal Virgins had to commit to maintaining their virginity for the duration of their posts - at least 30 years. When the girls, some as young as six, . were sent by their families to become Vestals they became brides of the . city itself. With Rome as their guardian, any sexual relationship with a . citizen was considered an act of incest which amounted to treason, a . crime punishable by death. Vesta was a powerful goddess of fire. Romans believed that as long as Vesta's sacred flame was kept burning then the city and its civilization would endure. It was the duty of the six priestesses to tend this fire on a daily basis. If it faltered it was seen as a bad omen for Rome and its associated military campaigns. Allowing the sacred fire to die out would lead to the Vestal responsible being taken to a darkened room by the Pontifex Maximus (chief priest) where she would be stripped and beaten. The College of the Vestals was . regarded as fundamental to the continuance and security of the Roman . state, and their hairstyle represented the vow of chastity they gave at . their ordination. The . religious significance of Vesta's sacred flame made her priestesses a . powerful and influential force in the Roman state, and they were . included in nearly all major dedications and ceremonies. The . College of the Vestals was disbanded and the sacred fire extinguished . in 394, by order of the Christian emperor Theodosius I. Such . was the power of their myth, the theologian Augustine felt compelled to . write The City of God in response to rumours the downfall of Rome was . due to disrespect shown to the old gods who had protected the city for . 1,000 years. Ms Stephens had just one bust . available for study which showed the braids in enough detail to 'reverse . engineer' the hairstyle enough to work out how it was done. Using . that bust, Ms Stephens tracked the braids back to the part of the head . where each must have originated. 'It's like weaving,' she told LiveScience. 'Every weaving pattern shows its marks.' The . virgins' hair was first separated into six sections and braided into . separate braids, including two that ran cornrow-style across the top of . the head above the ears. Hair . around the hairline was wrapped around a length of cord which was tied . at the nape of the neck, while any that was leftover around the face was . weaved into a seventh, final braid. The . first six braids were then brought around the back of the neck and tied . in pairs in half-square knots, with their ends wrapped up to the front . of the head and fastened to the cornrow braids. The seventh braid was finally coiled round to the back of the head and tucked beneath the knotted braids. Ms Stephens was able to complete the full hairdo in 35 to 40 minutes working alone with only Roman-style tools. But she believes that several slaves working together could have had it done in 10 minutes or less. It . takes waist-length hair to properly pull off the sine crenes, Ms . Stephens said. But her research indicated that there were workarounds . for Vestals who suffered from hair problems.","Vestal Virgins guarded the sacred flame of Rome and their hairstyle was a symbol of their chastity .

"A family of rabbits are believed to be responsible for unearthing an 8,000-year-old archaeological 'gold mine' near Land's End. A haul of Stone Age arrow heads and flint tools found in a freshly dug network of rabbit warrens less than 200 yards from the Cornish landmark has led archaeologists to plan a full excavation of the site. Although a formal dig of the 150-acre area is yet to begin, initial analysis suggests there could be a large Neolithic cemetery, Bronze Age burial mounds and an Iron Age hill fort buried there. Treasure: A family of rabbits are believed to be responsible for unearthing an 8,000-year-old archeological 'gold mine' near Land's End . Artifacts: Among the items brought to the surface by the family of rabbits were these Neolithic flint tools . Land's End has long been considered an area of historical interest as the spectacular views have led to a disproportionately large number of important people being buried there over several thousand years. Although there are a number of important archeological sites in the local area, the latest Land's End dig will almost certainly be the first prompted by a family of rabbits. The excavation of the site will be managed by a team from Wirral-based archaeologists Big Heritage. Team leader Dean Paton, 30, told the . Mirror: 'It seems important people have been buried here for thousands . of years - probably because of the stunning views. [But] it's a . million-to-one chance rabbits should make such an astounding find.' Land's End has long been considered an area of historical interest. Big Heritage now plan to spend the next two years excavating the site . Mr Paton says the rabbits dug two small burrows right next to each, dragging a number of historical artifacts to the surface as they did so. He added: 'No one knows the scale of it, but it's a gold mine. A family of rabbits has just rewritten the history books.'

"Ancient artefacts thought to be early gaming pieces will have to be reclassified after new research which claims they were actually used to wipe bottoms. The flat, disc-shaped Roman relics have been in the collection at Fishbourne Roman Palace in Chichester, West Sussex, since the Sixties. Up until now museum experts thought the items were used for early games like draughts, but an article in the British Medical Journal has now proposed that they have a very different function. 'Now they are suddenly engaging items': Dr . Robert Symmons, curator of the Fishbourne Roman Palace reserve . collection, said he thinks the new 'hilarious' explanation of the disks . will help people better relate to them . How far we've come: These are the ancient Roman . artefacts thought to be gaming chips that experts now believe were an . early equivalent to toilet paper . It is well publicised that Romans used sponges mounted on sticks and dipped in vinegar as an alternative to toilet paper. Yet the idea these ceramic discs might also have been used for such personal hygiene is a revelation. The broken pieces - known as 'pessoi', . meaning pebbles - range in size from 1in to 4in in diameter and were . excavated near to the museum in 1960. It had been thought that they were . chips used to play an ancient game, also known as 'pessoi',  but . research published last month in the BMJ drew from classical sources to . present evidence that they were also used to clean up after going to the . toilet. Noting the ancient Greek proverb . 'three stones are enough to wipe one's a***', Philippe Charlier, . assistant professor in forensic medicine at the Raymond Poincaré . University Hospital in Paris, points to archaeological excavations which . have uncovered pessoi inside the pits of Greek and Roman latrines . across the Mediterranean. In one such dig in Athens, American . archaeologists found a range of such pessoi 1.2-4in in diameter and . 0.2-0.8in thick which, Professor Charlier wrote, were 're-cut from old . broken ceramics to give smooth angles that would minimise anal trauma'. Ancient Roman householders revelled in having graffiti on their walls, especially if an election was coming up, researchers believe. Hundreds of political slogans have been found in Pompeii and the walls of the wealthiest voters offered prime advertising space for candidates. It would have been the Roman equivalent of posting a Facebook message, hiring an advertising hoarding or sticking a campaign poster in a front window. The discovery of slogans on the walls of the homes of Pompeii's riches inhabitants would have meant that homeowners gave their active approval to whoever scrawled the messages, archaeologist Eeva-Maria Viitanen said. ‘The facades of the private houses and even the streetwalks in front of them were controlled and maintained by the owner of the house, and in that respect, the idea that the wall space could be appropriated by anyone who wanted to do it seems unlikely,’ she told LiveScience. Other evidence from the classical world has been passed down to us in the form of ceramics painted with representations of figures using pessoi to clean their buttocks. According to Professor Charlier's article, the Greeks and Romans even inscribed some of their pessoi with the names of their enemies or others they didn't like. Thus everytime they went to the toilet they would literally be wiping their faecal matter on the names of hated individuals. Examples of such stones have been found by archaeologists bearing the names of such noted historical figures as Socrates, Themisthocles and Pericles, Professor Charlier reported. Museum curator Dr Rob Symmons said: 'When pottery like this is excavated it is someone's job to wash it clean. 'So, some poor and unsuspecting archaeologist has probably had the delight of scrubbing some Roman waste off of these pieces. 'It is not beyond the realms of possibility that we could still find some further signs of waste or residue. 'However, these pottery pieces have no monetary value because we are essentially talking about items once used as toilet roll. 'The pieces had always been catalogued as as broken gaming pieces but I was never particularly happy with that explanation. 'But when the article produced the theory they were used to wipe people's bums I thought it was hilarious and it just appealed to me. 'I love the idea we've had these in the museum for 50 years being largely ignored and now they are suddenly engaging items you can relate to.' Ancient: An article in the British Medical Journal by a noted French pathologist said that examples of the stones - known as 'pessoi' - had been unearthed in excavations of latrines across the classical world . Uncomfortable: Study author Philippe Charlier suggests the abrasive texture of the pessoi could have led to skin irritation, mucosal damage, or complications of external haemorrhoids . Dr Charlier's research indicates that the use of such stones would have probably been rather hard on the rear ends of the ancients, and could have caused a variety of medical issues. He suggests the abrasive texture of the pessoi could have led to skin irritation, mucosal damage, or complications of external haemorrhoids. He wrote: 'Maybe this crude and satiric description by Horace in his 8th epode (1st century BC) — “an a*** at the centre of dry and old buttocks mimicking that of a defecating cow”— refers to complications arising from such anal irritation.' 'In the Roman era it was that or very little else': Dr Symmons said the museum will now reclassify the relics . Dr Symmons, who has been at the Fishbourne Roman Palace museum for seven years, added: 'We will obviously have to think about re-classifying these objects on our catalogue.

"The earliest surviving portrait of Richard III in Leicester Cathedral. Archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in Leicester. Archaeologists today moved a step closer to finding the remains of King Richard III. They confirmed they have found the Greyfriars friary where he is believed to be buried in the most unlikely of settings - under a council car park in Leicester. They have found medieval window tracery, glazed floor . tile fragments, part of what may be the Greyfriars cloisters walk and a . section of wall. The team has so far excavated two 30-metre trenches in the Leicester City Council car park which is believed to cover the Greyfriars site where Richard was taken after meeting his end at the Battle of Bosworth. The team believe that the church is the most likely location for a monarch’s burial place – and the next step will be to dig another trench with the aim of intersecting the church itself. Richard Buckley, Co-Director of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services, said: 'Today, what we are saying is that we have found the Greyfriars and have uncovered tantalising clues as to the location of the church. 'It has gone about as well as we could hope for.' Richard Buckley of the University of Leicester with part of the medieval friary the team hopes will lead them to the body of King Richard III . 'We aim to dig a contingency trench over the weekend to see if these walls are the church. 'If this is the case we can point to the area where Richard III might have been buried.' Philippa Langley, of the Richard III society, said: 'We are in the right area. 'We have started to get a sense of where Richard’s body may have been brought. 'I did not think we would be where we are now at the start of the dig. A selection of medieval building materials found at the Greyfriars site in Leicester . 'I am totally thrilled. 'For me, the whole dig is now coming to life.' The dig is being filmed for a forthcoming Channel 4 documentary to be aired later this year. The researchers believe King Richard III was buried in a Franciscan friary in the area after being killed by the army of Henry Tudor during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. The friary was, however, knocked down during Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, and the exact location of the burial site has been one of Britain’s enduring historical mysteries ever since. Scroll down for video . The trench where part of Greyfriars, believed to be the resting place of King Richard III, was found . After closely examining ancient maps, . archaeologists believe the most likely site for the church is a car . park of a social services office in the centre of Leicester. Last week, . they began digging it up. Richard was King of England for two years, from 1483 until the Battle of Bosworth. His . death at the age of 32 marked the end of 30 years of civil war, known . as the Wars of the Roses, and the end of the middle ages. It also marked the dawn of the Tudor dynasty and the demise of the Plantagenets. His . clothes and armour were removed and his naked body carried on horseback . to Leicester, where the corpse was displayed in public for three days. He was then buried in the Franciscan friary, known as Greyfriars, but just over 50 years later the church was destroyed. Richard Buckley holding a piece of mullion from a traceried window from the later medieval period  at the archaeological site in Leicester . In a field behind Fenn Lane Farm near Leicester, the treeline marks the spot where Richard III is believed to have been killed in battle. The 69p stamp featuring Richard III . Born . in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 . until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field. According to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into battle, your head shall be broken on the return'. On the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle . He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a . hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an . image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by . Shakespeare. Legend says the body was removed and . cast into the river Soar, but historians hope to prove wrong this . disputed version of events by finding it at the council site. The archaeologists, from Leicester . University, along with members of the Richard III Historical Society, . hope finding the remains will help to change the way the monarch is . viewed historically. Richard III is traditionally seen as a tyrant who murdered his way to the throne, disfigured by a hunchback and a withered arm. Many historians, however, claim that a distorted image of the king was deliberately created by the Tudors, the most notorious example of which is Shakespeare’s play about him. The Richard III Historical Society said it hoped the excavation, which is projected to last two weeks, would end ‘the enormous disparagement’ of his reputation. The site of the friary was bought by Alderman Robert Herrick, the Mayor of Leicester, in 1612, after the church was demolished in 1538. He built a mansion there. In 1914, Leicestershire County Council bought the land, later turning it into a car park. Archaeologists will start by digging two long trenches across the car park, hoping to find remains of the church and narrow down the search. They will also use ground-penetrating radar to find the best places to dig. Richard Buckley, co-director of the Archaeology Service at the university, said: ‘It is quite a long shot but it’s a very exciting project. We don’t know precisely where the body would have been buried but we suspect it would be in the choir or near the altar.’ If bones are found they will be assessed for trauma to the skeleton. Richard was hacked down after being surrounded and one historical account suggests that the blow which finally felled him was so hard that fragments of his helmet were left in his skull. They will also be subjected to DNA analysis. The remains will be matched against the DNA of Joy Ibsen, a 16th generation descendant of Anne of York, the sister of Richard III. Mrs Ibsen died four years ago, aged 82. At the site yesterday, Mrs Ibsen’s son Michael, 55, watched as the search began. The furniture-maker, who was born in Canada but now lives in London, said his mother would have been thrilled by the project. ‘The family were entertained when she got the call several years ago from a historian claiming she was a descendant,’ he added. The Chiddingly Boar, medieval silver-gilt livery badge of Richard III, helped researchers pinpoint the location of the battle of Bosworth when is was found in east Sussex in 1999 . Archaeologist Dr Glenn Foard shows today how the badge of the boar led them to pinpoint the battlefield and where the king fell. 'This is almost certainly from a knight in Richard's retinue, who rode with him to his death on that last charge,' he said . A flag and memorial stone mark Richard's Field, just northwest of Ambion Hill . Memorial: The plaque at the place where Richard is believed to have been killed . A depiction of the carnage during the Battle of Bosworth Field by 18th century painter Philip James de Loutherbourg (1740-1812) The Battle of Bosworth Field was . fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War . Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and . Lancaster. One of the . most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard . III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best . known quotations. The leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks. The battle marked the final . confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger . Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster. The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483. Support . for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger . brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel. Following . an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, . Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485. Gathering . support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and . intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. After . Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII . and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted . until 1603.","Team say dig is 'exceeding expectations', and now plan to look for the monarch's burial site .

"The ‘Big Six’ energy suppliers were accused of abusing their power yesterday and of inventing claims about rising wholesale costs. MPs on the Commons energy select committee condemned recent price rises of around 10 per cent, which will add around £120 to annual bills. And they hit out at the big bonuses paid to executives at a time when many customers are struggling with a choice between heating and eating. Scroll down for video . Grilling: MPs quiz E.ON's Tony Cocker, William Morris from SSE, Guy Johnson from Npower and Stephen Fitzpatrick from small supplier Ovo Energy . Tony Cocker . Chief executive . Profit: £235million .

Bosses from the Big Six claimed that they . have been forced to put up their tariffs, at least partly, to reflect a . rise in the wholesale cost of energy. However, the head of a smaller energy . company told MPs yesterday that this was not true and, in fact, . wholesale prices have fallen in recent years. Stephen . Fitzpatrick, of Ovo Energy, said he could not understand the . justification for the price rises being imposed by the big suppliers . this winter. ‘I can’t explain any of these rises, other than they are not the prices we see in the liquid wholesale market,’ he said. The . Ovo chief said the wholesale price for gas peaked in the summer of 2011 . with a figure of 74p a therm to cover demand through the winter of . 2011-12. Since then the . figure for both last winter and this winter was a lower 72p per therm, . while the forward price of gas to be supplied in 2014/15 is lower still . at 69p.

The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . The head of a small rival energy firm today accused the Big Six of pushing costs as high as possible, knowing many people will never switch suppliers. Stephen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Ovo Energy, said he 'can't explain' the price rises being imposed because wholesale gas prices had fallen for his company. His firm is now buying gas at a cheaper price than it had in 2009. He said: 'It looks to me like a lot of energy companies, a significant number of the Big Six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any circumstances and then maintaining the illusion of competitive pricing with tariffs targeted towards a very small number of relatively well-engaged customers. He added: 'We buy all of our power and gas on the wholesale market. 'The most expensive price we have paid for wholesale gas in the last four years was in, I think, May 2011, that was 74p a therm. '""Since then it has been below 72p a therm for this winter, last winter and next winter. We are buying gas for next winter at a current price of 69p a therm. 'So I can't explain any of these price rises, other than they are not the prices we see in the liquid wholesale market.' He claimed that . competition in the energy market has collapsed and that it is impossible . to find out what the power giants are doing with all the money they are . making. Referring to the . other energy company executives in the room, he said: ‘You will never . find the money. These people are the best filibusterers in the business. ‘It . looks to me like a lot of energy  companies, a significant number of . the Big Six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away . with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any . circumstances.’ He told MPs . that if all the customers of the Big Six switched supplier to his . company they would have collectively saved £3.7billion in 2012. MPs . criticised the fact that most of the giant energy firms failed to send . their chief executives to give evidence. The biggest supplier, British . Gas/Centrica, as well as SSE, EDF, Npower and Scottish Power did not . send their top man. Labour . MP Ian Lavery challenged the executives who did turn up, saying: ‘A . report suggests over three million elderly people fear they will not be . able to keep themselves warm over the winter. ‘Another . says there is a potential for 24,000 people to die because of the hikes . in the energy prices from your companies. It is an absolute outrage . that this can happen in one of the richest countries in the world. ‘It is an absolute abuse, in my view, by the Big Six energy companies.’ The . managing director of British Gas, Ian Peters, came under pressure to . justify a culture of high pay and bonuses in the industry. MPs . highlighted the example of Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, . which owns British Gas.  They said his pay had risen 36 per cent since . 2008 to £2.35million. Labour . MP Albert Owen said: ‘How do you justify that? Do you think they have . earned that  money? Do you think he deserves a 36 per cent increase when . you  are putting up bills by almost 10 per cent?’ Mr . Peters said: ‘Sam Laidlaw looks after a global group. A lot of growth . in the Centrica profits, which post-tax are 5.9 per cent, has come from . expansion overseas. ‘We are very aware of this issue and it is subject to an independent remuneration committee.’ He . added: ‘We thought deeply about what to do with prices because of the . impact on household bills at a time when incomes are stressed. ‘We do more than any other  company to help those in need.’ The . energy companies told MPs outside forces were to blame for higher . prices. These included  rising wholesale prices, green taxes, eco levies . and charges to maintain and rebuild the national grid of wires and . pipes. Green: Tony Cocker (left), chief executive of E.ON, said green levies act as a 'regressive stealth tax essentially' and should be paid for from general taxation while Guy Johnson, External Affairs Director of RWE npower, also attacked the cost of the so-called climate obligation on power firms . Anger: Labour MP Ian Lavery (left) accused the Big Six firms of 'absolute abuse' by pushing up bills while Tory MP Dr Phillip Lee said that with all the firms putting up prices they were effectively acting as a 'monopoly' They argued for a . radical shake-up in the way the country pays for the switch to green . energy and to insulate the homes of the poor and vulnerable. Currently, levies of around £135 are applied to all bills. However, the industry wants the cost shifted to general taxation. Tony . Cocker of Eon, who was the one chief executive who did turn up, . described these charges as a ‘stealth poll tax’ which should be axed . from bills. He called for a full Competition Commission inquiry into the energy sector which, he believes, will clear firms of profiteering. Mr . Cocker added: ‘I fundamentally believe that this market is competitive . but I acknowledge we are not trusted and therefore I believe we need to . have a very thorough competition commission investigation.’ Soaring profits: This graph shows how energy firms have seen their profits soar as bills go up.

"Embarrassed about his country's inability to complete the promised infrastructure ahead of next month's World Cup, Brazil great Ronaldo believes the hosts will get it right on the pitch and win the tournament for a record sixth time. Brazil will stage the World Cup in June and July for the first time since 1950 and are favourites to lift the trophy at the Maracana stadium on July 13. Chaos: Ronaldo said he was embarrassed by stadium delays and transport problems in Brazil . Concern: Building work is still going on at the Beira Rio stadium in Porto Alegre . Tragedy: An accident at Sao Paulo's stadium  left two workers dead in November . Taking action: Brazil's civilian police have recently gone on strike over pay . The hosts have struggled to build stadiums on time and many of the promised infrastructure projects such as airports, bus lanes, and metro lines have been either cancelled or scaled down. Ronaldo, who as a member of the Local Organising Committee is one of the most visible backers of soccer's world governing body FIFA and the Brazilian government, said Brazil has always faced problems of 'corruption, embezzlement, overcharging' and he lamented the late delivery of stadiums, three of which are still not ready. 'In 2007 when they decided that the World Cup would be in Brazil, President Lula signed everything and agreed to everything and then they get here and there's this bureaucracy, total confusion and lateness,' Ronaldo said. 'It's a shame. I am embarrassed, this is my country and I love it and we shouldn't be transmitting this image abroad,' he added. 'But we mustn't forget that Brazil wasn't perfect before the World Cup. It was the same or worse.' The former Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan striker is betting on Brazil to win the competition, with Germany his second favourites, followed closely by Argentina and Spain. Brazil are on a rich run of form and have won 13 of their last 14 encounters, including the five games that won them the Confederations Cup last year. However, no side has ever won the World Cup a year after lifting the Confederations trophy and there is also the little matter of pressure. Local fans are desperate for a home win and yet only six players in Luiz Felipe Scolari's 23-man squad have been to a World Cup before. Horrific: Evidence of the damage at the stadium, where two workers died following the collapse . High hopes: Brazil legend Ronaldo believes the hosts can triumph in the World Cup . Shambles! The Itaquerao in Sao Paulo won't be completed before the World Cup starts (picture taken in March) Ronaldo, 37, said the players were experienced enough for the big occasion and will be well prepared by Scolari - the man who led Brazil to their last title triumph in 2002, with the help of two goals from Ronaldo in the final. The first match against Croatia on June 12 could set the tone for the tournament, he said. 'The first game in the World Cup, in Brazil, the first match for many players, it is going to be very important and it could determine the team's future,' he said. 'We see players that are 20 years old who've played with big clubs or with the national team for a year or two so I don't think the lack of experience will determine the final result. 'It could be important at some moments of the match but I don't think it will determine the result.' Ronaldo also dismissed concerns that South American teams will cope better with the tropical climes and noted that while humidity could be high in coastal and jungle cities, temperatures in some venues could drop to almost freezing in the southern hemisphere's winter. Stubborn: Brazil's civilian police want an 80 per cent pay rise ahead of the World Cup . Major blow: The stadium's roof will now only be completed after the World Cup has ended (picture taken May 8) Fever pitch: A mural of Mario Balotelli, Lionel Messi, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez in Brazil . 'In Europe they play in higher temperatures than here,' Ronaldo said. 'The games that could be controversial, for example 1 pm kick offs in Manaus, have been moved. 'I was in Manaus in the summer and at game time it could get to 35 degrees; in the winter it's 28, 29. That's a nice temperature to play in. 'In Brazil it's another controversy that makes no sense. No one is worried about the cold in Porto Alegre. Why does no one speak about that?"" 'If I could have manipulated the draw, I'd have sent the Europeans to the north and the Africans to the south,' he said with a laugh. Ronaldo went to four World Cups and took home winners medals in 1994 and 2002. While he holds the record for most goals scored in World Cups, German Miroslav Klose could surpass him if he gets two goals this year. Ronaldo joked he would spend only a little time willing Klose to fall short of his 15-goal tally, then acknowledged that if the big Lazio forward does equal or break his record then he will deserve all the plaudits that come his way. 'If he scores more goals than me then all credit to him,' Ronaldo said. 'So I am not going to be cheering against him. The record itself, it was made to be broken, someone will break it, I am under no illusions that it will remain forever.'","The hosts have struggled to build .

"Millions of people around the world are to be offered the chance of immortality on the moon. A multi-million pound scheme is hoping to fund a private lunar mission within the next decade, and for less than £64 ($100) each, members of the public will be invited to buy space on memory discs, and, for an undisclosed price, send a sample of their hair. These discs will act like time capsules for photos, videos and other files, and will be buried in a bore hole drilled into the lunar surface. Scroll down for video . A private mission plans to let people send time capsule 'discs' to the moon. It was devised by British engineer and financier David Iron. Called Lunar Mission One the crowd-funded spacecraft will fly to the lunar South Pole where there is constant sunlight (illustration shown) Four billion-year-old material extracted from the hole - which could be up to 330 feet (100 metres) deep - will then be studied for scientific purposes. The mission is called Lunar Mission One, and will involve sending a craft to the moon's South Pole - where there is constant sunlight. The vehicle will be delivered into space by a medium-lift rocket, such as SpaceX’s Falcon 9, before embarking on its journey to the moon. Once there, it will carry out a descent sequence to the lunar surface, with four engines ensuring it lands gently  within a pre-determined landing site the size of a football stadium. On the surface it will drill to depths of up to 330 feet (100 metres), collecting samples every six inches (15cm) for analysis on board the spacecraft. It’s thought that the top 33 feet (10 metres) or so of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles. Further down, though, the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago. Once on the moon the spacecraft will drill 100 metres (330 feet) down to collect samples for scientific analysis (illustrated). It will collect samples every six inches (15cm), which will be scooped up and placed in the spacecraft for scientific analysis to answer questions about the moon . Inside the hole (illustrated) will be placed archived data from the public on Earth. People can buy a space on the memory discs for £64 ($100). The team are seeking funding now and hope to launch in 2024 . Among the scientific questions hoping to be answered, Lunar Mission One wants to discover the true origins of the moon. And, at the bottom of the hole, astronauts will place the discs containing the archived data from the public back on Earth. British engineer and city financier David Iron, who came up with the plan said: 'People can put any information they like in the memory disc; it will be like a personal time capsule, a private archive. It could be a small message saying ""hi, I'm Joe"" or a whole family history. 'We have carried out research and been quite surprised how keen people are. School kids think the idea of having a bit of themselves on the moon is fantastic.' The samples of varying depths will be analysed on board the spacecraft inside special capsules (illustrated). It’s thought that the top 33 feet (10 metres) or so of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles, while further down will be rock fused by heat . He added: 'Governments are finding it increasingly difficult to fund space exploration that is solely for the advancement of human knowledge and understanding as opposed to commercial return. 'The world class team of advisers and supporters we have assembled will address this issue and crucially anyone from around the world can get involved for as little as a few pounds.' Under the scheme, there will be hundreds of discs, each one about two inches (5cm) in diameter. The company plans to send a robot lander to the South Pole of the moon - an unexplored area. They will drill to a depth of at least 66 feet (20 metres) - 10 times deeper than has been drilled before - and potentially up to 330 feet (100 metres). The hole will be two inches (5cm) in diameter, and it will take the lander one hour to drill each six inches (15cm). Core samples will taken from each six inches. It will then study lunar rock from this depth that is 4.5 billion years old, and has remain untouched underground. It’s thought the top 33 feet (10 metres) or so of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles. Further down, though, the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago. Among the scientific questions hoping to be answered, Lunar Mission One wants to discover the true origins of the moon. The spacecraft will be delivered into space by a medium-lift rocket such as SpaceX’s Falcon 9. It will carry out a staged descent sequent to the lunar surface. Four main engines will ensure it lands gently on the surface and keep it within a landing site the size of a football stadium. The spacecraft will be equipped not only with a drill, but also a jointed robotic arm to extract segments from its core, and other instruments to analyse core samples and monitor seismic activity.External solar cells will power the lander. People helping to fund the mission will be promised a small part of a disc on which to load information. An initial development phase has been launched via Kickstarter. Individuals making pledges through Kickstarter will become lifetime members of the Lunar Missions Club and given access to information and experiences related to the mission. They will also be offered the chance of seeing their name inscribed on the lunar lander that will carry the drill and memory discs to the moon. Various celebrities have endorsed the mission in a promotional video including Professor Brian Cox (pictured). ‘If we’re going to explore space, and I think we have to, then the moon is the obvious stepping stone,’ said Professor Cox. ‘It’s the easiest place to land and build a base.’ British engineer and David Iron, who came up with the plan (illustrated) said: 'We have carried out research and been quite surprised how keen people are. School kids think the idea of having a bit of themselves on the moon is fantastic' The spacecraft will be delivered into space by a medium-lift rocket such as SpaceX’s Falcon 9, pictured launching in July this year from Cape Canaveral in the US . The plan is to land on the lunar South Pole, a favoured spot for future moon bases because it receives constant sunshine. Rock drilled out of the lunar crust could be analysed in situ, using a package of scientific instruments, or left behind for human moon explorers in years to come. Mr Iron said business plan projections had shown that the global sale of memory disc space could raise enough to pay for the mission with money to spare. 'We're looking to make billions in revenue,' he said. 'It will be well in excess of the mission costs.' A commercial rocket such as the Falcon 9, from private space transport pioneers SpaceX, could be used to send the discs to the moon, confirmed Mr Iron. His team has taken advice from RAL Space, part of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Didcot, Oxfordshire, which contributed to Esa's recent comet probe, Philae. Philae hit the headlines by making a dramatic landing on a comet more than 300 million miles (480 million km) from Earth last week. Professor Richard Holdaway, director of RAL Space, said: 'Lunar Mission One is both ambitious and innovative, demonstrating an exciting way of enabling lunar exploration. Our experience in multiple and complex space missions will play a vital role in helping co-ordinate the project.'","Private mission plans to let people send time capsule 'discs' to the moon .

"Too young: 12-year-old Tamir E Rice was shot dead Saturday after police confused his airsoft gun with a real firearm . The boy who was shot dead by Cleveland, Ohio police yesterday, when they mistook his toy gun for a real firearm, has been identified as 12-year-old Tamir E Rice. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office released the victim's name Sunday afternoon, as the boy's family hired attorney Tim Kucharski to represent them in the upcoming investigation. Kucharski, of the law firm Richardson & Kucharski told WKYC: 'Apparently, listening to the 911 call...the caller halfway across the part recognized that this was a toy gun. I'm not sure how police weren't able to make that same decision.' 'We're going to conduct our own parallel investigation. I understand what police are putting out there, I cannot confirm or deny those facts. The family is absolutely is devastated. He was a wonderful young man. Our own investigation will begin as early as tomorrow.' A concerned man, who was saw the boy at a playground next to a recreation center Saturday afternoon, called 911 around 3:30pm and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy in collman1 . here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody. 'The guy keeps pulling it in and out…it’s probably fake, but he’s scaring the s*** out of people.' Minutes later, two Cleveland Police officers - a rookie and a 10-15 year veteran - arrived at the scene, where they apparently saw Tamir pick up the gun from a table and put it in his waistband. The rookie then asked the boy to put his hands up, at which point the youngster reached into his waistband and pulled out the pistol,  Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer said. Scroll down for video . Shooting: Young Tamir died after being shot by a police officer when he allegedly pulled this BB (airsoft) gun (pictured) from his waistband outside a recreation center in Cleveland . Scene: Tamir was spotted 'waving around' the airsoft gun in the playground area next to Cuddell Recreation Center (pictured) at around 3:30pm on Saturday. Above, police are pictured at the scene . Despite the 911 caller's prior warning that the gun was likely fake, the officer then fired two shots at the boy, at least one of which hit him in the stomach, according to Cleveland.com. After the shooting he was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center in serious condition, but his condition deteriorated throughout the night and he died early Sunday. Police later told Fox 8 the weapon the boy was carrying was 'an airsoft type replica gun resembling a semi-automatic pistol.' They added that the gun's orange safety indicator had been removed. Union officials claimed the officers - one of whom was later taken to hospital with an ankle injury - acted responsibly amid concerns the boy was in possession of a real gun. Distraught: One of the boy's relatives is pictured weeping on the ground after hearing of Saturday's shooting . Scene: A concerned bystander called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy in here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody.' Above, Cuddell Recreation Center . However, Deputy Chief of Field Operations Ed Tomba described the incident as 'very, very tragic', saying that the child did not threaten the officer verbally or physically. 'When an officer gives a command, we expect it to be followed,' Mr Tomba said. 'The way it looks like right now, it wasn't followed, but we're going to continue our investigation.' On Saturday evening, members of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office were at the scene. Investigators will determine if the officer was justified in shooting the boy. Response: Two Cleveland Police officers arrived at the scene following the 911 call. After the boy refused to put his hands up and reached for the gun (pictured from another perspective), one officer fired at him twice . According to the boy's mother, Samaria Rice, the family lives across the street from the recreation center, which is expected to remain cordoned off on Sunday. She told Action News 19 the first she heard of the shooting was when two  men came to her home to say her son had been shot. She added that her son did not have access to a gun at the property. Both officers involved are believed to have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with protocol in officer-involved shooting incidents. An investigation is ongoing.","Tamir E Rice, 12, 'waved around' an airsoft gun at a playground on Saturday .

"Barack Obama told his aides: ‘I just don’t know if I can do this’ after his woeful performance during the first Presidential debate last year, a new book claims. The President was being drilled by staffers to do better in the second round when he told them he wasn’t sure if he was up to the job. They were so rattled that they feared he might lose the election. The candid admission shows how just how scared Obama was - and how unprepared he had been to take on his Republican opponent Mitt Romney. Scroll down for video . Close to giving up: After Barack Obama finished the first presidential debate in October 2012 (pictured) he told aides he was not sure he could continue - leaving them fearful he would lose . It also makes clear that behind the scenes the President agreed with observers who said that he had been ‘dismal’ and seemed like he was asleep. The first Presidential debate took place on October 3 last year with Obama narrowly ahead of Romney in the polls going into it. But when the lights went down Romney was the clear winner after coming across as more punchy - whilst the President rambled and seemed nervous. Mr Obama did not even mentioning Romney’s notorious 47 per cent remark, or his past at hedge fund Bain Capital even though his campaign had been hammering it for months. According to New York magazine, in a excerpt from their new book ‘Double Down: Game Change 2012’, journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann say that at the White House aides to Mr Obama staged an ‘intervention’ to pull him back from the brink. During the process they claim the President was struck by self-doubt and said: ‘I just don’t know if I can do this’, referring to what was needed in the second debate. Defeated: Mitt Romney was deemed the winner of the first debate after Obama's lackluster performance . To solve the problem debate coach Ron . Klain was brought in and Bill Clinton, First Lady Michelle Obama and . Secretary of State John Kerry all gave him advice. In the second debate Obama was a different person and, according to ‘Double Down’, thought his performance was ‘fast and hammy’. Revealed: The new details are shared in 'Double Down', which is out next week . Previously reported extracts from the book have already painted Romney in an unflattering light. It . claims that he didn't ask Chris Christie to be his candidate for vice . president in his 2012 bid for the White House because of 'potential . landmines' in his health and background checks. The . New Jersey governor failed to fully answer questions about his health . and background and provided less information to Romney's vetters than . other potential candidates, the book says . Romney . also poked fun at Christie's size. 'Romney marveled at Christie's . girth,' according to the book. 'Watching a video of Christie without his . suit jacket on, Romney cackled to his aides ""guys! Look at that""'. Romney's search for a vice-presidential nominee was codenamed 'Project goldfish', but Christie was given the name 'Pufferfish'. In . response to the revelations, an aide to Christie said: 'Governor . Christie complied fully with the Romney campaign’s request for documents . in a timely manner, including a complete medical report from his . internist and cardiologist.' Christie, . who underwent lap band surgery in February to help him lose weight, . recently released a report from his doctor that said he 'has no medical . limitations and is fit to serve as the governor'. The book also reveals that President Obama's aides considered switching Joe Biden out for Hillary Clinton as his VP. Issues: A new book has revealed that Mitt Romney . (left) didn't ask Chris Christie (center) to be his candidate for vice . president in 2012 because of 'potential landmines' in his health and . background checks . Dropped: Romney, pictured with his wife Ann, re-considered Christie but ultimately decided to drop him . The authors explain that Christie, who is widely seen as a top candidate among Republicans for 2016, left unanswered questions about a defamation lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career - putting off Romney further. He also avoided information about a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement involving his brother, the names and documentation of his household help, details about his time as a securities industry lobbyist and on his medical history, the New York Times reported. 'The dossier on the Garden State governor’s background was littered with potential land mines,' the authors write. It led Romney to initially consider Christie before striking him off the list - then reconsider before eventually dropping him again. Some of the other concerns were over Christie's defamation cases - he has both sued and been sued for defamation. In 1994, his Morris County freeholder primary opponents sued him for claiming they were under investigation by the county prosecutor, the New Jersey Star Ledger explained. The case was settled and Christie apologized. By his side: The book also revealed that Obama's aides considering dropping Joe Biden as his VP . In 1997, Christie sued opponent John Murphy after losing his primary for re-election as a freeholder, but details of the outcome was never disclosed. In another book published earlier this year, Christie had branded the vetting forms 'intrusive', saying the Romney campaign expected him to complete 75 pages. 'Asked about stuff with your kids, and issues with your children, obviously criminal record, mental health issues drinking history, drug history,' he told Dan Balz for 'Collision 2012'. 'All intrusive stuff.' Romney also didn't like the way he showed up late to campaign events, according to the Washington Post. But there seems to have been no love lost from Christie's side either. The book claims Christie concluded Romney's campaign team was a 'gaggle of clowns who couldn't organize a one-ring circus', according to the Post. When Christie came under fire for his RNC speech, claims the book, he confronted Ron Kaufman, a Romney aide, and screamed: 'I'm tired of you people!!! Leave me the f***k alone!!!!' Another major revelation in 'Double Down' is that Obama's top aides secretly considered replacing Biden with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and carried out focus group sessions and pollings to help them decide it it were the right decision. Ruled out: But aides ultimately concluded that she would not give enough of a boost to justify the move . The consideration was pushed by the chief of staff at the time, William M. Daley, who explained that opinion of Obama in 2011 was at an all time low. ‘I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,' he said. 'You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, ""Holy Christ, what do we do?""' But the aides eventually dismissed the plan, concluding that, although Clinton was a popular candidate, it would not give a big enough boost to justify the radical move, the Times reported. The book also details Obama's opinion of Bill Clinton, saying that he found him exhausting and once told an aide: 'I like him... in doses.' But ultimately, it explains, Obama came to rely on Clinton as a counselor and immediately called him following Romney's concession call on election night.","President Obama told aides he wasn't sure he was up to the job after the first debate last year, a new book has revealed .

"Sleeping peacefully in the arms of her father, this is precious baby Maya born in jail to the woman facing execution in Sudan for marrying a Christian U.S. citizen. Our exclusive picture shows father Daniel Wani holding his daughter for the first time. Daniel's wife Meriam Ibrahim gave birth to Maya five days early in the hospital wing at Omdurman Federal Women’s Prison in North Khartoum yesterday. Proud: Father Daniel Wani, a U.S. citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire, holds Maya for the first time after being allowed to visit to his wife, Meriam Ibrahim, who was sentenced to death for marrying him, a Christian . Cruel: . Martin, above, is pictured with his father on the heartbreaking visit. His family claim he is American because . his father has been granted U.S. citizenship. He is being held with Meriam because the authorities claim he is a Muslim and will not release him into the care of a Christian . Meriam has spent the past four months shackled to the floor in a disease-ridden jail after being sentenced to death by hanging earlier this month for converting from Islam to Christianity and marrying a Christian man. Her lawyer Mohaned Mustafa Elnour said the couple are 'happy and proud' of their new arrival and that it has brought a momentary ray of light to an otherwise bleak and desperate situation. Mr Elnour: 'This is a special moment for them. Daniel is delighted that he is able to see his new daughter so soon. 'The family are taking some time to enjoy the birth before they return to fighting the injustice of Meriam's sentence.' Daniel, a 27-year-old biochemist who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, also got the chance to hold his 20-month-old son Martin, who is being held in the barbaric prison with his mother. The photo is especially poignant as Meriam will never see her beautiful daughter grow up. She is set to hang sometime in the next two years as the authorities said she will be executed when she has finished weaning Maya. And before the birth, Meriam made the defiant claim that she would rather die than give up her faith. In a heart-wrenching conversation with her husband during a rare prison visit, Meriam told him: 'If they want to execute me then they should go ahead and do it because I’m not going to change my faith.’ Loving: Meriam and Daniel married in Sudan. Daniel left New Hampshire to visit her in Sudan and arrange for his wife and son to join him in America when she was arrested . Holding out hope: Daniel Wani outside his home in Khartoum, Sudan, as he awaits the fate of his wife who has been held in shackles in prison. She has told him that she would rather die than change her faith . An . Islamic Sharia judge said she could be spared the death penalty if she . publicly renounced her faith and becomes a Muslim once more. Meriam . insists she has always been a Christian and told her husband she could . not 'pretend to be a Muslim' just to spare her life. She told him: 'I refuse to change. I am not giving up Christianity just so that I can live. 'I know I could stay alive by becoming a Muslim and I would be able to look after our family, but I need to be true to myself.’ Daniel revealed his wife’s defiant stance during an . exclusive interview with MailOnline at his modest home in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Sitting . beneath glamorous photographs of his wife taken at their wedding in . December 2011, he said: 'My wife is very, very strong. She is stronger . than me. 'When they . sentenced her to death I broke down and tears were streaming down my . eyes. Our lawyers were passing me tissues. But she stayed strong. 'She . did not flinch when she was sentenced. It was amazing to see, . particularly because she is the one facing the death penalty.’ Daniel . was in Khartoum trying to arrange for Meriam and their 20-month-old son, . Martin, to live with him in the US when his wife was arrested in . September. She was three weeks pregnant with their second child. The authorities will not release Martin into the care of his father. Bleak: The Omdurman Women's Jail in Khartoum, Sudan where Meriam Ibrahim is being held. It is overcrowded and riven with disease . Meriam has been locked up in the notorious women's prison in Khartoum since September after being charged with adultery and apostasy and given the death sentence . She . spends much of her time shackled to the floor, is not receiving much nutrition in her food and is rarely allowed outside. Both she and her bewildered son have contracted various illnesses because of the poor sanitation at the jail. A . report by Human Rights Watch claims the prison is 'beset with . overcrowding’ and suffers from 'poor sanitation, disease and the deaths . of many children living with their mothers’. Daniel, who is originally from South Sudan, but is now a naturalized American, was initially refused permission to visit her. Daniel told MailOnline: 'They say the . marriage is void. Now, even my wife is no longer my wife. And my son is . not mine and my new daughter is not mine. They say I am a stranger to . them. 'I know my wife puts . on a brave face but I can tell that she is in quite a bit of pain. She . doesn’t get to leave the room for weeks. 'She . has suffered medical complications while in jail, but no one knows the . full extent of what they are because she is in prison. It’s a difficult . time. To see her walking in chains is difficult.’ Daniel, . who is wheelchair-bound because he suffers from muscular dystrophy, . cuts a forlorn figure as he wheels himself around his empty house. His . child’s bed lies unused, as does a child-sized toothbrush. Daniel keeps . himself busy by studying the regular barrage of paperwork that his . legal team send him. Like many in Sudan, both Daniel and his wife’s childhood were blighted by civil war. Daniel managed to escape the brutal conflict in 1998 when he travelled to America with his brother Gabriel. The . biochemist returned to Sudan to marry Meriam at a Christian service in a . chapel which was attended by around 500 people in December 2011. Most who were at the wedding ceremony could vouch for the pair being committed Christians, defence lawyers say. Rotten . care: Martin is given a drink by prison guards. Daniel is desperate to be allowed to take him home and is fiercely critical of the U.S. Embassy for failing to help them and Martin in particular, who is American . But witnesses who were willing to give evidence on her behalf were barred from testifying because they were Christian. She even produced a marriage certificate identifying herself as a Christian. Despite . this, the judge determined that because her father was a Muslim, even . though he abandoned the family while they were living in a refugee camp . in the South East of Sudan when she was six, she too was a Muslim who . had broken the law by leaving Islam. But . her mother, who is now dead, brought her up as Christian. Her mother . was born in Ethiopia to Christian parents, but fled to Sudan because of . famine, and chose to raise her daughter in the same religion. Meriam was arrested in mid-September, three weeks after her second child was conceived. At . first the couple dismissed the allegations against them as trivial, but . when the case grew more serious Daniel went to the American Embassy in . Khartoum for help. 'I . thought this would be the one place which would help me, but they told . me they didn’t have time to do anything,’ Daniel said. 'I was upset . because now that I am American citizen I thought they would help me. 'I . was threatened. They said “well your wife isn’t American, so we can’t . help”. I felt disgusted. My home is in America and still they won’t . help. It’s getting uglier and it’s not going in the right direction.’ Mr Wani said the State Department asked him to provide DNA evidence proving that Martin was his biological son. He . added: 'I have provided wedding documents and the baby’s birth . certificate, but this is clearly not enough. It’s very upsetting that . they don’t believe me. 'They want me to take a DNA sample in Khartoum, then send it to the US for testing. It’s as if they don’t believe a word I say.’ The Sharia court has postponed her sentence, to give her time to recover from childbirth and to wean the new baby. Her . lawyer, Mohaned Mustafa Elnour, a Muslim, has received death threats . for defending her but has already lodged an appeal. If he does not . succeed at the Appeal Court, he will take the case to Sudan’s Supreme . Court. Fighting for justice: The legal team from the Justice centre in Sudan trying to free Meriam Ibrahim includes (l to r) Thabit Alzubain, Mohned Mustafa, Mohammed Abdalnabe, Osman Mobarek, Elshareef Ali . Mr . Elnour said the case hinges around the testimony of two men who claim . to be her brothers, and one woman who claims to be her mother. In . court they claimed that she had disappeared from the family home in a . small village in the east of Sudan and then discovered her living in . Khartoum, married to a Christian man. But . the lawyer said all three witnesses are liars whose evidence to the court has been highly contradictory. He . suggested that the trio are making up their story in an attempt to . claim ownership of Meriam’s flourishing general store in a shopping mall . on the outskirts of Khartoum. Mr . Elnour added: 'We can prove that Meriam’s mother died in 2012 and that . the two others are definite fraudsters. But the court is not interested . in our evidence.’ A petition calling for her release had last week has so far been signed by more than 661,000 people.","Meriam Ibrahim, 27, gave birth five days early yesterday .

"A never-seen-before photograph of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city Hiroshima has emerged for sale and is expected to go for $50,000 (£30,000) at auction. The black-and-white image was taken from the window of one of the U.S bombers on the historic, top-secret raid and is the only unofficial photo of the bombing known to exist. It shows the enormous mushroom cloud rising above the city moments after bomber Enola Gay dropped its catastrophic payload on August 6, 1945. Scroll down for video . Chilling: This never-before-seen photograph of the Hiroshima mushroom cloud was taken from the bomber Necessary Evil about one minute after the explosion - and is now going to be auctioned . Top secret raid: The Enola Gay dropped the Hiroshima bomb on August 6, 1945, three days before another atomic payload was dropped on Nagasaki . Historic item: Pictured left is 2nd Lt Russell Gackenbach's Agfa camera, which he smuggled on board the Necessary Evil and used to photograph the Hiroshima bomb going off, while pictured right is 2nd Lt Gackenback today . The poignnat photo was taken by Second Lieutenant Russell Gackenbach, navigator onboard Necessary Evil, one of the three B-29 planes that took part in the attack. As the three bombers banked away from the atomic blast, 2nd Lt Gackenbach took a photo of it on his own camera which he had smuggled onboard the plane. The photograph is thought to have been taken around a minute after the explosion, from 12 miles away at 30,000 feet. The bomb, nicknamed Little Boy, detonated at 1,900ft at 8.15am and instantly wiped out much of the city, killing an estimated 160,000 people in the process. Up for auction: A photograph of 2nd Lt Russell Gackenbach during the war (back row, center), and the flight  log of Brigadier General Paul W Tibbets, pilot of the Enola Gay . Despite only using 1.7 per cent of its potential force, the bomb was the most devastating ever dropped, around 2,000 times more powerful than British 22,000lb Grand Slam bomb. The grainy image of the explosion has never before been published, remaining in 2nd Lt Gackenback's posession until the 1990s when he sold it to a private collector. A three-ins by two-ins contact print of the photo is now up for sale at Bonhams alongside the Agfa Viking camera 2nd Lt Gackenback used to take the photograph. At the same auction, the flight log of the late Brigadier General Paul W Tibbets, pilot of the Enola Gay when he had the rank of Colonel, is also for sale for $100,000 (£60,000). It contains the records of every flight he undertook throughout the war, including the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Devastation: Hiroshima after the dropping of the atom bomb in August 1945 . Desolate: The bomb killed 160,000 people and left Hiroshima in ruins . Tibbets trained for several months for the mission, with the bomber named Enola Gay after his mother. The decision to unleash an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a city of military significance, was taken by U.S president Harry S Truman when the Japanese refused to surrender in July 1945. In a statement broadcast after the attack, Truman said: ‘It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe. ‘The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.’ Three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, another atomic bomb, called Fat Man, was dropped on the southern port city of Nagasaki, killing another 75,000 people. Destroyed: A fire engine in Hiroshima left twisted and burnt out by the atomic bomb . On August 15 Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan, effectively ending the Second World War. Tom Lamb, from auctioneers Bonhams, said: ‘Russ was the navigator onboard Necessary Evil, one of two planes accompanying Enola Gay on the bombing raid. ‘The plane was full of scientists and journalists who were there to study and report on the blast. Russ was not supposed to have taken his personal camera onboard but he did. ‘As his plane banked away from the blast he took the camera out and snapped this shot. At the time they were at about 30,000ft and 12 miles from the blast. ‘There were official photographs of the explosion but this is the only personal photograph that was taken. ‘Russ kept hold of the photo until the 1990s when he sold it, along with other memorabilia from the raid, to a private collector in the U.S who has had it ever since. ‘This poignant photograph has never been published. ‘It shows an iconic moment in history, of which this is the only privately taken photograph. There is nothing else like this out there.’ Also in the sale are four photos, a Mohawk watch, a bombers patch, 13 badges and uniform pins and an almost unused AAF cloth chart of the East China Sea, Japan and South China Sea previously owned by 2nd Lt Gackenback . The auction will take place in New York on June 5.","A never-seen-before photograph of the 1945 .

He proposed the Queen should be stripped of the title 'Defender of the Faith of the Church' ‘In the long run it would be better . for the Church and better for people of faith, and better for Anglicans, . if the Church and the State were to stand on their own two separate . feet,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio. His . proposal would mean the Monarch being removed as the head of the . Church, as they have been since 1534. The Queen holds the title of . Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The . Prime Minister immediately rejected his deputy’s suggestion, insisting: . ‘No I don’t want to see that, I think our arrangements work well in . this country. ‘As I’ve said . before, we’re a Christian country, we have an established church, and . being a Christian country, I find other faith leaders and members of . other faiths say that it makes us almost more understanding, more . tolerant, more understanding of the role that faith and religion plays . in our country. ‘And . actually, faith organisations do an enormous amount in terms of . supporting schools, supporting charities, helping to build what I call . the bigger society. ‘So I don’t want to see what the Deputy Prime Minister has set out, it’s a long-term liberal idea but not a Conservative one.’ The Deputy Prime Minister made his proposal despite admitting that Britain is 'infused by Christian values' The . Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday backed Mr Cameron in a row with . militant atheists over his Easter message insisting Britain should be . more ‘confident’ and ‘evangelical’ about its status as a Christian . country. The Archbishop said . it was a ‘historical fact’, whether people liked it or not, that . British society and culture - from art and music to the health service . and school system - was ‘earthed’ in Christianity. He . dismissed a warning from more than 50 public figures, organised by the . British Humanist Association, that Mr Cameron risked sowing ‘alienation . and division’ in society by championing Christian values. The . Most Rev Welby, writing on his personal blog, admitted that proof of . the importance of Christianity to the UK could not be found in . attendance numbers at church, which have continued to fall. But . he said the response to the Prime Minister’s assertion that Britain was . a Christian country had been ‘all quite baffling’ but also . ‘encouraging’, since Christianity thrived amid ‘hatred and opposition’ rather than ‘comfortable indifference’. A . group led by the British Humanist Association, and including writers . Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett and Guardian columnist Polly . Toynbee, accused Mr Cameron of causing harm by emphasising Christianity. The Prime Minister flatly rejected Nick Clegg's suggestion as Justin Welby defended the historical connection . The . Most Rev Welby insisted who signed the humanist letter were ‘wrong’ to . suggest that being proud of Britain’s ‘Christian identity’ excluded . others. ‘Judging by the . reaction, anyone would think that the people concerned had at the same . time suggested the return of the Inquisition (complete with comfy chairs . for Monty Python fans), compulsory church going and universal tithes,’ he said. Communities . Secretary Eric Pickles said he had been shocked by the backlash from . atheists to his recent ruling that councils should be allowed to hold . prayers before the start of meetings. He . said: ‘I am a Christian, but my little intervention was basically just . to say “let’s allow people to have a prayer before a council meeting”. I . would have been equally angry if people were forced to go to the . prayer. ‘All I wanted to do . was allow people, but on that basis the entire heavens have opened up - . you would have thought I was some kind of ayatollah demanding people go . to church when I was just trying to be a voice for moderation and . reasonableness.’","Nick Clegg said 'Britain infused by Christian values' but called for change .

"Many people may feel that they have spent a great deal of time on the A1 road, which connects London and Edinburgh. But the route has been in use for a staggering 10,000 years, according to newly-discovered archaeological evidence. A Mesolithic settlement, which has been compared to a modern-day service station, has been unearthed by researchers alongside the A1 near Catterick in North Yorkshire. Scroll down for video . The route, which is now the A1 between London and Edinburgh,  may have been in use for a staggering 10,000 years, newly-discovered archaeological evidence suggests. Experts have discovered ancient artefacts during the widening of the road through North Yorkshire (pictured) A Mesolithic settlement has been uncovered beside the A1 in North Yorkshire. The site is believed to have been a kind of overnight shelter used by people travelling north and south thousands of years ago. A number of flint tools dating back to between 6000 and 8000 BC were also discovered at the site. Evidence of Iron Age, Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements have been found near the Roman town of Cataractonium, near the River Swale. The team has discovered buildings on the edge of Dere Street - a Roman road running alongside the A1 - including shop frontages and even a bath house. Finds during the excavations have included a complete Roman bowl called a Mortaria used for grinding herbs and spices. Roman glass from a drinking vessel has also been found at the site of the Roman town. Approximately half a mile further south from Cataractonium, is evidence of Iron Age settlements and Iron Age cremations. This means the route predates previous estimates that claimed it was built by the Romans. The site is believed to have been a kind of overnight shelter, used by people travelling north and south thousands of years ago. A number of flint tools dating back to between 6000 and 8000 BC were also discovered at the site. Steve Sherlock, Archaeological Clark for the project, said: ‘This was a place that these people knew of - a place they could return to on many occasions, to stay sheltered overnight during their travels. ‘It is telling us there is evidence for people using the route and moving through the area over periods of time. ‘It is also adding to our knowledge of the early Mesolithic period, a time we don't know very much about and this is very interesting. A number of flint tools (pictured) dating back to between 6000 and 8000 BC were also discovered at the site, which is believed to have been a kind of overnight shelter by people travelling north and south centuries . A Mesolithic settlement (pictured), which has been compared to a modern-day service station, has been unearthed by researchers alongside the A1. Evidence of Iron Age, Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements have previously been found near the Roman town of Cataractonium, near the River Swale not far from this location . ‘We found a small structure which resembled a type of shelter where they were making the flint tools that were also present at the site.’ This rare find was uncovered during the excavation of known Roman settlements in advance of plans to upgrade the A1 to motorway status between Junctions 51 and 56. Neil Redfearn, principal inspector of ancient monuments for English Heritage in North Yorkshire, said: 'I think this is really tantalising. This discovery gives us an even greater understanding of the time depth and movement through this landscape. The discovery was made along a stretch of the A1 close to Catterick in North Yorkshire (marked). It was uncovered during excavation of known Roman settlements in advance of plans to upgrade the A1 to motorway status between Junctions 51 and 56 . ‘Can we ask questions about route ways that predate the Roman period?’ he asked. The A1 is the longest numbered road in the country and is under an almost constant state of upgrade. Archaeologists have been excavating ancient monuments between Leeming and Barton, where construction work will begin to widen the road. Finds during the excavations at Cataractonium include a complete Roman bowl called a Mortaria (pictured) which was used for grinding herbs and spices . Archaeologists were surprised to find the ancient 'service station' (pictured left) which provided shelter for travellers heading north and south 10,000 years ago.  A Saxon brooch (pictured right) was also unearthed at the site. Archaeologists are busy trying to find treasures before the widening of the A1 goes ahead . Roman glass from a drinking vessel, was also uncovered near Cataractonium. Finds preceding the glass by thousands of years were additionally discovered nearby . Dere Street, which was built by the Romans, runs alongside the modern A1 and the experts are focusing their efforts on a Roman town located by the road near to the River Swale, called Cataractonium. They have so far discovered evidence of Iron Age, Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements. Sherlock said: ‘The road scheme is 12 miles (19km) long and we are investigating a number of different sites. ‘It was fascinating to find that one of those was in fact a Mesolithic site, a further 8,000 years into the past, beyond the Romans. ‘We are still finding extremely clear evidence of how people used to live here almost 2,000 years ago during the Roman period.’ The team has discovered buildings on the edge of Dere Street, including shop frontages and even a bath house. This flint tool, which dates between 6000 and 8000 BC was also discovered at the site close to the busy A road . ‘We think this was a particularly industrial part of the town,’ he said. ‘Finds during the excavations have included a complete Roman bowl called a Mortaria used for grinding herbs and spices. Another was Roman glass from a drinking vessel, found in Cataractonium.’ Approximately half a mile )0.8km) further south from Cataractonium, is evidence of Iron Age settlements and Iron Age cremations. Redfearn added: ‘This is really interesting because we weren't quite expecting to find Iron Age material here either. ‘In pre-work, we have done quite a lot of studying at desktop level to try to understand what the level of archaeology of the landscape was actually like. ‘To find an Iron Age settlement with Iron Age activity and even cremations gives us an inkling again as to what life was like before the Roman period.’","Mesolithic settlement was unearthed near Catterick in North Yorkshire .

"Under fire: Michael Reingold, 53, a former NYPD officer and supervisor at a Bronx clinic, has been named in a federal lawsuit filed by his former staffer accusing him of raping her 18 times . A New York City social worker has filed a federal lawsuit accusing her former supervisor - a one-time police officer - of raping her 18 times inside a locked office. The 47-year-old Bronx resident, identified as Jane Doe in court papers, claims she was subjected to the unwelcome advances from her boss, 53-year-old Michael Reingold, from the day she was hired by the Highbridge Woodycrest Center in July 2012. Reingold, a retired NYPD officer, headed the center affiliated with Lebanon Hospital until last fall. According to the alleged victim’s lawsuit, Mr Reingold never missed an opportunity to remind her that he was a retired cop, and that she was required to follow his orders, or face termination. In court filings, the 47-year-old social worker stated that Reingold made passes at her, told her colleagues that the two of them were having an affair and then relocated her to a remote office, where the staffer allegedly felt 'imprisoned.' Sometime after the move, Jane Doe said Reingold walked into her new office, locked the door and forced himself on her. Afterwards, the man allegedly threatened to fire her if she said a word about what happened to anyone. ‘The office in which [Reingold] placed plaintiff became a veritable “Torture Chamber” where [he] would violate [her] in the most unspeakable ways,’ the lawsuit obtained by the New York Post alleged. 'Torture chamber': The alleged abuse took place inside the 47-year-old victim's office at the Highbridge Woodycrest Center in The Bronx . Her . predicament took a toll on the social worker, who would vomit from fear . and anxiety allegedly caused by her boss, the court papers stated. 'Bully': The plaintiff, Jane Doe, accused Reingold of forcing himself on her inside a locked office and threatening to fire her . Speaking to the Post, Jane Doe said she was living in constant fear, and that Reingold warned her he had a gun. ‘I didn’t pick up the phone and call the cops because he was one of them,’ she told the paper. The alleged sexual attacks on the woman were exacerbated by the fact that as a young girl, she  had been assaulted by six men in the subway, according to the suit. Last July, the social worker finally reported the alleged abuse to human resources director Maria Collura, who in response urged her to leave, or Reingold would hurt her. Jane Doe quit her job at the center July 8, 2013. Reingold was fired that fall after his alleged victim filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. According to his LinkedIn page, Reingold graduated from John Jay College of Criminal Justice with a master's degree in public administration in 2010 and was hired by the Highbridge Woodycrest Center in October 2011. Career change: The 53-year-old man, who has a young daughter, now works as an investigator for a hospitality company that works with the Yankees . After being fired last fall, Reingold got a job as an investigator for the company Legends Hospitality, which works with the New York Yankees.

"Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi is poised to cut short a season-long loan to Stoke City and join a club in the Middle East - paving the way for Tottenham's Aaron Lennon to move to The Britannia Stadium and for Liverpool to reignite interest in England under-21 international Nathan Redmond of Norwich City. Assaidi's £2million departure from the Premier League looks imminent with the 26-year-old Moroccan holding talks with Al-Ahli of Dubai with the blessing of both Liverpool and Stoke and is ready to undertake a medical. The forward has failed to make an impact in England after a £2.4million move from Dutch club Heerenveen to Liverpool in 2012. Oussama Assaidi is poised to cut short a season-long loan to Stoke City and join a club in the Middle East . Assaidi's imminent departure paves the way for Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon to link up with the Potters . He made just four Premier League appearances, all as substitute, under Brendan Rodgers before initially joining Stoke on loan last season, and scoring a memorable winning goal against Chelsea. But a second loan spell at The Britannia has not been as successful with Assaidi playing just 11 times for Mark Hughes and making it clear he would fancy a new challenge elsewhere. Once a deal is confirmed, and it would give Liverpool a transfer fee, it frees up squad places both at Anfield and for Stoke.Stoke boss Hughes is interested in £6million Lennon with the 27-year-old winger told that he is not part of Mauricio Pochettino's first-team plans at White Hart Lane. The Potters have also enquired about Redmond in the past but the Norwich City player is also the subject of interest from Liverpool and Southampton. Liverpool are set to reignite their interest in Norwich's £10million-rated winger Nathan Redmond . He stayed loyal to Norwich at the end of last season after relegation but The Canaries are outside the promotion places and changed managers last week with Hamilton Academicals boss Alex Neil replacing Neil Adams. Redmond, 20, is valued at £10million and is starting to consider a move to the top flight sooner rather than later so he is ready for the European under-21 championships this summer. His international team-mate Nathaniel Chalobah is poised for a loan move from Chelsea to French club Bordeaux to also gain regular top-flight experience before the finals. He returned to Stamford Bridge last week after a loan move to Burnley failed to work out.Stoke face Arsenal on Sunday without Bojan and Biram Mame Diouf, who is away on African Cup of Nations duty.","Liverpool's Oussama Assaidi is set to quit Stoke for the Middle East .

"The South Korean belief that eating dog helps beat the heat in the summer months has angered animal rights activists around the world. Known as ‘Bok-Nal’, the dog eating days, it is a ritual celebrated by South Koreans where dog meat is eaten to increase stamina during the hottest days of the year. To coincide with the tradition, animal rights activists staged protests around the world today, packing into wired cages in various locations including in front of the South Korean embassies in Seoul, London and America. Protest for dogs: These animal rights activists packed into wire cages to protest against the South Korean tradition 'Bok-Nal' where people eat dog meat to increase their stamina during the summer heat . While dog meat is consumed throughout the year, during Bok-Nal South Koreans consume more to combat the heat. Dog meat restaurants in Seoul say they served more customers than usual today. Animal rights group In Defense of Animals (IDAUSA) said dogs and cats are kept in cramped, filthy cages and slaughtered in unimaginable ways as part of the $2 billion dog and cat meat industry. A statement on their website said: 'Two and a half million South Korean dogs are electrocuted, hanged, or beaten to death each year. Don't eat: 2.5 million dogs are killed each year for consumption according to animal rights group In Defense of Animals. The protestors' signs read 'Don't eat dog meat' Dog will have his day: Activists say that dogs are slaughtered in unimaginable ways due to the prevailing myth that the greater the suffering, the more tender and tastier the meat . 'The dogs are slaughtered in . unimaginable ways: electrocuted, hanged, and even beaten to death, . because of the prevailing myth that the greater the suffering the more . tender and tastier the meat, and that the mythical health properties are . enhanced.' Thousands of cats are also eaten in soups and 'tonics'. IDAUSA said: 'Cats are often bludgeoned and thrown into boiling water while still alive.' According to Yonhap news agency, Seoul is experiencing the longest period of time with temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius since 1994.

"Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman says the Government is doing 'very little' about increasing numbers of children being exposed to online porn . Ministers were accused of betraying parents last night after they ruled out an automatic block on internet porn to  protect children. The Department for Education said ‘expert advice’ was against an automatic block, which would force those wanting access to online porn sites to contact their Internet Service Provider (ISP) to ‘opt in’. Instead, as the Daily Mail revealed last month, ISPs will simply be asked to ‘actively encourage’ parents to switch on internet filters if children are likely to be using computers in the home. Confirmation of the decision, slipped out on the DfE website without fanfare, came despite evidence from the Government’s consultation that half of parents back an automatic block on internet porn. Some 35 per cent of parents responding to the consultation backed the ‘opt-in’ system, with a further 15 per cent wanting it imposed with additional controls. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said the Government’s proposals did not go far enough. Alan Wardle, of the NSPCC, said: ‘The best option to protect children is for adult content to be automatically blocked by Internet Service Providers. ‘Given that half of the parents who took part in the Government consultation wanted this option, we are concerned their views have not been heard.’  Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman who was campaigning for an automatic block, said: ‘The Government’s response to the consultation is weak. Shocking: Helen Porter, from Newbury, Berkshire, told delegates that she knew of a Year 9 pupil who had been 'persuaded' to take part in an amateur porn video . ‘They have set no deadline for change and still appear to be putting the interests of internet companies before the safety of children.’ The Daily Mail revealed last month that David Cameron preferred an industry-led solution to the problem of online porn, with ISPs told to help parents impose internet filters if they want them. In its response yesterday, the DfE said parents have ‘just as much responsibility for keeping their children safe when they are online as when they are offline’. The Government’s consultation was flooded with hundreds of responses from the Open Rights Group which campaigns against internet restrictions. The internet industry also mounted a concerted campaign against automatic restrictions on the lucrative online porn sector.","Ministers claim experts advised against an automatic block forcing internet users to contact their Internet Service Providers to access porn .

"Hundreds of policemen and other emergency workers joined an impromptu motorcade to honor a fallen K-9 dog who was shot dead protecting his human partner. The 2-year-old German Shepherd named 'Mick' had only just joined the Portland Police force when he was fatally injured in the early hours of Wednesday while responding to a burglary alarm. The K-9 duo were chasing a suspect when 40-year-old Officer Jeff Dorn told Mick to 'Take that suspect!' and both were shot. Scroll down for video . Sacrifice: Portland police dog Mick was killed early Wednesday in a shootout while protecting his human partner, Officer Jeff Dorn, both pictured above . Paying their respects: Hundreds of police men, firemen and other canine units gathered Wednesday to escort Mick's body form the scene of the crime to a veterinary hospital . 'Mick saved my life,' Officer Dorn said yesterday as he recovered from two gunshot wounds in the legs. He has since been released from the hospital. Officer Dorn, a 16-year veteran of the force, joined the K-9 division in 2006 and Mick was his second police dog. The two had just finished 400 hours of training to pass the Oregon Police Canine Association Certification on March 5. Around 2am Wednesday morning, Officer Dorn and his dog responded to a burglary call at Blumenthal Uniforms & Equipment. When they arrived at the store, they found three suspects sitting in a nearby SUV and the suspects quickly tore off starting a chase. One of the suspects in the shooting, 20-year-old Steven Young (pictured), was booked for burglary charges. The other two suspects, including 20-year-old Paul Ropp who is suspected of shooting Mick, were expected to be booked sometime Thursday after a stay in the hospital . The chase ended when the SUV crashed into a pole and one of the suspects, 20-year-old Paul Ropp, got out of the vehicle and started running. Officer Dorn, another officer, and Mick took after Ropp into a nearby neighborhood and that's when the gunfight insued. Officer Dorn was hit twice in the legs, and Mick took a direct hit to the body. Mick was not wearing a canine ballistic vest at the time. Police created a perimeter around the neighborhood and later arrested Ropp as well as the two other suspects: 25-year-old Jamaell Riley and 20-year-old Steven Young. They also located an AR-15 assault rifle nearby, which they believe Ropp used to shoot Officer Dorn and his dog. Officer Dorn was taken to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries and released Thursday. Mick disappeared after the shooting and was later found dead underneath a nearby bush. Hundreds of firemen, police officers, and other canine units came together Wednesday to bring Mick's body from the scene of the shooting to a veterinarian's office. Russ Hall and his canine companion were one of the many who turned out to honor Mick. 'You become emotionally attached to them,' Officer Hall told ABC News. 'They're loving animals, they're good dogs, you get a bond with them.' Chase: Officer Dorn and Mick got into a shootout with Ropp after the suspect's SUV crashed into a pole and Ropp fled the scene on foot . Ropp, the suspect who allegedly shot Mick, was taken to the hospital for a head injury after the shootout and was exepcted to be booked in Multnomah County Jail sometime Thursday. He was also joined by suspect Riley, while Young was immediately booked for first-degree burglary. All three are expected to be arraigned on Friday. Good boy: Mick's trainer Leslie Hamblin remembers him as a 'great dog' who 'loved to give smooches' Ropp had most recently been living in the Beaverton area, his father Alan Ropp told the Oregonian. 'We're very sad all this has happened,' Mr Ropp said from his home in The Dalles. Ropp had attended Portlad State University through spring break, but had not signed up for the spring term, a school spokesman said. He was majoring in international studies. According to a necropsy, Mick died from a single gunshot would. He would have turned 2 years old in September. Mick started his short life as 'Dusty vom Langgarten' in Germany before he was imported by Colorado-based Tac-Dogs. At Tac-Dogs, Mick learned how to track suspects, search for evidence, protect his handlers and apprehend suspects. Tac-Dogs trainer Leslie Hamblin remembers Mick as a 'great dog' who 'loved to give smooches'. When he was chosen to join the Portland police force, Dusty went to live with Officer Dorn and his family, who decided to change the dogs name to 'Mickey' and 'Mick' for short while working. Before his death, Mick had taken down five suspects, including anther burglardy suspects just hours before his death. 'He did his job,' Ms Hamblin told the Oregonian. 'He paid the ultimate sacrifice.'","K-9 dog Mick was killed early Wednesday while responding to a burglary call with his partner, Officer Jeff Dorn, 40 .

"Three thousand years ago Britons in East Anglia were skilled boat builders and sailors, enjoyed fishing, and the occasional bowl of nettle stew - and used a method of eel trapping still used today. They even used wooden cutlery. This incredible, detailed picture of life three millennia ago is thanks to a haul of Bronze  Age boats, spears, swords and clothing have been unearthed at one of the most significant Bronze Age sites ever found in Britain, on the River Nene, at Must Farm quarry, Whittlesey. Site Assistants Emma Rees (right) and Iona Robinson work on a Bronze Age long boat unearthed along the old course of the River Nene at Must Farm quarry in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire . Bronze Age long boat: Researchers say the rare find in the East Anglian fens provides possibly the most detailed view yet of what life was like 3,000 years ago . Researchers say the rare find in the East Anglian fens provides possibly the most detailed view yet of what life was like 3,000 years ago. Preserved in silt and peat along the old course of the River Nene, at Must Farm quarry, Whittlesey, items which would normally have long since decomposed have been pulled out of the earth by archaeologists in pristine condition. The archaeologists have been able to dig to a much deeper level than normal by working with a local clay company . David Gibson, from Cambridge University’s archaeological unit, which is carrying out the dig, said: ‘It is giving us a 3-D vision of this community that we only see very rarely anywhere in the world, let alone in this country. ‘Usually at a Later Bronze Age period site you get pits, post-holes and maybe one or two really exciting metal finds. ‘Convincing people that such places were once thriving settlements takes some imagination. ‘But this time so much more has been preserved - we can actually see everyday life during the Bronze Age in the round.’ The site is being excavated ahead of the extension of a local brick quarry and its importance means that it is now likely to be further investigated for some years. Site Assistant Emma Rees works on a Bronze Age long boat unearthed along the old course of the River Nene at Must Farm quarry in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire . Hundreds of objects have been found. The most spectacular find is that of six boats, all from the Bronze Age but appearing at different levels in the silted up river. These range from just over two metres to a little more than eight metres in length. Each was hollowed out of the trunk of an oak tree and in some cases decorated with extensive carvings. Elsewhere, the site has revealed weaponry such as swords and spears still with their handles intact, and everyday items such as wooden spoons, part of a cape, green and blue beads, ropes, buckets and wicker baskets. Some of the weapons bear similarities to those found in northern Spain. There were no significant coastal ports during the Bronze Age but the finds suggest East Anglian waterways may have been an important channel of communication with the frontiers of Britain and the continent. It also indicates people were more mobile than previously thought. Our ancestors were much more mobile than previously thought - the research hints that the community sailed around the waterways of East Anglia, rather than remaining in one place . Researchers have identified the site of the settlement itself to the east of the current excavations. It is believed to have burned down at some point around 800BC. All that is missing from the picture of the society are the bodies of the people who lived there. Human remains may be lying in an as yet unexcavated area of land nearby, or they may have been buried in the river making them harder to find. The community would have lived on the river, fishing for perch, pike and eels. According to the remains of a meal found in one wooden bowl on the site, they also enjoyed the occasional nettle stew. One locally significant discovery is that of eel traps. Remarkably, the 3,000-year-old versions are very similar to those still used in East Anglia today. ‘A modern-day trapper was able to come in and tell us exactly how these traps were used and why,’ Mr Gibson said. ‘It’s amazing that such an ancient technology has continued right up to the present virtually unchanged.’ Archaeologists have been working closely with Hanson, the brick and cement supplier which owns the quarry. The company’s need for clay which lies at Jurassic age levels in the earth means that the dig team have been able to excavate far deeper than on normal archaeological sites.","Early Britons were very mobile - and 'commuted' via river .

"Karen Holland, who won her tribunal for unfair dismissal for being a Wicca witch . A Pagan witch has won a religious discrimination case after claiming she was sacked for attending a Halloween ceremony. Karen Holland, 45, was awarded more than £15,000 by the courts in what is believed to be the first payout of its kind in Britain. Her Sikh bosses insisted they fired her after they caught her stealing. But she accused them of turning on her when they found out she was a Wicca-practising pagan and took them to an employment tribunal, which ruled in her favour. Yesterday Mrs Holland, who is now on Jobseeker’s Allowance, said she was taken outside and fired when she returned to the newsagents where she worked after celebrating All  Hallows’ Eve. The Pagan festival, also called the Feast of the Dead, is marked by making food for the deceased, who are said to reawaken that night and travel back to their old homes for refreshments. Traditionally, cakes and meats are served alongside apples, pears, pomegranates, ale and herbal tea. Incense is also burned with woods and herbs. Mrs Holland claimed her bosses looked at her as if she was a ‘leper’ when they learnt she was Wiccan. She said she was subsequently ridiculed for her beliefs by brothers Tarloch and Gurnam Singh, 36 and 25, who own the Londis shop in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, where she was employed. They allegedly asked her if modern day witches could fly on broom sticks – something they deny they ever said. The Wiccan faith stems from some of the oldest religious practices in the world and has a number of annual festivals (file photo) Mrs Holland was later accused of stealing a magazine and a lottery ticket and fired. The Singhs gave her £204.76 as two weeks wages but no redundancy payment. She was also barred from returning to the store. Mrs Holland took her bosses to court, claiming unfair dismissal, sex discrimination and religious discrimination. She was awarded £15,337.12 in total, including £6,145.44 for unfair dismissal and £9,000 plus £95.84 interest for both of the other charges. The tribunal, in front of Judge George at Watford, found the way she was dismissed was ‘indefensible’ and breached ‘the basics of natural justice’. The ruling stated: ‘She described him [her boss] as seeming revolted by the idea that she was a Wiccan and was made to feel that there was something wrong with her. “There was a look of disgust, it was scary” were the words she used. Wicca was introduced to England in 1954 by retired civil servant Gerald Gardner. He claimed to have been  initiated into the faith by a coven of witches in the New Forest (file photo) ‘When she explained that the two men might have come across a reference to a religion where the female members were called witches and that was the Wiccan religion it led to jokes poking fun at a stereotypical view of witches which she found offensive. ‘Whatever was said it crossed the line from polite if uninformed and possible crass enquiry to insulting mockery.’ The Singh brothers are appealing against the court’s decision. They insist they caught Mrs Holland stealing and showed her CCTV footage to prove what they had seen before sacking her. Later, the footage was deleted because they did not think they’d have to produce it again. Tarloch Singh, who also has a shop in Windsor, said the payout would ruin his business. ‘I did not know about her religion. ‘I never ask my staff if they are Christian, Muslim or anything else,’ he said. ‘She made this up. She has no witnesses. I don’t know how I will pay.’ Mrs Holland had worked in the shop for two years before it was taken over by the Singh brothers last October. She was fired in November. She said: ‘I never stole at all. I worked in that shop for two and a half years and I had a great reputation.’ Mrs Holland, who has been officially initiated as a witch and wears jewellery representing Mother Earth, said she has ‘always been drawn to the spiritual side’ and has ‘always had a call towards it’. ‘It’s not like looking into being a Muslim or being a Catholic. It’s not like going to church on a Sunday. It’s a draw. It’s a pull. It’s a way of life. A total way of life.’ Wicca was introduced to England in 1954 by retired civil servant Gerald Gardner, who claimed to have been initiated in 1939 into a coven of witches in the New Forest. Dubbed the ‘father of Wicca’, Gardner wrote a book called the Book of Shadows, containing spells, from which most modern witches draw inspiration. Some Wiccans perform rituals in the nude, known as ‘skyclad’, because clothes block magical energies. Wiccans worship a goddess who is split in to three sections – virgin, mother and wise woman. They also venerate the ‘horned god’ who is associated with forests, animals and the after-life. The religion’s origins lie in pre-Christian traditions, folklore, folk witchcraft  and magic. Wicca teaches reincarnation. After death the human soul is reborn as the same species, again  and again. Followers celebrate eight festivals a year, known as Sabbats, which mark the four seasons and different agricultural festivals. During rituals, witches stand in a circle and cast spells which are often used for healing, protection  and fertility. 2011 census figures showed there were almost 12,000 Wiccans in the UK.","Karen Holland accused Sikh bosses of discriminating against her faith .

"Diana Nyad is now facing backlash over her record-breaking 110-mile swim from Cuba to Florida as other members of the small community of marathon swimmers are questioning whether she cheated. On social media and the online Marathon Swimmers Forum, long-distance swimmers have been debating whether 64-year-old Nyad got a boost from the boat that was accompanying her - either by getting in it or holding onto it - during a particularly speedy stretch of her swim. They also question whether she violated the traditions of her sport - many follow strict guidelines known as the English Channel rules - by using a specialized mask and wetsuit to protect herself from jellyfish. 'When you know how hard it is, you kind of want those details,' said Andrew Malinak, a Seattle long-distance swimmer who crunched the data available from the GPS positions tracked on Nyad's website and concluded that he didn't trust what he saw. 'Never give up': Diana Nyad emerges from the Atlantic Ocean after completing a 110-mile swim from Cuba to Key West, Florida . Nyad's navigator and one of the swim's official observers told The Associated Press this weekend that Nyad didn't cheat and that she was aided during the rapid part of her swim by a swift current. Neither Nyad nor her team ever said she would follow English Channel rules, developed for swimming the waters between England and France. Those rules outlaw neoprene wetsuits and contact with a support boat. Nyad wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit, gloves, booties and a silicone mask at night, when jellyfish are a particular problem, and removed the suit once she got over the reef on her approach to Key West. According to Nyad's team, she finished the swim Monday afternoon after roughly 53 hours in the water, becoming the first to do so without a shark cage. It was her fifth try, an endeavor apparently free from the boat troubles, bad weather, illnesses and jellyfish encounters that have bedeviled Nyad and other swimmers in recent years. GPS: Nyad's navigator said the above 'spot trackers' used by her critics to claim she cheated are not accurate . Nyad's progress was tracked online via GPS by her team, and some critics say they think information is missing. Many wonder about a roughly seven-hour stretch when Nyad apparently didn't stop to eat or drink, recalling her 2012 attempt when she got onto the boat for hours during rough weather. Nyad eventually got back into the water to try finishing, but her team was criticized for delaying the release of that information to the public. Malinak said the hours-long spike in Nyad's speed after 27 hours of swimming is particularly questionable - she went from her normal pace of roughly 1.5 mph to more than 3 mph, then slowed down again as she approached Key West. Nyad's spokeswomen did not immediately return telephone calls this weekend, but her navigator and Janet Hinkle, one of the official observers for the swim, told the AP that Nyad didn't cheat. Secret weapon: This is Nyad's first attempt . using the prosthetic face mask custom-made to shield her from the . paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish, which some fellow swimmers consider to be cheating . Navigator John Bartlett said the increased speed was due to the fast-moving Gulf Stream working in her favor, nothing more. 'At some points we were doing almost 4 miles an hour,' Bartlett said. 'That's just the way it works. If the current is in your favor at all, that explains it.' The data collected by Bartlett and two observers will be submitted to three open-water swimming associations and the Guinness World Records for verification, Bartlett said. An oceanographer not affiliated with Nyad's team said the swimmer couldn't have picked a more perfect current to get from Havana to Key West. Mitch Roffer of Melbourne-based Roffer's Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service Inc. said he got an email questioning whether Nyad's swim was a hoax, so he decided to look at the charts for himself. What he saw convinced him that she could do it. 'Many times that current runs west-east and you're constantly fighting the current if you're swimming north. In this case, it was in the shape of an S, and the angle was almost exactly from Havana to Key West,' Roffer said. Close to shore: Diana Nyad pictured about two miles out from shore in the Florida Keys. Her critics feel that there is a chance she got out of the water and went on board the accompanying boat . Janet Hinkle, a Key West boat captain and acquaintance of Nyad's, was called to be an observer for the swim when Steve Munatones, a former U.S. national open-water coach, was unable to make it. 'I can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question,' Hinkle said. Critics have said Hinkle was too close to Nyad to be an independent observer of her swim. Hinkle has in the past helped Nyad by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the Florida Keys, but she said she remained on the periphery of Nyad's team. 'I think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity. I believe that's why Diana asked me, and I took my job very seriously,' Hinkle said. 'She was giving her all and I would give her my best.' Since none of the various open-water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from Cuba to Florida - officially accomplished only by Nyad and Susie Maroney, who used a shark cage - Nyad just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins. Australian Chloe McCardel followed English Channel rules in her attempt to swim the Florida Straits in June. She had to be pulled from the water after 11 hours after being stung jellyfish. More than just encouraging words? Some other swimmers say that an uptick in her speed mid race implies that she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team . 'Generally the rules are: You walk in, you swim across and you walk out, and you do it under your own power,' said Munatones, who consulted with Nyad for this swim and observed her attempts in 2011 and 2012. The elaborate, full-body wet suit and protective mask Nyad wore to protect herself from venomous jellyfish actually weighed her down, Munatones said. 'To put that on is like putting on a wedding gown in the ocean,' he said. 'It's different from the English Channel rules, but the water is different from the English Channel.' To many, it seems Nyad hasn't exactly endeared herself to those in the marathon swimming community. Some consider her primarily concerned with gaining the spotlight instead of helping others advance the sport. When I'm 64! Diana Nyad entered the history books after completing the swim without a shark cage . Exhausted: The grandmother appeared to he covered in salt after the length of time she spent in the water . At her post-swim news conference on Tuesday, Nyad admitted that she had not been rooting for McCardel and that she was miffed some members of her team would jump ship to work for a competitor. McCardel said she was disappointed to hear Nyad call those crew members 'traitors.' 'One of the greatest things, I believe, about international marathon swimming is how people across the world support crew for and mentor each other. I wouldn't change this aspect of our sport for the world!' McCardel posted on her Facebook page.","Diana Nyad completed the swim in 52 hours, 54 minutes and 18 seconds .

"The monthly cost of a run-of-the-mill affair is $444, according to a new survey, and if it runs for the average lifespan of six months, that's $2,664 by the time it fizzles out. VoucherCloud's study polled 2,645 American married couples over the age of 25, and calculated the cost by assessing the hotel bills, dinner tabs and gifts associated with the illicit affairs reported. Of those questioned, nearly a quarter admitted to having cheated on their spouses; with affairs generally unfolding two years into the marriage. And only a third of those cheaters said their spouses had noticed a shift in the family's finances as a result of their pricey trysts. Expensive: The study polled 2,645 American married couples over the age of 25, and calculated the $444 monthly cost by assessing the hotel bills, dinner tabs and gifts associated with the affairs reported . The most pricey extravagance on the list . was the dinner and drinks tabs, averaging about $162 a month, followed by . hotel bills, at $123 a month. Date activities, including cinema tickets . for example, cost $69 a month, and gifts accounted for $54. Miscellaneous expenses added up to $36, rounding out the total monthly cost of $444. Of course, expenses can run a lot higher. Ramani Durvasula, a licensed clinical psychologist based in Santa Monica, California, told Today.com: 'Secret cell phones, airline tickets, secret credit cards, hotel rooms -  the costs can be astronomical.' Iconic model Christie Brinkley, now 60, was one cheating-victim who learned this the hard way. In 2008, it was revealed that her then-husband Peter Cook, an architect, was conducting an affair with an 18-year-old store-clerk, Diana Bianchi. Mr Cook was busted for showering Miss Bianchi with gifts; including a $2,000 watch, lingerie from Victoria’s Secret, a $15,000 down payment for a car, and an ultimately fruitless fee of $300,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Busted: In 2008, Christie Brinkley (left) discovered that her husband Tim Cook (center) had been showering his 18-year-old mistress Diana Bianchi (right) with gifts and cash . Amid the world of mortals, sociologists have long been grappling with estimates for how common extra-marital affairs truly are, with results from various surveys indicating anywhere from 25per cent to 75per cent of married people admitting to being unfaithful. Admitting it being the key of course. Dinner and drinks tabs: $162 . Hotel bills: $123 . Date activities, such as movie tickets: $69 . Gifts: $54 . Miscellaneous: $36 . Total: $444 . It is certainly much easier to cheat in today's world than it once was, with many experts pointing to the rise of social media and password-protected communication gadgets as culprits. Then there are portals such as AshleyMadison.com, the world's largest cheating website, and the second large dating site overall after Match.com; boasting 26 million members worldwide. AshleyMadison's slogan is 'Life is short. Have an affair,' and its members can log in to actively seek out cheating partners with whom to have affairs with. Still, however expensive an affair may be, Psycholost Ms Durvasula says it can never match up to its emotional costs. 'The betrayal of trust is the largest cost of having an affair,' she said. 'The guilt, the loss of self-esteem, the loss of self-worth - good luck putting dollars and cents on that.'","VoucherCloud polled 2,645 married couples in the U.S., a quarter of whom confessed to affairs .

"In an era where the quest for eternal youth is never ending, we happily pop pills, down potions and spend a fortune on face cream. But would you be brave enough to drink your own urine if it made you look ten years younger? One 91-year-old man insists this home-brewed elixir is the key to his youthful appearance and active lifestyle. Mark Ambrose, who 'lives in sin' with . his 87-year-old partner Joyce, in the south of Spain, sips his way . through a tumbler of the liquid every day. Elixir? Mark Ambrose, who 'lives in sin' with his 87-year-old partner Joyce, sips his way through a tumber of his own urine every day. He believes this is the key to his youthful appearance and active lifestyle . He also dabs it on wounds as he believes it can aid the healing process. Mr Ambrose told MailOnline: 'Joyce and I both have serious health problems which have to be coped with. 'I have a badly damaged spine and she suffers from macular disease, knees that really need replacements and other complaints normally associated with elderly people. 'Nonetheless, we lead a very active life with friends saying I look a lot less than my age, and my partner possessing remarkable energy and looking no more than 65-70 years of age.' The former publicity director said: 'As far I'm concerned, I am convinced that urine therapy, which I started practicing over three years ago, is mainly responsible for my younger appearance.' Mr Ambrose admits he stumbled across the so-called fountain of youth by accident while searching the internet for a cure for back pain. He explained: 'I'd already undergone three lumber . operations in the UK and in Spain with the specialists admitting they . could do nothing more for me apart from trying out different painkilling medicines. Mr Ambrose also dabs urine on wounds as he believes it can aid the healing process . 'With nothing to lose, I thought I'd try the therapy to help to obtain a better quality of life for my remaining years.' He eagerly began researching what needed to be done - but could find nothing about when or how much to drink. While the practice might sound abhorrent, Mr Ambrose isn't alone - in fact, urine therapy is said to date back to the Bible. Historical documents suggest that the Aztecs . disinfected wounds with it, while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature. Urine is highly sterile, consisting of water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. Advocates of urine therapy believe these excreted ingredients have health benefits ranging from a boosted immune system to eye and ear drops. Undeterred, and armed with this knowledge, Mr Ambrose he decided to adopt the trial and error approach. He recalls: 'Taking . a small sample in a small glass – easier for a male than a female, I . guess – I gingerly tasted the perfectly clear, amber-coloured liquid. 'Not too bad, I thought - a peculiar taste, nothing like anything I’ve . had before. Not pleasant, but on the other hand, not too awful.' Determined to continue, over the next few days he kept tasting his urine until he was brave enough to drink some. 'Taking . a small sample in a small glass, I gingerly tasted the perfectly clear, amber-coloured liquid. 'Not too bad, I thought - a peculiar taste, nothing like anything I’ve . had before. Not pleasant, but on the other hand, not too awful' Starting with just a sip, he began drinking a little almost every time he went to the loo, gradually increasing the amount as the weeks went by, building up to a tumbler. And the secret to it not leaving a nasty after-taste? A grape or two, or a quick rinse of the mouth with water,' he confesses. Three years on, he's also become somewhat of an expert on how one's bodily fluids should appear. 'I learnt that one should note the colour of one’s water and drink it if it’s mid-stream and a definite straw-colour.' But forget sipping on the pale stuff. 'If it's clear then it's practically tasteless - and I think pretty useless as a healing agent,' he instructs. At the other end of the scale, the elixir can also be a bit too strong to handle. 'If it's a deep amber colour veering . towards yellow, it looks beautiful but it's a bit . too strong for me to take, despite it's potential benefits.' Mr Ambrose (with Joyce) admits he stumbled across the practice by accident while searching the internet for a cure for back pain. He said: 'With nothing to lose, I thought I'd try the therapy to help to obtain a better quality of life for my remaining years' But what are the benefits? Mr Ambrose says his research has shown that 'only five per cent of urine contains health-giving vitamins which . will certainly strengthen one’s own immune system'. And how much does he drink in total? 'Half a small . glassful as many times as I can during a normal day' - equating to about a tumbler a day. But it doesn't stop there. He also massages the elixir into skin, believing it can be 'very effective healing problems on the face, arms and . legs and even eyelids and ears, by massaging the affected areas with . urine which can be fresh or a day or two old'. He said: 'I think I look and feel about ten years younger than my age. I often get up early and do some brain training work on the computer, then cheerfully wake up Joyce with a morning cup of tea' But he stresses that persistence is needed. 'Firm massaging of affected areas with urine can sometimes be needed for weeks on even months before healing is complete.' So, three years on, does he feel better? 'I still find it very difficult and painful to walk upright  and I have to take a couple of painkillers a day to keep active. 'However,  I firmly believe that the urine therapy helps to reduce the spinal column nerve pains to an acceptable level - and it doesn’t cost a bean! But despite his best attempts, Mr Ambrose can't convince partner Joyce (pictured) to join his quest for eternal youth . 'The rest of my body is in pretty good shape, with many friends and even strangers remarking how well I look.' 'I think I look and feel about ten years younger than my age. I possess a Spanish driving licence up to 2014, I do all the cooking, I belong to a bridge club which I helped to start 20 years ago; and I’m learning to play the piano whenever I can because I never had the chance when I was younger. 'The morning can’t come quickly enough for me and I often get up early and do some brain train  work on the computer, then cheerfully wake up my partner with her morning cup of tea. 'Because I can memorise the words of almost a 100 songs, Joyce encourages me to sing two or three of them before getting up and making the bed. 'This is an excellent therapy for me and I’m then ready to make the most of the remainder of the day.' He thoroughly believes that drinking urine is responsible for much of this well-being attitude. 'In fact, I feel that life for me would not be worth living without it,' he says. But while Joyce is impressed with the fruits of his efforts, he says she 'finds it impossible to overcome her feelings of repugnance at the very thought of drinking her own urine'. 'She has resisted all my attempts to persuade her to try the urine therapy,' he admits. Urine therapy is said to date back to the Bible. Historical documents suggest that the Aztecs . disinfected wounds with it, while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature. Urine is highly sterile, consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. During the digestive process, the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted. The blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine. But GP Dr Rob Hicks said: 'Over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine, but as far as I'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back-up these claims. 'The kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body doesn't need, so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive. 'Personally, I believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and keeping stress under control.'","Mark Ambrose sips his way .

"Adding pressure to fix the administration's problem-plagued health care program, former president Bill Clinton says President Obama should find a way to let people keep their health coverage, even if it means changing the law. Clinton says Obama should 'honor the commitment that the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got'. The former president, a Democrat who has helped Obama promote the three-year-old health law, becomes the latest in Obama's party to urge the president to live up to a promise he made repeatedly, declaring that the if Americans liked their health care coverage, they would be able to keep it under the new law. Scroll down for video . Bill Clinton said during an interview this afternoon that the U.S. was better off with Obamacare but admitted there were problems in the set up . Instead, millions of Americans have started receiving insurance cancellation letters. That, coupled with the troubled launch of the health care law's enrollment website, has prompted Republican critics and frustrated Democrats to seek corrections in the law. House Republicans have drafted legislation to give consumers the opportunity to keep their coverage. Ten Senate Democrats are pushing for an unspecified extension of the sign-up period and several pressed Obama to do so in a private White House meeting last week. Senator Mary Landrieu, D-La., has proposed legislation that would require insurance companies to reinstate the canceled policies. The White House says it is working on changes that would ease the impact of the cancellations for some people. But the fixes under consideration are administrative actions, not congressional changes to the law. White House spokesman Jay Carney on Tuesday reiterated the White House argument that the cancellations apply to only about 5 per cent of Americans who obtained health care insurance. Obamacare has been plagued by problems since its launch . He also argued that more than half of those people receiving termination notices would benefit from better insurance at lower prices either through expanded Medicaid or through new health care marketplaces. For the remainder, Carney said: 'The president has instructed his team to look at a range of options.' The issue facing the administration now is how to ease the impact on people who are losing their plans and don't qualify for subsidies to cover higher premiums. Carney said the White House would oppose legislation that would allow insurers to keep selling insurance that doesn't offer the type of benefits required by the new law. 'Any fix that would essentially open up for insurers the ability to sell new plans that do not meet standards would create more problems than it fixed,' he said. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democratic leader in the Senate, on Tuesday said that while the law does face problems, he said some of the changes proposed by Republicans 'are not friendly proposals. They're designed to derail this effort'. n an interview with CNN, Durbin cautioned that if consumers are permitted to keep policies that don't meet the law's minimum requirements 'it's going to be difficult for the insurance industry to produce a product that really is going to serve our needs and that they can adequately tell us what it costs'. Asked whether Obama lied to the public when he promised people that they could keep their policies, Durbin said: 'A couple more sentences added would clarify it.' In his interview with the website OZY.com, Clinton overall praised the health care legislation. 'The big lesson is that we're better off with this law than without it.'",Millions of Americans have started receiving insurance cancellation letters .
"Scientists have discovered a surprising new property of graphene – the world’s thinnest and strongest material – that could accelerate the development of electric cars and other  green technologies. Researchers have found that the newly discovered type of carbon graphite, which is found in pencil lead, allows positively charged hydrogen atoms or protons to pass through it. Their discovery could increase the efficiency of fuel cells for cars, because the cells generate electricity from hydrogen. Researchers have found that the newly discovered type of carbon graphite called graphene, which is found in pencil lead, allows positively charged hydrogen atoms or protons to pass through it. An atomic-scale honeycomb lattice made of carbon atoms is pictured . The researchers, led by Nobel Prize winner Sir Andre Geim of Manchester University, who discovered graphene, said their finding raises the possibility that, in future, graphene membranes could be used to ‘sieve’ hydrogen gas from the atmosphere to generate electricity. This is because the one-atom thick material acts like a filter to allow protons to pass through it, while blocking the passage of other atoms. The team demonstrated this when they combined the substance with a single-atom material called boron nitride. Scientists were able collect protons on one side of a membrane, with other blocked atoms accumulated in a chamber. Using such a membrane, fuel cells could extract hydrogen from the air and burn it in order to power electric cars, which wouldn’t spew out environmentally harmful emissions. The discovery could increase the efficiency of fuel cells in cars, because the cells generate electricity from hydrogen. While hydrogen is being used to fuel concept cars (pictured) the technology has a distance to go before it is widely commercialised . Green technology: Sir Andre and PhD student Lozada-Hidalgo hope that graphene could one day be used in proton-conducting membranes, which are a crucial component of fuel cells, used to power 'green' cars. They found that graphene membranes could be used to extract hydrogen from the atmosphere, suggesting the possibility of combining them with fuel cells to make mobile electric generators powered just by tiny amounts of hydrogen in the air. Medicine: Experts say that graphene could be used as a vehicle for delivering drugs to specific sites in the body, which could one day mean new treatments for people with brain conditions, for example. Transport: Graphene’s strength and lightness makes it an ideal material to incorporate into cars and aeroplanes in a bid to make them safer and more fuel efficient. Thin coatings: The thin and strong material could also be used to make corrosion-proof coatings, packaging and even super-thin condoms . Electronics: The material conducts electricity efficiently so it could be used to make new types of smartphones and as well as flexible wearable technology. Purifying water: Scientists are working on using the material as a membrane to separate liquids, so it could one day be used to purify water in areas of the world that do not have access to the essential liquid. ‘We are very excited about this result because it opens a whole new area of promising applications for graphene in clean energy harvesting and hydrogen-based technologies,’ said Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo, co-researcher on the study. At just one atom thick, graphene is the thinnest material on Earth and is also 200 times stronger than steel. It was first isolated in 2004 by Sir Andre and his fellow researchers, who received a Nobel Prize in 2010 for their work. The material is impermeable to all gases and liquids, giving it the potential for a range of uses such as corrosion-proof coatings, packaging and even super-thin condoms. The new discovery, published in Nature, came about because the team wanted to investigate whether protons (hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons) were repelled by the material, which is impermeable to the smallest atom, hydrogen. They were surprised to find that the protons could pass through the ultra-strong material fairly easily, especially at raised temperatures and if the graphene films were covered with nanoparticles such as platinum, which acted as a catalyst. Sir Andre and Dr Lozada-Hidalgo hope that graphene could one day be used in proton-conducting membranes, which are a crucial component of fuel cell technology. Fuel cells, used in some modern cars, use oxygen and hydrogen as fuel and convert the input chemical energy into electricity. But a major problem is that the fuels leak across the existing proton membranes to reduce the cells' efficiency. This problem could be overcome by using graphene. At just one atom thick, graphene is the thinnest material on Earth and is also 200 times stronger than steel. It was first isolated in 2004 by Sir Andre Geim (left) and Dr Konstantin Novoselov (right) who were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 . The team found that graphene membranes could be used to extract hydrogen from the atmosphere, suggesting the possibility of combining them with fuel cells to make mobile electric generators powered just by tiny amounts of hydrogen in the air. ‘Essentially, you pump your fuel from the atmosphere and get electricity out of it,’ Sir Andre said. ‘Our (study) provides proof that this kind of device is possible.’ Dr Sheng Hu, a postdoctoral researcher and the first author in this work, added: ‘Because graphene can be produced these days in square metre sheets, we hope that it will find its way to commercial fuel cells sooner rather than later’. Milo Shaffer, Professor of Materials Chemistry and co-director of the London Centre for Nanotechnology at Imperial College London, said: 'The report that protons can penetrate atomically thin layers is both exciting and surprising, especially given that the measured activation energies are significantly lower than predicted by theory.' Dr Gareth Hinds, Electrochemist specialising in fuel cells of National Physical Laboratory, said: 'While there are challenges to overcome in the manufacture of these 2D layers on a practical scale and questions to be resolved over the mechanism of proton transport, this exciting discovery could have a significant impact on a range of technologies in the energy sector. 'For example, if such a layer could be successfully incorporated between the electrodes of a hydrogen fuel cell, the issue of gas crossover would be completely eliminated, resulting in step changes in power output and stability. 'This would have major implications for an environmentally-friendly technology on the brink of commercialisation.'","Graphene is the world's thinnest and strongest material that is impermeable to atoms and molecules .

"A cash-strapped Greek pensioner shot and killed himself in a public square outside parliament in Athens yesterday, after saying he refused to scrounge for food in the rubbish. The death of the 77-year-old retired pharmacist, who said he wanted a ‘dignified end’, touched a nerve among ordinary Greeks. One in five in Greece is jobless as the country grapples with its worst economic crisis since the Second World War. Tributes: People lay flowers at the site where the pensioner fatally shot himself at Athens' main Syntagma square . Tributes: The financially-stricken pensioner had reportedly said, 'So I don't leave debts for my children' before shooting himself . After becoming desperate at his . financial plight, the Greek pensioner is said to have put a handgun to . his head in the busy central Athens square before declaring, 'So I won't . leave debts for my children', and pulling the trigger. Just hours after the death, an impromptu shrine with candles, flowers and hand-written notes protesting the crisis sprung up in the central Syntagma square where the suicide occurred. Dozens of bystanders gathered to pay their respects. One note nailed to a tree said 'Enough is enough', while another asked 'Who will be the next victim?'. The 'Indignant' protesters, who have turned out in the thousands against austerity measures imposed by foreign lenders in exchange for bailout loans, said they planned a march later on Wednesday. 'This is a human tragedy,' government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said as politicians in parliament decried the death. Mourners stand quietly next to the spot in Syntagma Square in Athens, where the Greek pensioner turned a gun on himself . Greek medics remove the body of the pensioner, after he had committed suicide in front of stunned passers-by in one of the busiest squares in Athens . Greek suicide rates increased in Greece by 22 per cent between 2009 and 2010, as the country struggled to cope with austerity measures . Acts of suicide have been instrumental in the past in provoking popular protest. A Tunisian vegetable seller triggered the start of the so-called 'Arab Spring' by setting himself on fire in December 2010. Witnesses said the man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger after yelling out: 'I have debts, I can't stand this anymore.' Another passerby told Greek television the man said 'I don't want to leave my debts to my children.' A suicide note found in his coat pocket blamed politicians and financial troubles for driving him to take his life, police said. The government had 'annihilated any hope for my survival and I could not get any justice. I cannot find any other form of struggle except a dignified end before I have to start scrounging for food from the trash"",' the note said. Within hours of the man's suicide, dozens of heartfelt notes of condolence were attached to the tree near where he took his life in Athens . The president of the pharmacists' union in the broader Attica region, Costas Lourantos, said he recalled . meeting the man several years ago and was struck by his dignified . manner. 'When dignified people like him are . brought to this state, somebody must answer for it,' said Lourantos. 'There is a moral instigator to this crime - which is the government . that has brought people to such despair.' Shortly after news of the man's . death, Lourantos says he received an anonymous call from a pharmacist . saying she would be next to follow suit. 'I am now frantically looking to find out who it was so we can stop her,' Lourantos said. The busy square, through which . thousands pass by during the morning commute hours when the suicide . occurred, was cordoned off while the body was taken away. Greece is stumbling through its worst . post-World War Two economic crisis as austerity measures demanded by . foreign lenders in exchange for financial aid push the country into its . fifth year of recession. Suicide rates in Greece have . dramatically increased in the past three years as the country struggles . to cope with economic hardship. According to the Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection, suicides increased by 22.5 per cent to 622 in 2010. The government last year said . suicides had increased 40 percent over the previous two years as the . worsening crisis drives ordinary Greeks to despair.

"It will take another 60 years before women earn the same as men at the current pace of change, Labour warned today. Women still earn just 80p for every pound men take home and the pay gap widened last year. Shadow women's minister Gloria De Piero accused the Tories of the 'turning the clock back' for female workers by failing to do more to reduce unfairness in the workplace. The gender pay gap widened from 19.6 per cent in 2012 to 19.7 per cent i 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics . Latest figures show that in April 2013, men earned £12.86 per hour and women £10.33, a gap of 19.7 per cent. It marked an increase on 2012, when the gap was 19.6 per cent, with women paid £10.05 to men's £12.50. Since 2010 the pay gap has closed at a rate of only 0.3 per cent per year on average, according to the House of Commons library. At this rate Labour claims it could take more than 60 years to deliver equal pay for women. By then, more than a century will have passed since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. Miss De Piero said: 'Women should not have to wait more than 100 years for equal pay. Labour's shadow women's minister Gloria De Piero accused the Tories of the 'turning the clock back' for female workers by failing to do more to reduce unfairness in the workplace . 'The Tories are turning the clock back for women. More women are struggling to make work pay, earning less than the living wage and facing sky-high childcare costs. This isn't the progress our mothers, aunties and sisters fought for. 'When David Cameron claims that working women have never had it so good, women know this isn't a government that speaks for them.' According to the Office for National Statistics' Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) 2013, women still earn just 80p for every pound men take home. House of Commons Library calculations of ASHE data from 1997 to 2013 show the pay gap has closed at a rate of 0.3 per cent per year since 2010. Miss De Piero added: 'Only Labour will deliver on the promise of equal pay with pay transparency, tackle the scandal of low pay and expand access to free childcare to make work pay for families across Britain. 'Next May there is a big choice for women across this country. A Tory Britain with progress on equality stalled, more women on low wages, on zero-hours contracts and earning less than their male colleagues. 'Or a Labour future that will deliver on the promise of equal pay, tackling the scandal of low pay and delivering affordable childcare for families.' Women and Equalities Minister Nicky Morgan said the Government is pleased that the overall trend on the gender pay gap continues downwards. She added: 'The gap for full-time workers under 40 is now almost zero and it continues to narrow for the over-40s. However, I am clear that it remains too high and I'm committed to reducing it more. 'That's why the steps we've taken have gone far further than the last Government - by giving employees the right to request flexible working as well as introducing tax-free childcare and shared parental leave from 2015 so that women can make the right choice for them about how to balance work and families. 'We are also introducing new regulations which will give tribunals the power to order employers to conduct a pay audit, where they have been found to discriminate over pay.' Liberal Democrat MP for Solihull Lorely Burt said the gender pay gap is not closing quickly enough and called for businesses to be forced to publish the difference between what they pay men and women. She went on: 'In a fair society men and women should be equally rewarded for their work. 'It's time to make large companies publish the difference between what they pay men and women - and it's a shame that the Tories have blocked this in Government. Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case strongly. 'Liberal Democrats are modernising the workplace and encouraging employers to become more family friendly - through measures like shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working.'","In April 2013 men earned £12.86 per hour and women £10.33, a gap of 19.7% .

"Acquitted: Sandor Kepiro, 97, was on trial for war crimes dating back 69 years . A 97-year-old man was sensationally cleared of committing war crimes during World War II today. The charges stemmed from a raid by pro-Nazi Hungarian forces in Serbia. Sandor Kepiro had been charged by prosecutors of involvement in the killing of some 35 people. The killings took place during an anti-partisan raid in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, which was then under Hungarian control, on January 23, 1942. Hungary was a member of the Axis powers - allied with Germany, Italy and Japan - from 1940, participating in the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was then part. Prosecutors had claimed that unidentified members of a patrol under Kepiro's command killed four people during the raid. Kepiro, at the time a gendarmerie captain, was also suspected of being involved in the deaths of around 30 others who were executed on the banks of the Danube River. Many of the dozens of people . attending the court session cheered and clapped after judge Bela Varga . read out the verdict of the three-member tribunal. Kepiro, . who returned to Hungary in 1996 after decades in Argentina, was . discovered living in Budapest in 2006 by Nazi-hunters with the Simon . Wiesenthal Center. Before reading out the verdict, Mr Varga said Kepiro had been brought to the tribunal by ambulance and had spent the past week in hospital after apparently being given the wrong medication. In a statement from Kepiro read out at the start of the court session, he rejected all the charges. Frail: He was accused of ordering the deaths of Serbian civilians in World War II . Trial: The court can sit for only 90 minutes each day because of the defendant's poor health . 'I am innocent. I never killed, never stole. I served my country,' said the statement read out by Kepiro's psychologist, who added that Kepiro said he returned to Hungary from Argentina in 1996, 'because for him without Hungary there is no life.' Unusually, the verdict is being given over two days, today and tomorrow, because only two court sessions of 45 minutes can be held daily due to Kepiro's frail health. Captain: Kepiro, shown here during the war, was a captain in the Hungarian army, allied to the Nazis . After Varga cleared him of the charges, Kepiro - who sat in a wheelchair during the session, had an IV drip in his arm and did not speak - was taken out of the courtroom by paramedics upon the request of his lawyer, Zsolt Zetenyi. After a brief recess, the judge continued reading out the full ruling, with only Mr Zetenyi representing the defence. Serbia's war crime prosecutor and representatives of the Simon Wiesenthal Center attended the session, leaving the courtroom after the verdict was announced. Efraim Zuroff, who brought Kepiro's . case to light in 2006, earlier described the proceedings as 'one of the . last major trials' of Holocaust-era war criminal suspects. In . 1941, after the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, Hungarian forces entered . northern Serbia, which sided with the Allies during the war and had . been part of Hungary until World War I. In early 1942, those Hungarian . forces carried out raids to counter the growing number of partisan . attacks. Kepiro said that . his task was to supervise the identification of people being rounded up, . but he claimed to be unaware of the killings until after they had been . carried out. About 800 Serbs and 400 Jews are thought to have been . killed in the raids. In January 1944, Kepiro and several other officers were convicted of disloyalty by a military court for their role in the Novi Sad raids. The 10-year prison sentence, of which Kepiro served a few weeks, was later annulled and his rank reinstated. Kepiro, pictured left at the start of his trial in May, was accused of atrocities committed in Novi Sad, left . Survivors: The victims of Hungarian raids in Serbia - like Rodoljub Malencic, left, and Elvira Fisova - are angry about the verdict . Before Kepiro's trial, the last man to be accused of Nazi-era war crimes was John Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker from Ohio, convicted in May of 28,060 counts of accessory to murder by a Munich court. Demjanjuk today became the subject of a new investigation, which accuses him of guarding not only the Sobibor death camp, for which he has already been convicted, but also the Flossenbuerg concentration camp. His case was the first time someone was convicted on evidence of being a guard alone, without evidence of a specific killing. Attorney Cornelius Nestler says his goal in filing the new complaint is to expand the precedent to apply to concentration camp guards as well as death camp guards.","Hungarian had topped Simon Wiesenthal's most wanted Nazi list .

"Pope Francis washed the feet of 12 elderly and disabled people Thursday - women and non-Catholics among them - in a pre-Easter ritual designed to show his willingness to serve others like a 'slave'. Francis' decision in 2013 to perform the Holy Thursday ritual on women and Muslim inmates at a juvenile detention center helped define his rule-breaking papacy just two weeks after his election. It riled traditionalist Catholics, who pointed to the Vatican's own regulations that the ritual be performed only on men since Jesus' 12 apostles were men. Humility: Pope Francis performs the traditional washing of the feet during a visit to a centre for disabled people today . Pope Francis kisses the foot of a man as he performs the traditional Maundy Thursday ritual . But as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio frequently performed the ritual on women - a practice that he seems intent on keeping up now that he is pope. This year Francis was at a centre for the elderly and disabled in Rome. Francis kneeled down, washed, dried and kissed the feet of a dozen people, some in wheelchairs, some with grossly swollen and disfigured feet. The Vatican didn't release the exact breakdown of their religious backgrounds, but said they came from various religious confessions. Italian news reports said one was a Libyan Muslim. Servant of God: Pope Francis washes the foot of a disabled person at the Santa Maria della Provvidenza church in Rome . Francis told the faithful that he was performing the ritual to remind himself how to serve others, as Jesus did when he washed the feet of his apostles. 'Jesus made a gesture, a job, the service of a slave, a servant,' he said. 'And he leaves this inheritance to us: We need to be servants to one another.' Francis began Holy Thursday by presiding over Mass in St. Peter's Basilica celebrating the priesthood, the start of a busy four days of Holy Week commemorations and preparations for next week's canonization of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII. During his morning homily Thursday, Francis urged his priests to exhibit joy, though he admitted that he too had suffered 'moments of listlessness and boredom which at times overcome us in our priestly life.' The Washing of the Feet, also known as Maundy (from Latin 'mandatum') is a religious rite observed by several Christian denominations. Jesus performed the act in John 13:1–17. He said: 'If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. 'For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. 'If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.' Many denominations observe the washing of the feet on Maundy Thursday of Holy Week. Foot washing rites are also practiced by many Anglican, Lutheran and Methodist churches. At one time, most of the European monarchs also performed the Washing of Feet in their royal courts on Maundy Thursday, a practice continued by the Austro-Hungarian Emperor and the King of Spain up to the beginning of the 20th century.

"The Director of the FBI has warned  the Khorosan terror group will strike the US 'very very soon' and says Americans fighting alongside militants in Syria cannot be stopped from returning home. James Comey said the unit of Al Qaeda veterans are 'bent on destruction' and are believed to be working on an attack directed at the United States or its allies. However he assured the public by saying changes made since 9/11 mean the security services are 'better in every way that you'd want' and have the systems in place to quash any threat. Scroll down for video . Concerns: FBI Director James Comey said the Khorosan terror group could attack 'very very soon' and admitted that Americans fighting alongside militants in the Middle East are entitled to return . Speaking on CBS 60 Minutes, he confirmed that there are around a dozen American citizens fighting in the Middle East for the extremist groups, and the government is aware of who they are. The interviewer Scott Pelley asks: 'How many Americans are fighting in Syria on the side of the terrorists?' 'In the area of a dozen or so,' Comey replied. 'Do you know who they are?' Comey answers: 'Yes.' Pelley then pressed: 'Each and every one of them?' 'I think of that, dozen or so, I do. I hesitate only because I don't know what I don't know,' Comey said. He said: 'Ultimately, an American citizen, unless their passport's revoked, is entitled to come back. So, someone who's fought with ISIL, with American passport wants to come back, we will track them very carefully.' Discussing the US fight against terrorism, Comey added that the terrorist networks within Syria as a sophisticated 'metastasis' of Al Qaeda . Khorosan, a small group of Al Qaeda veterans from Afghanistan and Pakistan, was targeted in strikes near Aleppo, Syria, last month. Senior U.S. officials have not said whether the group's plots have been disrupted. Comey said: 'Given our visibility we know they're serious people, bent on destruction.' But he added that Americans should have confidence in changes made since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, pointing to a government 'better organized, better systems, better equipment, smarter deployment. We're better in every way that you'd want us to be since 9/11.' During the interview, he also  compared Chinese hackers to a 'drunk burglar' who steals with reckless abandon, even as they cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars every year. Questioning: When interviewer Scott Pelley asked Comey whether he knew who the Americans fighting with the extremists were, he replied simply saying 'Yes' In an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS' '60 Minutes,' Comey said Chinese hackers target the intellectual property of U.S. companies in China every day. 'I liken them a bit to a drunk burglar. They're kickin' in the front door, knocking over the vase, while they're walking out with your television set. They're just prolific. Their strategy seems to be: `We'll just be everywhere all the time. And there's no way they can stop us,'' Comey said. The Justice Department earlier this year announced a 31-count indictment against Chinese hackers accused of breaking into computer networks at steel companies and the manufacturers of solar and nuclear technology, with the goal of gaining a competitive advantage. China has denied the allegations. Comey admitted that the government knows the citizens who have travelled to join the fighting and will 'track them very carefully' if they return . In the CBS interview, Comey also discussed the U.S. fight against terrorism. He described the terrorist networks within Syria as a sophisticated 'metastasis' of al-Qaida. He said the Khorasan Group, an al-Qaida cell in Syria that was targeted in military strikes last month, was 'working and, you know, may still be working on an effort to attack the United States or our allies, and looking to do it very, very soon.' 'Given our visibility we know they're serious people, bent on destruction,' he said.Comey said the U.S. believes there are about a dozen Americans fighting alongside extremist groups in Syria. He said if someone has fought alongside the Islamic State militant group and tries to come back to the U.S., 'we will track them very carefully.'","James Comey said the Al Qaeada veterans are 'bent on destruction'

"Action needed: Lord Justice Munby, the top family judge. says that contraception should be forced on problem parents . Problem parents with up to 15 children should be encouraged to use contraception by the courts, one of England’s most senior judges said last night. Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court, said it is a ‘distressingly regular occurrence’ that mothers end up with their dozen or more children taken into care. He praised the concept of Family Drug and Alcohol Courts, which are being set up in several areas to control the problem. These courts can give parents with huge families contraception to prevent ‘repetitive pregnancies’. The judge, who is the most senior family judge in England and Wales, made his comments at the annual meeting of the British Association of Social Workers. ‘The new FDAC projects have dealt with the taking into care of  14 children of one mother and  colleagues have dealt with a case of 15,’ he said. ‘I have certainly dealt with a case of 11 children. These cases are still happening. Eleven children being taken into care, or 14 children – these are very usual. ‘Repetitive pregnancies and repetitive care proceedings are a distressingly regular occurrence.’ The court proceedings involve social services, drug and alcohol experts and doctors, who draw up plans for parents. They also meet judges one-to-one rather than in the courts. It is hoped that this approach will keep children out of care and the parents out of prison, or off drink and drugs. ‘With some local authorities contraception is an important part of the thinking,’ Sir James said. ‘The whole thing is very intensive but it does seem to work. The savings if you can avoid care proceedings are enormous.’ Dropping the traditional adversarial approach used in British courtrooms in favour of a Continental-style inquisitorial approach had helped the new courts be  successful, he added. ‘That was a difficult concept for . lawyers to accept,’ he said. ‘They were worried about what their . clients might say. But it has been an absolutely key component in . getting FDAC to work. The judge is able to built up a personal rapport . with the mother and father. And from the parents’ point of view, it . makes them feel part of the process rather than being a spectator.’ In . a wide-ranging speech, he pointed out there was a ‘tension’ between . government guidelines in adoption and a recent key ruling from the . Supreme Court. He said: . ‘Ministerial guidance came out, in spring last year, which contained at . some point the statement or an exaltation that social workers should get . away from the idea that adoption is a last resort. Backing: Sir James, one of the most senior judges at the High Court, says that avoiding care proceedings will save a fortune . ‘Two months later a ruling from the Supreme Court said adoption should in fact only be used as a last resort. They are very difficult to reconcile – that is judicial speak for irreconcilable. In the final analysis, if there is a clash between what the Supreme Court says and the  guidance says, then under our constitutional system the Supreme Court wins.’ If politicians wanted to shift the balance in favour of the Government guidelines, making adoption more frequently used, they should change the law, he added. 'With some local authorities contraception is an important part of the thinking... The whole thing is very intensive but it does seem to work' Sir James Munby . He added that the courts must also devise a system which allows children taken into care to find out the reasons for the decision in later life, if they wish, saying: ‘We don’t deal with this adequately’. Sir James has said previously that a controversial court which can make life-or-death decisions and send people to jail in secret, should be opened up to public scrutiny. Addressing a conference in  London last autumn, he indicated that the rules for the Court of  Protection should be changed to make it more transparent. Sir James said it should be treated in the same way as the family courts where media are allowed to attend. He is also keen to further open up the family courts – which journalists can now attend but are more often than not prevented from reporting the details of a case. He said that while there were differences between the family court and the Court of Protection, they should be part of a single system. More judgments should be published, so the public could have confidence justice was being done.","Lord Justice Munby says contraception should be forced on some parents .

"Countless books, paintings and films have attempted to portray Pompeii and its subsequent destruction in 79AD. And now the famous Italian location has been immortalised in Lego. Named Lego Pompeii, the reconstruction took a master Lego builder 470 hours to complete and consists of more than 190,000 individual blocks. The Lego Pompeii reconstruction (pictured) took a master Lego builder 470 hours to complete and consists of more than 190,000 individual blocks. It is on display at Sydney University’s Nicholson Museum . It was constructed by Ryan McNaught, also known as The Brickman, and is on display at Sydney University’s Nicholson Museum. The museum said the reconstruction is the largest model of the ancient city ever made out of Lego blocks. It shows how the town would have looked at the moment of destruction in 79AD, how it looked when it was rediscovered in the 1700s, and how it looks today. Since 2012, the museum has commissioned Mr McNaught to recreate three ancient sites, including a replica of the Colosseum in Rome and the Lego Acropolis. The study of the cities of Vesuvius is central to the Higher School Certificate (HSC) Ancient History syllabus at the university. It was built by Ryan McNaught, known as The Brickman (pictured), and shows how the town would have looked at the moment of destruction in 79AD, how it looked when it was rediscovered in the 1700s, and today . The Forum of Pompeii recreated in Lego is pictured. It also shows features of the ancient city such as bakeries and bars, temples and marketplaces. The legacy of Pompeii in popular culture is also shown, from Bulwer-Lytton’s novel The Last Days of Pompeii (1834) to more recent Hollywood movies, such as Pompeii (2014) Pompeii was a large Roman town in the Italian region of Campania destroyed by a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in 79AD. Reports claim that two thousand people died, and the location was abandoned until it was rediscovered in 1748. Many of the buildings, artefacts and skeletons were found intact under a layer of debris. It is now classified as a Unesco World Heritage Site and more than 2.5 million tourists visit each year. In November, French and Italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town found raw clay vases that appear to have been dropped by Roman potters fleeing the disaster. The city also forms the basis of undergraduate courses on Roman history. The university said the Lego model helps introduce students to issues of Roman daily life, architecture and the history of the excavations. Visitors and students can also explore Lego features of the ancient city such as bakeries and bars, temples and marketplaces. The legacy of Pompeii in popular culture is additionally shown, taken from Bulwer-Lytton’s novel The Last Days of Pompeii (1834) to more recent Hollywood movies, such as Pompeii released in 2014. ‘The use of a popular medium such as Lego enabled the museum to present the ancient world in a way that captures new audiences who may not necessarily be museum-goers and ensure that fun is a central component of the museum visit,’ said Craig Barker, education manager at Sydney University Museums. ‘From personal experience I have seen children engrossed in the Lego display, but then actually spend far longer exploring the collection as a whole.

In October, a 70-year-old woman returned an ancient decoration that she took from the attraction back in 1964 - and local archaeologists claim this is a common occurrence. The unnamed woman picked up the small decoration during her honeymoon, and it is said to have formed part of the entrance to a theatre. Director Massimo Osanna told Il Messaggero: 'We have been receiving hundreds of packages with hundreds of fragments now for years.

Other stolen artefacts that have been returned include tiles, painted plaster, stones and bricks. And a fresco fragment, said to have been crucial to archaeologists hoping to restore the Casa Del Frutteto on the site, was returned in March after two decades. Other artefacts have been recovered by customs. In September, a large stone taken from the historical site was seized at Rome's Fiumicino airport after two Americans tried to take the 4-stone 10lb (30kg) artefact home in their suitcase. Pompeii was a large Roman town in the Italian region of Campania that was destroyed by a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in 79AD. Reports said 2,000 people died, and the location was abandoned until it was rediscovered in 1748. Many of the buildings, artefacts and skeletons were found intact under a layer of dust of debris. It is now classified as a Unesco World Heritage Site and more than 2.5 million tourists visit each year.

The 10 pots, which were found sealed beneath a later of ash and pumice, appear to have been ready to be fired. It looks as if they were dropped as frightened potters saw the smoke and smelt the sulphurous fumes that would have been spewed out by the volcano - and decided to make a run for it. Historical accounts and archaeological evidence show that many Pompeians took to the streets in a bid to leave the city, braving hot ash and pumice stones ejected from Vesuvius, with some collapsing from inhaling poisonous fumes. Roman writer, Pliny the younger, described the panic during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Terrified Romans (illustrated) living in the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum saw ‘sheets of fire and leaping flames’ as they ran through dark streets carrying torches with pumice stone raining down upon them, he said .

"Building houses will create more ‘human happiness’ than preserving fields, the Planning Minister has claimed. Nick Boles says the Government is determined to speed up the rate of house building, despite opposition from countryside groups. And he said communities who refused to support the initiative risked losing their hospitals and high street shops as their populations shrank. Nick Boles says the Government is determined to speed up the rate of house building, despite opposition from countryside groups . In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Boles acknowledged that rural rights campaigners and Conservative supporters were ‘very worried’ when greenfield land was replaced by ‘the sheer ugliness and soullessness of housing estates’. But he insisted that current planning laws were sending Britain ‘back to the 19th century’ when only the wealthy could afford their own home. He said: ‘The sum of human happiness that is created by the houses that are being built is vastly greater than the economic, social and environmental value of a field that was growing wheat or rape.’ His comments were met with a furious reaction from environmental campaigners who said the reforms would cause  ‘further sprawl’ in the countryside. In Mr Boles’s Grantham constituency, 7,000 homes are being built on greenfield land. Defending the plans, he said: ‘The only way we will get to hang on to the services we want to have, the local hospital, the only way we’ll get M&S back and get a John Lewis at some future point, is if the population of the town grows.’ The minister revealed he intends to bring in a further wave of changes to planning rules to ease the housing crisis, including: . Mr Boles said: ‘It’s a difficult thing to be a Conservative MP arguing for more houses to be built, sometimes on green fields.’ But he branded councils who refuse to co-operate ‘deeply irresponsible’. He said: ‘There’s no question that some local authorities are dragging their feet. ‘Some of them think to themselves they will sit on their hands and let applications come in and refuse them and then blame Nick Boles. It’s deeply irresponsible.

"Justin Welby: Unaware of Wonga holding . The Church of England was condemned last night after revealing it will continue investing in Wonga. Church leaders defended the decision saying they believe their money can improve the behaviour of companies that are less than ‘morally perfect’. It came as the City of London Police announced it is considering launching a criminal investigation into the controversial payday loan firm’s bogus legal letters sent to tens of thousands of customers. Regulators had previously insisted that an order to pay £2.6million in compensation to the 45,000 recipients was sufficient punishment. The church’s decision comes after a review by its Ethical Investment Advisory Group, the body which counsels church financiers on the morality of their investments. The report was prompted after the Archbishop of Canterbury last year criticised Wonga without realising the CofE’s financial arm, the Church Commissioners, had holdings in the firm, which are believed to amount to between £75,000 and £90,000. And in January, the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend David Walker, said that Wonga’s lending was sinful, adding: ‘In the first few pages of the Bible, the serpent offers Adam an apple. He’s tempted by the promise of a quick route to God-like wisdom. What he’s not reckoning on is just how much it will end up costing.’ In the report, group chairman James Featherby said that the row had ‘highlighted some misconceptions about ethical investment, and in particular that its objective is to achieve a morally perfect portfolio’. He said: ‘It is no more realistic to desire that they invest only in morally perfect companies than it is to desire that any of us should relate only to morally perfect individuals. ‘When engaging with companies the investing bodies seek positive momentum not perfection. We usually only recommend divestment where we see no genuine desire for change.’ The Church of England controls one of the biggest and most powerful investment funds in the country. The Church Commissioners, who maintain the historic assets of the church and fund 15 per cent of everything it spends, operate on such a scale that the investment in Wonga looks like the merest trifle. Last year the commissioners’ holdings grew by £600million to reach a record £6.1billion. Their chief, the First Church Estates Commissioner, former journalist Andreas Whittam Smith, said: ‘It was a very  good year for the portfolio.  Everything that could go right did go right.’ But such success, as the report from the Commissioner’s Ethical Investment Advisory Group made clear yesterday, is not based on squeamish thinking about the companies into which the investment goes. The wealth of the fund is based on the centuries-old landholdings of the church, together with various windfalls such as Queen Anne’s Bounty, handed over in the early 18th Century to help impoverished clergymen, and which is now reckoned to be worth around a third of total assets. He added that occasionally ethical investors, such as the church, would ‘graze their knees as they interact with a complex and ambiguous business world. But in our view, it is better to stay on the field of play than to sit on the sidelines’. The investment in Wonga, arranged through a ‘pooled fund’ directed by a third party, would be treated according to the parable of the weeds in the St Matthew gospel, Mr Featherby said. In the parable, weeds are allowed to grow with the wheat until harvest time, and only then separated from the wheat  and burned. He went on to justify the decision to keep the investment by saying: ‘It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.’ Edward Mason, the group’s secretary, said that the furore surrounding Wonga over the past few days had been ‘very concerning’, adding: ‘We don’t like the business and we would rather we weren’t in it.’ But he said the potential loss from withdrawing was ‘disproportionate’. Because of the way pooled funds operate, a platform of investments would have to be pulled. Police could reconsider launching a criminal investigation into the payday lender Wonga, it has been revealed . As a result the commissioners are said to have calculated that they will lose between £3million and £9million if they take their money out of Wonga. The Archbishop, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, was on holiday and unavailable for comment yesterday. Meanwhile the Reverend Rod Thomas, a Plymouth vicar who is chairman of the influential evangelical group Reform, criticised the church’s decision, saying: ‘I do not think the Church Commissioners have set out to do anything other than act in the best interests of the Church. ‘But once the facts are presented to them, it is up to the commissioners to do something about it.’ Andrea Minichiello Williams, of pressure group Christian Concern, and a member of the church’s General Synod, said: ‘The job of the Church is to tell the truth, and it should not be doing things that do a disservice to that task.’ The group’s report also said it would introduce lower ethical investment thresholds. In future, it will withdraw money from firms with more than 10 per cent of their business in tobacco, gambling, high interest rate lending or human embryonic cloning, instead of the present threshold of 25 per cent.","Church of England condemned after revealing it will continue investing in Wonga .

"The vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, has been charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road. Charlie Shrem, who had financial backing from the Winklevoss twins and is well known as one of the bitcoin's biggest global promoters, was arrested on Sunday at John. F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said on Monday. Shrem, who was also charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, appeared in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday and was released on $1million bond. Charged: Charlie Shrem (left), 24 - pictured with an unidentified person - was arrested at New York's JFK airport Monday morning and charged with money laundering . ‘At this point the allegations in the complaint are simply allegations, and Mr. Shrem is presumed innocent,’ his lawyer Keith Miller said. The 24-year-old entrepreneur, who lives above a bar he jointly owns in Manhattan that accepts bitcoins as payment, was CEO of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last summer. According to prosecutors, Shrem conspired with a Florida resident, Robert Faiella, who ran an illegal exchange, to sell more than $1million in bitcoins to users of Silk Road, which was shuttered by authorities last year. Faiella, 52, is also charged in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was arrested at his home in Coral Gables, Florida. At his court hearing on Monday in federal court in Florida, Faiella consented to detention until Wednesday, at which point there will be a bail hearing. Shrem could not be reached for comment. A person who answered the phone at Faiella's house and declined to be identified said, ‘Nobody wants to talk.’ Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank and whose value fluctuates according to demand by users. Users can transfer bitcoins to each other over the Internet and store the currency in digital ‘wallets.’ Scroll down for video . Similar situation: Like Shrem, Robert Faiella (left) ran a Bitcoin exchange and he was arrested at his Cape Coral, Florida home (right) and faces the same charges as Shrem . Rise of the Bitcoins: Bitcoins were first introduced four years ago and were initially unknown to everyone but hackers and the computer-savvy, but they have now caught the eye of investors . The criminal complaint says that . Shrem, in addition to knowing that Faiella's business was funneling . money into Silk Road, also used Silk Road himself to buy drugs, . including marijuana-infused brownies. ‘When . Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel . criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act,’ Preet . Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement emailed to . the press on Monday. ‘We will aggressively pursue those who would . co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.’ Bharara . has said recently that prosecutors are not going after Bitcoin itself . and view it as they view any other currency in which transactions are . sometimes made illegally. U.S. law enforcement officials have vowed to pursue any criminal activity in . the nascent Bitcoin world as regulators try to formulate their approach . to the digital currency. The . charging of a prominent Bitcoin Foundation official may be a blow to . Bitcoin's prospects, though it did not have a huge immediate impact on . trading. Bitcoins were exchanging hands at $970 late on Monday, down . from prices above $1,000 earlier this month but up from around $150 four . months ago on the Tokyo-based exchange MtGox. Winklevoss . Capital, which is run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, . invested in BitInstant in 2012 and led a capital-raising effort last May . that raised $1.5million. The twins, who are best known for their failed . lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in which they had . claimed he had stolen their idea for an online social networking . platform at Harvard, have been seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin . exchange-traded fund. ‘When . we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a . commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - . including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less,’ the . Winkelvoss twins said in a statement. ‘Although BitInstant is not named . in today's indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply . concerned about his arrest,’ they said. ‘We were passive investors in . BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement . officials.’ Double vision: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, known best for their alleged connection to the founding of Facebook, invested $1.5million in BitInstant last year . As part of the . conditions of his bail, Shrem will be confined to his parents' home in . the Marine Park section of Brooklyn. A report prepared by the court for . his bail hearing listed his net worth at $6million, according to U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. Serrin Turner, an assistant U.S. attorney, opposed bail, saying Shrem had a ‘strong incentive to flee’ and the means to do so. Bitcoin . insiders said Shrem's arrest showed just how hard it is to get away . with illegal activity using Bitcoin, which has an ownership chain built . into its software so that each unit can be tied to the users who have . acquired or spent it. ‘Using . bitcoin for illicit transactions is really, really dumb,’ said Patrick . Murck, the Bitcoin Foundation's general counsel. ‘Bitcoins are so easy . to track.’ According to the . charges, Faiella, going by ‘BTCKing’ online, sold bitcoins to Silk Road . users and passed on purchase orders he received from the site to Shrem, . who filled them, transferring funds to Faiella's account at an . unidentified bitcoin exchange service based in Japan. The . charging document says that Shrem failed to report suspicious activity . to regulators ‘with respect to numerous Bitcoin purchases’ Faiella made . from BitInstant. The . document contains email conversations between Shrem and BitInstant's . co-founder, who is not identified in the charges but is listed on . BitInstant's website as Gareth Nelson, in which Shrem tried to hide his . dealings with Faiella by pretending to ban him from BitInstant's . exchange platform. ‘You are hereby banned from our services,’ he wrote in an email to BTCKing that he copied to Nelson. According . to the complaint, Shrem then privately wrote to BTCKing, without . including Nelson. ‘Your email address is banned,’ Shrem wrote, ‘but you . can use a different one.’ Bitcoins . have been gaining wider acceptance recently. The Sacramento Kings . basketball team earlier this month became the first professional sports . franchise to say it would allow purchases using bitcoins. Last month, . ecommerce site Overstock.com announced its plan to become the first . major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency. Created . in 2009 by a developer or team of developers going by the name Satoshi . Nakamoto, whose true identity remains unknown, the bitcoin's earliest . adopters have included people expressing a desire to conduct their . affairs in a realm outside of government-sanctioned commercial spaces. Some . of that sentiment is visible in the charges against Shrem and Faiella. In one online interaction, Shrem tried to assure Faiella he was being . discreet. ‘The art of hiding . is making people think you are someone else,’ he wrote. Faiella . replied: ‘You must understand that the people that we pay taxes to have a . long reach and I like to stay away from that.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Charlie Shrem, 24, was arrested at New York's JFK airport on Sunday .

"Bodybuilder Luke Artis, 21, hit his girlfriend Tina Gillian, 41, at least six times with a baseball bat because she asked for money towards their anniversary dinner . A bodybuilder has been jailed for launching a brutal baseball bat attack on his  partner after she asked him for a contribution to their anniversary meal. Luke Artis, 21, lashed out at Tina Gillian in her bedroom - breaking her elbow and finger, and giving her a black eye and bruising to her legs, ribs and back. Bradford Crown Court heard how Ms Gillian asked Artis if he was going to contribute to the meal and he replied: 'You're only bothered about money.' Artis had drunk approximately eight . pints on the night and had taken painkillers when he retrieved the . baseball bat had hit his 41-year-old girlfriend around the head and . body. Prosecutor . Robert Galley said Ms Gillian required five stitches following the blow . to the head and was hit five times around the body. She was forced to . curl up into ball to protect herself as the attack continued. The . court heard that Ms Gillian of Queensbury, West Yorkshire needed her . elbow wired and suffered from sleepless nights, anxiety and flashbacks . following her ordeal. In a victim impact statement to the court, Ms Gililan siad she felt like a 'shell of her former self'. Artis told police that he had 'flipped' and described the incident as 'a flash of rage'. He pleaded guilty to one count of causing wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Defence solicitor Nadim Bashir said before the incident there had been no previous hint of violence and said the relationship had its ups and downs. He said the attack was a result of a sudden loss of control which caused 'the red mist' to descend on his client. Mr Bashir said Artis acknowledged that it was Ms Gillian's request for money towards their anniversary meal was the catalyst for the violent outburst. He said accepted he was facing a  lengthy prison sentence following the attack. Judge Jonathan Rose jailed Artis for six years and eight months and placed a lifetime restraining order on the bodybuilder prohibiting him from contacting Ms Gillian again. Judge Rose dismissed any suggestion that Ms Gillian bore any responsibility for the attack and rejected that the victim had broken her own arm after Artis had left the house. He said: 'For you to suggest after pleading guilty that the victim of this brutal crime caused one of the most serious injuries herself is truly unforgivable and demonstrates, far from you being remorseful for what you have done, you are more concerned with the outcome for yourself.' Bradford Crown Court heard that Artis tried to blame Ms Gillian for breaking her own arm after he beat her with a baseball bat . The judge accepted that Miss Gillian may have been kicking out at Artis as he continued the attack, but he added: 'Perhaps she was (kicking you). So desperate was she to save her own life because what you did that night could so easily have killed her. 'This court will never accept the use of violence by a man against a woman in any way, shape or form. That is the starting point. 'The use of a weapon against a woman takes this into a whole different league. You know that this was, putting it very shortly, unprovoked, vicious, brutal, sustained and wholly without a shred of justification whatsoever There is no blame on her. There is only blame on you.' Inspector Pam Pills of Bradford District Safeguarding Unit praised Ms Gilliam for reporting the crime. She said: 'Artis  viciously assaulted his victim, causing a number of serious injuries to her  which required hospital treatment. 'We would like to thank the victim for her courage in coming forward, and we  hope the sentence passed down today will help to give her some comfort. 'We would also like to encourage those suffering from domestic abuse to come forward and report it to the police, either by calling 101 or to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

'It was cool to have a moment where I was making a sitting president laugh — over something that might be considered inappropriate is a bonus,' he said. The president had just cut the line at Franklin Barbecue, while in town to raise money for the Democratic Party. Lives at the eatery are infamously long, and have been known to stretch as long as three hours wait. But Mr Obama did no waiting today, as he showed up at the restaurant, shook a few hands and made his way straight to the register to order more than $300 worth of meat. 'I know this is a long line.

And to the president's credit, he did pay for the order of a local father and daughter who were directly in front of him. While the restaurant seemed more focused on getting to see the president than they were on the fact that he cut them in line, others on Twitter were not as enthused about the president's line manners. 'No, no, no President Obama, You wait in line for 3 hours at Franklin's BBQ like everyone else!' a user named Kelly wrote.

If the preference is for politics then it won’t be solved.' Obama visited Texas for the first time since the influx of child migrants from Central America overwhelmed border resources. He had talks with Perry aboard his Marine One helicopter and in a group meeting with local officials that Obama called constructive. In a brief news conference after the meeting, Obama dismissed criticism from Perry, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, that he should personally visit the border region for a first-hand look. Ridicule: President Obama ridiculed congressional Republicans on Thursday in Austin, accusing them of doing little more than opposing his agenda in a campaign-style rally with less than four months remaining before midterm elections . 'This isn’t theater. This is a problem. I’m not interested in photo ops. I’m interested in solving a problem,' he said. The president, on a three-day trip out of Washington, is spending much time raising money for Democratic congressional candidates, leading to criticism that he should spend some time visiting the border. Obama said he is getting plenty of information from top advisers who are visiting the area. 'There’s nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on,' he said.

"A California medical student is facing felony theft charges after allegedly stealing the iPad of a dying cancer patient. Natalie Packer was a patient at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center being treated for an aggressive form of breast cancer when she went into cardiac arrest. Only after the chaos of the Code Blue response and attempts to revive her did Packer's family notice that the iPad that had been her source of entertainment and communication had disappeared. Virginia Nguyen has since pled not guilty to petty theft, grand theft of lost property, and computer access and fraud . The loss was especially wounding to her family, as Packer had used the iPad to write personal messages and information meant for sister Nicole. The iPad wasn't missing for long. Shortly after Natalie's death, the family used the device's finder app and saw the iPad was still somewhere in the Medical Center - except that the registration had been changed from 'Natalie's iPad' to 'Virginia's iPad.' The family contacted police, and a search warrant issued to Apple for the reregistration information revealed the iPad was in the hands of Virginia Nguyen, 32, a third-year med student, NBC Los Angeles. She was arrested on the campus in March and hit with criminal charges this July. Nguyen has since pled not guilty to petty theft, grand theft of lost property, and computer access and fraud. Cancer victim Natalie Packer's iPad went missing when she went into cardiac arrest, but uncle Sam Heller said an app to find the device revealed it had been re-registered to Virginia Nguyen . Nguyen told police that she only picked up the iPad because she had mistaken it for her own. 'If you analyze it, it's a pretty lame defense,' said uncle Sam Heller. Heller insists his niece was the kind of woman who would have offered the iPad as a gift if she knew someone wanted it so much and said he cannot understand why anyone would jeopardize their medical career over it. A felony conviction in the case could severely damage Nguyen's future in medicine said Cassandra Hockenson, a spokesperson for the California Medical Board. The accused has declined to respond to interview requests.

"Art often confronts questions of life, death and the human condition. Now one introspective painter has delved even further into existential themes. He creates each of his works entirely from his own blood. Scroll down for video . Strange themes: Vincent Castiglia sees his methods as putting 'psychic energy' into each piece. Pictured, Beautiful Vivisection . Portrait of the artist: Castiglia extracts his blood in his studio and then uses it to paint the unsettling scarlet designs . Vincent Castiglia, from New York, insists that the content of his work - surrealistic human bodies in various stages of decay - overshadows the strange medium. The tattooed 30-year-old describes his figures as being painted with 'what could be described as ""liquid flesh""'. He says that the iron oxide in human blood is a pigment common in paint, and also found naturally in rust and iron ore. His first experiments with using his blood as paint were prompted by a 'need to connect with his work on the most intimate level', but he insists the methods are not gimmicky. Underground sensation: The tattooed 30-year-old has created art for heavy metal band albums and MTV slasher film Savage County . Oxidised: Castiglia's macabre paintings can fetch up to $26,000 a time.

'In order for something to be a gimmick, it really . would have to lack substance.' Castiglia's website says he 'practises a kind of modern-day phlebotomy [blood-letting]... siphoning the life force which contains his own psychic energy, while giving it an outlet and form [and dissolving] the barrier between artist and art.' He sketches out his pieces in graphite or pen, before extracting his blood in the studio and completing his scarlet artworks.

"More than one in ten police officers are set to lose their jobs as a result of spending cuts, a report warned last night. By 2015 numbers in England and Wales are expected to fall to 127,600, their lowest level since 2001 and a fall of 16,000, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said. The report indicated that the reduction could fuel a sharp rise in crime, especially property thefts. Axe: About 16,200 police officers will be axed by 2015 amid fears crime could go up by three per cent . In a second blow for the Government, the watchdog also warned that locking up fewer offenders would lead to higher crime. The report is the first authoritative study of the impact of cuts of 20 per cent in Home Office funding for the police. Labour accused the Government of taking an 'irresponsible gamble with crime and public safety'. However, ministers continued to insist that cuts could be made without affecting the quality of front-line services, through efficiency savings. The 'Adapting to Austerity' report - based on force predictions - said that between March 2010 and March 2015, the total police workforce including backroom staff, will fall by 34,000 from 243,900, a cut of 11 per cent. Of those, 16,200 will be police officers, 16,100 will be police staff and 1,800 community support officers. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, has put chief constables up and down the country in an impossible position.' Three out of four employers plan to increase their workforce over the next few months, showing that business confidence is on the rise, according to new research today . A survey of 600 employers by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), also showed that redundancies, headcount freezes and reduced working hours were all 'significantly' down . Most of those polled said they would look to increase or maintain their use of agency staff over the next year . Roger Tweedy, the REC's director of research, said: 'It is too early to predict whether this will translate into significant jobs growth by the end of the year but we remain confident that the private sector can absorb the fall-out from public sector cuts. The reduction in paid officers will . in part be offset by rises in unpaid Special Constables. Their numbers . will increase by more than 7,000 to 22,600. A review of academic research . published by HMIC on how police cuts influence crime found a ten per . cent fall in officers could lead to crime, especially property theft, . rising by around three per cent. Such a rise in burglary would mean 22,000 more victims every year. Currently a burglary  is committed . every 40 seconds. The report’s author, Roger Baker, said the police . were facing their biggest financial challenge in a generation. He said how police chiefs deployed their staff was a key factor in dealing with crime. And he added: ‘Forgive the very . old-fashioned view, [but] if you lock up criminals it tends to have a . very good effect in your local communities because they are not causing . you harm and distress.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the report made it clear there are huge savings to be made in bureaucracy. Scotland Yard is due to lose 3,111 staff, including 1,907 officers, figures obtained by Ken Livingstone said . The report does not account for any . cuts in police pay proposed by former rail regulator Tom Winsor, nor in . savings made by police in other areas such as how they buy goods. Mr Clegg added: ‘There are far, far . too many police officers who are filling in forms or tied down to their . desks when they are not out in the community where they belong.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . said: ‘Many forces have no choice but to cut front-line officers because . of the scale and pace of the Government cuts. ‘Theresa May has put chief constables . in an impossible position. Crime fell for many years under Labour, but . people want it to fall further. ‘Right now the Government has no plan to cut crime, they are only cutting officers instead.’","16,200 bobbies in England and Wales to go .

"Sales of electronic cigarettes, labelled as a ‘healthy’ alternative to smoking, have risen tenfold in the last year, as celebrities help make puffing away ‘cool’ again. Star endorsements of the devices have been credited as one of the factors behind new figures showing an increase in sales from £9million in 2012 to £90million in 2013.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby joked that the English had ill-treated the Scots for 800 years but his comments could inflame the Scottish independence debate . The Archbishop of Canterbury has risked inflaming the debate over Scottish independence by saying the English had mistreated the Scots for centuries. The Most Reverend Justin Welby painted Scotland as a victim of English oppression and claimed Scottish people were reluctant to work alongside their southern neighbours. While his remarks appear to have been intended as a light-hearted aside, they run the risk of being seized upon by nationalists in the run-up to the independence referendum in September next year. Mr Welby was speaking in Iceland about his scheme to challenge payday loan companies with low-interest, co-operative credit unions. ‘It is such a powerful movement that we are even working with the Scots about it,’ he told a cathedral congregation in Reykjavik. ‘And there is a miracle. It takes a lot to make the Scots willing to work with the English. Understandably... we have spent about 800 years ill-treating them.’ The suggestion by a figure at the heart of the English establishment that Scots are victims could be ripe for exploitation. Disputed or glamorised portrayals of historic events and figures - from William Wallace, the battles of Flodden Field and Culloden to Mrs Thatcher’s poll tax - have played a major role in the growth of nationalism in Scotland over the past two decades. The 13th century figure of Wallace was mythologised into a nationalist hero by the 1990s Hollywood film Braveheart. Mr Welby’s sermon comes at a time when some pro-independence leaders are stepping up their rhetoric as a referendum tactic. Last week Blair Jenkins, head of the cross-party independence group Yes Scotland, gave a speech in which he condemned ‘the corrosive and cynical world of Westminster’, ‘warmongers and job-cutters’, ‘asset strippers and mortgage flippers’ and ‘welfare bashers and bedroom taxers’. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond is leading a campaign to break Scotland away from the United Kingdom in a vote on independence in September 2014 . Yesterday a spokesman for the Scottish National Party said: ‘While we recognise Justin Welby’s comment as the humorous remark it is intended to be, we want Scotland to work positively with our neighbours as equal partners on a range of issues – a status that only a yes vote next year will secure.’ Mr Welby delivered his speech last week, but the release of its controversial contents was held back by Lambeth Palace officials until after the christening of Prince George. In the sermon, he repeated his previous attacks on payday loan companies like Wonga, which he has accused of being guilty of ‘usury’ – a ‘sin since Moses’. He defended his claims that people could end up owing thousands of pounds for loans at annual interest rates of up to 5,500 per cent, saying the publicity his remarks received has given huge impetus to calls for reform. Mr Welby said: ‘It was an accident in which God was involved. The SNP said that, while they recognised Welby's comment was intended as a humorous remark, working well with England meant breaking up the historic union . ‘It has created such momentum that there is a great new movement to change the way we do community finance.’ The Archbishop also referred to the Icelandic banking scandal, when three major lenders collapsed in the autumn of 2008, taking with them billions of pounds of international investors’ money. He compared it with the impact of recession in Britain. ‘Lest we look at the world and sneer, let us sometimes remember our own faults,’ the Archbishop said. ‘In Iceland there is the pain of the crash which took place five years ago. ‘In every diocese in England churches take part in food banks, in a society which has no need for such imbalances of wealth. ‘On the richest continent on Earth we cannot devise an economic system that provides for the poor and yet forces the wealthy and the powerful to share equally the burdens of debt, and the heritage of materialism gone mad.’","Archbishop of Canterbury speaking in Iceland about payday lenders .

"Malik Obama, the president's Kenyan half brother, was photographed in 2010 at a public event in Yemen wearing a 'keffiyeh' – a special scarf – bearing two anti-Israel slogans of the terror group Hamas, it emerged today. 'Jerusalem is ours – WE ARE COMING,' reads one saying. 'From the river to the sea,' says the other statement. That rallying cry refers to Palestinian militants' belief that the territory representing Israel, with the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, rightfully belongs to them – and Israel should not exist. During a 2010 event in Yemen, President Obama's half-brother Malik wore this Hamas keffiyeh featuring the slogans 'Jerusalem is ours -- WE ARE COMING!' and 'From the River to the Sea' Malik Obama was the best man at the 1992 wedding of Barack and Michelle Obama . The photo appears on the website . of the Barack H. Obama Foundation, a group that Malik founded and . manages, despite its lack of a connection with he U.S. president. The . name in the organization's title refers to the president's father, the . parent whom the two men share in common. Malik . Obama also serves as the executive secretary of the Islamic Da'wa . Organization, a group created by the government of Sudan. While the White House has sought to distance President Obama from Malik and his other relations, the Kenyan told GQ in July 2013 that the two speak regularly. 'Of course we’re close!' he said. 'I'm the one who brought him here to Kogelo in 1988! I thought it was important for him to come home and see from whence his family came – you know, his roots.' Malik told MailOnline in March 2013 that his more famous half-brother is 'always at the end of a phone line if I want to talk. I last saw him on November 19 last year, shortly after the U.S. election. I went to the White House and offered him my congratulations'. The Barack H. Obama foundation made news in 2013 after the IRS was accused of delaying the tax-exemption applications of tea party groups and other conservative organizations because of their political beliefs in 2010 and 2011. But the Barack H. Obama Foundation saw its application approved in just 28 days. The final determination letter was signed by Lois Lerner, the former official forced to resign over the tea party scandal. Malik is a practicing Muslim, but his embrace of militant Islam, including Hamas – a U.S.-designated terrorist organization – is curious because he has expressed a desire to run for president in Kenya, a predominantly Christian nation. Malik Obama has been a visitor to his half-brother's Oval Office in the White House, and also appears to be a die-hard supporter of the Hamas terrorists . In 2004 when the president first ran for election to the U.S. Senate, his half-brother Malik showed off a photo of himself in Kenya with Barack Obama (L in photo) His first foray into politics ended badly when he was trounced in a regional governorship election in 2013, despite using a photograph of him and President Barack Obama in the Oval Office as his political calling card. But Malik Obama's connection to Hamas may not be the most colorful thing about him. The president's half-bother has had at least 12 wives and was accused of beating two of them. The 55-year-old's most recent spouse is a 19-year-old girl who quit her education to be with him, over her family's strenuous objections. Polygamy is legal in Kenya if it fits within a person's religious or cultural traditions. 'She decided she doesn't want to go back to school. She wants to get married now,' Malik said during a TV broadcast in 2010. 'She came here, and what am I supposed to do? So we are married.' The photo of Malik Obama wearing the Hamas scarf first appeared online on a blog run by Walid Shoebat, a former Muslim Brotherhood member who now calls himself a peace activist.","Malik Obama runs the Barack H.

"A Scottish livestock farmer has become an overnight literary sensation after selling more than 50,000 copies of his first detective novel in a month. James Oswald, 45, wrote Natural Causes, a crime thriller starring Detective Inspector McLean, while tending to his 350 cows and sheep at his farm in the Fife countryside. The tale, which centres around a series of brutal deaths in Edinburgh may not sound ground-breaking, but a combination of creative flair and clever marketing skills have helped make it a bestseller. Ploughing on: Livestock farmer James Oswald has become an overnight literary sensation with the success of his detective novel, Natural Causes, which he wrote while tending to his Highland cattle and New Zealand sheep . Into a new field:  A combination of creative flair and clever marketing has made Natural Causes an overnight success . At first James offered the novel on Amazon for free, but asked readers to pay £2.99 for the follow-up The Book of Souls. Sparkling debut: James Oswald's novel Natural Causes is a crime thriller set in Edinburgh . Within a month his debut had shifted 50,000 copies. It soared to the top of the Kindle bestsellers list where it remains in the top 10. Now James has been signed up by publishers Penguin for a three-book deal worth £150,000. Natural Causes is on the shelves in Waterstones and Tesco and has even been endorsed by Richard and Judy's Book Club. 'The last month has been a whirlwind,' James told MailOnline. 'I'm still trying to catch my breath. This has all happened incredibly quickly. I only self-published the . book about a year ago and I signed with Penguin in last October. 'Friends have been tweeting me saying the book has already sold out in some shops.' But there are no signs he will be giving up his day job - with his first advance, the amateur writer splashed out on a new tractor. James' overnight success has drawn comparisons with the meteoric rise of E.L.James and her Fifty Shades of Gray series. In . fact, he has been writing all his life, starting with comic strip books . while he was a psychology student at Aberdeen University. But . his efforts to replicate the dark, mystical workings of heroes Iain . Banks and Neil Gaiman failed to attract the attention of publishers. When James inherited his farm from his parents David and Juliet in 2008 after they died in a car accident from 2008, he became even more determined to make his writing a success. 'My father had semi-retired and I was thinking I would come to it eventually,' he told MailOnline. Hard days night: James juggles tending to his sheep and cattle with writing in the evening . 'But it has been rather harder work than I expected. I love writing - I would have carried on writing for years even if it had only been myself reading. 'I do a lot of thinking when I'm out in my tractor, or when I'm sitting in the lambing pens. I do the farm work that needs to be done in the daytime and then do my writing in the evening till about midnight. It is pretty tiring.' If his literary career continues to bring rich rewards he hopes to complete a three-bedroom house with partner Barbara and expand his flock of New Zealand sheep and Highland cattle. 'I would love to write more. I have a lot more ideas,' he added.","James Oswald's debut Natural Causes has been an overnight success .

"Sonar scans have shown that the mysterious object could be a huge Nazi anti-submarine weapon lost beneath the waves since World War II . Divers exploring a 'UFO-shaped' object in the Baltic sea say that the strange, curved object might be a Nazi device lost beneath the waves since the end of the Second World War. Sonar scans have shown that the device, raised 10ft above the seabed and measuring 200ft by 25ft, could be the base of an anti-submarine weapon. The weapon was built with wire mesh which could have baffled submarine radar, leading enemy craft to crash - much in the same way as turning out a lighthouse could be used as a weapon against shipping. But now former Swedish naval officer and WWII expert Anders Autellus has revealed that the structure - measuring 200ft by 25ft - could be the base of a device designed to block British and Russian submarine movements in the area. The huge steel-and-concrete structure could be one of the most important historical finds in years. Autellus claims it would have been built of double-skinned concrete and reinforced with wire mesh to baffle radar - which could explain why the dive team's equipment repeatedly failed near the mystery object. ‘The area was vital to the German war machine because most of the ball bearings for its tanks and trucks came from here. Without them the German army would have ground to a halt,’ explained one expert. ‘This device dwarfs anything ever found before and is an important weapons discovery,’ they added. Explorer Stefan Hogeborn - who is studying the images for the Ocean X diving team - agreed: ‘It is a good candidate for the answer to this mystery. The object lies directly underneath a shipping route.’ ‘It would be of enormous weight in steel and concrete. Other Nazi anti-sub anchoring devices were nowhere near as large,’ he added. While the Ocean Explorer team is . understandably excited about their potentially earth-shattering find, . others are slightly more sceptical and are questioning the accuracy of . the sonar technology. 'This device dwarfs anything ever found before and is an important weapons discovery,' said the dive team which discovered the strange structure . But now former Swedish naval officer and WWII expert Anders Autellus has revealed that the structure - measuring 200ft by 25ft - could be the base of a device designed to block British and Russian submarine movements in the area . Landing spot: The exact coordinates of the object have not been released, but it is confirmed to be somewhere at the bottom of the Botnia Gulf in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden . Swedish submarine officer, Anders Autellus says that the most likely explanation is that the object is a German submarine trap from the Second World War. These huge concrete structures were built to make navigation more difficult for Soviet submarines. Speaking to the Swedish newspaper Expressen, Autellus said that similar concrete structures had been built by the British during World War II.Autellus says it is likely that the object is built from double-skinned concrete for the purpose of holding large steel wire mesh structures, expected to disturb the propagation of radar and other signals used by any nearby submarines. During the decades after the war, the wire mesh structures would have eroded away, leaving only the holes shown on the images provided by Ocean X.Stefan Hogeborn, a member of the Ocean X research team states that Autellus' theory is a good candidate for the answer to the mystery. 'The object looks like as it has been formed by pouring, layer by layer. It is believable also because the object is located in the middle of a ship route'. These huge concrete structures were built to make navigation more difficult for Soviet submarines (pictured) The Swedish team exploring the structure have been plagued with problems.

Professional . diver Stefan Hogerborn, part of the Ocean X team which is exploring the . anomaly, said some of the team's cameras and the team's satellite phone . would refuse to work when directly above the object, and would only . work once they had sailed away.

Professional . diver Stefan Hogerborn, part of the Ocean X team which is exploring the . anomaly, said some of the team's cameras and the team's satellite phone . would refuse to work when directly above the object, and would only . work once they had sailed away. He is quoted as saying: 'Anything electric out there - and the . satellite phone as well - stopped working when we were above the object. 'And then we got away about 200 meters and it turned on again, and when we . got back over the object it didn’t work.' Hefty trajectory: The Swedish diving team noted a 985-foot flattened out 'runway' leading up to the object, implying that it skidded along the path before stopping but no true answers are clear . The team did get some pictures, such as these soot-covered rocks that encircled an egg-shaped hole which went into the object at its center, and have no idea what any of it means . No clarification: The divers made their sonar discovery public but waited a year to make the dive because they had to gather enough funding and base off of weather conditions . The sonar picture of the unidentified object resembles the famed Star Wars ship the Millennium Falcon . The object was first found in May last year, but because of a lack of funding and bad timing, they have . were not able to pull a team together to see for themselves - just the . strange, metallic outline, and a similar disk-shaped object about 200 . metres away. During their visit, the team saw a 985-foot trail that they described 'as a . runway or a downhill path that is flattened at the seabed with the . object at the end of it'. As it was before the recent dive, the . story behind the object is anyone's guess, from a 'plug to the inner . world' to the Millennium Falcon ship from Star Wars. In the past, such technology has confused foreign objects with unusual- but natural - rock formations. Part of the trouble they face, . however, is that they have no way of telling what is inside the supposed . cylinder- whether it is filled with gold and riches or simply aged . sediment particles. They're hoping for the former, and history seems to be in their favour. The Baltic Sea is a treasure trove for . shipwreck hunters, as an estimated 100,000 objects are thought to line . the cold sea's floor. The company have created a submarine . that they hope will appeal to tourists and wannabe shipwreck hunters who . will pay to take a trip down to the bottom of the Baltic Sea to see for . themselves. A further dive will take place in the coming weeks.

"At least 20 terror suspects have had their British passports torn up on national security grounds to stop them entering the country, it emerged today. In the last two years alone Home Secretary Theresa May has stripped British citizenship from 16 individuals considered to pose a threat to the UK. Rules in place for a decade allow ministers to act to revoke passports in a bid to target the so-called ‘enemy within’. Two men stripped of their British citizenship in 2010 - Bilal al-Berjawi and Mohamed Sak - had links to Somalia's al-Shabaab militant (pictured) The Home Office today defended the policy from claims it was equivalent to ‘medieval exile’, insisting the British citizenship was ‘a privilege not a right’. Officials said that from 2002 to September last year 20 citizens were stripped of their passports. A report by the Bureaux for Investigative Journalism, published in The Independent today, suggested the number is 21, of which only two have successfully appealed. At least five of the 16 to lose their citizenship under the coalition were born in Britain, the report said. One man had lived in the UK for five decades. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Citizenship is a privilege not a right. The Home Secretary has the power to remove citizenship from individuals where she considers it is conducive to the public good. An individual subject to deprivation can appeal to the courts.’ Home Secretary Theresa May, who has revoked 16 passports since 2010, insists British citizenship is a privilege not a right . However, concern has been expressed that after losing British citizenship suspects have been targeted, and in some cases killed, in US drone attacks. Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, is to write to Mrs May about the scale of the threat posed to Britain. ‘There was clearly always a risk when the law was changed seven years ago that the executive could act to take citizenship away in circumstances that were more frequent or more extensive than those envisaged by ministers at the time,’ Mr Hughes told The Independent. Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes is demanding the powers be reviewed . ‘I’m concerned at the growing number of people who appear to have lost their right to citizenship. I plan to write to the Home Secretary and the Home Affairs Select Committee to ask for their assessment of the situation, and for a review of whether the act is working as intended.’ Two men involved - Bilal al-Berjawi, a British-Lebanese citizen, and British-born friend Mohamed Sakr, who also held Egyptian nationality – travelled to Somalia in 2009. They are said to have become involved with Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, which has links to al-Qa’ida. Both rose to senior positions in the organisation. They were stripped of their British nationalities by Mrs May in 2010 and were killed in separate US airstrikes. Saghir Hussain, Sakr’s former UK solicitor said: ‘It appears that the process of deprivation of citizenship made it easier for the US to then designate Mr Sakr as an enemy combatant, to whom the UK owes no responsibility whatsoever.’ Gareth Peirce, a leading human rights lawyer, said the use of the powers ‘smacked of medieval exile, just as cruel and just as arbitrary’.

"Set aside the fact that our Queen is the Defender of the Christian Faith. Ignore the 26 Church of England bishops who sit in the House of Lords. Pay no attention to the 2011 Census that told us 33.2 million people in England and Wales describe themselves as Christians. For if you want a more telling insight into religion in the United Kingdom today, just look at these photographs. The story they tell is more revealing than any survey. The photo on the left shows St Mary's Church in Cable Street while the photo on the right shows worshippers gathered for Friday midday prayers outside a nearby mosque in Spitalfields, both in East London . What they show are three acts of worship performed in the East End of London within a few hundred yards of each other at the end of last month. Two of the photos show Sunday morning services in the churches of St George-in-the-East on Cannon Street Road, and St Mary’s on Cable Street. The third shows worshippers gathered for Friday midday prayers outside the nearby mosque on the Brune Street Estate in Spitalfields. The difference in numbers could hardly be more dramatic. At St George’s, some 12 people have congregated to celebrate Holy Communion. Empty pews: 18th-century parishioners crowded into St George-in-the-East hear John Wesley. Only 12 people attended the service . When the church was built in the early 18th century, it was designed to seat 1,230. Numbers are similar at St Mary’s, opened in October 1849. Then, it could boast a congregation of 1,000. Today, as shown in the picture, the worshippers total just 20. While the two churches are nearly empty, the Brune Street Estate mosque has a different problem — overcrowding. The mosque itself is little more than a small room rented in a  community centre, and it can hold only 100. However, on Fridays, those numbers swell to three to four times the room’s capacity, so the worshippers spill out onto the street, where they take up around the same amount of space as the size of the near-empty St Mary’s down the road. Dwindling flock: St Mary's Cable Street in East London was built to hold 1,000 people. Today, the congregation numbers around 20 . What these pictures suggest is that, on current trends, Christianity in this country is becoming a religion of the past, and Islam is one of the future. In the past ten years, there has been a decrease in people in England and Wales identifying as Christian, from 71.7 per cent to 59.3 per cent of the population. In the same period the number of Muslims in England and Wales has risen from 3 per cent of the population to 4.8 per cent — 2.7 million people. And Islam has age on its side. Whereas a half of British Muslims are under 25, almost a quarter of Christians are approaching their eighth decade. It is estimated that in just 20 years, there will be more active Muslims in this country than churchgoers — an idea which even half a century ago would have been utterly unthinkable. Many will conclude with a heavy heart that Christianity faces a permanent decline in Britain, its increasingly empty churches a monument to those centuries when the teachings of Christ governed the thoughts and deeds of the masses. A study in devotion: The tiny mosque on the Brune Street Estate, Spitalfields, holds only 100 people, so the local Bangladeshi community throng the street for Friday midday prayers . On Sunday October 1, 1738, St George’s was packed twice during the day to hear the great evangelist John Wesley, who then preached at the church for the following week explaining, as he put it, ‘the way of salvation to many who misunderstood what had been preached concerning it’. Today, there are no John Wesleys to fill up the pews. The church does its best, offering, for example, a monthly ‘Hot Potato Sunday’, during which the few congregants can discuss the  readings of the day over a baked potato. Canon Michael Ainsworth of St George’s puts on a brave face when he says: ‘What we are  saying now is it is not just a matter of numbers. It is about keeping faith with the city and hanging in there — being part of the community.’ At St Mary’s, meanwhile, Rev Peter McGeary cannot explain why the numbers are so low: ‘It’s impossible to say, there are so many variables.’ When he is asked if he tries to boost his congregations, he simply replies: ‘We are not a company, we are a church.’ In contrast, there seems a remarkable energy attached to the mosque on Brune Street, which has been described as the ‘Mecca of the City’. Here, come rain or shine, members of the  Bangladeshi community perform the Friday prayer of Jumma under the open sky. It is a communal act which will surely only grow in popularity. Sadly, that’s not something that can be said of the two nearby churches, and unless they can reinvigorate their congregations they may finally end up being deconsecrated. When that happens, such large buildings will be attractive spaces for those who can fill them. One day, in a few decades, St George’s may well again be packed with worshippers — but they will not be Christians.","Two photos show Sunday morning services in churches in East London .

"He has been investigated by police 40 times; has been accused of battery, car theft, boarding a plane with a loaded gun, and carrying drugs. German Bosque is likely one of the worst repeat offenders in Opa-Locka, Florida - and he's a police officer. Sgt Bosque, 48, who joined the force in 1993, has been arrested and jailed three times. He has been disciplined, suspended, fined and sent home on full pay more than any other officer operating in the state. Sgt German Bosque has been arrested and jailed three times and has been disciplined, suspended, fined and sent home on full pay more than any other officer operating in the state.

"Tensions between Russia and Japan have intensified after two Russian warplanes were allegedly spotted flying over Japanese territory. Japan scrambled its own fighter jets in response, claiming the Russian Su-37 planes had entered its air space off the northern tip of Hokkaido island in the South China Sea. Russia denied any border violation, but Japanese Defense Minister . Itsunori Onodera said that Tokyo will deal with yesterday's incident 'strictly, within the bounds of international law.' Japan released a picture of one of the Russian jets it claims made the incursion. Too close for comfort: This photo taken by the Japan Air Force apparently shows a Russian fighter jet SU-27 flying over the sea off the Japanese island of Hokkaido . Tension: Some fear Russia, under president Vladimir Putin (left) may be trying to test Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe (right), who has a reputation as a staunch nationalist . Rally: Silent prayers were offered during a national meeting in Tokyo - attended by Mr Abe - to demand the return of what Japan calls the Northern Territories, seized by Russia in the closing days of WWII . Disputed: The remote Kuril Islands are at the centre of a battle between Russi and Japan . Mr Onodera accused the Russian fighter jets of . intruding into Japanese air space, heightening regional tensions as . Beijing denied Tokyo's claims that Chinese naval vessels had locked . their weapons-targeting radar on to a Japanese destroyer last month. The alleged intrusion, which lasted just over a minute, happened when Japan was observing 'Northern Territories Day,' when it holds annual rallies urging Russia to return a series of islands off eastern Hokkaido captured at the end of World War II. The islands, called the Southern Kurils in Russia, are 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of where the incident took place. In Beijing meanwhile, China's Defense Ministry issued a statement denying Japanese claims that Chinese naval vessels had locked their radar on to a Japanese destroyer and helicopter in two instances last month in the East China Sea. Calls: Mr Abe delivers his speech during the annual rally which calls for the return of all four Russian-held islands North of Hokkaido in northern Japan, in Tokyo . Support: Some 2,000 people inclucing former residents of the Northern Territories attended the meeting . The countries are embroiled in a territorial spat over a cluster over tiny, uninhabited islands - called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese - in the vicinity that are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan. 'The Japanese so-called claims that the Chinese navy locked on to Japanese ships and aircraft with fire control radar are not factual,' the Chinese statement said. It also accused Japan of repeatedly fabricating reports to smear China over the normal training actions of its military and building China up into an international threat. 'The Chinese side wishes that the Japanese side take practical actions, cease creating a tense atmosphere in the East China Sea, and refrain from issuing irresponsible statements,' it said. Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida rejected Beijing's denial as 'completely unacceptable.' He told reporters that a thorough review of data by the Defense Ministry confirmed that the Chinese naval ship had locked on with its weapons targeting radar. Protest: Another supporter holds a placard reading 'Kuril Islands ours forever' as tensions over the disputed territory rises . The US Navy has said that Chinese . ships have in the past switched on their fire control radar as a . response to being hailed by US ships. Experts say this underlines the . need for better communication and coordination between navies. The . verbal back-and-forth comes amid the rise of China and to a lesser . extent Russia's re-emergence as a major power in Asia - but it does not . point to an imminent military conflict, said Narushige Michishita, a . security expert at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in . Tokyo. 'That's been . encouraging them to be more assertive and more active both on the . diplomatic front and military front in this region,' he said. China . and Russia may also be trying to test Japan's new prime minister, . Shinzo Abe, who has a reputation as a staunch nationalist and came to . office late last year pledging to defend Japan's sovereignty and to get . tough with its neighbours in territorial disputes. 'In the short run, this is happening I think partly in reaction to Mr Abe's return to office,' Mr Michishita said. While . a conflict between Japan and Russia is much less likely than with . China, Russia's alleged flight intrusion may be trying to send a signal . to Tokyo not to take them lightly, he said. That the incident took place on a day when Japan was demanding the return of Russian-controlled islands seems intentional, he added. Russian 'military operations and diplomatic intentions are pretty well coordinated,' he said. Photos of the Russian jets provided by Japan's military indicate that Japanese fighters got relatively close. When a Japanese fighter aircraft scrambles towards foreign aircraft, it usually maintains a 2,000 feet distance to avoid possible collisions, Mr Michishita said. Collisions can happen. In 2001, a Chinese fighter collided with a US Navy EP-3 flying about 60 miles from the southern Chinese island of Hainan. The Chinese jet crashed, killing the pilot, and the US plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan, where the 24 crew members were detained and interrogated by Chinese authorities.","Japan scrambles warplanes after 'Russian intrusion over its territory'

"Mystery: Authorities were awaiting DNA tests for final confirmation that they had the body of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez . Two Mexican government officials say a man . killed in an early morning shootout in western Mexico was the leader . of the Knights Templar Cartel who had been initially reported dead in 2010 by the government. Authorities were awaiting DNA tests for final confirmation that they had the body of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, said an official in the federal government and one with the Attorney General's Office. Both agreed to discuss the case only if not quoted by name because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation. Moreno's death would be one of the more bizarre twists in Mexico's assault on drug cartels, in which two others of the country's most powerful capos have been captured in the last year without a shot fired. One of the officials said Sunday's shootout happened near the farming hub of Apaztingan in the heart of western Michoacan state, where the Knights Templar have ruled through stealing, killing and extortion. Moreno, nicknamed 'The Craziest One,' would have turned 44 on Saturday, according to a government birthdate. Scroll down for video . Lawless drug war: Members of the community police, acting in this case as vigilantes, patrol on a highway near the village of Paracuaro in Michoacan state, January 5, 2014 . He led the La Familia cartel when he supposedly perished in a two-day gunbattle with federal police in December 2010 in Michoacan, his home state. No corpse was found then, however. The government of then-President Felipe Calderon officially declared him dead, saying it had proof, but some residents of Michoacan had reported seeing Moreno since then. Since the earlier death report, his former cartel, La Familia Michoacana, morphed into the more vicious and powerful Knights Templar. The cartel under both names preached Moreno's quasi-religious doctrine and moral code even as it became a major trafficker of methamphetamine to the U.S. When federal Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam was recently asked about the rumor that Moreno was still alive, he said: . 'We can't confirm or deny it officially as long as we have no concrete evidence, and I can tell you that we have nothing.' Power: Two former ""punteros"" (informants) of the Templar Knights drug cartel pose during an interview with AFP at la Nopalera community, Michoacan state, Mexico, on February 15, 2014 . After the 2010 death report, Moreno reportedly helped build himself up as folk hero, erecting shrines to himself and to the Knights Templar, which adopted the Maltese cross as a symbol. The hunt for him spiked last year as vigilantes, tired of the cartel's control of the state and government inaction, took up arms against the Knights Templar, saying they wanted to get the cartel kingpins. All of the civilian 'self-defense' group leaders said Moreno was alive. His reported killing comes on the heels of the February 22 capture of Mexico's most powerful drug lord, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, who surrendered peacefully after 13 years on the run when marines raided his condo in the Pacific resort city of Mazatlan. Another other top drug capo, Zetas chief Miguel Angel Trevino, was captured last summer, also by the Mexican navy's elite troops. Though Guzman's capture leaked to the press, Mexican authorities waited several hours before announcing it so they could solidly confirm they held the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Mexico's largest. They later gave a detailed explanation of how they fingerprinted him and measured his facial features against photographs as well as analyzed genetic markers from a DNA swab.","Mexican government officials are trying to determine if a man killed Sunday in an early morning shootout in western Mexico was a leader of the Knights Templar Cartel who had been reported dead in 2010 .

"One is the pampered wife of a financially-drained country's unpopular head of state... and the other is Marie Antoinette, or so the joke goes. But, according to right-wing bloggers, the notional similarities between First Lady Michelle Obama and the hated Queen of France did not go far enough. So to stress the point, one website has grafted Mrs Obama's face on to the famous 1775 portrait by Jean-Baptiste André Gautier-Dagoty. A few tweaks have been made, including exposing one of the President's wife's famously toned arms and having her pointing to a location on the globe rather than just resting her hand on top. Caricature: A right-wing blog site has featured an image of First Lady Michelle Obama as Marie Antoinette and, right, the original 1775 portrait by Jean-Baptiste André Gautier-Dagoty . Above the caricatured image, posted on the Gateway Pundit blog, is the caption: 'Choosing the next vacation' - highlighting criticism that Mrs Obama's recent trips to Hawaii and Spain were tax-funded. A similar image has Barack Obama's face cut over that of Louis XVI, with a caption 'you should be thanking Me' above it. That image also appeared last year. However, despite the seemingly innocuous historical comparison between one famous First Couple and another, a row has now erupted over whether the depiction of Mrs Obama was racist. Christopher Knight, writing for the LA Times, described Mrs Obama's caricature as 'baldly racist'. He wrote: 'The caricature of Obama as a profligate queen relies on the racist stereotype of an ""uppity Negro"", which emerged among slave masters in an earlier American era. 'Obama, born into a working-class Chicago family whose roots are traced to the pre-Civil War South, graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, prior to holding several high-level positions in the academic and private sectors.' 'Profligate?': The U.S. President has also been depicted as Louis XVI, husband of Marie Antoinette, with a caption 'You should be thanking Me' Blogger Jim Hoft placed the picture on Gateway Pundit along with a reference to Mrs Obama's guest appearance on Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly. On the show, she praises the cast for their support of military families and she is mistakenly referred to as 'your excellency', to which she jokingly replies: 'I kinda like it.' The image is believed to originate from another right-wing website, Instapundit, where it first appeared in 2010. The First Lady has been criticised after taking high-profile holidays abroad which required a heavy security detail. In December, she and her husband, along with their children, took a $4million vacation on Hawaii which saw large parts of Kailua cordoned off for security reasons. And in 2010, Mrs Obama provoked anger in the U.S. after going on vacation with her two daughters, Malia and Sasha, in Spain. Vacation: President Obama, the First Lady and their daughters Malia and Sasha spent Christmas in Hawaii, with critics attacking the $4million cost . The U.S. President came under fire over the preparations for his 50th birthday celebrations - including a private dinner for which couples were charged up to $35,800. But critics have attacked the LA Times blog and denied that the doctored image is racist. Cost: Michelle Obama took her daughters on holiday to the south of Spain in 2010 - a move criticised in the U.S. because of the cost of the necessary security detail . A blog on www.bookwormroom.com said: 'Is it possible that you're unaware of Marie Antoinette's reputation for living extravagantly while the ordinary people around her starved in the street? 'And are you unable to make the connection between Marie Antoinette's reputation (and she was Austrian, by the way, not African American) and the fact that Michelle Obama just recently went on a $4million tax payer funded vacation, while wearing $1,200 sundresses, even as Americans have been struggling desperately with unemployment and rising prices? 'For the informed mind (or just the living mind), the comparisons are inevitable, appropriate and non-racist.' The full length painting of Marie Antoinette hangs in the Palace of Versailles, France.

She is said to have proclaimed 'Let them eat cake' when told that starving peasants had no bread, although historians have found no proof that she actually said this. She was executed by guillotine in 1793 after the French Revolution abolished the monarchy. Her husband also enjoyed initial popularity, but his hesitancy to act on economic downturns and apparent ties to America saw him lose that appeal. His decision to flee with his family to Varennes undermined his credibility and he was also executed in 1793.","Face and arms of First Lady grafted onto 1775 portrait of French Queen .

"If this was a different era, Robin van Persie might be reaching for the hair dye, but it’s not so easy to pull wool over the eyes when it comes to age and decline these days. Not in the time of statistics. As a device they are overused, as vividly explained by Fatih Terim, the inimitable manager of Turkey, who tends to say: ‘Statistics are like mini-skirts - they don't reveal everything.’ But what they verify in this instance is the first-hand impressions of a sublime player on the slide. At 31 years old, the other numbers in this equation are not looking nearly as convincing as they once did. Robin van Persie has come in for some criticism following a drop in form for Manchester United this season . Van Persie (right) jokes with his Manchester United team-mates in training at Carrington on Friday . A struggling Van Persie gets a shellacking from the Arsenal supporters as he struggles to stamp his authority . More than that, the statistics drawn from each of the 2012-13, 13-14 and 14-15 seasons, hint broadly at decline across a range of significant indicators. A striker who seemed indispensable when reunited with Louis van Gaal in the summer suddenly seems out of place and ineffective in Manchester United’s frontline. With Radamel Falcao back in training and apparently fit, how much longer will he hold down a place? Van Persie's touch map against Arsenal . Beyond immediate selection decisions, how much longer will he be wanted at the club? Inter Milan are keen to welcome him to the slower realm of Serie A next summer, when The Dutchman will have a year remaining on his £250,000-a-week contract and could go for £10m. With a £10m loyalty bonus also believed to exist in his contract, United will have extra incentive to sell a striker who only two seasons ago was the difference between success and failure in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final campaign. It seems like a stark fall, but the statistic that showed he only touched the ball 13 times in the win over Arsenal is not alone in suggesting the effects of time and injuries on his game. The basic frontline numbers do only some of the damage, showing he has scored just three Premier League goals in 11 games and has contributed no assists. Last season those numbers were 12 and three and in 2012-13 he managed 26 and nine. As Tottenham goalkeeper Michel Vorm, a Holland team-mate, told Sportsmail last season: ‘I have never seen a player with such a versatile game. He is a complete team player – so much more than goals.’ That has rarely looked the case this season. But the numbers of greater concern show that over the past three seasons focus on the rate at which he produces. Whereas in 2012-13 he scored every 120 minutes on average and a season later was managing one goal every 132 minutes, that rate has slipped to a strike every 307 minutes. Van Persie cuts a dejected figure on the Emirates pitch as he manages just two touches in the first half . Van Persie's form has been in rapid decline this season, as the forward moves further into his 30s . Radamel Falcao is back in training with Manchester United after consistent injury problems . VIDEO Van Persie could be sold . In 2012-13, that ratio of goals per minute was the fourth best in the division among players who scored 10 or more. In 2013-14, he was fifth for the same criteria. This season, of players who have scored three or more, he ranks 37th out of 39, with only Raheem Sterling and Morgan Schneiderlin behind him. An assist used to come every 347 minutes under Ferguson and every 528 last season. There have been none in the Premier League under Van Gaal. Louis van Gaal has seen his side struggle in front of goal - despite scoring twice at Arsenal on Saturday . Van Persie (right) chats with his manager Van Gaal during a training session at Carrington on Friday . And having managed an average of 3.4 shots per game in 2012-13 and 2.61 last season, it is now down to 2.15. His shots on target have followed the same pattern, as have his touches, which went from an average of 47.5 per game in Ferguson’s final season to 32.67 in this campaign. Of the indicators studied, only Van Persie’s shooting accuracy of 59 per cent this season is better now than it was in his first United season. It’s a long way removed the influence Van Persie used to hold over this division. Is it the end? Are such predictions premature? The next few months will offer more detailed and anecdotal clues, but the numbers currently don’t make pleasant reading. Head here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Forget Peter Piper and his Peck of Pickled Pepper - psychologists have come up with what may be the world's most frustrating tongue twister. It may not make much sense, but the phrase 'pad kid poured curd pulled cold' completely defeated volunteers taking part in a U.S. speech study. Asked to repeat the phrase 10 times at a fast lick, many of the participants clammed up and stopped talking altogether, according to lead researcher Dr Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. MIT researchers in Boston found that certain combinations of sounds appear to make people lose control of their mouth. Often, one sound seems to replace another. For instance, 'toy boat' becomes 'toy boyt' and 'top cop' becomes 'cop cop' 'If anyone can say this 10 times quickly, they get a prize,' she said. The tongue twister study, presented at the annual meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in San Francisco, was conducted to shed light on the brain's speech-planning processes. 'When things go wrong, that can tell you something about how the typical, error-free operation should go,' said Dr Shattuck-Hufnagel. Spoken too quickly, certain combinations of sounds appear to make people lose control of their mouths. Often, one sound seems to replace another. For instance, 'toy boat' becomes 'toy boyt' and 'top cop' becomes 'cop cop'. Psychologists have come up with what may be the world's most frustrating tongue twister. It may not make much sense, but the phrase 'pad kid poured curd pulled cold' completely defeated volunteers taking part in a U.S. speech study . Researchers recorded misspoken sounds and analysed them  to find  mistakes could be subtle . But when the researchers recorded misspoken sounds and analysed them they found that the mistakes could be more subtle. At least some of the time, tongue twister mix-ups were not one sound or another, but appeared to be something in between. In the 'top cop' example, sometimes the 't' and 'c' seemed to arrive at almost the same time ('t'kop') and sometimes there was a delay between the two sounds with space for a vowel ('tah-kop'). The scientists studied two categories of tongue twister, simple lists of paired words, such as 'top cop' and whole sentences. They found that in the word list tongue twisters there was a preponderance of 't'kop' type errors. In contrast, sentences produced more 'tah-kop' mistakes that included a short vowel after the initial consonant. One possible clue to what is happening may be the regular rhythm of the word lists compared with the more irregular timing of the sentences, said Dr Shattuck-Hufnagel. But there appeared to be some overlap in the processes used to produce both types of speech. The MIT team, working with colleagues in Germany, has already collected data from the next stage of the research, which involved placing tiny transducers on volunteers' tongues to measure their articulation.","MIT researchers in Boston found that certain combinations of sounds appear to make people lose control of their mouths .
They asked volunteers to say 'pad kid poured curd pulled cold' repeatedly, which defeated most people taking part in the experiment .

"A pastor at Attleborough Baptist Church in Norfolk, was spoken . to by police after this poster appeared on the church's notice board . A baptist church was at the centre of a police probe after a sign which suggested non-Christians would 'burn in hell' was investigated as a 'hate incident'. The offending sign at Attleborough Baptist Church in Norfolk, pictured burning flames below words which read: 'If you think there is no God you better be right!!'. Now the church has been forced to remove the sign after a passer-by complained to police that it could 'not be further' from the Christian phrase, love thy neighbour. Robert Gladwin, 20, said: 'It is my basic understanding that Christianity is inclusive and loving in nature. 'The message being displayed outside of the church could not be further from the often uttered phrase ‘love thy neighbour’.' Mr Gladwin said he was 'astounded' when he spotted the poster by chance as he was walking home. He said: 'I was just astounded really. We live in the 21st century and they have put that message - that non-Christians will burn in hell - up to try and scare people into joining their mentality.' The strongly-worded sign - which was put up next to a notice board which promises that visitors 'can always be sure of a very warm welcome' - was taken down by Pastor John Rose, 69, after police launched an investigation into the complaint. Mr Rose said he 'regretted' how the poster could have been interpreted. He said: 'Attleborough Baptist Church offers a variety of ways in which people are able to engage with the Christian message. 'Jesus encourages us to love God and to love our neighbour and we therefore regret that the poster has been seen as inciting hatred. 'Indeed, we want to assure all members of our local community that they would be made to feel very welcome at any of the church's activities.' Mr Rose said he changed the posters on his notice board every two weeks. The poster has now been replaced by . another one with the message : 'God loves you!' and a picture of a . meerkat and a speech bubble saying: 'Simples'. Robert Gladwin, 20, complained to police about the poster after saying . it suggested non-Christians would 'burn in hell'. He said the poster . 'could not be further away from the often uttered phrase 'love thy . neighbour' But despite the sign now being removed, it has still caused controversy in the church's local area. Chris Copsey, from Norfolk Humanists, branded the sign 'pernicious nonsense'. He said: 'I believe the people of Attleborough have more common sense than to give this sign any credence.' Terry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society, also defended the church and said police involvement was the equivalent of 'banning the Bible'. He said: 'Personally I don’t find it offensive. But we did fight a long battle of freedom of speech together with Christian groups because we believe that freedom of speech is essential to a functioning society. The church has now taken down the poster after being spoken to by police . 'If you don’t give free speech to everybody then it isn’t free speech and as long as they aren’t inciting violence then I think it is acceptable to say whatever you want to say.' But the Reverand Simon Ward, of the Diocese of Norwich, said: 'I guess they are trying to open a conversation and cause people to think. 'However, I think there are more positive conversations that you could have and more positive reasons for coming to church.' A Norfolk police spokesman said: 'Norfolk Constabulary received a report regarding a poster outside a church in Attleborough which was deemed offensive by the complainant. 'National guidance required us to investigate the circumstances and the matter has been recorded as a hate incident. 'Having spoken to the pastor of the church, it has been agreed the poster will be taken down.' The controversy has echoes of a freedom of speech debate sparked in January 2009, after the British Humanist Association launched an anti-religion advertising campaign on London buses. The campaign was made up of posters disputing the existence of god, which read: 'There’s probably no god. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.' The campaign was originally intended for buses in London, but the appeal spread across the country because it became so popular.","Poster with burning flames put up at Attleborough Baptist Church, Norfolk .

"Edgar Tamayo was convicted of the January 3, 1994 shooting death of Houston police officer Guy Gaddis and and was executed last month in Texas . Thousands of mourners poured out to see the burial of the Mexican man put to death by lethal injection in Texas last month, a move that has sparked diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and the central American state. Friends and relatives carried the coffin of Mexican Edgar Tamayo to the cemetery in his home town of Miacatlan, Morelos state, amid an outpouring of grief from local residents. The 46-year-old Mexican was controversially executed in Texas less than two weeks ago for the killing of a Houston police officer in 1994, despite outrage from human rights groups and last minute appeals from his lawyers for clemency on the grounds that Tamayo was mentally disabled. The case saw the unusual intervention of the U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, who had repeatedly urged the Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott to delay Tamayo's punishment, saying it 'could impact the way American citizens are treated in other countries.' Abbott and the Harris County district attorney opposed postponing what was the first execution this year in the ultra-conservative American state. Some 16 people were executed in Texas in 2013. The Mexican government also sharply criticized the decision, saying failure to review Tamayo's case and reconsider his sentence would be 'a clear violation by the United States of its international obligations'. Tamayo was found guilty of shooting 24-year-old Houston policeman Guy Gaddis 20 years ago. Tamayo’s lawyers, the Mexican government and rights groups all say Tamayo was denied a fair trial because he failed to receive consular help, something which they say broke international law and could have helped him avoid the death sentence.

Legal assistance guaranteed under the Vienna Convention could have uncovered evidence to contest the capital murder charge or provide evidence to keep Tamayo off death row, they said. His lawyers also argue that Texas governor Rick Perry and Abbott reneged on a promise to review Tamayo’s case as ordered by the International Court of Justice in 2004. Tamayo's attorneys previously appealed to a federal court in Austin, Texas, for an injunction against  Perry and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which he appoints. The board could have recommended Perry grant clemency, but it's an action they rarely take. A judge rejected that lawsuit last month.","Thousands line streets of Mexican city for burial of Edgar Tamayo .

"Police in West Texas say they have solved the murder of a highly-decorated U.S. Army officer in a case that has remained cold for 36 years. On Thursday investigators arrested the estranged wife and stepson of Major Chester Garrett, who was found dead in the back of his Volkswagen Beetle in 1977. Officials have charged Lisbeth Garrett, 74, and Roger Garrett, 54, with killing the military hero, who was 36 when he died. Police say the case was reopened after new information was received in 2006, leads that led to these arrests. Special Forces hero: Major Chester Garrett was commended for his bravery in the Vietnam War before being found dead in his car in 1977. 36 years later his wife and stepson have been charged with his murder . Roger Garrett, 54, left, and Lisbeth Garrett, 74, have been charged with the murder of the Vietnam hero, 36 years after he died . Major Garrett's bloody body was found in the back seat of his 1972 Volkswagen by a passing motorist in the desert east of El Paso in January 1977. Investigators say he'd been stabbed 10 times but died of a skull fracture. Local police discovered footprints and vehicle tracks near the car but authorities weren't able to pursue any leads and the case went gradually cold. Garrett was in the U.S Army Special Forces, served four tours in Vietnam and was commended for 'extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty' for his actions during the Vietnam War. 'From what we've learned, the man was real tough - a Special Forces type, almost what you'd call a superman,' a sheriff told reporters in 1977, as reported by the El Paso Times. 'Whoever got him must have been mighty tough, too, and probably more than one, and probably took him by surprise.' Major Garrett was executive officer of the student battalion at the Fort Bliss Air Defense School in Texas when he died in 1977 . Garrett was executive officer of the student battalion at the Fort Bliss Air Defense School, as well as a basketball and baseball coach, at the time he died. The murder case was reinvestigated in 2006 when family members contacted the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office with new leads, including a co-case that also took place in 1977. Using this fresh evidence police tracked down Major Garrett's stepson to Knoxville, Tennessee. Roger Garrett had been living there for a couple of months and had recently lost his job. Knoxville Police spokesperson, Darrell DeBusk, told WATE that Garrett had no idea that investigators were ringing about a homicide 36 years ago. 'He thought we were calling about another issue and he made the suggestion for him to come by. When he did we placed him into custody,' DeBusk said. Major Garrett's bloodied body was found in the rear seat of his Volkswagen Beetle by a passing motorist in January 1977 . At the same time, police arrested Major Garrett's widow, Lizbeth Ann Garrett, in El Paso. Officials have not cited a possible motive for the killing but both the stepson and the wife of the murdered man have been placed on bonds of $5 million. 'We've been working this case for many years,' sheriff's Cmdr. Paul Cross told the El Paso Times. 'The homicide guys did a tremendous job never quitting that case. It's a great night, and hopefully this is the first step in getting justice for him and his family.'","Vietnam hero Major Chester Garrett found dead in his car in El Paso desert .

"Google will appeal to the High Court to block a breach of privacy legal action launched against it in the UK by a group of British internet users. The internet giant's lawyers are seeking a declaration that the court has no jurisdiction to try their claims - which relate to the Apple Safari internet browser. The British group, known as Safari Users Against Google’s Secret Tracking, accuse the company of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and to target them with personalised advertisements. Doesn't apply: Google (UK headquarters pictured) claims the privacy case cannot be brought in the UK . The group includes editor and publisher Judith Vidal-Hall, with Robert Hann and Marc Bradshaw, who are both IT security company directors. They say Google’s 'clandestine' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 has led to distress and embarrassment among UK users. They argue Google’s bid to block a trial is 'misconceived' and the company should 'answer to British justice.' Allegations against the company include misuse of private information, breach of confidence and of the 1998 Data Protection Act. The users action group says the information was collected and sold to advertisers who used its DoubleClick advertising service. Google, the most dominant internet search engine site in the world, is powered from a site in Silicon Valley, California. The company is multinational and therefore argues that the privacy claim should not be heard in a British courtroom. It is the latest controversy involving Eric Schmidt's £170bn company after tax avoidance scandals . Antony White QC, appearing for Google, today argued the British claimants had failed to establish that their claims fell within one or more of the legal “gateways” which would allow them to go ahead. Mr White told Mr Justice Tugendhat that the only potential gateway available required there to be a real basis for concluding that the conduct complained of between summer 2011-spring 2012 would be 'continued or repeated'. He said: 'There is no suggestion there is any risk of repetition or continuation of that conduct - and good reason to think that it will not be repeated or continued'. In written arguments before the judge, Google Inc, contends any damages recovered if the claimants win are likely to be 'very modest'. A trial would be likely to last six to seven days and cost in the region of £1.2m and be disproportionately expensive, it said. A trial was likely to be 'substantial and complex' and involve a great deal of highly technical evidence about the operation of browsers, websites and cookies, it added. Campaigner Ms Vidal-Hall said before the court hearing, expected to last two days: 'Google is very much here in the UK. It has a UK specific site. It has staff here. 'It sells adverts here. It makes money here. It is ludicrous for it to claim that, despite all of this very commercial activity, it won’t answer to our courts. 'If consumers are based in the UK and English laws are abused, the perpetrator must be held to account here, not in a jurisdiction that might suit them better. 'Google’s preference that British consumers should travel all the way to California to seek redress for its wrongdoings is arrogant, immoral and a disgrace. We will fight this attempt to dismiss the case robustly.' Hugh Tomlinson QC, appearing for Safari users, said he rejected Google’s criticism that the claims being brought were uninteresting and made for 'trivial' amounts. Mr Tomlinson told the judge: 'These claimants are holding Google to account for what they have done.' He said no regulatory authority had taken action against Google in the UK, though there had been action in the US. One of two US investigations related to the very breaches underlying the basis for the UK court action. The Safari users wanted 'to find out what information has been obtained (by Google) and how it has been used', said Mr Tomlinson. Privacy: Claimants say the web giant has tracked their phones or laptops without permission . 'We say there are very serious and important issues which relate to how Google, a corporation of immense wealth and power, deals with private information and the individuals who use their services. 'We wholly reject the idea these are trivial and uninteresting claims sounding in trivial sums and the court should not entertain them.' The attempt to bypass British privacy rules will further fuel controversy over how Google tries to avoid regulation in overseas markets. Google avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking UK profits through its international headquarters in Dublin - claiming profits from sales of online advertising for UK companies should not be taxed here as its intellectual property is in Ireland and the US. But Dan Tench, a partner with Olswang, which is representing dozens of claimants in the lawsuit, has previously said: ‘Google has a substantial presence here and earns substantial revenues here. ‘This is yet another instance of Google being here when it suits them and not being here when it doesn’t.’ The claimants argue Google’s policies ‘don’t respect’ British privacy laws. The lawsuit follows on from Google being hit with a record £14.4m fine in America after the company bypassed the privacy settings found on iPads, iPhones and Macs. It also paid out a further £10million to resolve a related complaint. The privacy breach concerns Apple’s search browser, called Safari, which is designed to block the software that allows Google to track users’ online. However, Google disabled this safeguard between summer 2011 and spring 2012 without notifying those using it. Earlier this year, a British judge granted permission for the case to go ahead. In its submission to the High Court, Google’s lawyers argued that any information gleaned from the search engine is not ‘private or confidential’, meaning it has no obligation to keep it confidential. Other internet giants, such as Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft, all offer some services through European bases - meaning there is some protection for users under EU privacy laws.","Web giant accused of breaching privacy by tracking phones and laptops .

"A government minister today pleaded with civil servants to let him have a games console in his ministerial office. Ed Vaizey revealed he had been told not to have gaming equipment wired up to his office TV because it would look ‘frivolous’. But the Tory culture minister said he was going to ‘renew’ his campaign, arguing that it was connected with his day job. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has revealed his frustration at civil servants who will not let him have a games console in his office . As Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, the 44-year-old is responsible for policy affecting the gaming industry. But the plea to try out the latest games in his government office will raise eyebrows at a time when other Conservatives have suggested that people work harder to get the economy growing. He revealed that his requests for a console in his office at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, just off Trafalgar Square, were rejected by the ‘powers that be’. He added: ‘I was encouraged not to, in case it looked frivolous,’ he told The Independent. ‘But I think I will renew my campaign. I have a television so why can't I have a games console?’ Ed Vaizey was an early player of the Angry Birds (left) iPhone game but Prime Minister David Cameron is a secret fan of Fruit Ninja on his iPad . For now, Mr Vaizey is making do with playing games on his iPhone. Having first played Angry Birds – a favourite of Prime Minister David Cameron – he has progressed to Plants vs Zombies and now enjoys Monopoly on his iPad. But Mr Vaizey admitted he was in the dark about the industry until Mr Cameron gave him the brief in opposition six years ago. ‘I knew nothing about gaming in terms of either doing games or its policy place. ‘The only time I heard about games in the policy sphere was about violence and banning games.’ As a schoolboy he played Asteroids and Space Invaders but was baffled by the complexities of Defender. ‘It was the game that put me off gaming - because I wasn't any good at it,’ he laments. Earlier this year Mr Cameron was forced to defend the amount of time he spent playing games on his iPad, after it an advisor said the Prime Minister was addicted to the game Fruit Ninja where players swipe a sword at flying pineapples, melons and strawberries.","Culture minister Ed Vaizey wants a games console in his departmental office .

"The trend for women to increase the size of their bottoms to look like US stars such as Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian is catching on in the UK as figures show more women are injecting fat into their bodies than having it removed. Annual figures out tomorrow from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) show the number of fat transfer procedures has overtaken the numbers having liposuction for the first time. Cosmetic surgeons say women are increasingly looking to boost their curves and rejuvenate saggy areas by having their own fat removed from one area and transferred into another – most commonly from flabby areas such as the thighs to their bottoms, breasts and face. Write caption here . The association’s surgeons also say scandals over defective PIP breast implants and controversy over fillers such as Botox are prompting women to seek options in which the body’s own fat supplies are used. Thousands of women have had the faulty PIP implants removed after it was found they could leak industrial-grade silicon into the body. BAAPS’ figures show a decrease  in the number of women seeking breast-enlargement surgery in the past year. This has been attributed to the scandal. Normally, this number rises each year. Cosmetic surgeons say women are increasingly looking to boost their curves . Consultant plastic surgeon Michael Cadier, BAAPS President-Elect, said: ‘Fat transfer has been around for 70 years, but the techniques have got much better. It can be used around the whole body. We do occasionally get patients who have their bottoms enlarged in this way. ‘In my experience, they want to enhance their contours rather than get a massive bottom to mimic  the US trend, but we do get people enquiring about that.’ The annual figures show the number of women having fat transfer procedures has risen by 13 per cent to 2,641, overtaking the number of liposuction operations (2,638) for the first time. Paula Andrews, 66, a cattery manager from Southport, Merseyside, had fat taken from her midriff and injected into her cheeks at the Sthetix Clinic in Liverpool. She said: ‘I felt sick when the surgeon suggested taking fat from just below my left rib and putting it into my face, but then I thought at least it wasn’t a foreign substance.’ Rajiv Grover, President of BAAPS, said: ‘The growth rates for surgical facelifting and other anti-ageing procedures showed a double-digit rise, despite the country’s double-dip recession. ‘Perhaps because of the turbulent financial times we’re experiencing, patients are looking for tried-and-tested procedures that will deliver  a reliable and long-lasting result.’","Trend for women to look like J Lo and Kim Kardashian is catching on .

He . added: ‘We are looking at the potential for some localised  flooding . because we could see  so much rain fall in a short space  of time that . it can’t drain away  fast enough.’ Reading . University flooding expert Dr Hannah Cloke said: ‘We could see flash . floods in some parts of Britain if rainfall this weekend is as intense . as has been predicted. ‘The . problem is likely to be exacerbated in areas where the ground is still . wet from the winter floods, particularly in catchments with high . groundwater levels and where rivers are still high following Britain’s . wettest winter ever. But when it rains very heavily, almost anywhere . could be at risk. ‘Extremely . intense bursts of rain can mean that the soil is simply unable to soak . up the water  fast enough, so excess water  runs off and causes floods . in all sorts of unexpected places.’ Meteogroup forecaster John Lee said . the ‘heavy, thundery rain’ would spread up from the south today. Rowan Storey and sisters Sarah and Bonnie Carruth celebrated the end of their summer exams by having some fun on the beach in the sunshine at South Shields . The Met Office said the mercury could rise as high as 25C today and tomorrow in London and the South East - not far short of the warmest temperature of the year so far . Tomorrow's downpours will ease by Sunday when there will be some 'good, dry and bright spells', particularly in southern and eastern parts of the country. Pictured: Amber and Alisha enjoy the sunshine at South Shields with two-year-old Teddy today ahead of the rain . Weather warnings for rain are already in place across most parts of the country including the north of England, the south west, south east, midlands, London, Scotland and Northern Ireland but it didn't stop some people, including Michelle Bayes and Margaret Bloodworth, from enjoying the sun at South Shields beach . Yellow 'be aware' weather warnings are in place for much of the United Kingdom tomorrow as forecasters warn a fortnight's of rain could fall within one hour . ‘Even . though we are expecting pretty much everywhere to see some rain, . potentially parts of  the Midlands and northern  England will get the . heaviest blasts,’ he added. Some . places could see between 0.8in (20mm) and 1.2in (30mm) of rain fall in . an hour – almost half of the UK monthly average for the whole of June of . 2.9in (73.4mm).The Met Office has issued yellow ‘be aware’ warnings for . rain across almost all of England and Wales, and parts of Scotland and . Northern Ireland. The Environment Agency has issued nine flood alerts. An . EA spokesman said: ‘Heavy rain with isolated torrential downpours may . bring some river and surface water flooding on Saturday across all of . England, except for Devon and Cornwall, and all of Wales, except for . Pembrokeshire.’ This turbulent weather is caused by warm, humid air from Europe hitting cooler air over the UK. The predicted deluge is down to warm, humid air moving in from Europe which creates a risk of downpours when it mixes with cooler air over the UK.

"The newest Utah polygamous family featured in a reality TV show says sharing their story with a wide audience has been liberating. Brady Williams and his five wives were a bit apprehensive ahead of the airing of a pilot episode in September, but they said this week an interview with The Associated Press that it felt liberating to be open about who they are and what they believe. 'It really is like coming out of the closet,' said Brady Williams, 43. 'It's very liberating.' Brady Williams poses with his wives, from left to right, Paulie, Robyn, Rosemary, Nonie, and Rhonda, outside of their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City . His wives feel the same way, including his second, Robyn Williams, 40, who said: 'I feel more free to just be who I am and not be so afraid.' The first of nine episodes of the show, 'My Five Wives,' airs Sunday on TLC. It chronicles the life of Brady Williams, his five wives and their 24 children who live in a small rural community outside of Salt Lake City dominated by a branch of the fundamentalist Mormon church. The family once belonged to the group, known as the Apostolic United Brethren, but withdrew during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs. Now, they practice polygamy not because they think they must to get to heaven, and avoid hell, but because they prefer the lifestyle. Their show begins airing in a social and political climate that has softened significantly toward plural families in recent years. A federal judge in Utah struck down key parts of the state's polygamy laws in December, marking a victory for the Williams and hundreds of other polygamous families in the state. The ruling decriminalizes polygamy, making only bigamy — holding marriage licenses with multiple partners —illegal. Brady Williams five wives, from left to right, Robyn, Nonie, Rhonda, Rosemary and Paulie, pose for a photograph outside of their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City . The family that brought that lawsuit against the state of Utah, Kody Brown and his four wives from TLC's ""Sister Wives,"" is credited with helping create greater acceptance for plural families. Their show, which debuted in 2010 with footage of the family at their house in northern Utah, was ground-breaking in demonstrating to viewers across the country that not all polygamists are child predators like Warren Jeffs, the imprisoned leader of a polygamous sect on the Utah -Arizona border. The Williams family members said they don't expect viewers to be surprised by much, other than maybe how similar they are to non-polygamous families. It's normal times five, the family jokes. Viewers will see tears, joy and quarrels, they said. TLC is banking on viewers being fascinated by the unique dynamics of a plural family: regular family sit-down meetings among the adults where Brady Williams follows an agenda written on a notepad; side-by-side multiplexes where they live; and nightly family dinners where the children line up like kids in a school cafeteria to get their food. Brady Williams talks while his wives, from left to right, Robyn, Paulie, Rosemary, Nonie, and Rhonda, look on during an interview at their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City . Then there's the always-intriguing dynamic among the wives who share a husband. In the first episode, Brady Williams suggests the women work out their issues directly with one another rather than always coming to him, only to see it lead to hurt feelings and shouting. Among the topics discussed by the family during the season is a possible move out of Utah, maybe even to Washington state. The Browns of 'Sister Wives' fled Utah for Las Vegas after their show aired under the threat of prosecution from a county official. The Williams aren't terribly worried about that happening to them, as long as the recent court ruling stands. But they say they don't feel welcomed in the tight-knit community where almost everyone but them belongs to the church. 'There haven't been any overt acts of disapproval,' Brady Williams said. But he added: 'We want to be able to feel comfortable in our own skin.' Aaron Bronson, a principal at the school in the community and member of the Apostolic United Brethren, said he doesn't begrudge the Williams family for doing the show. He said the production crews have been respectful, and he's heard no complaints from the Williams family's neighbors. 'If they want to go public with what they believe, it's their choice,' Bronson said. 'It's not something I would choose to do with my family. It's a rocky road.'","'It really is like coming out of the closet,' said Brady Williams, 43. 'It's very liberating'

"Humans mastered the art of catching fast-moving, deep-water fish such as tuna more than 40,000 years ago, archaeologists revealed today. A team of Australian experts have uncovered evidence of the practice in a small cave at the eastern end of East Timor, north of Australia, which contained the bones of more than 2,800 fish. Some were caught as long as 42,000 years ago. Exciting find: Fish bones and hooks at the excavation site in an East Timor cave, which showed prehistoric humans were adept at catching fish in deep water . They also found the world's earliest recorded fish hook, made of shell and dating from between 23,000 and 16,000 years ago, during excavations at the Jerimalai cave site. The findings, published in the latest issue of the journal Science, stem from work done by Professor Sue O'Connor from the College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University. She said it demonstrated prehistoric man had high-level maritime skills, and by implication, the technology needed to make the ocean crossings to reach Australia. She said: 'The site that we studied featured more than 38,000 fish bones from 2,843 individual fish dating back 42,000 years. 'What the site in East Timor has shown us is that early modern humans in Southeast Asia had amazingly advanced maritime skills. 'They were expert at catching the types of fish that would be challenging even today - fish like tuna. It's a very exciting find.' Hook, line and sinker: Our ancestors developed techniques to catch fast-moving fish like tuna (pictured) far earlier than previously thought . A fish hook was also found at the site, but O'Connor said was not likely to have been used for deep-sea fishing. 'This . is, we believe, the earliest-known example of a fish hook and shows . that our ancestors were skilled craftspeople as well as fishers,' she . said. 'The hooks don't seem . suitable for pelagic fishing, but it is possible that other types of . hooks were being made at the same time.' What . is still unknown is exactly how these ancient people were able to catch . fast-moving deep-ocean fish. Slippery business: Tuna can be caught using nets or by trawling hooks on long lines through the sea. But this can be tricky even by today's standards . Tuna can be caught using nets or by . trolling hooks on long lines through the water, said O'Connor. 'Simple . fish aggregating devices such as tethered logs can also be used to . attract them. So they may have been caught using hooks or nets,' she . said. 'Either way it seems certain that these people were using quite sophisticated technology and watercraft to fish offshore.' She added that the finds may shed light on how Australia's first inhabitants arrived on the continent, with the implication that seaworthy boats would have been used to fish in the deep ocean. 'We have known for a long time that Australia's ancient ancestors must have been able to travel hundreds of kilometres by sea because they reached Australia by at least 50,000 years ago,' said O'Connor. 'When we look at the watercraft that indigenous Australians used at the time of European contact, however, they are all very simple, like rafts and canoes. 'So how people got here at such an early date has always been puzzling. These new finds from Jerimalai cave go a long way to solving the puzzle.'","Remains of more than 2,800 fish unearthed in East Timor cave .

"Chefs such as Heston Blumenthal have made everyday cooking a high-tech and scientific art. But if you struggle to cook even the most simple meal, a range of smart saucepans could set you on the path to culinary success. Called SmartyPans, the pots feature sensors that sync with a smartphone app and reveal cooking time, weight and if the pan is too hot. Scroll down for video . SmartyPans were invented by San Francisco-based Rahul Baxi. Each $189 (£115) pan (pictured) features a weight, humidity and temperature sensor and is powered by a 5V rechargeable battery. When cooking, the pan connects to a free smartphone or tablet app using Bluetooth . And the pans can even help with weight loss, because they reveal the number of servings and calories of every dish. SmartyPans were invented by San Francisco-based Rahul Baxi. Each pan features a weight, humidity and temperature sensor and is powered by a 5V rechargeable battery. When cooking, the pan connects to a smartphone or tablet app using Bluetooth. When in Recipe Mode, as the user adds ingredients to the pan, they are shown a progress bar indicating how much is required. The app monitors internal temperature and humidity, and tailors the cooking time and instructions accordingly. This mode additionally reveals how many people the meal will serve, and calories. Metrics mode gives unfiltered information from the pan,  including temperature and weight. Its battery recharges in an hour, and lasts up to a month. Each pan features a weight, humidity and temperature sensor, and is powered by a 5V rechargeable battery. Made of aluminium and Teflon, the pans are non-stick and the sensors are protected by a waterproof, ceramic cover. These sensors can also withstand heat of more than 649ºC (1200ºF). When cooking, the pan connects to a smartphone or tablet app using Bluetooth, which features two modes. When in Recipe Mode, as the user adds each ingredient to the pan, they will be shown a progress bar indicating how much more of it is required, and when to stop. The app then monitors internal temperature and humidity, and tailors the cooking time and instructions accordingly. This mode additionally reveals how many people the meal will serve, and calories. Meanwhile, the Metrics mode gives unfiltered information from the pan, in real time, including the current temperature and weight of the ingredients. Its battery recharges in an hour, and should last up to a month with 'regular use'. Mr Baxi has set up an Indiegogo campaign, and is hoping to raise $90,000 (£55,000) to fund production of the pans.

"If you drank red bull in the last 12 years, and you didn't automatically grow wings, then you'll be entitled to a small piece of a hefty settlement the company has agreed to pay for false advertising. But thanks to all the press the cash payouts have received, the check maybe much smaller than originally anticipated. Energy drink Red Bull GmbH settled two class-action lawsuits this week, agreeing to pay $13million because their famous slogan 'Red Bull gives you wings' isn't true. It was originally reported that anyone who bought a drink from January 1, 2002 to October 3, 2014 would be eligible to receive either a $10 cash payment of $15 in Red Bull product -regardless of whether there was a receipt for proof. There's now speculation that the cash payouts will be much less since an influx of people are making claims on the energy drink'ssettlement website. According to the terms of the lawsuit, the company agreed to pay customers up to $13million, not $10 in cash to anyone who filed a claim by the deadline. It's unclear whether the payouts will be diluted if more than $1.3million ask for cash payouts, or if the company will stop accepting claims after a quota has been reached. Scroll down for video .

'Such deceptive conduct and practices mean that [Red Bull's] advertising and marketing is not just ""puffery,"" but is instead deceptive and fraudulent and is therefore actionable,' the suit says. 'Even though there is a lack of genuine scientific support for a claim that Red Bull branded energy drinks provide any more benefit to a consumer than a cup of coffee, the Red Bull defendants persistently and pervasively market their product as a superior source of ""energy"" worthy of a premium price over a cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine,' the suit says .

"Many people dream of quitting the rat race - but few would expect a star NFL player to forgo fame and fortune. John Moffitt, who plays for Denver Broncos has quit the league because he thought it was crazy to risk his happiness and health for wealth. The third-year guard from Wisconsin said he knows teammates and fans don't understand how he could wave goodbye to his career. Denver Broncos guard John Moffitt plays against the Arizona Cardinals during a pre-season NFL football game . 'I just really thought about it and decided I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all,' he said. 'And I think it's really madness to risk your body, risk your well-being and risk your happiness for money. 'Everybody, they just don't get it and they think it's crazy. But I think what I was doing is crazy.' He said he didn't want to see things through this season for the shot at a Super Bowl. 'I don't care about the Super Bowl. I used to. I mean, anytime I played this game, I gave my heart to it and I'm a person that does thing with his heart. 'I don't need the Super Bowl experience. I played in great stadiums and I played against great players. And I had that experience and it's enough.' Moffitt, seen when he played for the Seattle Seahawks, says he is more interested in his health and happiness . Offensive lineman John Moffitt said he thinks it's madness to risk body, well-being and happiness for money . The Broncos acquired Moffitt, 27, on August 20 from the Seahawks after he'd lost out on one of two starting guard spots in Seattle during training camp. He played in two games for the Broncos and made about $1.5 million before taxes in his 2 1/2 seasons in the NFL. 'I've saved enough. It's not like I'm sitting here and I'm a millionaire,' he said. 'That's what I kind of realized. I'm sitting here and I got to this point and I was like, what is the number that you need? How much do you really need? What do you want in life? And I decided that I don't really need to be a millionaire. 'I just want to be happy. And I find that people that have the least in life are sometimes the happiest. 'And I don't have the least in life. I have enough in life. And I won't sacrifice my health for that.' He called the Broncos this week to notify them he wouldn't be returning to the team. Then he announced on Twitter that he . was calling it a career, saying, 'Football was fun but my head . hurts-haha kidding roger goodell. I'm on to new things, thanks to . everyone along the way!!!' The . Broncos put him on their reserve/left team list on Tuesday when they . started center J.D. Walton from the physically unable to perform list. Moffitt, 27, made about $1.5 million before taxes in his 2 1/2 seasons in the NFL . They have five days to formally release Moffitt, who left more than $1 million on the table, including about $312,000 for the remainder of this season and more than $700,000 in salary next season. Moffitt stressed that he's not passing judgment on his former colleagues, saying: 'This is all my personal stuff and I respect this game and I respect the men in this game.' Although Moffitt never had a history of concussions, he acknowledged all the blows he sustained in practices and games concerned him. 'I'm not trying to be the poster boy for ""Oh, I thought I should leave because of concussions,"" I'm just saying, it's a valid point,' Moffitt said. 'I love the game and I respect the game and everybody who plays it knows what they risk and I knew what I risked when I played, and I'm no longer willing to risk it.' Moffitt majored in sociology at Wisconsin and said his world view has been shaped after he began studying the writings of the Dalai Lama and Noam Chomsky. Now he's looking forward to speaking his mind on the radio and in podcasts he's going to produce. He said he has plenty of opinions to share on everything from philosophy to politics, although he has less to say about sports. Moffitt (right) says he is happy with what he has in life and won't sacrifice his health for football . He said he also wants to go on a diet now that he doesn't have to maintain his 319lb physique.'""I would like to grow my own food for a while, lose a ton of weight, feel great. And spend time with people I love and be happy,' he said. Moffitt said the timing of his decision had nothing to do with Walton being activated from the reserve/PUP list, although 'I'm glad it worked out like that.' He doesn't regret playing football, either. 'Obviously, I wish things worked out better in Seattle. I wish I played more there, but I loved college football. I loved being in Seattle playing football. 'It wasn't always the easiest, but I live here now and I'm thankful,' he said. 'I look back and I'm thankful for the whole experience. That's enough for me.' Moffitt said he wants to spend more time with his parents in Connecticut and with his girlfriend and her 5-year-old daughter in Seattle. He said his father is 'my best friend and I never get to see him.' Moffitt said he'll miss playing in games but he's glad the rest of his NFL life is over. 'Once you tear away all the illusions of it, it's hard work. And it's dangerous work. And you're away from your family. And it's not good for families. It's very tough on families,' he said. Moffitt is also glad to leave the league on his terms. 'I'm ready to go to work and start doing other things right now. 'So, it's a smoother transition and I'm still young enough to start a career and my body's healthy and I'm good. I look at it as a great start to life, you know?'","John Moffitt, who plays for Denver Broncos has quit the league because he thought it was crazy to risk his happiness and health for wealth .

"A set of twins who were born joined at the hip for the first 10 months of their life are celebrating turning 18 today. Emily and Caitlin Copeland, from Houston, Texas, are set to graduate as co-valedictorians from Lutheran High North in Houston. 'I think for anyone it's exciting to get to 18, but in particular for us I think it's just a really big blessing that we got to 18, considering what could have happened,' Caitlin said. Scroll down for video . Emily and Caitlin Copeland, a set of twins who were born joined at the hip for the first 10 months of their life are celebrating turning 18 today . The twins' before they were separated when they were just under a year. Conjoined twins is a phenomenon that occurs once in every 200,000 live births . The twins' mother Crystal Copeland says she will never forget the day she learned she was pregnant with conjoined twins, a phenomenon that occurs once in every 200,000 live births. Between 40 percent and 60 percent are stillborn, and some 35 percent survive one day. Mrs Copeland learned she was pregnant in 1996 when she was under the care of Dr. Kevin Lally, surgeon in chief at Hermann Memorial Children's Hospital in Houston. The twins' mother Crystal Copeland says she will never forget the day she learned she was pregnant with conjoined twins . The complications after the twins were born were concerning. One was born with a blocked intestine, and surgery had to be conducted when they were just two days old . He promised to provide an honest assessment of the chances for survival - the babies were kicking. and Mrs Copeland had seen them in an ultrasound. She had to wait a weekend to find out the extent of their joining. And in late 1996, surgery and imaging were not as advanced. 'At the time, if you Googled conjoined twins all you got was circus acts and babies that died,' Ms Copeland said. This summer 1997 cover of H magazine provided by Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, shows Dr. Kevin Lally holding Emily and Caitlin Copeland after the successful operation . Dr Lally wanted to separate them early on, but when the surgery began doctors discovered they were not only conjoined at the liver but the organs were discharging through only one twin. So they decided to wait for them to get bigger for the separation surgery . That weekend, she said, was the hardest in her life, but on Monday, the Copelands got the best news they could have hoped for. 'They were joined at the liver, not at the heart, which would have been, you know, fatal,' Mrs Copeland said. 'He thought there were good opportunities for separation where they would both be able to live basically normal lives,' she added. The complications after the twins were born were concerning. One was born with a blocked intestine, and surgery had to be conducted when they were just two days old. Caitlin, left, and Emily Copeland are shown on their first day of school . After the operation the two little babies grew into healthy young girls . Dr Lally wanted to separate them at that point, but when the surgery began doctors discovered they were not only conjoined at the liver but the organs were discharging through only one twin.

"It is the season of glad tidings and forgiveness. But many Christians living in Auckland, New Zealand, are struggling to find goodwill in their hearts for the latest in a series of controversial billboards coming out from the Church of St Matthew in the City. 'It's Christmas. Time for Jesus to come out', the sign proclaims, with an image of baby Jesus as a toddler in a manger, surrounded by a rainbow halo. The billboard was put up by the Reverend Glynn Cardy, who said it was meant to 'lift' the humanity of Jesus. But it is likely to face the same fate as last year's controversial poster - torn down by angry locals. Controversial: St Matthew in the City's billboard questions if Jesus was gay - while a more traditional poster announces the Christmas Day services . Raising eyebrows: The poster is getting attention - and criticism - from those who see it . The Rev's message, while presented in a controversial manner, is to ask if it would change anything for the . faithful if Jesus had been gay. He points out that there is no indication about Jesus's sexuality: 'The fact is we don't know what his sexual orientation was.' This isn't the first time the church . has . erected a controversial billboard. Last year the church erected one . showing the Virgin Mary looking shocked at the results of a pregnancy . test. However it did not last long, after an angry protestor tore it down. But Cardy did not mind, especially as the image had already gone viral, seen by millions of people. He said: 'In the internet age though the image will be out there forever. They can do what they want to it.' On this year's billboard, Rev Cardy said that, as homosexuality was not a word until the . 1800s, any mention of it in the Bible or other documents would have mistranslations. Fellow Reverend Clay . Nelson said the billboard tries to humanise Jesus by getting people to think about the challenges he would have had growing up. He added: 'Some . scholars have tried to make the case that he might have been gay. 'But it is all conjecture. Maybe gay, maybe not. Does it . matter? 'There is almost nothing in . the record of his teachings about sexuality while there is plenty about . the perils of being rich. Certainly he always supported the marginalised . in society.' Flashback: Last year's poster - of Mary with a pregnancy test - was destroyed by an angry neighbour . Criticism: The protestor ended up ripping the poster down in anger . It is not the first time billboards have caused an outrage. In the UK, the gay lobby group Stonewall's bus poster campaign stating 'Some people are gay. Get over it' has raised debates over how far advertising should push a viewpoint. It has led to some controversy, including one Christian bus driver from Rotherham who left a bus-full of angry passengers waiting as he would not drive a bus with the banner on the side. Earlier this year, London Mayor Boris Johnson blocked a Christian group from running a 'Not gay and proud: Get over it' campaign on London buses. The sign, like the one pictured here, was a billboard for gay lobby group Stonewall. Passengers spent 20 minutes stranded on the bus because the driver refused to board .",Reverend claims controversial billboard is mean to 'lift' humanity of Jesus .
"English backs are firmly against the wall at Twickenham today and, going by recent history, that suits them fine. Stuart Lancaster’s side must resurrect the knack for summoning strength in adversity. Defeat against Australia today would mean no escape from the blunt conclusion that they have spent this autumn locked in reverse, just when they were seeking to climb into the higher gears. This final instalment of the QBE series represents a shot at salvation of sorts and England will hurl themselves into it knowing that a full house of losses against the southern hemisphere giants would be an unacceptable return from a month of Tests in London. Charlie Hodgson scores at Murrayfield in 2012 in Stuart Lancaster's first game at the helm for England . Owen Farrell (right) and his England team-mates battled to a 14-14 draw with South Africa at Port Elizabeth . Chris Ashton races away for a memorable try during the demolition of the All Blacks at Twickenham in 2012 . Yet, desperation has been their ally in the past. During Lancaster’s tenure, his men have often delivered when cornered. They did so in their first match with an untried line-up and novice captain, against Scotland at Murrayfield at the start of 2012, and that set a bloody-minded tone. The same streak of resilience under fire was evident in Port Elizabeth months later, when England went into the final Test of three against South Africa 2-0 down and weakened by injuries, only to fight tooth and nail for a commendable draw. Later that year came the ultimate illustration of this stubborn character trait, as Chris Robshaw and his side — battered by criticism after back-to-back defeats — stunned the All Blacks with a record 38-21 victory at Twickenham. Those were the encouraging early benchmarks of spirit under fire which need to be emulated this afternoon. Lancaster's team have a habit of delivering a big performance when their backs are to the wall . For all their indignation about the negative reviews this November, it is imperative that England add substance to their defiance by winning. To do so, they will not be afraid to embrace traditional English virtues. The pack have often been dominant this month and the signs are that Lancaster will order his men to lean heavily on that likely advantage up front. Two recalled players explained the thinking. Hooker Dylan Hartley said: ‘We have to test them out and see what is working and if the maul is working, stick to it — don’t get bored of doing it. I don’t care if people think it is boring. If it is working and it is killing them, let’s exploit it and keep going.’ Tom Wood, reinstated in the back row, reflected on decision-making shortcomings which have hampered England’s ambitions this month. ‘We are not where we want to be,’ he said. ‘Our set-piece has been strong, but we’ve lacked continuity and a real understanding of what we’re trying to achieve in the middle third of the field. In that middle zone, you can get muddled up. ‘Are we keeping the ball and playing multi-phase or are we expecting them to rush off the line continuously and make big hits so we’ll keep chipping the ball in behind them and turning them? ‘I think we’ve got ourselves a little bit mixed up in the last few weeks. Hopefully this week in training we have put a plan in place to iron that out.’ George Ford, England’s exciting new No 10, concedes that the backs must repay their team-mates in the pack for sterling service this month, which has been undermined by a lack of clarity and ‘smart’ play behind the scrum. But Wood was right to conclude that it hasn’t been a simple case of good up front, poor behind. The home forwards have to carry and connect more astutely, while also sharpening their breakdown work, which Graham Rowntree admits is still a ‘work in progress’. With that target in mind, there has been a continual tweaking of methods at the ruck, minds focused by the prospect of competing with Australia’s supreme openside and captain Michael Hooper. England have had a superb set-piece platform in their recent matches, but they are wary of the threat posed by the Wallabies in the scrum. Rowntree, England’s forwards coach, suggested that the visitors are ‘dishonest’ in the way they seek to avoid a straight pushing contest, but Australia head coach Michael Cheika offered an alternative take on the matter yesterday. Northampton flanker Tom Wood has been recalled to the starting side and is backing England to bounce back . England's powerful scrum has been one of the biggest positives from this autumn series . ‘I definitely think they’re going to target us there,’ he said. ‘They are probably more tactical than we are. They turn and wheel and move to the left.’ When told England suggested his side were the ones guilty of such antics, Cheika added: ‘All that talk they carry on about — we are trying to milk penalties and that kind of business — it’s all irrelevant. ‘I don’t think any referee is going to be influenced by Graham Rowntree saying we are trying to turn the scrum. ‘What we’ve got to do is be really united in how our binds are, get our body height right and push very, very hard.’ Dylan Hartley insists that if England get an edge up front and in the set-piece, they will exploit it . That is a straightforward philosophy, but these Wallabies do not present a straightforward threat. Their commitment to attacking in wide channels through instinctive runners such as Israel Folau and Henry Speight makes them dangerous, even counter-attacking from deep. Andy Farrell described them yesterday as England’s ‘biggest test, defensively’. Lancaster’s team must not be afraid to revert to the old staples of territory and forward force if that is what it takes. Their backs are to the wall and if they are true to themselves, that means they will be inspired. Wallabies coach MIchael Cheika has denied that his forwards employ illegal tactics in the scrum .","England targeting win over Australia after disappointing autumn series .

"Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela made sure David Moyes’ reign at Anoeta started in style scoring a hat-trick in Real Sociedad’s 3-0 win over Elche. Despite the best efforts of fussy referee Carlos Velasco, Moyes picked up his first win and it was largely thanks to the Mexican international who scored twice in the first half and then again after the break to help Real Sociedad move away from the La Liga drop zone. Vela had the ball in the net inside three minutes when Sergio Canales tricked his way down the right and rolled the ball into Carlos Martinez’ path. The right back crossed to Real Sociedad’s leading scoring and he scored with a powerful header.

One of the things that Moyes will need to get used to in La Liga is the tendency for some referees to penalise the slightest physical contact. In recent years match officials’ style has change and become closer to that of Premier League referees but Velasco is old-school and frustrated Moyes by whistling every Real challenge in the early part of the game. Moyes has demanded his players be more physical but both Canales and Jon Ansotegi went into the book for what looked like harmless challenges. Real Sociedad’s football was bright though with Canales linking well with the excellent Vela and shooting over as the home side went for the second goal. Striker Imanol Agirretxe pulled up with a hamstring injury and had to be replaced by Alfred Finnbogason but it did nothing to knock La Real out of their stride and Vela soon had the second. He ran onto a perfectly weighted pass from skipper Xabi Prieto and sprinted between Elche’s two central defenders to score past Przemysław Tyton.

Elche's Faycal Fajr (R) fights for the ball with Sociedad midfielder Sergio Canales (L), as Moyes looks on with interest during the match . Elche threatened through their Brazilian striker Jonathas but he squandered two chances in the first 45 minutes and Real Sociedad goalkeeper Eñaut Zubikarai saved well from Denis Suarez. Vela was on form though and he played Canales in with a brilliant pass only for the former Real Madrid forward’s cross to be blocked. Vela almost scored at the start of the second half but Tyton turned his shot away for a corner. Vela has a superb record against Elche who came into the game never having won at Anoeta and having lost this fixture 4-0 last season. The Mexican has the quality to lead Real up the table and his third goal was the pick of the three burying a shot in the far corner through through the legs of Elche defender David Lomban. Vela is a reminder of why Real Sociedad were playing Champions League football last season and when he was hauled down by Victor Rodriguez Velasco pulled out perhaps his first justifiable card of the night. He is not the only jewel in the squad Moyes has inherited. Ruben Pardo came on for Canales in the last 20 minutes and orchestrated some of the best football of the night. The Spain under-21 international has lost his way of late but Moyes will be encouraged by this cameo. He will also be delighted with a second clean sheet from his players. If that and the form of Vela, who went off to a standing ovation four minutes from time, keeps up then Real will soon be back at the right end of the table.

"Being expected to do household chores isn't just a bug bear of modern women – female Neanderthals had a similar dilemma. A new study of Neanderthal teeth has discovered that our ancient cousins required women to do typical household chores, while also expecting them to hunt alongside men. The study suggests women in the group were responsible for looking after furs and adjusting garments, while men had the task of improving stone tools. The Spanish National Research Council made the discovery after analysing 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 Neanderthals found in Spain, France and Belgium. Pictured is one of the specimens used in the study . Scientists at Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid analysed 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 Neanderthals found at sites in Spain, France and Belgium. The fossils in Spain dated back 100,000 years, in France 50,000 years, and in Belgium the ancient teeth were believed to be 44,000 years old. Regardless of age, Neanderthals had dental grooves. 'This is due to the custom of these societies to use the mouth as a third hand, as in some current populations, for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat, for instance,' said Antonio Rosas, CSIC researcher. But the study found grooves present in the female fossils followed the same pattern, and were different to those found in male individuals. But the study found grooves  present in the female fossils (pictured) followed the same pattern, and were different to those found in male individuals. 'What we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men,' said Professor Rosas . In modern hunter-gatherer societies, women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of garments.Researchers state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task. Pictured is an illustration of how they used their mouths as hands . 'What we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men,' said Professor Rosas. Researchers believe Neanderthals used their mouths as a third hand for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat. In July, the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered lent weight to this theory. The collection reveals how Neanderthals developed their distinctive teeth before their brains, using them as a third hand for holding objects. The study adds to theories that the Neanderthals evolved their characteristic looks slowly, and intermittently, over hundreds of thousands of years. The ancient skulls, dating back 400,000 years, show Neanderthal-like features in the face and teeth, while other parts of the skulls, including the brain case, resembled those of more primitive human ancestors. This suggests the earliest Neanderthals used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects. The discovery at the Sima de los Huesos site in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated. 'Therefore we assume that the tasks performed were different'. The tiny nicks of the teeth enamel were also analysed. Male individuals show a greater number of nicks in the enamel and dentin of the upper parts, while in female individuals these imperfections appear in the lower parts. It is still unclear which activities corresponded to women and which ones to men. However, the authors of the study note that, as in modern hunter-gatherer societies, women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of garments. Researchers state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task. Almudena Estalrrich, CSIC researcher at the Spanish National Museum of Natural Sciences, adds: 'We believe that the specialisation of labour by sex of the individuals was probably limited to a few tasks. 'It is possible that both men and women participated equally in the hunting of big animals'. 'The study of Neanderthals has provided numerous discoveries in recent years,' Rosa adds. 'We have moved from thinking of them as little evolved beings, to know that they took care of the sick persons, buried their deceased, ate seafood, and even had different physical features than expected: there were redhead individuals, and with light skin and eyes. 'So far, we thought that the sexual division of labour was typical of sapiens societies, but apparently that's not true'. Almudena Estalrrich, CSIC researcher at the Spanish National Museum of Natural Sciences, adds: 'We believe that the specialisation of labour by sex of the individuals was probably limited to a few tasks.'It is possible that both men and women participated equally in the hunting of big animals' The study looked at the teeth of 19 individuals from three different sites in El Sidron, in Asturias, Spain, L'Hortus in France, and Spy in Belgium .","This is according to a study of 99 Neanderthal incisors and canine teeth .

"Sorry: The Prime Minister said that although he remained a committed supporter of gay marriage, he regretted the uproar the policy had caused . David Cameron has admitted in a private meeting of senior Conservative constituency officials that he never expected the issue to cause such a furore. In a brutally frank series of exchanges with activists behind closed doors at the party conference, he conceded it had been a political error to have forced the contentious legislation through Parliament. The Prime Minister said that although he remained a committed supporter of gay marriage, he regretted the uproar the policy had caused in the Parliamentary and voluntary party. He admitted he had under-estimated the scale of the opposition from his own supporters and the Church. One association chairman who attended the meeting but declined to be named said: ‘Cameron was repeatedly and often forcefully challenged over gay marriage. He said he still believed that gay marriage was right but regretted the way he had forced it through Parliament. ‘He was effectively saying he wished he had left it well alone. We wished he had too.’ Another constituency chairman said: ‘Feelings were running very high. We told him that we were losing good members to Ukip over gay marriage which was when he did his mea culpa. The trouble, is the damage is already done as I’ve lost dozens of members from my association.’ Mr Cameron was politely applauded when he revealed his regret over the policy. One Cabinet minister, who was at the conference, said: ‘It’s true he wishes he had never done it.  He has been saying this is the biggest political mistake of his premiership because he totally underestimated the trouble it would cause. ‘There’s no doubt Cameron genuinely believes in the policy and passionately believes in  equality in marriage. But he regrets the unhappiness and dissent it has caused among his MPs and the voluntary party.’ One Cabinet minister said: ¿It¿s true he wishes he had never done it. He has been saying this is the biggest political mistake of his premiership' Thousands of Tory activists have cited gay marriage as their reason for refusing to renew their subscriptions . In the Commons vote earlier this year, 136 Tory MPs out of a total of 303 voted against changing the historic definition of marriage and dozens more abstained. The rebellion, one of the most serious . ever suffered by a Conservative Prime Minister, would have been even . greater if ministers and their parliamentary aides had not been leant on . to support the Prime Minister. Contentious: One Tory MP colleague said a colleague of his has lost 25 per cent of her members over this gay marriage issue . Mr . Cameron’s admission that he got it wrong will infuriate Tory MPs and . party officials who begged him not to press ahead with the policy, which . is the biggest factor in the catastrophic fall in party membership. The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year that it had fallen to 134,000 – a drop of more than half since Mr Cameron became leader in 2005. Thousands of activists have cited gay marriage as their reason for refusing to renew their subscriptions. The revolt even spread to Mr Cameron’s own true-blue Witney constituency when Cicely Maunder, 64, a branch chairman, resigned from the party. ‘I left after 34 years because of David Cameron’s support for gay marriage,’ she said. Sir Gerald Howarth, the Tory MP for Aldershot, said: ‘This has caused immense difficulty and distress for many of my colleagues, some of whom were pressured into voting for it. ‘Gay marriage will have an enduring affect on our support and our membership. I have lost members. I know of one colleague who says she has lost 25 per cent of her members over this one issue.’ In the private session, Mr Cameron also revealed he wishes he had not abused Ukip members as ‘a bunch of loonies, fruit cakes and closet racists’. Lynton Crosby, the Australian strategist who masterminded Boris Johnson’s London mayoral campaigns and now works for Mr Cameron, has urged him to move on from issues such as gay marriage to concentrate on immigration, the economy and Europe. Vitriol: Heseltine was damning in his assessment of Ukip . Michael Heseltine last night branded Ukip ‘racists’ and warned the Tories to abandon any thought of an electoral deal. The former Deputy Prime Minister compared Ukip’s appeal to that of Enoch Powell and his infamous ‘rivers of blood’ speech, as well as to the former French National Front leader Jean-Marie le Pen. Lord Heseltine said that any attempt to come to an electoral arrangement with Ukip would cost the Tories the centre-ground votes they needed to win a general election. ‘Beware of what happens to your pivotal vote in the centre ground,’ he said. ‘You always have these right-wing, racist operations pandering to the lowest common denominator in politics. That is what happens.’ Asked he if was saying Ukip was racist, he replied: ‘Of course it is racist. Who doubts that? The language, the rhetoric, the membership – who doubts it?’ Ukip described the comments as ‘baseless and repugnant’.","PM says controversial issue may have cost party support .
He added he remains committed to gay marriage .
Correction: An earlier version of this article's headline suggested that David Cameron had said at a meeting that he wished he hadn't forced through gay marriage. Number 10 has since asked us to clarify that, while the Prime Minister regretted the furore it had caused within the party, he made clear that he did not regret its introduction."
"Arsene Wenger has promised to spend in January to help ease Arsenal’s mounting injury problems. Their extensive injury list lengthened this week when Jack Wilshere was ruled out for up to four months after undergoing ankle surgery, while Mikel Arteta is set to miss the rest of 2014 with a calf problem.

This season we bought five players who are all top quality so I think we have done really well, we will try to repeat that. ‘To buy football players is not to go into a supermarket and just say, “I want to buy a right back or a centre back”. It’s to find the right quality. ‘If you go out tomorrow you will see that everybody looks for the same positions. It’s not as simple as it looks.

"Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott were among the players who paid tribute to the late Phillip Hughes at the Australian Open on Friday. Australia is mourning the loss of the cricketer, who tragically died on Thursday two days after being struck in the back of the head by a bouncer while batting for South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. McIlroy and Co are in action this week just three miles away at the Australian Golf Club and the players wore black ribbons on their caps in memory of Hughes.

Home favourite Adam Scott also wore a black ribbon on his cap in respect for his countryman Hughes . Greg Chalmers held a one-shot lead at the halfway stage of the tournament but McIlroy moved himself in position to defend his title over the weekend after claiming a share of second place. Chalmers, twice a former winner of his national open, snared his seventh birdie on the last green for a five-under-par 66 to edge ahead of a congested leading pack at five-under for the tournament. The 41-year-old was not getting too carried away with his early lead, however, with the world No 1 on his heels after a second 69 and Adam Scott having revived his tournament with a sparkling 66. 'I think it's very early to be talking about winning given who's right behind me and who's playing very well,' he told reporters. 'Very early to be thinking about what's going to happen on Sunday night.' McIlroy takes a shot from the rough on the 16th hole at the Australian Golf Club in Sydney . McIlroy hits a putt on his way to a second round score of 69 and a halfway score of four under par . McIlroy had an up and down round with an eagle, six birdies and six bogies for a share of second with American Conrad Schindler as well as Australians Adam Crawford and Todd Sinnott on four-under. 'I felt like I had an opportunity today to shoot a good one and put a little bit of space between myself and the rest of the field but it didn't really turn out that way,' said the Northern Irishman. 'A few too many mistakes and it was pretty tricky out there to be honest. Swirling quite a bit, which made it hard for club selection. Misjudged a few wedged shots and got bogies from those. 'I was happy with how I finished, picked up shots in four of the last five holes and I'm still in a good position heading into tomorrow.' Overnight leader Jordan Spieth had a day to forget, bogeying two of his first four holes and finishing with a 72 to drop to a share of sixth on three-under with three others. Overnight leader Jordan Spieth of the USA could not match his first-round heroics but is still in contention . Australian Greg Chalmers sits on top of the leaderboard with a one stroke advantage over McIlroy . 'It was a struggle, big time struggle,' he said. 'I wasn't hitting it well. If I wasn't putting well I may have shot 45 on the back nine.' Scott was in a group of six players sharing ninth on two-under having soared back into contention with a blemish-free 66 that was also fired by an eagle at the 14th. The 34-year-old former Masters champion, an early starter, held the course record on the newly-reconfigured layout at The Australian Golf Club for half an hour until Jamie Lovemark completed a round of 65. 'We had a good morning for it, so I had to take advantage just for the sake of getting back in the tournament,' Scott said.

"Andy Murray’s Manila Mavericks fell to defeat in their opening contest of the first International Premier Tennis League. The Scot is playing in the four parts series along with some of the top names in the game past and present, with the first round of fixtures played in the Philippines this weekend. Maria Sharapova came back from 2-5 down in her clash with Kristina Mladenovic to win 6-5 before Murray faced US Open champions Marin Cilic in the final singles needing a 6-2 win to force a shootout. Two-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray partnered Maria Sharapova in the doubles in Manila but they couldn't win their set . Murray and Sharapova teamed up to play in the mixed doubles but eventually lost their crucial match 6-4 . Andy Murray poses with his Manila Mavericks team-mates after day one of the inaugural International Premier Tennis League . Murray, who was suffering with jet-lag, chases down a drop shot from Marin Cilic who beat Murray 6-5 in their singles match . Murray enjoyed teaming up with Sharapova in the mixed doubles during the inaugural round-robin International Premier Tennis League . The four franchised teams will visit each other (although star names might not play in all the matches. For example Murray is only expected to play the first event in Manila) and the home team decides the order of play. Matches are five sets and will involve a one set contest in men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles and men's legends singles. The winners are the team that gains the most games within five sets and not the winner of the most sets like usual in tennis. If a set is tied at 5-5 then players play out a timed tie-break to decide the winner. In addition there are no advantage scores, meaning the winner of the point at deuce takes the game. A shot clock of 20 seconds is used in between points to keep the momentum of the matches quick and the change of ends only lasts a minute. The scoring system is rather labored: The winning team picks up four league points, the losing team receives two league points if they win 20 games, only one point if they win 10-19 games and gain no points for less than 9 games. The winning team pockets $1million each match. Murray and Sharapova lost 6-4 in their mixed doubles set against Nenad Zimonjic and Kristina Mladenovic . MANILA MAVERICKS: Andy Murray, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Kirsten Flipkens, Maria Sharapova, Daniel Nestor, Carlos Moya, Treat Huey.

MACROMAX INDIAN ACES: Roger Federer, Pete Sampras ,Gael Monfils, Ana Ivanovic, Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopanna, Fabrice Santoro. UAE ROYALS: Novak Djokovic, Caroline Wozniacki, Malek Jaziri, Goran Ivanisevic, Nenad Zimonjic, Marin Cilic, Kristina Mladenovic. Murray surrendered an early break to Cilic to fall 2-1 behind but managed to respond to force a tie-break at 5-5 all. Team coach and player Treat Huey said to Murray at the changeover 'you're all over him', as the Mavericks tried to stay in contention. However in the timed tie-break Cilic built a decisive lead to beat Murray and secure the UAE's victory 29-24. Earlier on Friday, the first team contest saw the Micromax Indian Aces beat the Singapore Slammers 26-16, with charismatic Frenchman Gael Monfils playing inspirational tennis. Monfils defeated 2002 Wimbledon champions Lleyton Hewitt 6-1 after Ana Ivanovic had thrashed Daniela Hantuchova 6-0 to enable the Micromax Indian Aces to cruise to victory. 30 players are included in the four franchise teams, including the likes of Roger Federer, Djokovic, Murray, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. The tournament heads to Singapore second, before fans in India and the UAE are entertained through the first half of December. Captains Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic did not play in the opening ties for their sides after winning the Davis Cup and Barclays ATP World Tour Finals respectively in the past fortnight.

"Usually if you want to lose weight, the first thing that has to stop is all those trips to the local takeaway. But now a former junk food addict hopes to show dieters they can lose weight and still enjoy a night in with an Indian, or a Chinese. Danielle Moss, 35 from Salford, Greater Manchester is leading the way in helping others keep their waistlines in check after opening a 'healthy' fast food restaurant. She has a petite frame of 5ft 3"" but weighed more than ten stone and wanted to shift the extra pounds without giving up her favourite fast food. So she created her very own low calorie takeaway-style kebab and burger recipes to help her lose more than a stone and a half in weight. Danielle, pictured on holiday in Cyprus in 2010, weighed ten stone at 5ft 3"". She now weighs just 8.5 stone . Mother-of-two Danielle was so happy with her results she decided she just had to share them - and not just with her family. The healthy chef took her meals out of her own kitchen and launched a brand of lean Indian, Chinese and Italian cuisine with less than half the calories at her Naji's Kitchen eaterie in her home town. 'Everything we sell is what you would expect in a takeaway except that for example our chips are oven baked and our chicken burgers are coated in crushed cornflakes and honey,' said Danielle who now weighs 8.5 stone. 'Nothing is ground breaking it's just looking at a delicious and easy way to cook something. 'It's strange because I thought the kind of people that would come in would be women who are conscious of their weight and the food they eat but we have had a lot of young lads who go to the gym a lot.' Ex-marketing assistant Danielle had piled on the pounds three years ago after she and husband Colin would order out up to three times each week. Daniellle, with the healthy chilli meatball kebab, launched the UK's first healthy takeaway in Salford . Eventually she researched her intake of food and created her own takeaway-styled menus and substitute fatty ingredients such as oil and butter. Danielle said: 'I started Weight Watchers and was able to look at the plans to see what we should be eating and I realised that mine and my husband's portions were huge. 'I realised that the food I was cooking that I thought was healthy really wasn't. We were having a 500g pack of mince between us in a lasagne which has so much fat. 'I spent loads of time cooking and looking at the things we were putting into our bodies. 'I made a great low fat curry one night and while talking to my husband discussed why takeaway food couldn't be delicious and healthy. 'When I was on weight watchers I lost around a stone but I have found that becoming a bit more educated on food and cooking more has improved our lifestyles massively. I love running and we have much more energy.' Her food joint serves curries, pizzas, chips, burgers and kebabs made from healthy low fat ingredients . Danielle got the idea when she was trying to lose some weight but was missing takeaways . Danielle's chilli meatball kebabs are made with lean mince blended with onions, spices and oil substitute fry-lite at only 249 calories compared with one in an average takeaway expected to rack up more than 1,000. Her pizzas are made using wholemeal flour and reduced fat toppings at around 600 calories compared to one you may find in your local takeaway at 2,000 calories. All of their sauces are homemade using only natural and fat free ingredients with chilli sauce at only 100 calories compared to 200 calories and chutney at a mere 13 calories against 150 calories in a takeaway. All of the meals on the menu come with a calorie counter and even using one extra ingredient could alter the fat content. Danielle cooking a 249 cal chilli meatball kebab blended with onions, spices and oil substitute fry-lite . She said: 'What we didn't want is for it to scream healthy which would put people off we want people to think that it is a takeaway with things like curries and kebabs rather than salads and cous cous. 'We want to be known as a takeaway that is healthy, but not where people are saying: ‘oh I don't want that lettuce leaf diet rubbish.' 'We originally had to really train our cooks as it can be really tempting to put an extra bit of chicken or extra cheese as we are advertising that dish with the nutritional values in and we do not want to sell something that we are not advertising. 'But the chefs know the recipes in and out and know exactly what must go into each dish, you haven't got the freedom in many kitchens where you can add or take away ingredients as you choose.' Daniellle's chilli meatball kebab has a quarter of the 1,000 calories you'd normally expect .","5ft 3"" Danielle, 35, from Salford, tipped the scales at more than ten stone .

"Ariel Castro pleaded not guilty today to 977 criminal charges stemming from the abduction and imprisonment of three women over a decade and the subsequent birth of a child to one of them during that time. A grand jury on Friday added 648 charges to a previous indictment against Castro, who is accused of abducting the first of the women in August 2002 and holding them captive until they escaped his home on May 6 with a six-year-old girl he fathered during her mother's captivity. An attorney for Castro, 53, entered the 'not guilty' plea during a brief arraignment before Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Pamela Barker, who kept in place an $8 million bond and order that Castro not be allowed to see his daughter.

Officials have said that they were kept bound for periods of time in chains or rope and that they endured starvation, beatings and repeated sexual assaults. Ariel Castro now faces hundreds of new charges relating to the abduction and imprisonment of three young girls in his Cleveland home for about a decade. The 977-count indictment against Castro includes charges of rape and kidnapping and two counts of aggravated murder on accusations that Castro starved and punched one of the women while she was pregnant until she miscarried. The indictment does not include charges that could carry a death sentence, but Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty said he is still reserving that option. In chains: Castro, seen here at an earlier hearing in July, now faces 977 charges relating to the abduction and captivity of three young women and one of their children .

"A robotic suit that is worn as an exoskeleton and can be used to help disabled people walk again has received an EC certificate from the German safety monitoring agency. The approval means that the Robot Suit HAL, designed by Japanese robotics firm Cyberdene, has passed the required safety tests, paving the way for the suit to be sold in other parts of Europe, including the UK. HAL, which stands for Hybrid Assisted Limb, responds to biosignals detected on the wearer's skin that are sent to the muscles which in turn makes the robotic limbs move. A robotic exoskeleton used to help disabled people walk has been approved for sale in Germany. This means the Japanese Robot Suit HAL, pictured, could soon be sold in other parts of Europe including the UK . Japanese robotics firm Cyberdyne's CEO Yoshiyuki Sankai, pictured right, presents the medical Robot Suit HAL as demonstrated, left and far right, by a Cyberdyne employee. There are two types of HAL system. The HAL 3 system, pictured, is a leg-only device, while the full-body HAL 5 additionally works with arms and torsos . Height: 1.6m . Weight: Full Body Type approximately 23kg, Lower body approximately 15kg . Power: Charged battery (AC100V) Continuous operating time: 2 hours 40 minutes . Motions: Daily activities including standing up from a chair, walking, climbing up and down stairs, holding and lifting heavy objects. Cyberdyne and Tsukuba University . began hospital trials of the HAL suit in 2012 in Japan. By October 2012 . HAL suits were being used by 130 different medical institutions across the country. In February this year, the HAL system became the first powered . exoskeleton to receive global safety certification and it has now received a EC Certificate of Conformity in Germany. This means it has passed the German safety standards of the TUV Rhineland agency and is allowed to be sold in the country. The exoskeleton was demonstrated during a press conference to celebrate the news at the company headquarters in Tsukuba, north-east of Tokyo, Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. It has been designed to 'support and . expand the physical capabilities of its users, particularly people with . physical disabilities.' There are two types of HAL systems: HAL . 3 provides leg function, while HAL 5 is a full-body . exoskeleton for the arms, legs, and torso. HAL 5 can help the wearer to lift and carry about five times as much weight as he or . she could lift and carry unaided before. Daily activities that the HAL system can help disabled people do include standing up from a chair, walking, climbing up and down stairs, pictured, and holding or lifting heavy objects . A Cyberdyne employee demonstrates the medical Robot Suit HAL during a press event at the company headquarters in Tsukuba, north-east of Tokyo after the suit received an EC certificate from German safety monitoring agency TUV Rhineland . The HAL system detects biosignals on the surface of a wearer's skin. Based on these signals HAL then moves the robotic joint in time with the wearer's muscle movement . Robot Suit HAL is a 'cyborg-type robot' that can be used to replace limb function or expand and improve a person's physical capability and wellbeing. When a person attempts to move, nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles through motoneurons. This moves the musculoskeletal system as a consequence. Weak biosignals can be detected on the surface of the skin and HAL catches these signals through a sensor attached on the skin of the wearer. Based on the signals obtained, the power unit is then controlled to move the joint in time with the wearer's muscle movement. Cyberdene calls this a 'voluntary control system' that interprets the wearer's intention to move, using the biosignals, and registers these in advance of the actual movement. HAL additionally comes with a 'robotic autonomous control system' that provides human-like movement based on a robotic system which works with the 'autonomous control system'. This has been designed to make the movements as natural as possible. Cyberdene claims HAL is the world's first cyborg-type robot controlled by this unique Hybrid System. The company want the device to be used in various fields such as rehabilitation support and physical training support in medical field, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) support for disabled people, heavy labour support in factories and rescue support at disaster sites, as well as in the entertainment industry.","The Hybrid Assisted Limb (HAL) robotic suit has passed German safety tests, increasingly the chances of it being sold in other parts of Europe .
Worn as an exoskeleton, it responds to signals sent from a wearer's brain, enabling those who has lost the use of their legs to walk again ."
"Billy Joe Saunders has been fighting his whole life. Growing up on a travellers site, his boxing education started not in the gym but in bare-knuckle scraps from the age of just five. Saunders, now 25 but still living on a site in Hertfordshire with his wife and two young sons, is the great-grandson of Absolom Beeney, considered the Romany culture's finest fighter. Billy Joe Saunders, who grew up on a travellers site, will fight Chris Eubank Jnr in London on Saturday night . Romany boxer Saunders poses outside his home near Hatfield, just north of London . And on Saturday, he hopes to take another step on the road to becoming the first traveller to win a world title when he faces Chris Eubank Jnr. 'Imagine a site of 48 plots all with little kids growing up together,' he says. 'You're going out there and every single day, all it is is fighting, then playing. 'You have a game of football then you have a fight over it, then you play again. Imagine that all your life. Growing up like that does nothing but harden you inside. 'If I had a fight when I was young my mum and dad wouldn't know about it. If he [Eubank] had a fight, he'd go straight back and tell his mum. It was a natural thing for me, I've been brought up on it and it hardens you inside. 'It is 100 per cent a different experience to being a professional fighter but it hardens you and I've never ever given in in my life. I'm not that sort of person and if I was I wouldn't be in this sport. 'When you're born into it, it becomes natural. It stops when you're 15 and you're getting a bit older and you're going to work and stuff, that's when the younger kids start. It's a culture and it always happens. The 25-year-old (right) has won all 20 of his professional fights, and is more experienced than his opponent . Saunders (right) is the current British, European and Commonwealth middleweight champion . 'When you walk out there, some people think it would feel like, ""I'm not going out there because I don't want to have a fight"". 'But it's not like that with us – you have to fight. Whether you win or lose you're getting out there and having a fight, it's as simple as that.' Saunders has vowed to retire if he loses to Eubank in a fight for the former's British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles. It also carries the prize of a shot at the WBO world title against the winner of Andy Lee's clash with Matt Korobov in Las Vegas next month. And much has been made of Eubank's size advantage amid stories that he has given the likes of Carl Froch a torrid time in sparring. But it is again to his upbringing that Saunders turns in response. 'I'll tell you a story about Tom Little, a big fella who is now a good friend of mine, but we became friends after we had a fight,' he says. 'It was something stupid, I was 16 or 17 and he was from around my end. We had an argument, he's a heavyweight, a big boy, 6 foot 6 and 18 at the time. And this was one time where if I could have talked myself out of it I would have. 'We were on the site and we just had it. There was an argument and it escalated into a little challenge to me and there were too many people there to turn it down. I would have loved to get out of it, I was thinking, ""I don't need this"" but I said, ""if you want to fight let's have it"". The two fighters square up at the weigh-in at the Imperial War Museum in London . Eubank Jnr has considerably less professional and amateur experience than his opponent . 'We had our shirts off and we had a fight for 10 minutes. But what a good fight and I beat him. It was in a field, bare-knuckle and we shook hands afterwards and became friends, very good friends. 'But it's very hard, everything goes out the window and you stand there having it. It's pointless trying to box around and conserve energy because any minute you could get hit with a big punch and go out. You might as well get done what you can while you can. 'When you see a street fight, nobody has respect for each other and you see knives and bats out. But when you have respect for each other then it's a fair fight, you stand up and that's it. If you win or lose it's over and there's no dishonour in saying ""enough"". 'We're friends now but that's just an example of how it happens. It escalated out of nothing but it's more about pride than anything else. 'I've never been a bully and at that stage that sort of fight was rare because you don't get many people who want to have a fight with a boxer who is doing well in the boxing game. But it happened and thank God, I haven't had one since.' Saunders, who represented his country at the 2008 Olympics, has won all 20 of his professional fights but admits it is only now that he has given the sport his full attention. He adds: 'When I was in training for other fights the boys would say, “are you coming with us? We're going to the dog track”. Saunders during his media work-out ahead of his clash with Eubank Jnr . Eubank Jnr and Saunders looks set to overshadow the main event between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora . 'Then you go to the dog track, from there you would go to the casino then you look at your watch and it's four in the morning. That's no good. 'I look back at that and I don't know how I beat some of the fighters I've beaten doing that sort of thing. I don't care how good you are, a fit man will always beat a good man who is unfit. 'In my professional boxing career I've had 20 fights and I've won those 20 fights on worth ethic alone because I haven't done my diet right, haven't lived the life and I know now I can't win a world title living the lifestyle I was living before. 'Kebabs, food, this, that, walking around at 15 stone. This time last year I was 16 stone – it was just a joke. I know I can't live that lifestyle – the elite fighters don't do it. 'When I won the European title in my last fight, the night before the weigh-in I got six-and-a-half pounds off in a sauna and I thought, ""I never want to do that again"". 'Some people have to learn from a loss but luckily enough I didn't have to and I got the win but I knew I had to learn from it.'

"Arsenal face an injury crisis with Jack Wilshere set to miss four months after ankle surgery yesterday. And manager Arsene Wenger will be handed an increased January transfer budget to help bolster his injury-hit squad. Wilshere had his left ankle ligaments operated on following Manchester United’s 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. And captain Mikel Arteta is also facing a battle to play again this year after suffering a calf tear in the 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund. Wilshere posted a picture of his ankle in a cast after the operation and insisted he will return soon . The midfielder posted a similar image after his last ankle surgery, on the other foot, in 2013 . Wilshere was injured during Arsenal's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium last Saturday . It leaves Wenger with three recognised senior midfielders — Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky. After the operation Wilshere posted a photo on Instagram (left) to reassure fans that the surgery had gone well. ‘Ankle needed surgery in the end,’ he wrote. ‘Went well thanks to the main man James Calder (the surgeon)! The midfielder has been beset by injuries, and will have missed 119 weeks of football by the time he returns . Wilshere was injured by this tackle from Paddy McNair during last weekend's defeat by United . Wilshere was clearly in pain after the tackle and it is unlikely that he will be back for Arsenal before March . ‘You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticises you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.’ Now Arsenal will give Wenger more funds than the £20million earmarked for a central defender in January. Bayer Leverkusen’s Lars Bender remains Wenger’s first midfield option, but Sevilla’s Grzegorz Krychowiak is also being considered. Wilshere could be back in training by February, but it will take some time to get back to full fitness .

"Chelsea are close to agreeing the second biggest Premier League shirt sponsorship ever with Turkish Airlines. A £25million-a-year deal is expected to be finalised by Christmas. The negotiations with the big spending airline, famous for its Lionel Messi and Kobe Bryant TV adverts, were first revealed by Sports Agenda last September. The money would be a significant advance on the £18m-a-year Samsung currently pay to have their name on Chelsea shirts and would propel the club above Liverpool and Arsenal in the PL shirt sponsorship table. Scroll down for video . Launch: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (left) and then Chief Executive Peter Kenyon at launch in 2005 . Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich wants his club — hot favourites to be crowned champions — to be as dominant on football’s commercial side as they are on the pitch. But the west London club, already deep in talks with Turkish Airlines before former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow was brought in to revamp the commercial operation, still lag well behind Manchester United. The Old Trafford shirt sponsorship with Chevrolet, that began this season, is worth £53m annually. Barcelona have had their shirts sponsored by Turkish Airlines in the past . Spreading their wings: Turkish Airlines linked up with Manchester United . Clare Balding could end up spending just 20 days a year presenting racing on Channel 4 when she finally agrees a new contract to accommodate her other broadcasting options. That would mean Balding (below) hosting only the Derby, Grand National, Cheltenham and Royal Ascot.

Clare Balding could end up spending far less time presenting racing on Channel 4 when she agrees terms . FIFA plan to end live video streaming of the post-executive committee meeting press conferences because of the pounding that president Sepp Blatter subsequently receives on social media. Strangely, online ridicule has not dissuaded Blatter from standing for a fifth term next May. Meanwhile, it looks like the PR agency who get the job of helping FIFA in the build-up to Russia 2018 — Webber Shandwick are favourites — will face a tough task. The video launching the tournament logo has already stirred up trouble by showing the disputed Crimean peninsula as part of Russia. FIFA were angry but the Kremlin were said to be very relaxed. BBC Radio 5 Live, much to the angst of its rugby production team, will give commentary priority today to Manchester United v Hull City, a run-of-the-mill Premier League match.

The England Cricket Board’s choice to succeed commercial director John Perera, who brought in $1billion worth of TV rights and sponsorships, has already ruffled a few feathers. Sanjay Patel allegedly made an insensitive comment about committing suicide while on a panel at the Business of Cricket Awards. Patel was responding to a Somerset representative who admitted he was depressed about falling attendances and participation. There were more than 200 people at the event, but an ECB spokesman claimed they heard nothing untoward. The England team are on tour in Sri Lanka and held a two-minute silence for Phillip Hughes on Saturday . The RFU offer to the International Rugby Board to win the right to host next year’s World Cup included an £80million guarantee and half of the 2.3m tickets being sold by the IRB to competing nations, sponsors and corporate hospitality. So although ER (England Rugby) 2015 have only 140,000 of their allocation still to shift, tens of thousands of seats are likely to be returned by the IRB. That will leave ER 2015 to sell the returns at late notice — some for supposedly sell-out matches. The gloves are off already in the battle for the IAAF presidency between Lord Coe and Ukraine’s Sergey Bubka, even with the election not due until next August. Bubka suspects the only way he can win is to fight dirty with his camp planning to use every opportunity to highlight conflicts Coe might have through his many varied roles.","The Blues' shirt sponsorship deal with Samsung is set to come to an end .

"Jose Mourinho claims he does not want to sign or sell anyone in January and preserve the happy equilibrium which has helped Chelsea storm clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League. 'For me that is the perfect situation,' said Mourinho. 'I don't want people to leave. I don't want people to come in. We started our project this way, and I'd like to go until the end. 'If other teams do it in January, good for them. No problem for me. It will not be something I will use, saying: 'These guys spend £30million more'. Jose Mourinho has said that Chelsea will not buy or sell any players in the January transfer window . There had been rumours that Petr Cech could leave the club but that now appears unlikely . 'They can spend what they want and what they can. Hopefully everything goes okay and we have no emergency needs for January.' The Chelsea boss said something very similar last year only to have a busy month when the January transfer window opened with Juan Mata and Kevin de Bruyne leaving the club and Nemanja Matic and Kurt Zouma signing. The difference, however, is that his team are clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League and unbeaten in 19 games as they travel to Sunderland. When the market opens at the end of December, the onus will be on others to improve to catch the leaders. Mourinho's Chelsea side are six points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League table . Mourinho said he was happy with his summer signings and didn't want to change his squad at all . 'It will take some other clubs winning every match,' said Mourinho when asked what it will take to lose the title from this position, six points clear after 12 games. 'Not every match, but win-win-win-win-win-win-win. With my team, I don't believe in bad periods. 'I believe in defeat. I believe there are many difficult matches ahead, with so many points to lose. But I don't believe in bad moments. The team is a good team, a solid team. The players know what they want and how to reach it. 'They have changed. There was an evolution in these young people, a clear evolution. I don't think the group, as a group, can be complacent. That's the only risk we don't have because it's not the profile of this group.'","Jose Mourinho says Chelsea will not buy or sell any players in January .

"Barcelona players are used to stepping out in front of 90,000 fans week in, week out, but on Friday their first-team stars took some time out when they were surprised with a day at a go-karting track. Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were all in action as Luis Enrique's side looked to enjoy life in the fast lane. According to Mundo Deportivo, Gerard Pique came out on top in the team-building exercise, with Martin Montoya second and Thomas Vermaelen third.

Lionel Messi (pictured) is unstoppable on the football field, but struggled to pass his team-mates on the track . Messi may be used to dribbling past players in La Liga, but seemed to find it tough passing his team-mates on Friday morning. It is not the first time the Barcelona coach has organised such excursions for his players. He did the same while in charge at Barcelona B, Roma and Celta Vigo. Coming off the back of an impressive 4-0 win over APOEL Nicosia in the Champions League, the Catalan giants head to the Mestalla to face a dangerous Valencia side on Sunday. Martin Montoya, Jordi Masip, Sergi Roberto, Jordi Alba, Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Pedro (in pink, left to right) play up for the cameras . The competitive spirit of Barcelona's team spreads further than the football pitch, it seems, as they fought it out on the track . The Barcelona squad were not immune from the pre-race safety talk as they prepared for their go-karting experience on Friday . Jeremy Mathieu spoke to the press at a conference at La Masia after the karting exploits, and he admitted the game would be 'special' for him against his former side. 'It's a special game for me but I won't play any differently. It's always nice to play at Mestalla, I was there for many years,' Mathieu told fcbarcelona.com. 'I don't know how they will receive me – I believe I did myself justice there. Now I am 100% focused on Barca.'

Alves, widely known as the joker in the Barcelona pack, turns into a corner as Barcelona took part in a team bonding go-karting session . Mathieu also hopes Messi will stay at the Nou Camp for the rest of his career. The Argentinian has already had a record-breaking season, beating the all-time La Liga goalscoring record last weekend, before topping the Champions League goalscoring record on Tuesday. 'I think Messi will end his career at FC Barcelona because he is a legend and he has spent his entire career here. I hope for the club and for our sakes that he stays here.'

"Months of anticipation finally came to an end on Friday night as Sam Burgess made his eagerly anticipated rugby union debut in Bath’s victory over Harlequins. The league convert looked every inch the poster boy as he was brought on as a second half replacement at the Rec. His arrival was greeted by cheers and all cameras were focussed on the player Russell Crowe calls ‘the ‘sparkly-eyed man’. Sam Burgess charges into the Harlequins defence with his first touch of the ball in rugby union . Powerful winger Matt Banahan crosses for Bath's first try of the evening at the Rec . Bath fly half Ollie Devoto knocks over an early penalty as the home side dominate the opening exchanges . Quins scrum half Danny Care, who was dropped from Stuart Lancaster's England squad, puts in a box kick . His arrival from Australia — South Sydney Rabbitohs owner Crowe took him over there in 2010 — has been one of the most hyped-up signings of all time and it was the perfect start as his side moved to the top of the table with a convincing victory over their play-off rivals. Afterwards, Burgess  said: ‘I just wanted to get out there to try and enjoy it. I had a few experienced guy around me and the whole squad has been great. I have a lot to learn and it was good to be part of a win.’ The Yorkshireman had to wait until the 63rd minute to get on. Among those also hoping to make their mark were England trio Danny Care, Kyle Eastmond and Semesa Rokoduguni who were all released for club duty. Eastmond, another league convert, was turned over early on by Kyle Sinckler, but his mistake was amended when Matt Banahan scored the first try after nine minutes. Eastmond doubled the lead inside the first quarter. Ollie Devoto missed the conversion but found his range as he went on to exchange penalties with Nick Evans. Quins trailed by 10 points at half time but the reliable Evans opened the scoring with anther penalty early in the second half. Bath continued to dominate the set piece and their pressure in the scrum resulted in a yellow card for Sinckler in the 54th minute. He was joined in the sin bin by George Robson and Will Collier and, with a three-man advantage, Bath gave Burgess the orders to warm up. He came on for back Horacio Agulla and it took three defenders to bring him down on his first carry. Forwards Ross Batty and Leroy Houston then extended the lead with further tries. There was plenty of excitement at the Rec as rugby league superstar Sam Burgess was named on the bench .

"The Philadelphia Eagles and Detroit Lions both served up  Thanksgiving Day routs to move atop their divisions while the Seattle Seahawks boosted their playoff hopes with a commanding win on Thursday. The Lions served up the day's first course by mauling the Chicago Bears 34-17 before the Eagles thumped the Dallas Cowboys 33-10 in Texas. The defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks (8-4) capped the tasty triple-header with a 19-3 win over San Francisco to move within a game of the NFC West-leading Arizona Cardinals and leave the 49ers in danger of falling out of the play-off chase. Russell Wilson (left) and Richard Sherman (right) enjoy a Thanksgiving turkey after Seattle's win at the 49ers . Sherman helped a dominant Seattle Seahawks defence effort in their 19-3 victory in San Francisco . As expected the game between the two West Coast rivals was a bruising battle from the start that featured two of the league's hardest hitting teams. The Seahawks' top-ranked defence lived up to its fierce reputation by limiting the 49ers to 164 total yards of offence and a 40-yard Phil Dawson field goal. An interception by Seattle's All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman set up the game's only touchdown, Russell Wilson hitting Robert Turbin with 13-yard strike while Steven Hauschka handled the rest of scoring with four field goals. The Detroit Lions began the Thanksgiving day programme with a win over the Chicago Bears . Joique Bell dives over the top for a Detroit Lions touchdown at Ford Field . 'It's a huge game to win, on their turf it is pretty tough to do,' said Wilson, who completed 15 passes for 236 yards. 'One game at a time, we know there are a lot of great teams to play, NFC is not easy to win against, we are excited about the opportunity, championship mindset we'll see what happens.' Dallas and Philadelphia came into the game as co-leaders of the NFC East but when time expired it was the Eagles alone atop the division after quarterback Mark Sanchez ran for a touchdown and threw for another while LeSean McCoy rumbled for 159 yards and a score. The Eagles took control early with Sanchez diving in from two yards out to cap an impressive opening drive before hooking up with Jordan Matthews on a 27-yard touchdown strike on their next possession for a 14-0 first quarter lead. Calvin Johnson catches a touchdown pass from Matt Stafford in the second quarter . Fans in Detroit wear turkeys on their heads while watching the game to celebrate Thanksgiving . DeMarco Murray, the NFL's leading rusher, put Dallas on the scoreboard when he dove over from the one early in the second but the Eagles would answer with three Cody Parkey field goals to take a 23-7 advantage into the intermission. Dallas converted a LeSean McCoy fumble into a short Dan Bailey field goal early in the third quarter but on the next possession McCoy made up for his drop by racing 38 yards for a touchdown to put Eagles up 30-10. 'It is a team win, that's all it's about,' said McCoy, praising his offensive line. 'We've been criticized all year, all the doubters, but no matter who is in there they give 110 percent and that's what it is about. LeSean McCoy's rushing effort led the Philadelphia Eagles to a huge win over the Dallas Cowboys . Pitbull (right) and Neyo perform during half-time on Thanksgiving Day in Texas .

The Lions (8-4), who entered their game tied with the Seahawks and 49ers for the final NFC Conference playoff berth, are now joint top in the NFC North with the Green Bay Packers. Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford completed 34 of 45 passes for 390 yards and two touchdown passes to Calvin Johnson to put the Lions in position to secure their first playoff berth since the NFL's 2011 season. Trailing 14-3 after the first quarter, Stafford threw two second-quarter touchdowns to Calvin Johnson sandwiched around a one-yard run from Joique Bell, his first of two scores on the day, that gave Detroit the lead for good.","Detroit Lions beat Chicago Bears 34-17 at Ford Field .

"Injured Arsenal star Jack Wilshere was up with the lark on Friday morning as he recovered from his ankle operation on Thursday. The 22-year-old faces quite some time on the sidelines, but that was not enough to dampen his spirits as he kicked back and watched the latest sporting news. Cup of tea in hand and his his foot neatly wrapped in bandages, the Gunners midfielder took to social media to show his fans that his mind is still in the game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger: Jack Wilshere is out for three months . Jack Wilshere showed off his bandaged ankle as he recovered from Thursday's surgical procedure . On Thursday Wilshere posted a picture of his ankle in a cast after the operation and insisted he will return soon . Posting a picture on his Instagram on Friday, the England midfielder, who was injured in a challenge with Manchester United defender Patrick McNair, was laid up on a couch with his crutches at his side. Not wanting to miss a minute of the action, Wilshere wrote: 'Early morning catch up on @SkySportsNewsHQ.' The injury has led to Wilshere becoming the subject of criticism, with one media outlet saying he has 'brittle ankles.' The image Wilshere shared on his personal Instagram account showing Paddy McNair's challenge . Letting loose on his Instagram account once again, the Arsenal man showed an image of the challenge with Paddy McNair that led to his injury. 'As this picture clearly shows' most people/players would have broken their ankle if someone tackled them like this. 'Luckily I have 'loose joints', not brittle' and only damaged ligaments #Fool #GetTheFacts,' Wilshere finished. On Friday, Wenger said of the midfielder: ‘He’s prepared and focused to come back and finish the season well. 'I think he will be back at the end of February, beginning of March and he will focus on coming back to rehab, having a strong rehab, and then I’m sure he will help us to do well until the end of the season’ The midfielder posted a similar image after his last ankle surgery, on the other foot, in 2013 . Wilshere was injured during Arsenal's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium last Saturday . Wenger does not believe the 22-year-old's persistent injury problems are a result of how he plays: ‘I think his injury is just a consequence of a tackle that is very bad but not malicious because I don’t think that McNair wanted to hurt Jack,’ added Wenger. ‘He has joints that are quite lax and he deals very well with kicks and tackles. This was too hard. When you see it again, I don’t think that anybody would have escaped without surgery in this tackle.’ Wenger confirmed that Wilshere is frustrated by another injury: 'He is very down. He is a football man who loves the game. On the other hand he is very strong as well and has learnt to deal with adversity from a very young age. The midfielder has been beset by injuries, and will have missed 119 weeks of football by the time he returns . VIDEO Arsenal handed double injury blow . ‘He always comes out stronger and when I spoke with him he is already determined, it is already in his mind the final sprint to the season. He is a very strong boy.’ Ahead of their trip to West Brom on Saturday, Wilshere's injury leaves Arsenal with three recognised senior midfielders — Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky. The Gunners will also be monitoring the fitness of captain Mikel Arteta (calf) and Yaya Sanogo (hamstring) following their 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.

"A cat has been hit with 'an animal ASBO' after allegedly biting and scratching people while also damaging property. Rocky, who is owned by Samantha Davies in Rotherham, Yorkshire received a letter concerning her cat's behaviour. The letter warned that council officials received 'several complaints' about Rocky which have caused 'alarm, distress and annoyance'. Samantha Davies, pictured, with Rocky, from Rotherham claimed her cat has been hit with 'an animal ASBO' Council officials accused Rocky, pictured, of scratching and biting some of his neighbours . Ms Davies put a sign outside her back gate defending Rocky, claiming that he is not a nasty cat . Under the terms of the notice, Rocky is banned from leaving Ms Davies' house or she will have to pay any damage caused. The letter read: 'I am in receipt of several complaints regarding your cat Rocky causing alarm, distress and annoyance to other residents in the area of your property. 'Although I appreciate that cats do roam, I would prefer if you could take steps to keep your cat Rocky from leaving the perimeter of your garden in the future. 'Should further complaints be received about damage done to neighbours’ property by your pet you will be charged for the repairs.' Several residents  confirmed that Rocky would not leave their property if he jumped over a wall. Ms Davies claimed: 'Rocky doesn’t like being touched on certain parts of his body but he is certainly not aggressive. 'He has been accused of damaging property because he scratched a fence. 'The council has said if he does any more damage I’ll have to pay for it. 'The only time he has bitten someone was when they pulled its tail. 'I’ve heard of people being told to keep their dog under control, but never a cat.' Ms Davies, who is studying Maths and English at Rotherham College described the entire process as ridiculous. Ms Davies said the council's instruction to lock Rocky inside  is cruel: He's a cat and wants to be outside' She said: 'It’s just like an animal ASBO, and it is completely ridiculous. 'How can a cat behave antisocially? It’s an animal, it’s a pet - he’s not going to bite your leg off, drink alcohol in the street or try and rob your phone.' When Ms Davies phoned Rotherham Borough Council to ask about the specific complaints she was told that Rocky had allegedly bitten two people, scratched an outside fence, and had intimidated residents by entering their homes and refusing to leave. She said: 'Even if Rocky did do these things, it’s hardly what you’d deem to be antisocial behaviour. 'But where’s the proof? I haven’t seen a shred of proof that any of this even happened. I think the council need to concentrate on doing their job properly instead of following up rubbish like this. 'The council told me to lock him indoors, but in this weather I think that’s extremely cruel. He’s a cat and wants to be outside. 'I’ve heard of people being told to keep their dog under control, but never a cat. It’s ridiculous.' Rocky the cat, who has been hit with an 'Animal ASBO' is banned from roaming the streets of Rotherham . Council officials said they had received one formal complaint and two verbal complaints from residents on The Lanes estate over the behaviour of four-year-old cat, Rocky. One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Rocky has bitten me on numerous occasions. 'One time he came into my house through an upstairs window and started terrorising my dog. 'I could hear him going mad and went up to see what the problem was and Rocky was there. 'When I tried to get him out the house he bit me extremely hard.' The neighbour added: 'I don’t want to see Rocky locked up, but I just want Samantha to look after him properly because he can be vicious.' Samantha Davies asked Rotherham Council to provide evidence of her cat's anti-social behaviour . Next door neighbour David Willoughby, 65, said: 'He comes over to our house quite a bit, but we don’t have a problem with him. 'He did bite me once, but that was because he got stuck and was frightened. Sam was very apologetic about it afterwards and I didn’t have a problem. 'He’s a male cat, and he needs to assert his authority, but he’s not a bad cat really. 'I certainly didn’t make a complaint about him.' Paul Walsh, Housing and Communities Service Manager for Rotherham Borough Council, denied the authority was being heavy-handed saying that it had a duty of care to neighbouring tenants, who have made one formal complaint and numerous verbal complaints about Rocky. He added: 'We do appreciate it is very difficult to control a cat once they are let out but Rocky has been causing problems around the area for quite a while now and is actually terrifying some local residents who are very vulnerable. 'Last year he allegedly bit two people and his bad behaviour has continued because he causes both internal and external damage when he visits neighbouring properties. He certainly does not like being challenged and lives up to his boxing namesake!. 'We have asked his owner to take reasonable steps to try and cut down his wandering and have advised the neighbours to use a variety of cat deterrents, which certainly includes not feeding him. 'The warning letter is very much a last resort and if the owner takes reasonable steps to control him and we get no further reports from neighbouring residents then obviously this will go no further. 'As part of their tenancy agreements all pet-owning council tenants must keep any animal at their property under proper control so that they do not cause a danger, nuisance or annoyance to their neighbours or anyone visiting the property or the locality. 'This often refers to dogs but cats can also cause problems, as this case has illustrated.'

"In the week since Manny Pacquiao dominated and dismantled Chris Algieri over 12 lop-sided rounds in Macau, the clamour for him to fight Floyd Mayweather Jnr has reached unprecedented levels. Pacquiao stoked the flames by dutifully calling out Mayweather to anyone who would listen and his promoter Bob Arum quickly followed suit, as he had done with gusto in the build up. The WBC, whose welterweight and light-middleweight titles Mayweather holds, then claimed they will do whatever they can to make the fight despite having ranked the pair as No 1 and No 2 for the last year without installing Pacquiao as Mayweather's mandatory challenger. Floyd Mayweather has been quiet amid speculation over a fight with Manny Pacquiao . Pacquiao (right) defeated Chris Algieri to win the WBO world welterwight title on Saturday night . 'If Mayweather retires without defeating Pacquiao, the question about being the best in the world will linger,' said president Mauricio Sulaiman. 'There is no fight in this decade that has been expected for so long.' Indeed, it is now five years since the fight first captured the imagination after Pacquiao stopped Miguel Cotto in 2009. Las Vegas bookmakers immediately installed him as the favourite to beat Mayweather. But rows over drug testing, purse splits and promotional disputes have almost strangled the life out of the so-called 'Fight of the Century'. Pacquiao knocked Algieri down six times during the fight in Macau, which he won on points . On Thursday, promoter Oscar De La Hoya tweeted: 'I'm prepared to put up the biggest guarantee in sports history to give the fans The Fight.' That followed reports in the Philippines that Mayweather would be guaranteed $100million with Pacquiao pocketing $80m were they to finally touch gloves. But amid all the commotion, one man has remained silent; Mayweather himself. In fact, when he commented on the fight last month, he rubbished comments from his dad and trainer Floyd Snr that the two would finally meet in the ring. 'Well my father is totally wrong... the best thing for Pacquiao to do is be quiet before he really gets exposed,' he said. Mayweather (right) beat Marcos Maidana in his last fight to take his record to 47-0 . 'They're bringing up my name to sell tickets. All you've got to do is look at his [pay-per-view] numbers that he did on his last couple of fights and look at my numbers.' And his numbers are certainly impressive. While Pacquiao managed around 750,000 pay-per-view buys for his rematch with Timothy Bradley, Mayweather regularly hits the million mark. He was also named the richest sportsman in the world in 2013 by Forbes magazine having earned $105million for just two fights, against Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Marcos Maidana. Reports in the Philippines stated that Pacquiao would pocket $80m if the pair were to finally touch gloves . He could replicate that over the next 12 months from his final two fights on his Showtime television contract, expected to take place in May and September next year. Another two victories would take 'Money' to 49-0, an identical record to legendary heavyweight Rocky Marciano. Is he willing to risk that against Pacquiao? Even if he is, Mayweather's relationship with key promoters remains a barrier. Mayweather, according to the reports, would earn $100 million if he were to fight Pacquiao . His bi-annual fights are broadcast on Showtime in the United States while Pacquiao's are broadcast on HBO. Both networks are believed to be ready to show the fight simultaneously, as they did with Mike Tyson against Lennox Lewis in 2002. But HBO have a deal with De La Hoya's Golden Boy and he hopes to schedule Alvarez's prospective fight with Miguel Cotto on the May date normally reserved for Mayweather. And in the same Fight Hype interview, Mayweather said: 'Oscar De La Hoya has always been disloyal; very disloyal... De La Hoya is a piece of s***. Oscar is a snake!' The Filipino fighter was given a hero's welcome on his return to his home country this week . But that hurdle pales into insignificance when compared to Mayweather's feud with Arum. Having signed him to his Top Rank company after the 1996 Olympics, Arum promoted Mayweather for the best part of a decade until he struck out on his own following a disagreement over how he was being marketed. And a year ago, Mayweather said the Pacquiao fight will never happen 'because I will never do business with Bob Arum again.' Mayweather (left) eyes up Maidana during his title fight in Las Vegas in September, 2014 . He also told Pacquiao to leave Top Rank if he wants the fight to take place but the Filipino recently signed a new deal to take him through to 2016 and likely his retirement to the Senate in his homeland. That leaves public pressure and the hope that Mayweather's ego relents for long enough for him to agree to what would be the richest fight in history. For as straightforward as his victory over Alvarez was last year, few disagreed that it was a good test even if it came slightly too early for the young Mexican. An aerial view of the ring shows Algieri knocked to the floor during a bout with Pacquiao last weekend . Maidana then surprised many with his performance but there was little doubt about the result at the final bell. The rematch served only to allow Mayweather to notch another fight on his Showtime bedpost. And as the world waits for the next lucky winner of the 'Mayweather lottery', there is a diminishing list of names who would provide credible opposition. Bolton's Amir Khan, who 12 months ago was so sure he would face Mayweather that he scrapped a fight with then world champion Devon Alexander, remains on the shortlist. Amir Khan (left) is still on the shortlist to face Mayweather, but he must beat Devon Alexander in December . But first, ironically, he must beat Alexander in Las Vegas on December 13. Khan aside, only Danny Garcia, currently operating at light-welterweight, stands out but he would not bring the razzmatazz that both Khan and Pacquiao guarantee. Whether Mayweather cares remains to be seen. December 5, 2009: ESPN report Pacquiao has signed a contract to fight Mayweather which the Filipino later denies. December 11: Yahoo report an eight-page contract was sent to Pacquiao with a proposed date of March 13, 2010. December 22: Golden Boy claim Pacquiao is unwilling to agree to Olympic-style drug testing. December 30: Pacquiao sues Mayweather, alleging him of making defamatory statements regarding performance-enhancing drugs. July 13, 2010: Arum gives Mayweather a week to sign the contract for the fight. July 19: Mayweather's adviser Al Haymon denies negotiations have ever taken place. January 20, 2012: EPSN reports that Mayweather spoke to Pacquiao on the phone and offered him $40m but Pacquiao demanded a 55/45 split in Mayweather's favour. September 25: Mayweather and Pacquiao reach a settlement in their defamation case. December 20, 2013: Mayweather says the fight will never happen while Pacquiao is promoted by Bob Arum. January, 2014: Pacquiao challenges Mayweather to fight him but to donate all proceeds to charity.

"A huge stone carving crafted by the ancient Mayan civilisation that has been hidden inside a pyramid in Guatemala for centuries, shows a battle of superpowers in 6th Century Central America, archaeologists have said. The giant frieze featuring inscriptions and brightly coloured painting was discovered last month at a dig in the north east Peten region of the country at the Holmul archaeological dig. The archaeologists believe evidence suggests that the rulers of the region were embroiled in a political clash of the titans between the kings of Kaanul - the Snake Kingdom - and the kings of Tikal. Archaeologist Anya Shetler cleans an inscription below an ancient stucco frieze recently unearthed in the buried Maya city of Holmul in the Peten region of Guatemala. The frieze of the Maya culture is 8m long and 2m tall ans is one of the best preserved examples of its kind according to the Holmul Archaeological Project . The frieze, which is eight metres wide and two metres tall and stands along the exterior of a multi-roomed rectangular building, was found in a 20 metre high pyramid built in the 8th Century, in a style typical of the Maya. Much of the building still remains . encased under the rubble of the later 20m-high structure. The carving is . painted in red, with details in blue, green and yellow. Francisco Estrada-Belli, director of the Holmul Archaeological Project that made the discovery, said: 'This is a unique find. It is a . beautiful work of art and it tells us so much about the function and . meaning of the building, which was what we were looking for.' The carving depicts human figures in a mythological setting, suggesting they may be deified rulers. It shows three human figures wearing elaborate bird headdresses and jade jewels seated cross-legged over the head of a mountain spirit known as a witz. A cartouche on the headdress contains . glyphs identifying each individual by name. The central figure’s name is . the only one that is legible but the inscription says: Och Chan Yopaat, meaning 'the storm god enters . the sky.' Two feathered serpents emerge from the mountain spirit below . the main character and form an arch with their bodies. The frieze shows images of governors, Gods and inscriptions. The central human figure wears an elaborate bird headdress and jade jewels ans is seated cross-legged over the head of a mountain spirit known as a witz . Under each of . them is a seated figure of an aged god holding a sign that reads 'first . tamale.' In front of the serpents’ mouths are the two additional human . figures, also seated on mountain spirit heads. At the bottom of the carving there are bands of glyphs that reveal the grand frieze was commissioned by the ruler of Naranjo - a superpower kingdom south of Holmul. In the dedication, king Ajwosaj Chan K’inich claims to have restored the local ruling line and patron deities. The images and glyphic text on the . frieze also provide information about political actors in the Maya . Lowlands well beyond this small kingdom. The writing says the ruler, was also referred to as a 'vassal of the Kaanul king' the snake lord. 'When this building was erected, Kanul . kings were already on their way to controlling much of the lowlands, . except Tikal of course,' said Estrada-Belli. Mr Estrada-Belli told NBC News: 'It's all a grand scheme of building a Maya empire. Sometimes the Kaanul kings were on top. Sometimes Tikal was on top. But there was nothing chaotic about it.' At the bottom of the carving there are bands of glyphs (pictured) that reveal the grand frieze was commissioned by the ruler of Naranjo - a superpower kingdom south of Holmul. In the dedication, king Ajwosaj Chan K¿inich claims to have restored the local ruling line and patron deities . According to Alex Tokovinine, a Harvard University Maya epigrapher who worked on the project, the text places the building in the decade of the 590s and provides the first glimpse of the remarkable extent of Ajwosaj’s political and religious authority. 'It also reveals how a new order was literally imprinted on a broader landscape of local gods and ancestors,' she said. At the time, the Tikal kings had established new dynasties and . far-reaching alliances with kingdoms throughout the Maya Lowlands, . perhaps thanks to a connection with Mesoamerica’s greatest state, . Teotihuacan. Tikal suffered a defeat in the year 562 . by the Kanul 'Snake' kingdom, which, for the following 180 years, would . come to dominate most other Lowland kingdoms. The find came as the team excavated in a tunnel left open by looters. The archaeologists unearthed a tomb associated with the pyramid last year containing an individual accompanied by 28 ceramic vessels and a wooden funerary mask. It was found in a cavity dug into the stairway leading up to the building and the skeleton of an adult male and his ceramic offering were preserved by large limestone slabs that kept the tomb free of debris. Intriguingly his incisor and canine teeth had been drilled and filled with jade beads, while two miniature flower-shaped ear spools were also found. The archeologists said the iconography on the vessels discovered in the tomb bore clear references to the nine lords of the underworld as well as to the aged sun god of the underworld. There were two sets of nine painted bowls decorated with the water lily motif and nine red-painted plates and one spouted tripod plate decorated with the image of the god of the underworld emerging from a shell. Because of the unusually high number of vessels and the jade dental decorations, Mr Estrada-Belli believes the individual found may have been a member of the ruling class at Holmul. The team hopes to return to the area in 2014 to continue exploring and to preserve the buildings. The research was supported by the National Geographic Society/Waitt Grants Programme.","An ancient frieze found in a 20 metre tall pyramid in Guatemala, shows the battle of superpowers in 6th Century Central America .

"Having cancelled last Christmas following a defeat at Sunderland, Jose Mourinho is returning to Wearside on Saturday with a plan to reward his team’s brilliant start to the season with a little more festive spirit. It will be a family bash, rather than a boozy night out, and will be squeezed among eight games in December as thanks for the ‘clear change’ in attitude during a campaign which has started without defeat in 19 games. ‘They are doing very well,’ said Mourinho. ‘Probably because of that, the club is preparing a little Christmas party for them and their families.’ Jose Mourinho is in an excellent mood after Chelsea's superb unbeaten start to the season . Chelsea players Diego Costa (left), Gary Cahill (centre) and John Terry in training on Thursday . Blues goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois jumps to fist one away during the session at Cobham . Last year, after losing at Sunderland in the Capital One Cup, plans for a players’ night out were scrapped on the orders of the manager. ‘There are Christmas parties and Christmas parties,’ the Chelsea boss said. ‘This is one the families deserve and the boys are very happy to be with their families. This is a squad with a lot of kids aged from a couple of weeks to 10 years old. It’s good for them. For good things, we will find the time. ‘I have to go to say a couple of words and, after that, to leave them there with their families and kids.’ Chelsea are six points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League and eight ahead of champions Manchester City. They are into the Capital One Cup quarter-finals and the last 16 of the Champions League and the manager is confident a significant corner has been turned. ‘They have changed,’ said Mourinho. ‘There was an evolution in these young people, a clear evolution. I don’t think the group can be complacent but it’s not a risk we have because it’s not the profile of this group. We were winning 5-0 against Schalke in the 88th minute and Eden Hazard made a sprint to defend. Minute 88, winning 5-0.’ Eden Hazard is challenged for the ball by Marco Hoeger during Chelsea's 5-0 win over Schalke on Tuesday . Cesc Fabregas, along with Hazard, has been nominated for the FIFPro Team of the Year . In May Mourinho claimed Hazard was not ready to sacrifice himself for the team but noted an improvement as he criticised FIFPro’s Team of the Year award, for which several Chelsea players are shortlisted, with Hazard and Cesc Fabregas among the midfield nominees, revealed yesterday. ‘This kind of trophy is not good for football,’ said Mourinho. ‘Sometimes it looks like we are looking for stars and people to be more important than others. This is not the culture we want in this club. ‘The mentality here is not to be obsessed with that. When I see these names, Fabregas and Hazard, I think clearly they don’t think about it. They think about the team, about playing well and trying to win matches.’ Gus Poyet could become the first manager to beat Jose Mourinho three times in a row on Saturday . Sunderland ended Mourinho's 77-game unbeaten run at Stamford Bridge with a 2-1 win in April . Sunderland’s Gus Poyet can become the first manager to inflict three successive defeats on Mourinho with victory at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Never, in 14 years in the dug-out, has the Portuguese suffered three straight losses at the hands of an opposite number. Sunderland were 2-1 winners in the Capital One Cup quarter-final in December and repeated the scoreline in April to end Mourinho’s 77-match unbeaten run at Stamford Bridge. And, for once, former Chelsea midfielder Poyet is relieved that the omens rest with his side. He said: ‘We’re usually on the wrong end of stats. We hadn’t won for ages on a Monday night and we didn’t beat someone for 50 years, but now we’re on the right side, so let me enjoy it. ‘We know how tough it’s going to be but it’s great to have the opportunity to beat them. Let’s try to do that.’","Jose Mourinho not planning to cancel Christmas again this year .

"Brendan Rodgers is adamant Liverpool’s dreadful autumn form will not derail their ambitions of ending the season with a top four place. Such has been the dramatic reversal in Liverpool’s fortunes, Rodgers – who just six months ago was named the LMA Manager of the Year – had to field questions yesterday on how he felt having his odds slashed by bookmakers in the ‘sack race’. This has been a testing period for Rodgers. Liverpool have not won a game since October 28 in any competition and their struggles have left the Northern Irishman pacing his kitchen in the middle of the night, trying to find solutions to their problems. Brendan Rodgers was voted LMA Manager of the Year last season, but has had a tough start to 2014/15 . Liverpool sit 12th in the Premier League, and haven't won a match in any competition since October 28 . So managers can clam up in these types of situations but Rodgers, who will keep faith with under-fire No 1 Simon Mignolet for today’s Anfield collision with Stoke after holding a meeting with him at Melwood, was relaxed as he discussed the shortcomings that have left Liverpool in twelfth place. More than anything, though, he was resolute in stating his that his side will claw back any lost ground and fulfil the aim of Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners, and secure a place in next year’s Champions League. For all that they have been wretched, their rivals have not pulled away. ‘I have an inherent belief that we can still make the top four – absolutely,’ said Rodgers. ‘I know what we are all capable of here. For whatever reason, it hasn’t happened for us yet but I said to the players the other night our standards will go up after the game against Ludogorets. ‘Thankfully no matter how we have been, we are still within touching distance and that is the initial aim. Fourth and then moving forward. If that is the aim – and we are only five points off it – then that gives me belief we have every chance of doing it. ‘I am not saying it is going to be easy or hard. We obviously have to pick up form but I saw enough encouragement from the group the other night that we are going to move forward and now is the time to do that. Ludogorets scored a late equaliser through Georgi Terziev to nick a surprise draw against Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday night - another disappointing result for Rodgers . Rodgers watches on as Liverpool struggle to a draw against minnows Ludogorets in the Champions League . ‘If we put a run of results together then we have the experience from last year. The players went through it and did it then. I have every belief we can do it. Sometimes things are never as bad as people say or write. They are not always as good as people say or write, either. ‘For me, stay calm. We will be better for sure and let that be seen on the field in their actions. I am satisfied that all I can do with what I have is the best I can possibly do. When you do that and put hours and hours into your work and study and manage to motivate players that makes you relaxed.’ He is also realistic. Rodgers recognises how capricious football can be and for all that he has the unequivocal backing of FSG’s leading men, John W Henry, Tom Werner and Mike Gordon, a couple of positive results are required to turn down the noise others are making about his future. ‘I know I will fight for my life to be here for as long as I can; if there is a rocky spell then that is something you never like as a manager,’ said Rodgers. ‘You never like seeing or hearing things like you are the bookies favourite to get the sack when six months ago I was Manager of the Year. ‘But that is modern football. All I can do is my best and I will continue to do my best. While I do that, I will always be relaxed knowing that whenever that time comes from the owners, whether it is in a month or 10 years, I’ll walk out of here having given my absolute all. I am happy with that.’ On Sunday, Liverpool lost 3-1 to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park - but Rodgers insists they can make top four . Mile Jedinak (second left) celebrates after scoring Palace's third in the rain at Selhurst on Sunday . One thing Rodgers has not lost through all this is his confidence. Sir Alex Ferguson revealed in his autobiography that his belief in his ability was rattled early in his career after enduring a month without winning but Rodgers has not lost sight of what he is trying to achieve. ‘I have faith in my methods and a way of working,’ said Rodgers. ‘We have been given a different deck of cards and, as a coach, I have to do what I think gets the best out of them. I have methods, a belief and a philosophy but you also have to get results. I am not a fantasist.’ It will take time for them to find the sparkle of last year but not losing is the immediate priority and it remains to be seen whether Rodgers will reward Lucas Leiva for an encouraging return to action in the 2-2 draw with Ludogorets with his first Barclays Premier League start since September 20. ‘I am 27 now and probably my best years are still to come,’ said the Brazilian, whose long-term future is still uncertain. ‘Of course I want to play. The day that I walk into Melwood and feel ok about not playing? That is not me. I am not the type of person who just wants to collect his money. It is not me and has never been me. Of course I am not happy not to be playing. When you play, you feel that you can help the team and you feel better.’","Six months ago, Brendan Rodgers was named LMA Manager of the Year .

"When James Dyson reinvented the hand dryer, everyone was surprised at how such as a simple concept could work so effectively. Now one New York-based company is planning to replicate the success of Dyson's AirBlade, but for the entire body.

"Louis van Gaal has poked fun at Manchester United's official Twitter feed after they mistakenly reported last week that Daley Blind would be sidelined for six months with a knee injury. Giving his press conference ahead of Saturday's home match with Hull City, Van Gaal joked that after being 'misinterpreted' last time he had asked his medical advisor to provide him with a list of the current injuries at the club. After Blind damaged knee ligaments in Holland's European Championship qualifying win over Latvia, United's Twitter feed said he would be on the sidelines for six months. Scroll down for video . Louis van Gaal made a joke at the expense of Manchester United's Twitter feed after they mistakenly reported last week that midfielder Daley Blind would be out injured for six months . Blind injured his knee ligaments during Holland's European Championship qualifier with Latvia . In reality, as Van Gaal confirmed on Friday, Blind will return to the club on Monday and should be back in action in a couple of weeks. The Dutch manager said: 'Last time I have said something and it was not so good interpreted. So, I have asked my medical advisor. Maybe Manchester United Twitter account can pay attention to it.' To the sounds of laughter from the journalists in the room, Van Gaal then produces a pair of glasses and begins reading slowly from a piece of paper. 'So, Luke [Shaw] sustained an ankle ligament injury but with no serious complications and he will be out for the next few weeks because of this.' One reporter shouts: 'Not six months then' in reference to the Blind tweet. Blind posted this picture on Twitter last week showing his heavily bandaged knee . Van Gaal suggested that Blind could return to action in a few weeks' time . United's injury problems do seem to be easing ahead of Saturday's match at Old Trafford as they bid to stay in the Barclays Premier League top four. Van Gaal confirmed that striker Radamel Falcao and defender Marcos Rojo will both return to the squad for the Hull match. The Colombia striker, who has scored just once since joining United on loan from Monaco on transfer deadline day, has not played for five weeks because of a calf injury. Rojo dislocated his shoulder in the 1-0 defeat to Manchester City at the start of this month and may be involved. Van Gaal's injury problems seem to be easing though several key personnel remain on the sidelines . Van Gaal confirmed that striker Radamel Falcao would be included in United's matchday squad for Hull . Defender Marcos Rojo is also set to return for the Old Trafford encounter with Hull City . Luke Shaw is expected to miss between four and six weeks with his ankle ligament injury . ‘We have to wait and see in the last training session,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I live day by day at this moment. 'It’s always difficult to say but we have good news. Maybe Falcao and Rojo come back in the 18, that’s it I think. The rest were already fit.’ He confirmed that Shaw will be absent for between four and six weeks with the ankle ligament injury sustained in United's 2-1 win at Arsenal last Saturday. Van Gaal also confirmed that he has given Blind a holiday after the midfielder suffered his injury in Holland's 6-0 win at the Amsterdam ArenA. The United boss said: ‘I gave Daley Blind a holiday because in the first week it is more or less rest than exercise. He didn’t have so much holiday because of the World Cup. You may remember the Netherlands were there until the end. ‘He will come back on Monday. Then he has to exercise and practise every day because an injured player has to train more than a fit player.’ Head here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.","The Manchester United Twitter account mistakenly tweeted last week that Daley Blind would be out for six months with knee ligament damage .

"New Jersey police said they have identified more than one person of interest over the unsolved murder of four prostitutes whose bodies were found in Atlantic City in November 2006. No suspects have yet been named, but the case has taken officers from the bright lights of Atlantic City in New Jersey, to Florida, Missouri and Alaska. The women, aged between 19 and 42, had been killed and their bodies dumped within 50 yards of each other in a drainage ditch close to the town's casinos. Discovery: Kimberly Raffo, 35, was found first . Victim: Molly Dilts, 19, was killed first . Police told Fox News they were 'quietly and aggressively working the case', and that their investigation had taken them across the U.S. as they tried to make connections with similar killings. The search for the serial killer began in November 2006, when two women found the body of Kimberly Raffo, 35. She was laying face down in run-off water filled with fecal matter and chemical waste, behind the Golden Key Motel. When police arrived they found the bodies of three other women, all barefoot but clothed, in the same ditch, all of them prostitutes. Because their shoes were missing it led to speculation that the killer may have a foot fetish, and had kept the shoes as a trophy, according to the New York Times. Miss Raffo, and the other victims - 19-year-old Molly Dilts, Tracy Ann Roberts, 23, and Barbara Breidor, 42 - all had children, and all had been forced to turn to the sex trade for money. Miss Roberts and Miss Raffo, who were the more recent victims, had been strangled, but the bodies of Miss Dilts, the first victim, and Miss Breidor were so decomposed a cause of death could not be established. Only two of them had been reported missing before the bodies were found. Attack: Tracy Ann Roberts, 23, had been strangled . Killed: Barbara Breidor, 42, was the oldest victim . 'This fits the FBI definition of a . serial killer,' Atlantic County Prosecutor James P. McClain said last week. 'From the facts gathered during the investigation, . it could have been a local person or it could have been a transient.' Kate . D’Adamo, a spokesman for the Sex Workers Outreach . Project, said it was likely that other women had encountered the killer, but did not . report it to police for fear of a prostitution arrest. Despite the case remaining unsolved for seven years however, Mr Mclain said it did not mean police were not concerned about prostitutes. 'No one should ever think that . because someone works as a prostitute or works in the sex trade that . they’re not going to get law enforcement’s best efforts. Everybody . counts,' he said. Mr McClain, who is the third prosecutor to take office since the bodies was found, added: 'I have great hope in . justice. I’ll never give up on that.' The case has been linked previously to the ten bodies found in Long Island in 2010. The month before she was killed, Miss Raffo had been staying a motel close to where the bodies were found in Gilgo Beach. The connection led authorities in 2011 to question whether the killer used several methods of murder and display in order to confuse authorities, or if more than one murderer was involved, according to the Examiner.","Case has taken detectives from Florida to Alaska as they try to catch killer .

"Radamel Falcao is ready to boost Manchester United’s firepower by returning from injury against Hull City at Old Trafford on Saturday. The Colombia striker’s fitness has been in question since he joined United on loan from Monaco in the summer and he has not played for five weeks because of a calf injury. But manager Louis van Gaal revealed that Falcao is set to return to the squad this weekend, and Marcos Rojo may also be included after recovering from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in the Manchester derby at the start of this month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal reads list of injuries in joke at club's twitter feed . Louis van Gaal switches on the Christmas lights at Old Trafford on Thursday night . Radamel Falcao (centre) was back in training this week, and is set for a return to action against Hull . Juan Mata (left) and Ashley Young were in good spirits as United trained at Carrington on Friday . Falcao (left) is set for a return against Hull at the weekend, and United were in good spirits at training . Defender Marcos Rojo is also set to return to action after recovering from a dislocated shoulder . ‘We have to wait and see in the last training session,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I live day by day at this moment. It’s always difficult to say but we have good news. Maybe Falcao and Rojo come back in the 18, that’s it I think. The rest were already fit.’ Falcao, who will cost in excess of £50million if United sign him permanently in the summer, has made only five appearances so far and scored once. Asked if he believes the former Porto and Atletico Madrid striker can rediscover the form that made him one of the most feared strikers in world football, Van Gaal added: ‘I hope so because we have him on loan because of that. ‘Every player in my selection has to fight for his position. I shall always take the best of the players and it has to be suitable for the mix of players. It’s also an obligation of a player that he does that.’ Wayne Rooney led the line as the United squad took part in sprint drills on Friday .

Luke Shaw is set to miss between four and six weeks with ankle ligament damage sustained against Arsenal . Manchester United sit fourth in the Premier League table ahead of the weekend's match . United still have a worrying injury list with Luke Shaw the latest to be ruled out for between four and six weeks with the ankle ligament damage he suffered against Arsenal last weekend. Van Gaal also confirmed that he has given Daley Blind a holiday after the midfielder suffered a knee injury playing for Holland earlier this month. The United boss said: ‘Luke sustained an ankle ligament injury but with no serious complications. He will be out for the next few weeks because of this. ‘I gave Daley Blind a holiday because in the first week it is more or less rest than exercise. He didn’t have so much holiday because of the World Cup. You may remember the Netherlands were there until the end. ‘He will come back on Monday. Then he has to exercise and practise every day because an injured player has to train more than a fit player.’ Daley Blind, who injured his knee on international duty, will report back to United on Monday . Van Gaal was guarded in his optimism that United will end the season in the Champions League places . United’s victory at the Emirates lifted them into fourth place but Van Gaal was guarded in his optimism at seeing his team among the Champions League spots despite the injury problems and a fixture list that has seen them face Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in three of the last four games. ‘I don’t want to mention that (injuries) as a manager because I want to speak about the fit players, but you’re right when you see how our preparation was, how many injuries, and then how heavy our second part of the matches were,’ he added. ‘It was a very big test but after (playing) heavy opponents we are still a force so I’m happy. But we have to be a force at the end of the league, not now. Now is not so important. We have to improve our playing style and beat our opponents more easily.’ Former United skipper Steve Bruce returns to Old Trafford with Hull on Saturday to take charge of his 700th Premier League game as a manager. At the age of 63, Van Gaal knows he is unlikely to reach the same milestone. ‘It says that he is a very good manager I think, but I don’t know, I cannot judge him,’ he said. ‘When you have 700 Premier League matches, I don’t think I will reach that amount. ‘I have seen him playing for Manchester United. He was a very firm and also a leader. Mostly players who are leaders become managers.’ Head here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Tyson Fury has been exchanging letters with Charles Bronson and has revealed that his beard is inspired by Britain's most violent prisoner. Fury goes toe-to-toe with fellow Brit Dereck Chisora at London's ExCel Arena on Saturday night in a WBO world title final eliminator to set up a bout with champion Wladimir Klitschko. And ahead of the fight 26-year-old Fury admitted to having communication with Bronson, who has spent most of the last 40 years locked up for violent crimes, and even plans on visiting him when he has the time. Tyson Fury has revealed he has been exchanging letters with notorious criminal Charles Bronson . The boxer also amits he wants to visit Bronson in prison when he has the time . Tyson Fury may have to shave off his beard ahead of the fight against Dereck Chisora . Charles Bronson has spent most the last 40 years behind bars for violent crimes . 'I have written to him a couple of times and he has written back to me. It was just general stuff between us. You could say I suppose the letters were one crazy man to another,' Fury told The Sun's Pat Sheehan. 'I'm really busy at the moment but I would like to go and see him when I get the time.' The heavyweight claims Bronson's famous beard was the inspiration behind his own facial hair, which he may be forced to shave off before the fight. Fury has admitted that his inactivity is his only weakness against Chisora . Fury was put through his paces during an open work out at Peacock's Gym in Canning Town . The British Boxing Board of Control  has a rule that states a boxer's chin must be visible when fighting, and Fury says he has no problems shaving the beard. 'I was originally inspired by the beard that Charles Bronson grew.' 'If Chisora's camp want me to shave it off because of some rule, then fine, I will take it off, no problem. If they want me to shave down below, I'll do that as well or maybe they want me to have a waxing... I'll do that for them too.'","Tyson Fury faces Dereck Chisora at the ExCel Arena on Saturday night .

"You spend half an hour putting on your make-up only to sweat it off, do your squats wrong so he'll come adjust your pose and you've spent a fortune on tight new gym gear. Oh dear, fancy your personal trainer? We've all been there. Including Madonna. And rumour has it, Kym Marsh has now got the hots for hers. But as one of Britain's top PTs reveals, as long as you're training together, it's best to keep things in the gym and out of the bedroom... You can't deny Andy's a tasty dish, but Diane had to hold off until their gym sessions ended . By Andy McGlynn, Director of Lifestyle Fitness Personal Training, lsfpt.co.uk and the UK's leading trainer of Personal Trainers. 'During my many years in the business unfortunately I can recount many a tale of personal trainers becoming romantically involved with their clients, and an unsurprisingly 99 per cent of the time it does not end in a loving, lasting relationship. 'If you do become attracted to your client, and vice versa, the only way to pursue it is to terminate the professional contract as soon as you realise you have developed feelings for the other person. 'I first met my now partner, Diane (Jet from Gladiators) when I became her PT. 'It was only later, once we had finished training together that we pursued a personal relationship. I have no doubt that if we had continued our personal trainer and client relationship whilst embarking on something romantic, it would have failed on both counts. He has twelve years of personal training management experience behind him . 'It's such a cliché and any . career-minded PT would never cross that line at work so it's really . frustrating to see the latest headlines about personal trainer Matt . Baker allegedly 'finding romance' with his client, Coronation Street's . Kym Marsh. Once again the actions of a minority threaten to undermine . the credibility of our industry. 'I have been in the personal trainer management business for 12 years and have trained over 1,000 individuals. 'The average age is 26 and so it's quite a young, vibrant industry but there is one very strict rule for every single person I train - 'no sex with clients' - and anyone refusing to agree will be shown the door without exception. 'In the capacity of personal trainer you are being entrusted with your client's health and well-being, and to take advantage of that whilst they're in your care is unacceptable. 'If a patient started seeing their doctor or physician it would be at the very least frowned upon, and would no doubt cause outrage among his peers and other patients, yet it seems the same rules don't apply to our industry. 'There is a stigma around personal trainers and their female clients and there's a tendency to treat it as a bit of a joke. But it's something that not only breaks up marriages, but also casts our industry in a somewhat seedy light. I've worked tirelessly in my career to drive up the credibility of personal training, but this type of behaviour playing out in the media with celebrities and their trainers totally undermines that. 'The problem with so many male personal trainers having relationships with their clients is that it's normally habitual - it becomes the way for them to meet women and the pattern ends up replaying itself over and over again. 'The standing joke in one gym I know is . that if you sign up for sessions with one particular trainer, you . automatically sign up for an affair! hat guy must have some angry . husbands after him, not to mention the trail of ‘heartbroken' women he's . leaving behind. 'But this is the problem. More often than not the . relationship is being treated much more seriously by one party than the . other. A sure sign of this is if the attraction is purely lust-driven . and there is little to no romance or effort being made outside the gym. 'Of course, sometimes there will be more to it than just a spark of sexual chemistry and it may be that you have met your potential soul-mate in your PT. Andy lives with ex-client Diane Youdale (Jet from Gladiators) 'If this is the case the only way for a personal relationship to succeed is if it becomes genuine and the professional training contract is terminated immediately. The couple are then free to get to know each other as with any other potential partner and it removes any need for secrecy or deceit, which are not the foundations for a healthy partnership. 'If the trainer is serious about the relationship he won't want to jeopardise either his career or a possible future with the client, so he will instigate a termination in the contract. 'Sadly though this rarely happens in my experience and it tends to be a fling, an affair or a fumble in the sunbed room or car park. 'I have come across these types of affairs and they do typically end the same way - with the personal trainer coming to see me sheepishly asking for advice on how he can extricate himself from the situation, and the client is often left feeling humiliated. 'So, why does it happen? Clients are attracted to the stereotypical fit-looking male personal trainer. Typically he will lavish her with compliments about her body week in and week out. That attention often fills a gap - giving her the sort of attention that she might not be receiving elsewhere. Before you know it, it's turned into something romantic or sexual. 'I operate a very strict policy in my organisation - the client and the client's partner has to feel happy and reassured that the service is professional and focused on what it should be. If one of my personal trainers refuses to adhere to these rules, they are out. 'Twelve years of personal training management experience behind me and I believe my policy is the only option.'","Andy McGlynn got together with ex-client Diane Youdale (Jet, Gladiators)

"First ever: Eric Daniel Hughes saw 11.02 of his Bitcoins, a type of online currency, taken by the federal government in the first ever seizure of its kind . A South Carolina man received a dubious honor in April when his Bitcoins became the first ever seized by the U.S. government. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration seized the 31-year-old Eric Daniel Hughes’ Bitcoins, which are a type of online currency. It’s believed that the seizure may have been related to shady online drug clearinghouse Silk Road, a site that only accepts Bitcoins as currency. According to DEA documentation, agents seized 11.02 Bitcoins from Hughes, worth $814. Though . the forfeiture notice makes no mention of the online illicit drug . seller, the Post and Courier reports that speculation regarding the . involvement of Silk Road has quickly arisen simply because of the . Bitcoin seizure. When buzz . began to spread of the seizure, users of the blog Let's Talk Bitcoin! were able to connect the Bitcoin account number listed on the DEA . document to a transaction made in April on Silk Road of exactly 11.02 . Bitcoins. ‘This is the . first time something like this has happened with Bitcoin,’ said Adam B. Levine, editor of Let’s Talk Bitcoin!, told the Post and Courier. ‘And . the interesting subtext is: We don't have any idea just how involved the . DEA is with Bitcoins.’ Consequently, . neither do Silk Road users know how deeply the so-called ‘eBay of . drugs’ has been breached, if indeed it has at all, by the federal . government. eBay of drugs: Evidence suggests that Hughes' Bitcoins were seized in connection with shadowy internet drug bazaar Silk Road, which only accepts Bitcoins . Chomping at the bitcoin: Bitcoins are a virtual currency that are difficult to track and the fact some were seized by the government led many who follow the novel money to wonder how they did it . Federal . authorities admit to seizing Hughes’ Bitcoins, however it is unclear how . they went about actually holding onto the largely anonymous currency . units. The Post and Courier reports that the feds have not, however, charged Hughes as of yet. The . local authorities are going after him. The Charleston, South Carolina . police raided Hughes apartment in June and, according to police . affidavits, found 10 bags of the narcotic Suboxone during the search. How'd they do that? The digital currency is stored virtually by sites like Bitcoin Wallet. The feds may have used Hughes' own computer to seize his 11.02 Bitcoins or staged an online sting operation . He is also accused of selling other prescription drugs as well as marijuana to police informants. So how did the DEA confiscate completely digital currency? According to Levine, the police would have either had to use the same computer Hughes used to make the transaction to take ownership of the currency or they undertook an online sting operation in order to confiscate the coins. Unstable currently: Those in the know when it comes to Bitcoins seem at a loss as to how Hughes' virtually currency was seized and what it means for the illicit sale of drugs and other items on sites like Silk Road in the future . Either way, this remains one for the record books and likely has Silk Road drug buyers squirming as their so-called Deep Web—a difficult to access layer of the internet invisible to the typical user where Silk Road can be found—may have been penetrated by authorities. They are no doubt chomping at the bitcoin as they wait to find out. THE 'EBAY OF DRUGS' Dubbed by some as the 'eBay of drugs,' Silk Road is an online, peer-to-peer marketplace for every drug imaginable. Instead of money, however, Silk Road buyers and sellers use the hard to track digital currency Bitcoins. Unlike normal websites, Silk Road cannot be reached via normal routes. A special browser called a Tor browser must be used to access the illicit site. Sites like Silk Road exist in a sort of hidden internet, just beneath the one most people know and enjoy. It is known as the Deep Web. Commerce within the shadowy bazaar is tough to track and authorities have been unable to shut it down. However, the seizure of Hughes' bitcoins has some wondering if federal agents are getting closer to successfully infiltrating the site after years of unsuccessful attempts to bring it down. MONEY IN A DIGITAL AGE . Bitcoins are a type of online currency that can be exchanged for dollars and vice versa. The main idea behind it is to facilitate cheap, anonymous transactions policed by its community of users. Much like gold, there are a finite number of Bitcoins - 21 million exist and are predicted to last until 2140. This number was designated by the inventor (or inventors) of the virtual coinage when it first came about in 2008. Also like gold, Bitcoins are mined. But instead of digging in the ground, Bitcoins are extracted online via complex algorithms like virtual pickaxes. The value of Bitcoins fluctuate like gold, too.

"Arsene Wenger has confirmed he will be active in the January transfer window as he looks to bolster his injury-hit squad. Arsenal's problems mounted this week after losing midfielders Mikel Arteta and Jack Wilshere. In total, Wenger has up to eleven injured players going into Saturday's clash against West Brom.

Jack Wilshere will be out for up to four months after undergoing surgery on his injured ankle . Arsenal have nine players out ahead of their trip to play West Brom on Saturday, Arsene Wenger confirms . ‘It was a very committed game and we have given a lot physically in the last two games,’ said Wenger reflecting on the Borussia Dortmund victory on Wednesday. ‘Szczesny has not practised yet at all. Arteta is out for sure of course and I think Sanogo has problems as well because I had to take him off. We have a few other players that we have to check.’ Sportsmail revealed this morning that the Arsenal board will make more money available than the original £20million in January to help Wenger deal with their growing injury crisis. ‘January might be a month when we have nearly everybody back because (Laurent) Koscielny is back in the squad, (Mathieu) Debuchy will be back I think in two weeks,’ added Wenger. ‘We have gone through a period where we are very short but we discovered as well that players have learnt their job well in the centre back position, like (Nacho) Monreal and he is doing very well now.

"Alexis Sanchez will miss his mid-winter break this season — last year he used it to go home to Tocopilla in northern Chile and inaugurate five new synthetic grass football pitches he had donated to the desert town where he grew up. ‘This is where I used to play, although not quite in these conditions. It was more a case of rocks for goalposts when I was young,’ Sanchez told the crowds who had gathered to catch a glimpse of him last year. The donation has made a difference with a youth football league established and more young boys than ever playing the game despite baseball being Tocopilla’s No 1 sport. Alexis Sanchez celebrates scoring a goal for Arsenal against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night . Sanchez grew up in Tocopilla, a town in northern Chile, where he used rocks for goalposts growing up . It has been quite a rise to fame for the forward, who is now the man Arsene Wenger can rely on . They are watching too as Sanchez shines for Arsenal, scoring 13 goals in 20 games in all competitions, including the second in their 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night. His mother Martina sees every match with friends in the same house where she brought up her son and his four older brothers. She rejected the chance to move house, but has allowed her son to pay for the home’s extensive renovation, and now she no longer needs to sell fish in the market to scrape a living — a job that once inadvertently gave Sanchez a major career leg-up. While her son was a 16-year-old playing for the Cobreloa first team in the Copa Libertadores, but still on youth-team wages, she was fined for selling fish without a licence. Sanchez's first club away from his home country was Udinese, in Italy's Serie A . Sanchez's €25m move to Barcelona in 2011 took him a long way from the dusty streets on which he grew up . Sanchez has played over 70 times for Chile, making his debut in 2006 against New Zealand . Local journalist Mauricio Riquelme says: ‘There was no way the family could pay the $1,000 fine and so Sanchez was put in touch with the agent Fernando Felicevich who bought his registration and settled the debt.’ Felicevich moved the youngster to Udinese in Italy a year later, giving him the big break to Europe that he thought would never come. It should not be a surprise he has already shown himself capable of carrying Arsenal on his shoulders this season. They are made tough in Tocopilla where the copper mine, the power plant, and the docks are the limited career options on the contaminated horizon — the air is thick with industrial pollution and the region has abnormally high cancer mortality rates linked to levels of arsenic used in the mining. Under the guidance of Felicevich, and with loan spells back in Chile with Colo-Colo and at River Plate, Sanchez made the Udinese first team before his €25million switch to Barcelona in 2011. Sanchez (left) played for Barcelona against English opposition Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League . Sanchez, pictured second right, grew up playing youth football in his home country of Chile . He appeared for Chile at Wembley against England in November 2013, scoring both goals in a 2-0 win . That move to Barçelona fulfilled the dream of Sanchez’s doting step-father Jose Delaigue who by this time had contracted cancer. Sanchez paid for his care and treatment up until his death. Sanchez was misunderstood at times at the Nou Camp. He was given the nickname ‘Cachai’ — a Chilean expression which means: ‘know what I mean?’ He used it frequently to team-mates who more often than not, did not know what he meant because of his thick Chilean accent. And there was a failure to communicate during matches too. ‘He has to have a certain amount of freedom on the pitch to thrive,’ says his former coach Nelson Acosta. But that was never really afforded him in the shadow of the great Lionel Messi. Sanchez celebrates after scoring his, and Chile's, second goal in a 2-0 win against England in 2013 . Sanchez, pictured bottom second right, poses for a photo in his younger years in Chile . Since joining Arsenal, Sanchez has been hailed for his impressive performances for Arsene Wenger's side . In contrast at Arsenal he is just another Spanish-speaking overseas star in the dressing room and on the pitch the trademark energy has been harnessed. Sanchez loves to run. One of his Italian adventures at Udinese came when he left his house close to the club’s Stadio Friuli outside the city to drive into the centre on a shopping trip only to lose his keys. A more pampered player might have called his agent to send a car. But whether out of embarrassment or just because he thought nothing of the ‘hardship’, Sanchez ran the four miles home to get a spare set of keys — and then ran back to his car. He is also famous for failing to recognise AC Milan’s chief executive Adriano Galliani at a publicity shoot — the glitz of modern football’s ‘who’s who’ passes him by. Sanchez wheels away in celebration after scoring the opening goal against Sunderland in October . Sanchez scored the second goal against Dortmund on Wednesday night to send the home fans into raptures . The big heart Sanchez has shown this season has won over the Arsenal fans in the space of just three months. He is adored back home too and they will miss his Christmas visit in Tocopilla this year. There are London derbies against QPR and West Ham to play so there will be no time for a repeat of last year’s trip when he was also driven around the town on a pick-up truck handing out Christmas gifts. Not everyone is sure about the hero’s welcome he gets every time he returns however. He now earns more in a month than he would have earned in a lifetime had he not made it as a footballer. Some of Tocopilla’s school teachers question if it’s a good thing that someone who earns £130,000 a week has become a role model — why work hard at school when you can just grow up and play for Arsenal? But most see him as a positive example to the youngsters playing on those pitches he has donated. He might not have worked hard at school, but he did work at his game and it has taken him from the Chilean desert to the promised land of the Premier League.","Alexis Sanchez grew up in Tocopilla, Chile with rocks for goalposts .

Fury, on the eve of his rematch with Dereck Chisora from which the winner should be propelled into a mega-euros fight with Wladimir Klitsckho, has trained ‘as never before’. So hard in fact that he was able to weigh in fully clothed and still scale under 19 stones. Eubank makes a sudden jump in class as he takes on Billy Joe Saunders — but also a leap of faith that he will be the one to challenge the winner of next month’s fight for the vacant WBO middleweight title between Matt Korobov and Ireland’s Andy Lee. The most extravagant boast before these Battles of Britain has come from Chris Eubank Snr, who touts his son as greater already than the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard and more dangerous than any other boxer active today — Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao included. Yet the claim which will intrigue the sports community most is Fury’s depiction of himself as ‘the most mobile, fluent, lithe, flexible and explosive athlete in the world’. But even though 6ft 9in Fury is an incorrigible jester, he is deadly serious when he says: ‘I am a one-off. Yes, unique. I was born to be a sportsman. Not only a fighter but a champion at any sport.’ Chisora, who is eight inches shorter than his opponent, squares up to Fury at the Imperial War Museum . Billy Joe Saunders (right) is the current British, European and Commonwealth middleweight champion . Most importantly, he points out: ‘The biggest key is my legs. They are the legs of a racehorse. Not the legs of a carthorse like most fighters who are built squat for power.’ By chance, I can confirm that he is unexpectedly agile when he wants to get in shape. One day at his old training camp in Belgium he said ‘Watch this’ and vaulted acrobatically from the floor, above the ring apron and over the ropes to land lightly on his feet in the ring. It was a startling sight. Fury suspects that the mighty Klitschko is already aware of his physical prowess ‘and may not agree to fight me next year even though I will be his mandatory challenger’. Klitschko had a close-up view of one of the very few heavyweights taller than himself when Fury worked out at Wladimir’s and his brother Vitali’s training camp in the Austrian Tyrol. Fury says: ‘He watched me train — but showed no inclination to spar with me. In a way I’m glad because if we do meet he won’t have the learning experience of us trading punches.’ Eubank Jnr has considerably less professional and amateur experience than his opponent . Fury claimed that his biggest assets are his legs, which he said were the legs of a racehorse . Eubank the Younger, on the contrary, is built for the strength which he hopes will counter Saunders’ considerably deeper amateur and professional experience. Saunders is defending his European, British and Commonwealth middleweight titles. As the champion, he is favourite. But it is not forgotten in the Eubank household that this month sees the anniversary — the 24th — of the dramatic night when Chris the Elder, then a comparative novice, overturned the odds with that historic upset of Nigel Benn. And of the two big fights at the ExCel, this appears the harder to call. ‘Fifty-fifty,’ plead many when asked to predict the outcome. So it will be if Saunders allows his visibly seething anger at the deliberately provocative behaviour of the opposing camp to draw him into a slugging match. The Eubanks are calculating on a knockout if the fight turns into machismo exchanges of heavy punches. Eubank Jnr and Saunders looks set to overshadow the main event between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora . Fury throws a big right hand at Chisora during their first fight at Wembley Arena in 2011 . But if Saunders keeps his temper and sticks to his boxing skills, he should edge a 12-round decision. Fury, for his part, argues with conviction that in his current chiselled and athletic condition he will beat Chisora more easily than he did when they first met three years ago. Chisora, however, has rededicated himself since that defeat, taken Vitali Klitschko the distance and now scales 18lb lighter than he did three years ago at 17st 3½lb. It will be no surprise if both men are knocked down at various stages of the fight but Fury has a consistent record of getting up after being decked — and appears to hit the harder. It would be no great shock, either, if this one went the full 12 rounds scheduled for Chisora’s European title defence. Although that is not my expectation. Fury should get the job done, even it is later rather than sooner. JEFF POWELL’s predictions: . Saunders beats Eubank on points. Fury K0s Chisora in 10th.

"Premier League clubs spent an eye-watering £115 MILLION on payments to agents in relation to deals that happened in the last two transfer windows according to official figures just released. Four clubs spent eight-figure sums each, with Chelsea spending more than anyone - £16,7771,328 - followed by Liverpool on £14,308,444, Manchester City on £12,811,946 and Tottenham on £10,983,011. To put these astonishing sums into perspective, those four clubs alone have spent as much on middle-men payments in the past year than every club in League Two spend on their entire wage bills in a season. Chelsea spent £32 million on Diego Costa in the summer... but his 11 goals may prove that he was worth it . Crystal Palace supporters unveiled a banner aimed at Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in October . 1st: Chelsea - £16,771,328 . 2nd: Liverpool – £14,308,444 . 3rd: Manchester City – £12,811,946 . 4th: Tottenham Hotspur – £10,983,011 . 5th: Manchester United – £7,975,556 . 6th: West Ham United – £6,380,339 . 7th: Everton – £5,753,269 . 8th: Sunderland – £5,276,674 . 9th: Arsenal – £4,293,407 . 10th: Stoke City – £3,986,850 . 11th: Newcastle United – £3,876,250 . 12th: Swansea City – £3,784,090 . 13th: West Bromwich Albion – £3,493,745 . 14th: Queens Park Rangers – £3,242,668 . 15th: Southampton – £2,766,444 . 16th: Aston Villa – £2,577,866 . 17th: Hull City – £2,459,010 . 18th: Crystal Palace – £2,200,797 . 19th: Leicester City – £1,608,418 . 20th: Burnley – £711,024 . Total – £115,261,136 . Burnley spent the least on agents, with £711,024, and then Leicester City on £1,608,418. Crystal Palace, Hull, Aston VIlla and Southampton all spent less than £3m. The accompanying table shows the payments made by each Premier League club to agents in the period 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014. The amounts shown include payments made by clubs on behalf of players. The Premier League has been publishing agents' fees in the name of transparency since the 2009-10 season onwards. The figures give an insight into the considerable sums that middle-men take out of the game for brokering deals. Chelsea may well argue that paying agents helped them to a stellar transfer window in which they signed stars including Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas - and still made a small PROFIT on their dealings! (Before agents' fees). Liverpool spent £117m on players including the Southampton trio of Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert. Liverpool, like Manchester City, also bought a player with third-party ownership issues that needed to be resolved and inevitably needed to pay fees to help sort that out. Lazar Markovic was the player in question for Liverpool. At Manchester City, it was Eliaquim Mangala, who cost the club around £40m to three third-party owners (contrary to the widely reported but erroneous figure of £32m). Mangala's agent in that deal was 'super agent' Jorge Mendes. He is the epitome of the monied middle-man. As Sportsmail exclusively revealed earlier this year, Mendes has traded players worth more than £1 billion in his career - and pocketed fees of £100m-plus in commissions - including from several Premier League clubs for deals included in today's new figures. Adam Lallana poses with a Liverpool shirt after completing his £23m move from Southampton in the summer . Burnley and Leicester bought Lukas Jutkiewicz (left) and Leonardo Ulloa (right) respectively in the summer, but they make up the bottom two in the payments to agents table .","Chelsea spent the most on agents between October 2013 - September 2014 .

"The Bureau of Land Management may be attempting to take over private land in Texas, the state Attorney General warns. The BLM, which oversees public land in the U.S., has reportedly been 'eyeing up'  90,000 acres of land on the Texas side of the Red River, which makes up the border between the state and Oklahoma.

The Bureau of Land Management has reportedly been looking to grab 90,000 acres of land on the banks of the Red River, which forms part of the border between Texas and Oklahoma . Texas’ Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott wrote in a letter to Neil Kornze, the director of the BLM, about his ‘deep concern’ that the Federal Government would lay claim to land along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River which had been owned by local families ‘for generations.’ 'I am deeply concerned about reports that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is considering taking property in the State of Texas and that it now claims belongs to the federal government,’ Attorney General Abbott wrote in a letter obtained by FoxNews.

"With its incredible presentation, near-prefect controls and life-like animation, it’s hard to find anything wrong with NBA 2K14. And although it’s not radically different from the previous game, key gameplay mechanics have been tweaked to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. Court in the act: everything from the animation to the way each player looks is right on the money . Perhaps most impressive is how 2K Sports have captured the feel of the sport. Fast breaks are easier to execute than ever before, while showboating Assist Passes (achieved by a tap of the right and left triggers) means no game is without flair. Play-calling, achieved via the D-Pad, is a breeze, too, allowing you to change tactics on the fly. There are also plenty of dribble moves – with an impressive amount of combinations available at the touch of the right analogue stick. Thankfully, they don’t always work, and pulling them off at the wrong moment will often result in a turnover. Shooting from deep is as rewarding as ever, made even more so by just how well-realised the players are. Many of the most famous stars have made a seamless transition to the game – from pixel-perfect expressions, to their shot technique. Three points! Shooting isn't easy, but it's not so hard as to put you off trying your luck from distance . Sadly, although the game looks incredible in motion, cut-scenes do not have the same level of polish. Characters have a ‘dead-behind-the-eyes’ look about them, and uncomfortably jolt around. Given the high-quality of the presentation – from the outstanding commentary to glitzy game menus and impeccable soundtrack – it’s a shame such an integral part of the game isn’t quite up to scratch. Thankfully, this blip can’t take away from the wide selection of game modes on offer. The standard pick-up-and-play matches, multi-season and multiplayer feature but it’s the LeBron: Path to Greatness, that takes centre stage. In similar vein to NBA 2K12’s Jordan Challenge, you take control of LeBron James and take part in a series of key games across several seasons. So close but so far: If only the cutscenes had more polish, then this could be the perfect sports game. There is still hope, though, when the game is released on next-gen consoles . You can choose either the Heat Dynasty – where James must help Miami become a dominant force in the league, or the Fantastic Journey – that sees the star hop around different teams. It’s a worthy addition, but one many won't find as fun as the Jordan Challenge. No matter, because for the most part, NBA 2K14 is a slam-dunking success. NBA 2K14 is out now. Agree with Talal?

"Meet Lolita Richi, the youngest 'Human Barbie' yet to emerge, who claims to be the most doll-like beauty yet. Lolita, 16, from Kiev, Ukraine, boasts the same improbable body proportions and blank facial features as a Barbie. She has a tiny 20-inch waist, a 32F bra size and wears contact lenses that give her a wide-eyed, doll-like stare. Lolita maintains that her striking looks were achieved without plastic surgery, dieting or Photoshop. Scroll down for video . At the age of just 16, Lolita claims to be the most doll-like beauty yet - and it's all natural (apart from the coloured contact lenses) Lolita has a 20-inch waist, which she shows off in various costumes and outfits . Lolita, pictured aged six, says as a child she was a tomboy with no real interest in dolls or dressing up . The outspoken high-school student, who is now temporarily living in Turkmenistan, says: 'I think I've achieved this image better than anyone else. I'm the ultimate vamp woman. I haven't even heard of Valeria Lukyanov. 'People have openly told me that they're jealous of me and how good I look. All of the boys at school fancy me as well but I don't like any of them. They are not to my taste.' Growing up, Lolita was a playful tomboy who showed no interest in her appearance. She says: 'I never thought about playing with dolls when I was younger. I was always outside playing with the boys.' Despite the provocative nature of many of the pictures she posts online, her mother approves - in fact, she takes all the photographs . Lolita claims she never uses Photoshop on her pictures and has never had any surgery . It was only a year ago that super-confident Lolita first adopted the doll look. She has since gained a devoted band of followers on Russian social network VK. Lolita explains: 'I started dressing up like this because I want to look perfect. I think that all women should be well-kept and immaculate. I wanted to be my own inspiration. 'If a girl doesn't have beautiful eyes then they should wear contact lenses to sort it out. If they have a crooked nose, then she must do something about it, whether that's plastic surgery or not. The confident teenager has amassed many fans on Russian social network VK . Lolita's mother Anya is her photographer and captures all of the snaps that Lolita uploads online . 'I had great features to start with and I just improved on them. My big breasts are natural although I something wear a push-up bra to enhance them. 'I have a gorgeous figure so I don't even have to diet. I just eat whatever's available in the fridge whether that's sausages or fruit. 'I started wearing affordable contact lenses and make-up. My mother used to be an actress so I borrow her wigs. 'I feel comfortable and confident in my appearance. There are many women who want to look like this.' However Lolita confesses that she does receive a fair share of negative criticism online. She says: 'People make good and bad comments about me online. I've blocked a few users who have been particularly mean about my appearance. 'But I do get nice compliments too, I like when men admire my hands.' Lolita hopes to find fame through her Barbie-like looks, but says her ultimate aim is to be a psychologist . One person who is wholly supportive of her eccentric look is Lolita's mother, Anya Richi, 33. Anya is her photographer and captures all of the snaps that Lolita uploads online. She says:'My mum doesn't say anything about my appearance. She allows me to dress however I want. My mum's proud of how I look.' Lolita says there is no man out there at the moment who is a worthy candidate for her affections. 'I'm not attracted to any of the boys at school, although they all like me. They aren't good enough for me and they have an immature mentality. 'I did have one serious boyfriend in the past but I dumped him because we kept having little disagreements. In the end, we were incompatible. 'I want to be with a really manly man who is polite, sensible and who doesn't run away from problems. He also needs to have a full head of hair. I don't like bald men.' Lolita wants to become a psychologist after she finishes school but would love to achieve fame for her look. She says, 'I'm only 5ft 4in tall so I can't become a model unfortunately. But if I can become famous for my appearance in some other way, I will be extremely happy.'","At 5ft 4in, she has a 20-inch waist and 32F bra size .

"Liverpool have paid tribute to Steven Gerrard's glittering 16-year career at the club with a commemorative programme cover of him for their game against Stoke City on Saturday. Gerrard, who made his debut for the Reds as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers on November 29 1998, is a club legend among the Anfield faithful. The veteran midfielder has won the likes of the Champions League, three League Cups and two FA Cups during his glorious stint so far with his boyhood club.

In the past week a number of Gerrard's team-mates have paid tribute to him in the build-up to the historic landmark, with vice-captain and fellow midfielder Jordan Henderson hailing the former England midfielder. Henderson told FATV: 'I'd have to say Steven Gerrard has been my biggest influence in my career so far. 'I watched him when I was younger and then to go and play and train with hime every day was massive for me, and still is now.' Summer signing Emre Can has also been hugely complimentary of the Reds skipper, labelling him as his 'big brother'. Can said: 'He is the greatest captain the club have ever had - it's as simple as that. 'And I feel comfortable on the pitch because I always know Gerrard is ­behind me.

"The earliest example of Roman irrigation in Britain, dating back almost 2,000 years, has been discovered in Cambridge - and it may have been used to produce wine. A network of ditches and ridges was found on the site of a proposed new £1 billion development on farmland at the edge of the town, near the M11. Researchers believe the channels were used as a vineyard, or to grow asparagus, and are being hailed as evidence of 'intense agriculture' dating back to around 70AD. The network of ditches and ridges, pictured, were found on a development site in North Cambridge. Researchers from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit believe the ditches were used to grow grapevines or asparagus and date back to 70AD . Historians have long suspected the 370-acre (150 hectare) site could have been home to an ancient Roman settlement. Archaeologists were invited to explore the site 18 months ago before work begins on the major new development of housing, shops and a new school. By March last year they had uncovered evidence the site was once home to a Bronze Age settlement pre-dating the Romans. A team from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit have now uncovered the irrigation system across the northern section. During the Roman Empire, level plains were used for cultivation. To . plough the soil, Roman farmers used a simple soil breaker called an . ‘ard’, pulled by oxen. Fields were ploughed at various . points at right angles to each other to create a flat and even surface. The Romans then built dams . and reservoirs needed for irrigation. Water . collected in these dams and reservoirs and could then be distributed . through channels easily and effectively, increasing the amount of crops . that could be covered. This was vital in producing enough food for the large and growing . Roman population. Water for crops and farms, as well as for public baths, fountains, . and homes, was brought into cities and towns via Roman aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard aqueduct, (pictured above) in Roussillon, France. Aqueducts . were built on gradients, made of stone, brick or concrete. Most were . buried underground, and many featured distribution tanks to control the . supply when needed. Team leader Chris Evans said it was evidence of an ‘intense agricultural regime’ dating as far back as 70AD. ‘Our findings from excavating around the ridgeway have unearthed zebra-like stripes of Roman planting beds that are encircled on their higher northern side by more deep pit-wells,’ continued Evans. ‘The gully-defined planting beds were closely set and were probably grapevines or possibly asparagus. The Romans built dams, pit wells, pictured at the site in Cambridge, and reservoirs for irrigation. The find near the M11 is being hailed as evidence of 'intense agriculture' and is thought to be the earliest example of Roman irrigation in Britain . Historians have long suspected the 370-acre (150 hectare) site could have been home to an ancient Roman settlement and archaeologists are continuing to dig at the planned development on Cambridge University farmland between Huntingdon Road and the M11 . Extraordinarily, after carefully peeling off the clays, we saw a series of ditches lining the wells and the horticultural beds. ‘Clearly in dry spells, water could have been poured from the pit-wells into the ditches to reach the beds. ‘This is a tremendously significant find that reflects the area's intense agricultural regime from the Roman period. It's an unparalleled discovery and the earliest evidence of Roman irrigation in Britain. ‘People don't think about wells and irrigation being a significant invention but it was incredibly sophisticated. I mean how many hours do women in Africa have to go to collect their water?’","The network of ditches and ridges were found in North Cambridge .

"A Brooklyn teacher has described the terrifying moment she fought off an attempted rapist armed with a machete, who had broken into the Jamaica villa she was staying in. It was supposed the holiday of a lifetime with her boyfriend, but the dream soon became a nightmare after the machete-wielding rapist tried to attack. Since the ordeal in May last year, Veronica Cassidy has struggled with post-traumatic stress syndrome and even considered taking her own life, she told XOJane. Ordeal: Veronica Cassidy and Shane O'Connor were attacked on the first night of their trip . Traumatic: The would-be rapist was armed with a machete like the one pictured . The couple had only been on the island for a few hours before the attack. It was the first time Miss Cassidy's boyfriend, Shane O'Connor, had ever left the U.S. and they were excited about their stay in a villa overlooking the ocean. As they drove through Kingston from the airport however, they began to realize the dream holiday may be a little rough. 'The town didn't seem to have any tourist presence, now . or ever. On our drive from Kingston's airport, a young mother selling . fruit advised us to be careful as we traveled ahead,' Miss Cassidy told XOJane. 'But . here we were, feeling informed with our guidebooks in hand, stubbornly . optimistic for our beach vacation and myself, anyway, overly adventurous . from a lifetime of travel ""off the beaten path"".' Although she admits that the view was amazing, their villa was dirty and full of bugs, and the couple had reservations about its location as soon as they arrived. Miss Cassidy, who is also a writer, said they discussed moving straight away but, because they had paid a non-refundable deposit and it was getting late, they decided to wait until morning. However, after waking from a restless sleep, caused by music still blasting from the beach below, Miss Cassidy stumbled naked towards to the bathroom - only to discover the couple were not alone. Survivor: Veronica, pictured with Shane, says she found strength from knowing she fought off her attacker . Dream holiday: The couple had been excited about their first vacation together in Jamaica . 'When I turned to sit, there stood before . me a a tall, thin man, his face illuminated by the near-full moon. This . man, who I later learned is named Yuan, stood a foot away from me, . smiling from behind the large machete he held samurai-style,' she said. As the teacher screamed, the man swung the machete at her while grabbing her breast. 'I don't remember well what happened . then,' Miss Cassidy, who was left needing therapy. 'There's no visual memory anymore, only the memory of that scream, . mine eventually joined by his, this man who had been seconds away from . slitting my boyfriend's throat a few minutes before.' She added that the attacker had been to their villa earlier in the day, on the pretense of selling fruit to them. He had then hidden in the bushes for night to fall. Miss Cassidy managed to fight off her attacker, and push him out of the bathroom, where she believed he planned to lock her in. As she hit the attacker and tried to block his machete blows, her boyfriend, armed with a kitchen knife, helped scare him off. But their ordeal was far from over. For the next three hours they sat huddled in the locked bathroom, with Miss Cassidy, and the walls, still covered in blood, as they waited for help to arrive. 'The terror of that night ended, but its horror haunted me for months to come,' Miss Cassidy said. After a couple of weeks she developed tendinitis in both wrists and suffered four months of cramps after the post-traumatic stress syndrome compounded the side effects of an IUD that she had been fitted with just before the attack. Explore: Veronica Cassidy had planned to go off the beaten track in Jamaica but an attack left her traumatised . Her sleep was disrupted with terrifying dreams and Miss Cassidy took to compulsively writing 'This is not my life' and 'Higher power give me peace' in her journal. The trauma also led her to start having suicidal thoughts, and she recalled trying to swallow a bottle of painkillers and considering other ways to take her life. Finally, in November, Miss Cassidy sought professional help and has started to come to terms with the horrific experience. 'Remembering that night, there lingers a haunting fear of the dangers that might still lie ahead. Yet that memory also brings pride. I am proud that I fought back,' she said. She added that she has drawn strength from knowing she was able to fight off her attacker, and break the 'social narrative that says women are always victims'. The U.S. Embassy has said reports of violent crime and sexual assault against tourists is frequent in Jamaica. It advises travelers to stay away from several areas on the island and to always keep windows and doors of cars and villas locked. The Embassy added that it can often be hard to bring a case to court because the victim must attend for each stage of the process. Tourists are also warned about the danger of stray bullets. An American businessman became the victim of this, after being caught in the crossfire of a robbery in June this year.","Brooklyn woman faced with armed attacker in Jamaica villa .

"It doesn’t look particularly out of the ordinary. But there are a few rather significant differences between this tap and the ones you normally find in a bathroom – not least the £999 price tag. Dreamt up by James Dyson, the man who re-invented the vacuum cleaner, it combines hand washing and drying in one rather futuristic tap. First, the user must place their hands under the central nozzle, which breaks an infra-red beam and triggers a stream of lukewarm water. Scroll down for video . Next, the user moves their hands out underneath the two wings, where breaking a second beam sets off a blast of cold filtered air to scrape the water away. The drying process takes 12 seconds, and there is no need to touch any surfaces that might spread bugs. There is one thing it doesn’t dispense, however – soap. While the Dyson bagless vacuum cleaner became a mass market success despite its relatively high price, the Dyson  Airblade Tap is likely to be more of a niche product, at least in the short term. Its big innovation is the small and immensely powerful fan motor, called the V4, which sits in the  base of the tap. Mass market success: The tap and hand-dryer was dreamt up by James Dyson, the man who invented the bagless vacuum cleaner . High performance: Mr Dyson said the Dyson Airblade hand dryers dry hands quickly and that the digital motor self adjusts 6,000 times a second to maintain optimum efficiency . The 1600 watt motor is just 85mm . across and weighs 675g, yet it is able to power a tiny fan from . standstill to 90,000 revolutions per minute in less than 0.7 seconds. As . a result, it can blast out 30 litres of air a second, travelling at . 430mph. 'Most simply give up': Conventional hand dryers use one column of bacteria filled bathroom air to evaporate water from hands . Air sucked into the Airblade passes through a filter to remove 99.9 per cent of all bacteria before it dries the hands. The combined tap and fan is one of . three new hand dryers developed by a team of 125 Dyson engineers at its . headquarters in Wiltshire. Mr Dyson said: ‘Conventional . hand-dryers use one column of bacteria filled bathroom air to evaporate . water from hands, after much hand rubbing. ‘Most people simply give up. Dyson Airblade hand dryers dry hands quickly. Sheets of high  velocity unheated air travel through tiny apertures at 430mph, quickly scraping water from hands like a windscreen wiper, leaving them fully dry. ‘Using complex computer modelling Dyson engineers have developed a high performance digital motor. ‘The Dyson digital motor self-adjusts 6,000 times a second to maintain optimum efficiency to create high velocity sheet of air that dries hands quickly and hygienically.’ The new motor came after seven years of design and experimentation, which required an investment of £26.9million.","The Airblade Tap combines hand washing and drying in one tap .

"A widow whose husband was killed courageously fighting a wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona five weeks ago is being denied the lifetime benefits she was counting on to raise the couple's four young children alone. Juliann Ashcraft's husband, Andrew, was one of 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighters who lost their lives when a fire they were battling suddenly changed direction and engulfed them. Mr Ashcraft, like his colleagues, was protecting the people of Yarnell when he died, tragically leaving his young family without a husband, father or income. But the city of Prescott, where the Hotshots were based, is now claiming he was a seasonal worker, despite him working a 40 hour week year round, and denying Mrs Ashcraft full benefits. Scroll down for video . Confused: Juliann Ashcraft, pictured, is fighting with the city of Prescott for the benefits she is being denied . Children: Mrs Ashcraft, pictured, was left to raise her four children alone . 'As shocked as I was that my husband . went to work and never came home, I'm equally shocked in how the city . has treated our family since then,' Mrs Ashcraft, whose youngest child . is just 18 months old, told CBS News. All 19 Hotshot families will receive worker's compensation and a one-off federal payment of $328,000. But . the city is refusing to pay Mrs Ashcraft her husband's lifetime salary . and health benefits, which together are worth millions, because it . insists he was among 13 of the squad who were seasonal employees rather . than full-timers. Only six of the 19 firefighters are entitled to full-time benefits, the city claims. 'I . said to them, ""My husband was a full-time employee, he went to work . full-time for you,""' she said, 'and their response to me was, ""Perhaps . there was a communication issue in your marriage.""' CBS . News has seen paperwork showing Mr Ashcraft did infact earn a full-time . salary as a firefighter for the city of Prescott. He was the only one . of the 13 Hotshots denied full benefits who worked a 40 hour week . through out the year. In love: Juliann, right, is pictured with Andrew Ashcraft, left, in happier times . Heartbreaking: Not only was Juliann Ashcraft, pictured, devastated to lose her husband, she is now facing raising their four children without the benefits she is entitled to . In a statement to CBS News, Prescott . officials said the city had 'fully complied with all of the laws and . employment polices that direct survivor benefits.' But . Mrs Ashcraft, still mourning the loss of her 29-year-old hero, is . desperate for help, as the costs associated with bringing up four . children mount. 'Quite . literally, my bills are being paid by the good people of the world who . are giving donations, because the city of Prescott isn't doing anything . for us,' she told the TV station. 'Now I have four kids and myself, and I . don't know what I'm going to do. 'I want to be able to just be mourning my husband, be supporting my children, be figuring out what our new normal is.' The . shocking treatment comes five weeks after the mother-of-four learned by . watching the news that her firefighter husband had perished in the . intense blaze that burned scores of homes to the ground. Just days after the men's deaths, Mrs . Ashcraft revealed the last conversation she had with her husband - and . her fears when he never responded to her text messages. Heartbroken: Juliann Ashcraft, cries alongside her father Tom Ashcraft outside of the Granite Mountain Hotshot fire station in Prescott on Monday July 1 . Struggle: Juliann Ashcraft, left, will only get a one-off payment of $328,000 and workers' compensation . Mrs . Ashcraft sobbed as she recounted the bravery of her beloved husband and . his close unit of highly-trained 'hotshot' colleagues, who were overcome . by the ferocious flames in Yarnell. She . said she had been texting her husband throughout the day - with him . telling her how much he loved and missed her, and how proud he was of . their young children - until he abruptly stopped. 'I . asked, ""Will you be sleeping out there tonight?""' she told the Today . show early last month as she struggled to hold back the tears. 'And of . course there was no reply and they all laid out there that night.' She . added that she had been sending him pictures of their children swimming . that day, and how his daughter had commented that she wished he was . there to see the thunder storm with them. He responded that he wished for that too. 'We could sure use some rain over here,' he said. Mr . Ashcraft also sent his wife a picture of their view of the smoke and . flames from his team's lunch spot on Sunday, and Juliann said that she . was not particularly concerned when she saw it. Final moments: Mrs Ashcraft shared the final image Andrew Ashcraft texted her before the 19 firefighters were killed by the flames . An honorary flagpole is shown at the site where the 19 firefighters died . The devastation has been described as a 'moonscape' after an inferno so intense that only the metal part of one chain saw was found . 'It still did not look as catastrophic as it turned out to be,' she said. 'But he let us know that he loved us and missed us. Because of the dangers of the job, he would always tell us that he loved us.' Family photographs reveal a picture . perfect family as Juliann and Andrew are seen grinning and kissing, as . well as laughing along with their four young children. She told the Today show how, apart from his family, fighting fires with the Granite Mountain Hotshots was his life. 'He . was the most amazing man,' she said. 'The best person I know. A . contagious smile, a heart of gold. That's why he did what he did, . because he want to protect the community where he lived.' Of . his team, she added: 'They loved what they did. These men lived . together. They fought fires together. They died together - doing what . they loved.' On July 1, the day after the men were killed, Mrs Ashcraft was pictured distraught at a makeshift . memorial in Prescott for the fallen firefighters. She said she . learned of her husband's death while watching the news with their four children. 'They died heroes,' she told azcentral.com as she wept. 'And we'll miss them. We love them.' Prescott . High School physical education teacher and coach Lou Beneitone taught . many of the Hotshots, and remembered Ashcraft as a fitness-oriented . student. 'He had some . athletic ability in him and he was a go-getter, too. You could pretty . much see, from young freshman all the way, he was going to be physically . active.' Engulfed: 19 firefighters died as the wildfire spread near the Arizona town of Yarnell . Beneitone said . athletic prowess was a must for the Hotshots. 'That's what it takes. You . gotta be very physically fit, and you gotta like it, gotta like the . hard work.' Ashcraft, a . member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was honored . to be a member of the Hotshot crew, and 'he just had a really sweet . spirit about him,' Elise Smith, a Prescott, Arizona, resident, told The . Deseret News of Salt Lake City. As the bodies of the . Granite Mountain Hotshots were recovered, it emerged that the team's . 20th member survived as he was moving the crew's truck when the flames . overcame his comrades. Helicopters had been unable to reach the highly-trained men as they fought the flames in Yarnell and they could not be saved by their emergency shelters - tent-like structures meant to shield them from flames . and heat. When they were found on Sunday, all 19 . shelters were deployed but some of the men's bodies were inside their . individual shelters, while others were outside - indicating just how . suddenly they were overcome by the flames. 'It had to be a perfect storm in order . for this to happen,' Prescott Fire Department spokesman Wade Ward told the Today show last month. President Obama . called the firefighters heroes and highly skilled professionals who 'put . themselves in harm's way to protect the lives and property of fellow . citizens they would never meet.' The highly-skilled team was overtaken by a . fast-moving blaze stoked by hot winds on Sunday. The fire was sparked by a lightning strike on Friday and spread to at least 8,400 acres amid triple-digit temperatures, low humidity and . windy conditions. Death toll: The Yarnell wildfire is the deadliest wildfire involving firefighters in the U.S. for at least 30 years . The fire has also destroyed an estimated 200 homes. Dry grass . near the communities of Yarnell and Glen Isla fed the fast-moving . blaze. It . was unclear exactly how the crew became trapped. Southwest incident . team leader Clay Templin said the team and its commanders were following . safety protocols, but it appears the fire's erratic nature simply . overwhelmed them. At the . time, Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo said the 19 firefighters were a . part of the city's fire department. With their deaths, the department . lost 20 per cent of its members. 'We . grieve for the family. We grieve for the department. We grieve for the . city,' he said at a news conference on June 30. 'We're devastated. We just lost 19 of the finest people you'll ever meet.' Hot shot crews are elite firefighters . who often hike for miles into the wilderness with chain saws and . backpacks filled with heavy gear to build lines of protection between . people and fires. They remove brush, trees and anything that might burn . in the direction of homes and cities. The crew killed in the blaze had been working on other wildfires in recent weeks in New Mexico and Arizona, Fraijo said.","Andrew Ashcraft, 29, died beside 18 of his 'Hotshot' comrades on June 30 .
He left behind his young wife, Juliann, and their four children, the youngest of whom is 18 months .
Five weeks after the tragedy, Mrs Ashcraft has been denied the full lifetime benefits she was relying on to raise the couple's children .

"Tottenham have severed links with one of their official licensed suppliers after three pitch invasions caused a 10-minute delay to their Europa League clash against Partizan Belgrade and left them facing a UEFA charge. Despite securing their place in the last 32 of the competition thanks to Benjamin Stambouli’s second half goal, the club’s night was overshadowed by the serious breaches of security which led to Ukrainian referee Yevhen Aranovskiy taking both teams from the field four minutes before half-time. All three culprits were wearing shirts emblazoned with the logo of audio manufacturers BassBuds, who sell official branded headphones through the club’s merchandise store. The second of three supporters had his shirt ripped off by Roberto Soldado, before being dragged away by a number of Spurs stewards . The first pitch invader was on the field for five minutes and managed to take a selfie with a frustrated-looking Kyle Naughton . Soldado grabbed hold of one of the pitch invaders, and pulled his shirt off him before he was dragged away by stewards . Soldado did not take kindly to the second pitch invader, ripping his shirt off in anger before stewards reached him to drag him away . BassBuds issued a statement via Facebook that condemned the actions of the pitch invaders. 'We have been made aware of an incident at the Tottenham game tonight,' the statement read. 'We are appalled that the game was interrupted in this manner. We do not condone the interruption of any sporting fixture in this way.' Investigations revealed that all three match tickets for the invaders were bought by the same individual. A fourth ticket was also bought by that person and a member of the crowd who did not make it on the pitch has been identified by the club. The company, who also have licensing deals with Liverpool, Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa, have denied that it was a PR stunt. Spurs will investigate the incident further and could take action against the company if they are found to have links to it. UEFA are expected to charge the club over the breaches in security, with a heavy fine the most likely form of punishment. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino hit out at the farce and admitted that he was concerned for the safety of his players. The Argentine said: ‘I’m very disappointed with what happened in the first half. The club is aware of the situation. ‘You never know what can happen on the pitch, the behaviour of these people was only to go in and show I don’t know what. I’m very disappointed, for all the club’s supporters that love football, it’s a very strange situation.’ The second pitch invader was eventually stopped by Mousa Dembele, who tripped him up to cut short his time on the Tottenham field . Roberto Soldado grabs a pitch invader as referee Yevhen Aranovsky decides to halt the match . The players were taken off the field of play by Ukrainian referee  Aranovsky after the third pitch invasion of the first half . 41 minutes had been played when the referee Aranovsky led the players down the tunnel for 10 minutes . Tottenham's manager Mauricio Pochettino watches as players leave the pitch after the referee halts the match before half time . The giant screen shows that the match is suspended due to pitch invaders before half time of the Europa League game . Tottenham issued a statement saying: ‘Three pitch invaders at the match have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries. ‘We apologise to fans for the disruptions caused by this totally unacceptable behaviour.’ Shortly before the teams came back out, a tannoy announcement warned supporters at White Hart Lane: ‘Please do not run on the pitch. You will be arrested and banned from future matches. This is a criminal offence and police will prosecute.’ The first invader caught stewards by surprise on 21 minutes, was on the pitch for around two minutes and managed to take three ‘selfie’ photographs with Kyle Naughton, Erik Lamela and Jan Vertonghen, much to the bemusement of players. But it moved beyond a joke when another ran on to the pitch five minutes later and a third followed in the 41st minute. The first supporter took a selfie with Jan Vertonghen before being dragged away after two full minutes of being on the pitch . One of the pitch invaders gestures to the crowd after running on to the pitch and stopping play . One of the pitch invaders is escorted off the pitch by security during Tottenham's game with Partizan Belgrade . Stewards and officials tackle a third pitch invader to the floor during the first half . On Tottenham’s website they posted a competition to win the headphones just three days ago, explaining: ‘The official Tottenham Hotspur BassBuds collection offers Spurs fans a new and exciting way to show your pride for the team wherever you go.’ BassBuds issued a statement via Facebook which read: ‘We have been made aware of an incident at the Tottenham game .We are appalled that the game was interrupted in this manner. We do not condone the interruption of any sporting fixture in this way.’ Opposition manager Marko Nikolic was left stunned by the pitch invasions. ‘Maybe we can hope something like that happen everywhere in the world but not here in England,’ he said. ‘We were a bit surprised, I must say. It was a strange thing to be part of game in England and game stopping three times in one half, then for 10 mins. Maybe that was a little bit disturbing for both sides, for us definitely, but I don’t think it was decisive.’ He added: ‘These strange things are happening around the world and it’s not good for the game. People in UEFA and national federations, government and police who must think about that problem, it’s a big problem.’ One of the pitch invaders runs around the pitch after play was halted .

"A British Airways flight was forced to make an emergency landing at a Canadian town after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the flight deck. The Boeing 777, carrying 158 passengers from Heathrow to Philadelphia, made the unscheduled stop at Goose Bay, in Newfoundland, in temperatures of -30C after fumes started to cause eye and throat irritation halfway through the eight hour flight. The co-pilot also became incapacitated after he started to feel nauseous nearly half an hour later. Oxygen masks were then required for the captain and first officer, so they could make the landing last Sunday, according to the Sunday Express. Emergency: A British Airways Boeing 777 was forced to make an unscheduled stop after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the deck (file picture) The news comes just two weeks after the first picture was released of one of two top BA pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes. Last month it was reported Richard Westgate, 43, died after instructing his lawyers to sue BA for health and safety breaches days before fellow pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, passed away. Both claimed they had been poisoned by the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force pilots to wear oxygen masks. Mr Westgate's lawyers want to 'give him the trial he never got' by suing the airline in a case they say will be a 'moment of truth' for the aviation industry. They say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of 'aerotoxic syndrome', a chronic physical and neurological condition they insist will one day be seen as 'the new asbestos'. Thousands of pilots are currently 'unfit to fly', one specialist doctor claims. Pilot Richard Westgate, pictured at the controls of an airplane, had instructed his lawyers to sue BA for alleged health and safety breaches . Official records from the Civil Aviation Authority show that pilots and crew have to put on their oxygen masks at least five times a week to combat suspected 'fume events'. The Sunday Express report suggests the latest incident was on an aircraft which made an emergency landing in October 2009 after five passengers fainted or felt ill due to suspected fumes. The airline has denied any link between the two incidents, according to the report. Following the latest incident, a BA spokesman said: 'Safety is always our top priority and the captain took the right decision to divert. We are sorry our customers' journey was delayed.'

"Chris Eubank Jnr and Billy Joe Saunders finally came face to face as they weighed in ahead of their grudge match on Saturday night. Until they both stepped on the scales at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, Eubank had refused to square off with his opponent and also failed to attend the final press conference this week. Both men were comfortably inside the 160lb limit for a fight that looks set to overshadow the heavyweight rematch between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora at the ExCel Arena. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chris Eubank Jnr vs Billy Joe Saunders weigh-in . Chris Eubank Jnr (left) and Billy Joe Saunders come face to face at the weigh-in on Friday . It was the first time the boxers had squared off after Eubank Jnr failed to turn up for the final press conference . Earlier on Friday, a leading bookmaker took bets of £35,000 on Saunders and £10,000 on Eubank. And the pair locked eyes for several minutes in front of several hundred fans with both refusing to face the front for photographs. Saunders eventually broke the intense stare as Eubank's father watched on. Each brings a perfect record to the ring with Saunders' British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles on the line. The winner will also earn a shot at the WBO world title which will be contested by Andy Lee and Matt Korobov in Las Vegas next month. Without doubt, Saunders has proved himself against a higher calibre of opponent to date but as the fight draws closer, opinion is increasingly divided. Eubank Jnr and Saunders looks set to overshadow the main event between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora . Chris Eubank Snr fist pumps as his son weighs-in for Saturday's fight at London's Excel Arena . And Saunders admitted earlier this week that this was the first fight he had prepared for in a professional manner. He spent time in Marbella with trainer Jimmy Tibbs and at a media workout on Tuesday was only a couple of pounds over the middleweight limit. 'In my professional boxing career I've had 20 fights and I've won those 20 fights on work ethic alone because I haven't done my diet right,' he said. 'I know now I can't win a world title living the lifestyle I was living before. Kebabs, food, this, that, walking around at 15 stone. This time last year I was 16 stone – it was just a joke. I know I can't live that lifestyle – the elite fighters don't do it. 'When I won the European title in my last fight, the night before the weigh-in I got six-and-a-half pounds off in a sauna and I thought, ""I never want to do that again"". 'Some people have to learn from a loss but luckily enough I didn't have to and I got the win but I knew I had to learn from it.' Both boxers have a perfect record and the winner will have a shot at the WBO middleweight title . Saunders' British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles are on the line on Saturday . Eubank, meanwhile, believes he has won the mental battle before the first bell. 'I can see he is not mentally ready to face what is going to be brought to him on Saturday night,' he said. 'I could see he’s not ready at the press conference, with his nervous laughing and talking like he is a school kid. It’s going to be complete domination on my part in this fight. 'From day one of my professional career I have had people saying all types of things to me – from social media to trolls to haters. They have always been insulting me, whether it’s because they doubt my abilities or they didn’t like my dad so they don’t want me to succeed. 'So I’m used to insults and immune to any bad words that are directed towards me. He is not getting to me but I am getting to him by not reacting to the dumb things he says.'","Chris Eubank Jnr and Billy Joe Saunders step into the ring at the ExCel .

"A young French mother who was flying to New York via Switzerland for a holiday with her husband and two young children was told she not allowed entry to the United States, seemingly because her name sounds suspiciously like terrorist network Al Qaeda. Aida Alic arrived with her family at Geneva airport on Wednesday preparing to board a connection to JFK. However she was told by Swiss Airlines officials that her access to the country had been denied. Forced to cancel their trip and return to their house near Chambery in the French Alps, it wasn't until the 33-year-old got home and started googling for answers that she realized her name appears surname first on her passport and reads 'Alic Aida'. 'Religious profiling': Aida Alic, 33, was denied access to the United States because, she believes, her name appears on her passport as 'Alic Aida', which is suspiciously similar to terrorist organization Al Qaeda. She even had her nails painted as the American flag in preparation for the trip . Ms Alic feels there is no other explanation for being turned away by customs. 'Alic Aida, Al-Qaeda.,' she told the French news website Dauphine Libere. 'When friends make the play on words to wind me up, I am used to it, but not this. 'Especially as my name is pronounced Alitch. 'It is of Yugoslav origin. 'And now here I am labelled as a risk.' The family are out of pocked almost $3,800 on the trip because their return flights to the states were not refundable. Access Denied: Aida Alic was turned away by officials at Geneva International Airport in Switzerland, en route to New York with her family . Ms Alic continues to make inquiries about the trip but is yet  to receive any answers. The US embassy in Paris said it does not comment on individual cases of people appearing on the US no-fly list. As of 2012 there were over 21,000 names on the list which has been accused of religious and racial profiling and discrimination.","Aida Alic, 33, a French national, was traveling to New York with her husband and two young children .

"Doreen Lawrence is being given a seat in the House of Lords, 20 years after her son Stephen was murdered by racists. The respected campaigner for justice will be made a baroness in a list of peerages expected to be published today. She will sit on the Labour benches as a working peer specialising in race and diversity. Peerage: Doreen Lawrence is to become a Labour member of the House of Lords, 20 years after the murder of her son Stephen . Honour: As the co-founder of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, Mrs Lawrence received the OBE in 2003 . Welcoming the news, Shami Chakrabarti, . of human rights group Liberty, said: ‘Who can imagine transforming the . grief of losing a child into a campaign to reform policing and the wider . values of an entire nation?’ Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna tweeted: ‘Arise Baroness Doreen Lawrence!’ Mrs Lawrence, 60, who received an OBE . in 2003, has campaigned tirelessly for justice for her 18-year-old son, . who was stabbed to death after being ambushed by five white youths while . waiting at a bus stop in Eltham, South London, in April 1993. She founded the Stephen Lawrence . Charitable Trust to help young people from ethnic minorities pursue . their ambitions, and has sat on Home Office and police panels. Politics: In April senior politicians from all parties joined Mrs Lawrence at the 20th anniversary memorial of the death of Stephen - including, from left to right, Police Minister Damian Green, Home Secretary Theresa May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Prime Minister David Cameron, Labour leader Ed Milliband, who recommended her for the peerage, and London Mayor Boris Johnson .

"Louis van Gaal has demanded more from Robin van Persie after telling the misfiring Manchester United striker that he had ‘a very bad game’ against Arsenal last weekend. Van Persie was replaced at the Emirates for the fourth time this season having had only 13 touches of the ball. With Radamel Falcao set to return to the squad against Hull City on Saturday and young James Wilson on standby for a start, the Dutchman’s place is under threat. ‘You can count his touches of the ball and I do think that 13 is (too) few,’ said the United manager. Robin van Persie has been told that he must step up his displays after poor performance against Arsenal . Louis van Gaal has demanded more from his striker after a string of underwhelming games . Van Persie alongside his United team-mates in training on Friday ahead of the visit of Hull . ‘More importantly is how he’s playing. It was a very bad game from him and that is why I changed him. ‘When I change players it is normally because they are doing something not good. Every player has to fight for his position.’ Van Persie has struggled for form since firing United to the title in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final season, scoring 26 Premier League goals following a £24million move from Arsenal. The 31-year-old’s form dipped under David Moyes last season and hopes that he would be rejuvenated by the arrival of his old Holland coach have faded after a modest return of three goals in 11 games. Van Persie struggled to get into the game while playing up front at former club Arsenal last weekend . Van Persie cuts a dejected figure on the Emirates pitch after he managed just two touches in the first half . Van Persie was eventually substituted for 18-year-old forward James Wilson (left) in the second half . There are concerns that Van Persie has lost a yard of pace but Van Gaal questioned whether a lack of confidence might also be to blame. He said: ‘It’s a question also of confidence, maybe a question of scoring a wonderful goal at the right moment. You know how strikers are, they have to score goals. They feel like that, it’s not that I’m asking that.’ Falcao is available for the first time in more than a month after recovering from a calf injury but the Colombian lacks match fitness and Van Gaal could turn to Wilson, who will be 19 on Monday. Wilson marked his senior debut by scoring twice against Hull in the corresponding fixture in May and it is understood that he has been told to expect to start on Saturday or against Stoke on Tuesday. Striker Wilson, who will soon turn 19, could start for Manchester United against Hull on Saturday . Radamel Falcao (centre) who could be available following injury trains alongside Angel di Maria (right) Defender Marcos Rojo could be available less than a month after dislocating his shoulder . Asked if Wilson is ready, Van Gaal said: ‘I shall not say. You shall see if I give him that confidence.’ The manager refused to enthuse over the win at Arsenal, even though it lifted United into fourth place. ‘The performance was not the performance that shall give us a lot of confidence,’ said Van Gaal, who could include Marcos Rojo in his squad less than a month after the defender dislocated his shoulder in the Manchester derby. ‘We have to be fourth at the end of the league — now is not so important. We have to beat our opponents more easily.’","Louis van Gaal has demanded more from forward Robin van Persie .

"Bronze Age Brits were wearing bling around 4,000 years before today’s flashy pop stars and footballers, reveals new research. A study proved our ancestors adorned themselves with necklaces featuring mollusc shells. Scientists analysed amino acids to identify the raw materials used to make beads in a 4,000 year old necklace unearthed during an archaeological dig in Suffolk. Beads in a 4,000 year old necklace (pictured) were found to be made of Dog whelks and tusk shells. The Bronze Age began in Britain about 2,000 BC when new bronze tools and weapons were brought over from continental Europe. The . skulls recovered from burial sites from the Bronze Age are different in . shape from Stone Age skulls, suggesting new ideas and new blood were . arriving. Stone and bronze . can be used together, subject to the availability of both materials. True bronze is a combination of 10 per cent tin and 90 per cent copper. Both materials were readily available in Britain at this time. Before . its entry into Britain, the Bronze Age was in full swing in Europe. The . island of Crete was centre for the expansion of the bronze trade to . Europe. The Mycenaeans . created the finest bronze weapons. They came from southern Russia at . around 2,000 BC, and settled in the lowlands of Greece. There they began . to trade with the Minoans. They built a large navy, and began to attack . nearby lands. Bonze Age craftsmen used species such as dog whelk and tusk shells, both of which were likely to have been sourced and worked locally, to fashion the tiny disc-shaped balls, according to the findings published in the journal PLOS ONE. The necklace was found by archaeologists at an Early Bronze Age burial site at Great Cornard, near Sudbury, and researchers wanted to know where the items came from. The Mediterranean thorny oyster, for instance, is a shell of long-standing symbolic and cultural significance which is known to have been used on the continent around the time when the necklace was made. But powerful microscopes found this not to be the case, and an alternative possibility has now been suggested. Dr Beatrice Demarchi, of the University of York, said: ‘Dog whelks and tusk shells were likely to be available locally so these people did not have to travel far to get hold of the raw materials for their beads.

Bottom left and right are microscopic images of the beads, which are pictured top left and right . ‘There is evidence, from elsewhere in Britain and further afield, for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past. This may well be because they are relatively easy to work and their hollow shape is very distinctive.’ Study co-author Dr Julie Wilson added: ‘The statistical analysis used pattern recognition algorithms for taxonomic identification, comparing the composition of the beads with a large database of shell amino acid compositions. ‘Although we cannot know the origin of the beads for certain, our multi-disciplinary approach provides additional evidence for the identifications.’ The necklace was found by archaeologists at an Early Bronze Age burial site at Great Cornard, near Sudbury .","The 4,000-year-old necklace was found in an archaeological dig in Suffolk .

"It’s every cyclist’s nightmare – discovering that they have run out of water half way up a hill on a sweltering day. But the days of topping up water bottles may soon be over, now that one designer has created a bottle that collects and condenses moisture from the air while a bike is in motion. The prototype ‘Fontus’ device uses the principle of thermoelectric cooling to fill up a bottle with water when attached to a bike frame. The ‘Fontus’ bottle uses the principle of thermoelectric cooling to fill up with water when attached to a bike frame (pictured). It's named after the Roman god of wells and springs . Kristof Retezár, an industrial design student at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna came up with the idea, and a finalist in the 2014 James Dyson Award. Named after the Roman god of wells and springs, the upper part of the bottle holder is cooled by electricity generated by solar panels, while the bottom heats up. This means that as the bike moves, air is sucked inside and moves through the upper chamber of the holder, where it cools down. The air condenses into water and drips into the bottle attatched below. ‘Useful on long bike tours, the constant search for freshwater sources such as rivers and gas stations can cease to be an issue since the bottle automatically fills itself up,’ he wrote on the James Dyson Award website. The upper part of the bottle is cooled by electricity generated by solar panels, while the bottom heats up. This means that as the bike moves, air is sucked inside and moves through the upper chamber of the bottle, where it cools down. It condenses into water and drips into the bottle (a cross section of the design is shown) The bike-mounted device that the bottle attaches to, has a small cooler at its centre called Peltier Element. This cooler is divided in two. Solar panels generate electricity to cool the upper part down, while the bottom side warms up. As air enters the bottom chamber of the bottle at high speed - when the bike is moving forwards - the hot side of the device is cooled down, which in turn cools the cold side further. When the air enters the top chamber it is stopped with 'little walls' that are perforated, and the water condenses. Droplets flow through a pope into the bottle, which can be turned into a vertical position and loosened. Any standard 500ml bottle can be used. Mr Retezár said that the device can harvest half a litre of water in an hour under the right climatic conditions - in temperatures of around 20°C (68°F) and 50 per cent humidity. The bottle has a filter to keep dust out of the water, but does not yet purify it, which may be important the Fontus bottle is used in a polluted city. He told The Huffington Post that the prototype cost between $25 (£16) and $40 (£26) to make, but he plans on refining the design before bringing it to market and setting a price for consumers. Mr Retezár has not ruled out raising money via crowdfunding and aside from consumer cycling applications, believes the product could be used to acquire fresh water in regions of the world where groundwater is scarce but air humidity is high. ‘Harvesting water from the air is a method that has been practised for more than 2,000 years in certain cultures mostly in Asia and Central America,’ he said. ‘The Earth’s atmosphere contains around 8,077 cubic miles (13,000 km3) of mostly unexploited freshwater. This project is an attempt to discover these resources.’ The bottle may be able to help the two billion people in more than 40 countries who live in regions with water scarcity. It is predicted that 47 per cent of the world’s population will be living in areas of high water stress in 2030. Industrial design student, Mr Retezár said that the device can harvest half a litre of water in an hour under the right climatic conditions - in temperatures of around 20°C (68°F) and 50 per cent humidity. A diagram of the different parts of the device is shown .","‘Fontus’ bottle uses the principle of thermoelectric cooling to fill up with water when attached to a device on a moving bike frame .

"The unexpected result makes it appear as though the Earth is breathing . It is an incredible view of our planet ‘breathing’ over the course of a year. Created using images from Nasa, the incredible animated images give the iconic ‘blue marble’ view of the Earth a dramatic new twist. They were created by John Nelson, a Michigan programmer for IDV Solutions. He stitched together images provided by Nasa as part of its ‘Blue Marble Next Generation’ project, which took a picture of the Earth each month. ‘It took an afternoon to make,’ Nelson told MailOnline. ‘And then a little bit more for me to describe why I felt the way I did about them - which, to be honest, caught me quite by surprise. ‘I of course had some expectation of what I would see as a result of animating these frames. ‘But I didn't expect to be so mesmerised by them.' The images are based on the original Blue Marble, a composite of four months of satellite observations with a spatial resolution (level of detail) of 1 square kilometer per pixel created by Nasa. Nelson thanked Nasa for updating the project for his version. 'This is made possible by the tremendous folks of the NASA Visible Earth team.' He also explained how the animations were made. He said the idea for the site came following a chat with a colleague about Nasa’s website. ‘The idea for these images came about rather randomly, as I was describing to a colleague various design options for presenting satellite data in a compelling way. An image from Nasa's Visible Earth Project. There have been many images of the full disc of Earth from space- a view often referred to as 'the Blue Marble'- but few have looked quite like this. Using natural-colour images from the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), this shows a new view showing the Arctic and high latitudes . ‘When went to NASA's Visible Earth website to access some of their tremendous source data imagery, that they make freely available, I noted that there were images representing Earth at each month of the year. ‘I was curious if stitching them together in time into an animation would show and interesting seasonal pattern and so I went to work. ‘I downloaded the twelve cloud-free satellite imagery mosaics of Earth (""Blue Marble Next Generation"") at each month of the year.  I wrapped them into some fun projections then stitched them together into a couple animated gifs.’ ‘Because much of the dramatic change throughout the year occurs in the northern latitudes, I chose a polar projection to focus on this area. Nelson said he hoped the images would give people a new view of the planet. This image of Asia and Australia at night is a composite assembled from data acquired by the Suomi NPP satellite in April and October 2012. The new data was mapped over existing Blue Marble imagery of Earth to provide a realistic view of the planet . ‘Overall, to me it looks like breathing,’ he said. ‘My pixel is right at an interesting intersection of life and ice, where the longest night of the year feels like forever, and the longest day of the year is a like a battery strapped to my back. ‘When I stitch together what can be an impersonal snapshot of an entire planet, all of the sudden I see a thing with a heartbeat. ‘I can track one location throughout a year to compare the annual push and pull of snow and plant life there, while in my periphery I see the oscillating wave of life advancing and retreating, advancing and retreating. ‘And I'm reassured by it.’ John Nelson used the Visible Earth website to access some of their tremendous source data imagery, that they make freely available. This 'blue marble' image is is the most detailed true-colour image of the entire Earth to date . The images, created by Nasa, are part of a series called Blue Marble: Next Generation, and give a years worth of monthly composites at a spatial resolution of 500 meters. ‘These monthly images reveal seasonal changes to the land surface: the green-up and dying-back of vegetation in temperate regions such as North America and Europe, dry and wet seasons in the tropics, and advancing and retreating Northern Hemisphere snow cover,’ said Nasa. ‘From a computer processing standpoint, the major improvement is the development of a new technique for allowing the computer to automatically recognise and remove cloud-contaminated or otherwise bad data—a process that was previously done manually. ‘The new version also improves image clarity, and gives highly reflective land surfaces, such as salt flats, a more realistic appearance.’","Animation was created by John Nelson, a U.S. programmer for IDV solutions .

"The live-in boyfriend of troubled country singer Mindy McCready shot himself in his Arkansas home on Sunday night, it was revealed today. New sheriff reports reveal that David Wilson, 34, was found in his house in Heber Springs with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and he was transported to the local hospital but declared dead shortly after. Singer McCready, who has publicly struggled with drug problems, described her live-in boyfriend as her 'soul mate' and 'life partner' as she announced his death on Sunday. Mourning: David Wilson, seen here with his country singer girlfriend Mindy McCready, was found with a gunshot wound on Sunday night and pronounced dead hours later . 'Life partners': McCready, 37, and Wilson, 34, lived together in a home owned by a Wilson relative . The official Cleburne County Sheriff's department confirmed to MailOnline that police and emergency services responded to a call at approximately 6.15pm on Sunday though it is unclear who made the call. The house is the same one where McCready was discovered hiding in a closet in December 2011 with her elder son Zander after a nationwide manhunt as part of a long custody dispute. Zander was taken from McCready's arms and placed in foster care. McCready's mother and step-father had legal custody of him at the time, following McCready's lengthy and public battle with drug addiction. Bygone era: McCready burst onto the country music scene in 1996 with 'Ten Thousand Angels' (left), and she had her first son Zander ten years later in 2006 (right), seen here being held on stage by Rosie O'Donnell . Custody: Mindy had been fighting for custody rights over her elder son Zander (pictured) for years and allegedly was just awarded the landmark decision . It's unclear whether Zander is living . with McCready, if he has been returned to his grandparents and if he . remains in foster care. Wilson is the father of McCready's younger son, Zayne, who was born in April. 'Today, we mourn the loss of my life partner and my children's father, David Wilson,' McCready said in a statement she released. 'David was my soulmate; he was a caregiver and guiding hand to our sons, Zander and Zayne. 'Mindy is in no condition to to be talking right now. She's too upset.' -- Mindy McCready's brother Joshua . 'He . was a precious gift from God to all of us and, yesterday, he returned . home and is now with his mother and father. David loved and he was . loved. 'Those who knew and . loved him will miss him; those who did not know David missed the . opportunity to know a truly loving and gifted man.' The police report says that emergency services arrived at Wilson's house on Fox Chase Road at 6.15pm and transported him to nearby Baptist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8pm. No criminal charges have been filed but the investigation is ongoing. Speaking to MailOnline, Mindy's brother Joshua said that she was too upset to talk to anybody. He said: 'She's going through a lot right now. What happened was tragic, there's no doubt about it. In the business: Wilson ran Dave Wilson Productions and was also a songwriter . Too young: Wilson was only 34-years-old when he was found dead on Sunday, and he was the father of Mindy's 9-month-old son Zayne . Picturesque: Wilson was found shot in the home he and Mindy shared on Fox Chase Road in Eden Isle neighborhood just off Greers Ferry Lake in Arkansas . 'I knew David pretty well. Mindy is in no condition to to be talking right now. She's too upset. 'She is being looked after by relatives'. Fatal: The nature of his self-inflicted gunshot wound has not been revealed and the investigation is ongoing . Mindy's father Timothy said that the family were still coming to terms with their loss. 'Thank you so much for calling but it's way too soon and there's too much going on,' he said. 'It's just too soon. We're still dealing with it.' The house on Fox Chase Road became the center of the custody battle between Mindy and her parents after she kidnapped her elder son and hid out in the house that was then-owned by her father Timothy McCready. News reports said at the time that neither she nor Wilson- who was found in the house with her- were allowed to be on the property. The house has since legally changed hands, and is now owned by a relative of Wilson's. Wilson is said to be a record producer and songwriter, though it is unclear who he worked with specifically. McCready . rose to fame in 1996 with her hit country song 'Ten Thousand Angels.' Her album of the same name went double platinum - though that marked the . peak of her career. She struggled with arrests and drug addition after her career began to faded in the late 1990s. She . was dropped by BNA Records in after her 1999 album had disappointing . sales and then dropped by Capitol Records in after her 2002 record . suffered the same fate. She was arrested in Tennessee in 2004 and pleaded guilty to using a fake prescription to buy the painkiller OxyContin. Criminal record: Mindy McCready has been arrested multiple times- for a probation violation in 2005 (left), for allegedly assaulting her mother in 2007 (center) and for a probation violation shortly after that (right) Troubled: Mindy McCready, 37, has waged a public battle with drug addiction since her career peaked in 1996 . She . was arrested in Nashville in May 2005 for drunk driving and driving . with a suspended license after she was stopped for speeding. Two months . later, she was charged with identity theft, unlawful use of . transportation, unlawful imprisonment, and hindering prosecution in . Arizona. She was arrested twice, in 2005, 2007 and 2008, for violating the term of her probation. 'He . was a precious gift from God to all of us and, yesterday, he returned . home and is now with his mother and father. David loved and he was . loved' -Mindy McCready . In July 2007, she was arrested in Fort Myers, Florida and charged with with fighting with her mother. In . 2005 and 2008, she was hospitalized for attempting suicide. She was . taken to the hospital in 2010 for a drug overdose, as well. McCready . has been mounting a comeback in recent years, though. Her 2010 album . 'I'm Still Here' was praised by critics for McCready's vocal prowess. She also appeared on Celebrity Rehab with Dr Drew as she attempted to work out her drug issues. Hard life: McCready has been arrested numerous times - including once for drunk driving and once for drugs . On the show's website, VH1 made references to her personal problems and even pegged the root of her troubles on her relationships. Her biography on the show's page says: 'Although she was arrested and jailed for trying to buy OxyContin with a false prescription and attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs and alcohol, Mindy believes her only true addiction is to violent relationships.'","David Wilson, 34, was McCready's live in boyfriend and her 'soul mate'

"Viewers have criticised Olympic medallist Chris Boardman for not wearing a helmet while cycling around Manchester for a BBC programme on cycling safety. Hundreds of angry viewers have taken to social media to complain that the champion cyclist set a bad example by wearing dark clothing and no helmet for a cycling safety segment on BBC Breakfast this morning. Mr Boardman was shown riding five miles around the streets of Manchester with presenter Louise Minchin as he gave his top tips for cycling safely in Britain's cities. Scroll down for video .

But while Ms Minchin wore a cycle helmet and bright yellow visibility jacket, Mr Boardman, who has his own brand of cycle helmets, was seen in a dark coat and jeans. He later said in a video posted on the BBC Breakfast Facebook page that he didn't wear a helmet because it 'discourages people from riding a bike' and 'you are as safe riding a bike as you are walking.' But more than 300 viewers complained he was being irresponsible for not wearing a helmet, particularly as the segment was shown as children were getting ready for the school run. While Louise Minchin wore a cycle helmet and bright yellow visibility jacket, Olympian Chris Boardman, who has his own brand of cycle helmets,  rejected a helmet and wore dark clothing .

Viewer John Stimpson wrote: 'Chris Boardman wearing no helmet and riding in black jacket and jeans. For an item on cycling safety you can't get more stupid.' Another viewer, Benjamin Holden, added: 'Not only is he not wearing a helmet but he's also wearing dark clothing in stark contrast to the presenter who is appropriately dressed in high a visibility jacket. For a so called 'hero' of cycling he is setting an extremely bad example!!!' Mr Boardman said in a video posted on the BBC Breakfast Facebook page that he did not wear a helmet because it 'discourages people' from riding . Rebecca Townson said: 'His comments make me so angry. A friend of ours had a serious bike accident and he was told if he hadn't been wearing his helmet he would've been killed. 'His helmet was smashed up. My husband came off once and cracked his helmet.

'I have just spent 10 minutes explaining his argument to my three daughters who now question safety and feel less sure about being safe on a bike. Well done Chris, you idiot.' Viewer Lou Lessiter added: 'I'm a normal cyclist, I wear normal clothes, I also wear a helmet! Enough said, I now think you're a bigger idiot than I did before! You have lost all credibility & respect as has the BBC for allowing you air time!' Mr Boardman explained his reason for not wearing a helmet in a video posted this morning. He said: 'It's a very long answer and more time than we've got here, but it discourages people from riding a bike. You are as safe riding a bike as you are walking. One angry viewer wrote on Facebook: 'For a so called 'hero' of cycling he is setting an extremely bad example' 'Statistically you are much safer than going in your own bathroom and you don't wear a helmet there. 'There is absolutely nothing wrong with helmets, but it's not in the top 10 things you can do to keep safe. 'We're going to look at all those things, but for me I want bikes to be for normal people in normal clothes. 'About 0.5 per cent of people wear helmets in the Netherlands and yet it's the safest country in the world and there's a reason for that.' A BBC spokesman said: 'Wearing a cycle helmet is not a legal requirement. It’s a matter of individual choice and the BBC is not able to force Chris to wear one. 'Our presenter Louise Minchin did wear a helmet during the filming. BBC Breakfast has also featured campaigns calling for cycle helmets to be worn.' Paul Tuohy, Chief Executive of CTC, the national cycling charity said: 'The furore around Chris Boardman not wearing a helmet shows how far the health and safety lobby has scared people off from the health and money saving benefits of cycling. 'Instead of relying on polystyrene a better solution would be to create proper provision for cycling so that your child or granny would feel safe on our roads.' Mr Boardman defended his choice and said helmets are 'not in the top 10 things you can do to keep safe' Ed Morrow, campaigns officer for Brake, the road safety charity, said: 'Brake encourages cycle helmet use as an easy step to protect yourself from head injury in the event of a crash. 'However, cycling injuries can take many other forms, which is why the most important thing to focus on is making sure people on bikes aren’t being hit in the first place – by improving driver awareness, rolling out more 20mph limits, and building safe cycle routes into our road infrastructure at every stage. 'That way, we can create a road environment where far more people feel safe to cycle, and reap the undeniable health, environmental and economic benefits that result.' Mr Boardman has also written a statement on the British Cycling website defending his decision to not wear a helmet. In it, he wrote: 'People wear helmets and high vis as they feel it’s all they can do to keep themselves safe. It shows just how far away Britain is from embracing cycling as a normal and convenient form of transport.' He cites Utrecht in the Netherlands, where helmet use is less than 0.5 per cent but they have a good safety record and 'some of the lowest casualty rates of anywhere in the world'. He added: 'I want cycling in the UK to be like it is in Utrecht or Copenhagen and more recently New York City - an everyday thing that people can do in everyday clothes whether you are eight or 80 years old. 'I want cycling to be a normal thing that normal people do in normal clothes. Is that wrong?' BBC Breakfast is running a week of special reports on cycling and started today with Mr Boardman's top tips for safe cycling. The reports come as figures from the Department of Transport show that for every hour cycled in England you are 16 times more likely to be killed or seriously injured on a bike than driving a car. The Government wants to double the number of cyclists over the next 10 years. At the moment only one per cent of journeys under a mile are taken by bike. The Department of Transport's Think! road safety campaign recommends wearing a correctly fitted cycle helmet, which is securely fastened and conforms to current regulations when cycling.","Chris Boardman was filmed riding a bike around Manchester as he gave Louise Minchin his top safety tips for cycling segment on BBC Breakfast .

"He has millions of female fans and it seems that Harry Styles has been taking style inspiration from them. The One Direction singer, who just jetted back from his US tour, reportedly took advantage of his time in the States by stocking up on women's jeans. A source told the Daily Star Sunday that 20-year-old Harry was seen perusing the ladies jeans in Paige Denim in Beverley Hills. Harry (girls) Styles: The 20-year-old One Direction singer reportedly loves stocking up on women's jeans from celebrity favourite Paige Denim when he's in America . 'He went straight for the women's ranges. Harry's favourites are the skinny women's jeans in size 30 and then men's jeans in size 28,' said the source. 'Of the two, he says he prefers the women's because they are the tightest.' Harry apparently loves the black and grey versions of the Paige jeans, which have fast become a celebrity favourite. The tighter the better! A source told the Daily Star Sunday that Harry's favourites are the skinny women's jeans, right, in size 30, because they are the tightest . Good taste: Harry apparently loves the black and grey versions of the jeans, which he has been stocking up on during his tour of the States with One Direction this month . And it seems that money is no object for the star, who is worth a reported £20m. Harry apparently snapped up four pairs of women's jeans, as well as two pairs of men's. The star has such a love affair with the brand that he even splurged £551 on a pair of women's black leather Edgemont jeans. Established by founder and creative director Paige Adams-Geller in Los Angeles in  2005, Paige's designs became an instant hit with celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Olivia Palermo and Miranda Kerr, as well as prominent fashion editors. They range in price from £175 all the way up to £900 for a pair of leather trousers. After graduating from USC, the former Miss California became a fashion industry muse, transitioning from modeling to a career behind the seams and her namesake designs are now sold at Net-a-Porter and in Selfridges with IT girl Rosie Huntington-Whiteley serving as the face of her brand. She wears them well! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is currently the face (and legs) of Paige Denim, which was established in 2005 by Paige Adams-Geller . Like peas in a pod: The supermodel posed with the brand's founder, Paige Adams-Geller, at a recent store launch . Speaking about Harry's fashion choice, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'It's nice to know he’s investing in clothes, but honestly Harry, if your jeans get any tighter, you’ll almost certainly develop a bad case of thrush. Or at least stop the circulation to some of your vitals. 'Men’s skinny jeans are bad enough - some are verging on meggings territory, but women’s jeans are cut differently: to support a bottom and fit hips, of which Harry has neither. And what’s more, I’m sure no women find it sexy that HER jeans look better on HIM. Those twiglet legs do nothing for the opposite sex. 'Surely he can find some decent denim made for men? I do believe that super skin tight, spray on jeans are slowly dying out (thank God), so now might be a good time for Harry to try a new cut. Unsightly camel toe on women is bad enough, if Harry continues with his ladies jeans, we’re sure to see the male equivalent sooner or later!'","Harry, 20, is a huge fan of Paige Denim .

"The global hacking group Anonymous launched a cyber attack against Israeli government websites in a web protest on the country's annual Holocaust memorial day. Hackers had promised a mass assault to protest over Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, with the campaign appearing timed to coincide with the memorial day, which begins at sundown tonight. However, Israeli officials have said that the plan to shut down the country's websites failed to cause any serious disruptions, despite threats from the Anonymous hacker collective. Campaign: Global hacking group Anonymous launched a cyber attack against Israeli government websites in a web protest on the country's annual Holocaust memorial day . Attack: The mass assault was part of a strike called #OpIsrael in protest over Israeli policy towards the Palestinians . The cyber attack was the latest in an almost constant effort by Israel's enemies and ideological opponents to shut down its vital websites. Most of the attacks have had little impact, and Israeli experts even say they welcome the attempts as ways of sharpening their defenses. Israel itself is accused of taking part in much more sophisticated cyber attacks against its enemies, particularly Iran. Web posters using the name of the hacking . group Anonymous warned they would launch a mass attack on Israeli sites . in a strike they called #OpIsrael, starting today. An official from the militant Palestinian Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, praised the attackers. 'God bless the minds and the efforts of the soldiers of the electronic battle,' Ihab Al-Ghussein, Gaza's chief government spokesman, wrote on his official Facebook page. However, by late afternoon, few disruptions had been reported. The Foreign Ministry's website was taken down for a few seconds, but no other ministries behind the government firewall were affected, said Ram Alfia, an official at the Finance Ministry, which oversees the government's websites. Concern: A Palestinian man looks at the Facebook page of Avichay Adraee, the spokesman of the Israeli Army to the Arabic media, after hackers replaced his cover photo with that of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigade . He said some slowdowns in local Internet service were expected because of government countermeasures. The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial was among those targeted. Its website was operating fully on the eve of memorial day for the victims of the Holocaust, the time apparently set for the assault. Israel is considered one of the world's cyber powers. Its secretive high-tech military units have helped turn the country into a leader in cyber security, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has identified cyber security as a top priority. Israel is also said to be a cyber attacker itself. Among other operations, it was widely believed to have been involved, along with the United States, in the Stuxnet virus, which damaged Iran's nuclear development program in 2010. Israel has never commented on the allegations. 'The Israeli people have a lot of knowledge in security, they know what they are doing in security and we can see that no major sites have been hacked,' said Roni Bachar, head of the Israeli cyber security firm Avnet. 'The major sites have got professional people ... and fixed all the problems on the sites on a regular basis.' Isaac Ben-Israel, a former director of the government's National Cyber Bureau, said that the hackers failed to shut down key sites. Target: The '#Op_Israel' campaign reportedly hit the websites of the Israeli premier's office, the defence ministry, the education ministry and the Central Bureau of Statistics . Dismissed: Israeli officials said that the plan to shut down the country's websites failed to cause any serious disruptions, despite threats from the Anonymous hacker collective . 'So far, it is as was expected. There is hardly any real damage,' Mr Ben-Israel told Israel's Army Radio. Israeli news websites reported brief cyber attacks on the stock market and the Finance Ministry Saturday night, but the two institutions denied the reports. Israeli media said small businesses were targeted, and some websites' home pages were replaced by anti-Israel slogans. In retaliation, Israeli activists hacked sites of radical Islamist groups and splashed them with pro-Israel messages. Shlomi Dolev, an expert on network security and cryptography at Israel's Ben-Gurion University, said attacks of this kind will likely become more common. 'It is a good test for our defense systems, and we will know better how to deal with more serious threats in the future,' he said. He said Israel is well prepared to deal with the attacks. 'This is a real battle. It is good training for our experts,' he said. Mr Dolev, who also serves as chairman of the Inter-University Communication Center, which connects Israeli universities and research branches of companies like IBM, added that 40 security experts from the center 'are looking forward to play with the attackers'. Hackers have tried before to topple Israeli sites, with limited success. In January 2012, a hacker network that claimed to be based in Saudi Arabia paralyzed the websites of Israel's stock exchange and national airline and claimed to have published details of thousands of Israeli credit cards. A concerted effort to cripple Israeli websites during November fighting in Gaza failed to cause serious disruption. Israel said at the time that protesters barraged Israel with more than 60 million hacking attempts. Coping: Israeli experts believe that similar attacks will become more common, and that the protest had allowed them to test out defense systems .","Hackers had planned online assault to protest Israeli policy on Palestinians .

"It is one of the most mysterious substances in the universe, but it appears dark matter could hold the key to the future of our species. Scientists have found evidence that suggests encounters between the Earth and concentrations of dark matter in our galaxy trigger mass extinctions. They claim that as the Earth hits patches of dark matter, it can lead to additional heating of our planet's core, causing geological events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Dark matter clustered within the dense disk of the Milky Way (shown above) could trigger extinction events by sending comets on a collision course with our planet and sparking geological disruption on the Earth . The dark matter is also thought to disrupt the orbits of comets, potentially sending them on a collision course with the Earth, such as the strike 66 million years ago that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. Professor Michael Rampino, a biologist at New York University, has found that these events appear to occur every 30 million years, broadly in time with our solar system's path through the galactic disk of the Milky Way . In a scientific paper for the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, he said the Earth could be still be experiencing the effects of the most recent encounters and may even result in future extinctions. He said that the solar system is thought to have last passed through the plane of the Milky Way around two to three million years ago and this might explain a cluster of recent impact craters and a minor extinction event in the Pliocene. Professor Rampino said: 'Several researchers have suggested that we are in a comet shower at present. 'This may be a long-term driver of evolution, since the mass extinctions are followed by evolutionary radiations filling all the vacant niches. 'Of course, if we are in a shower now we might expect enhanced rates of large body impacts.' He also said that the heat generated in the Earth's core by dark matter can take millions of years to bubble to the surface. Professor added: 'We are fortunate enough to live on a planet that is ideal for the development of complex life. 'But the history of the Earth is punctuated by large scale extinction events, some of which we struggle to explain. 'It may be that dark matter – the nature of which is still unclear but which makes up around a quarter of the universe – holds the answer. 'As well as being important on the largest scales, dark matter may have a direct influence on life on Earth.' Our solar system sits on a sprial arm of our galaxy, the Milky Way, as can be seen in the graphic above . The study found the Earth's path through the main disk of the galaxy (marked with x on the solid line) coincide with impact craters (hatched area), floods of volcanic bassalt (dots) and mass extinctions (arrows) If he is right, then it would mean that the future of life on Earth and our own civilisation may be determined by encounters with clumps of dark matter in the future. Dark matter is thought to be clustered in dense clumps within the plane of the galactic disk of the Milky Way galaxy. This is the area of our spiral shaped galaxy that is particularly crowded with stars and interstellar dust. Although dark matter cannot be seen with conventional telescopes, it thought to exist due to the gravitational effects it has on the light and matter around it. Our own solar system sits on one of the spiral arms of the galaxy but as it orbits the supermassive blackhole at the heart of the Milky Way, it follows a wavy path that winds through the plane galactic disk every 33 to 42 million years. Dark matter cannot be seen directly with telescopes but its effect on the light from other objects in the universe can be seen, like the ghostly rink in the picture taken by the Hubble Telescope above . Professor Rampino claims that as the solar system passes through the patches of dark matter here, the gravity it produces can disrupt the huge swarm of comets that sit in the Oort cloud around the very outer edges of our solar system. This can throw them into the inner reaches of the solar system and some can impact the Earth. He found that there appeared to be regular correlations between extinction events on Earth and the movement of the solar system through the galactic disk. His conclusions echo those made by Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece at Harvard University in Massachusetts who calculated last year that the solar system would move through a dark matter disc every 35 million years. They said this matched a similar pattern seen in comet impacts on Earth. Professor Rampino, however, also claims that major geological events also appear to be correlated to this movement through the galaxy and may also trigger extinctions. He said that major changes in sea level and tectonic episodes appeared to occur on a 26-27 million year cycle. Dark matter may be linked to increases in volcanic activity by heating up the Earth's core, the paper claims . Professor Rampino believes that dark matter particles could become trapped within the Earth's gravity and accumulate in the Earth's core, where they may reach densities high enough for mutual annihilation. This, he says, would release huge amounts of energy and heat the planet's interior, leading to geological disruption millions of years later. If correct, this could mean the Earth will experience an increase in earthquakes and volcanoes as a result of the last crossing our solar system made through the plane of the Milky Way two to three million years ago. It could explain why geologists are finding that the Earth appears to be growing more active - certainly compared to the 20 year period since the mid-1970s. Professor Romano said: 'Excess heat near the core-mantle boundary could trigger upwelling plumes of mantle material. 'These plumes could rise to the surface in possibly as short as a few million years, depending on mantle vicosity. 'The plumes would create volcanic hotspots, rift apart continents and perturb mantle convection, possibly leading to pulses of tectonic unrest, changes in direction and rate of sea floor spreading and associated changes in volcanism, sea level and climate. 'Geological events that have been thought of as independent occurrences might have common roots and might be partly related to extraterrestrial forces.'","Scientists have found a correlation between extinction events on Earth to the path our solar system takes through crowded areas of the Milky Way .

"A family has been forced out of their home for Christmas after their pet Beagle set fire to the kitchen by turning on the hob with her paw. Ten-month-old Muffin was home alone when she accidentally ignited a flame as she jumped around the kitchen top. As clothing near the electric oven caught fire, the ground floor went up in flames and Muffin was left barking for her life. Jill Tonge, 33, from Bolton, left Muffin home alone for a morning and came back to a blackened kitchen . Shock: Ms Tonge said her children, Jayden, 11, and Lexi, 7, are devastated two days before Christmas . Hearing the alarms and cries, the next-door neighbour to the semi-detached home in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, called the emergency services, stopping the blaze from spreading further. Firefighters forced their way into the property and rescued Muffin at . around 10.30am on Saturday, arriving within a minute of the neighbour's call. Despite tackling the flames immediately, . the kitchen is wrecked, all the doors will need to be . replaced and the walls are black with smoke. Today homeowner Jill Tonge, 33, who was at work at the time, said she and her two children are devastated as they will not be home for Christmas. She said: 'It has ruined Christmas a bit because I wanted to have it at home with . my kids with all our own decorations up. But I’m just trying not to let . it get to me for the kids’ sake. Still learning: As she is just a puppy, the family hope Muffin will grow out of her hyperactiveness. But failing that, Ms Tonge admitted she may concede to buying some sort of cage . 'When I told them Muffin had started . the fire they were devastated because they love her to pieces. I just . had to tell them that she didn’t mean to do it.' Luckily the family’s presents were not damaged in the fire but any hopes of Christmas dinner at home have been dashed. Ms Tonge and her children Jayden, 11, and Lexi, 7, will have to go to her parents, where Muffin is already causing havoc. 'They aren’t used to the dog. She’s a barker,' she said. 'But she has been very quiet since the fire - I thought maybe she was embarrassed. But then yesterday she woke my mum up at 6am so she’s back to her old ways.' Muffin suffered smoke inhalation and was seen by a vet but is now back to full fitness. Despite the damage, Ms Tonge says her feelings for Muffin are still the same, though she may consider new ways of controlling her behaviour. The firefighters arrived at 10.30am on Saturday and managed to prevent the fire from spreading, and saved Muffin . She said: 'Muffin is a mischievous dog and she’s very feisty. She can be boisterous at times but she’s still young so she’s still learning. 'She’s . our first dog and we’ve only had her since April. I’ll definitely think . twice about leaving her in the house alone from now on. I might even . have to get her a cage which I don’t want to do but I can’t risk . anything like this happening again. 'When my neighbour rang me up and told me there was a fire at the house I just wanted to know if the dog was alright. I wasn’t angry with the dog, I was just so worried. 'Apparently she ran upstairs and hid in the bedroom. She must have been so scared. I’m obviously devastated about the damage but there’s nothing I can do now - you just have to get on with it. 'I still love the dog to pieces but I never thought she could do anything like that. It’s definitely made me more wary. I’m just pleased the kids were at my mum’s and my neighbour was in. Although we can’t live in the house at the moment because it’s still really smoky.'","Muffin was home alone when she ignited a flame jumping around the house .

"With the word ‘lunacy’ tracing its roots to ‘lunar’, it’s been a common myth for centuries that a full moon causes higher levels of psychological problems and can result in a rise in crime or injuries. But the lunar cycle has no effect on our mental state - and full moon madness can be put down as legend, according to a patient study by psychologists at Université Laval in Québec City, Canada. They analysed 771 patients admitted to emergency wards over three years, in particular those with psychological problems, and found they were no more likely to come in during a full or new moon. Full moon: The lunar cycle has no effect on our mental state, according to a hospital study by psychologists . But medical staff said otherwise, with 80 per cent of nurses and 63 per cent of doctors convinced they saw more patients with mental health problems during a full moon than at any other time. Researchers evaluated patients who visited emergency rooms at Sacré-Coeur Hospital in Montreal, Quebec and Hôtel-Dieu de Lévis in Lévis, Quebec, and linked their visits to lunar calendars. The scientists looked at patients who came in with mystery chest pains - and found a large number of those people suffered from panic attacks, anxiety and mood disorders, or suicidal thoughts. Results showed there was no link between incidence of psychological problems and the four lunar phases, but anxiety disorders were 32 per cent less frequent during the last lunar quarter. Institution: The research was produced by psychologists at Université Laval in Québec City, Canada . Professor Geneviève Belleville from the university’s psychology school said: ‘This may be coincidental or due to factors we did not take into account. But one thing is certain. 'One thing is certain - we observed no full-moon or new-moon effect on psychological problems' Professor Geneviève Belleville . ‘We observed no full-moon or new-moon effect on psychological problems. The analyses revealed no link between the incidence of psychological problems and the four lunar phases.’ The study was published in the General Hospital Psychiatry journal and Professor Belleville said she hoped the results would encourage doctors to stop linking the lunar cycle to mental illness. ‘This misperception could colour their judgement during the full moon phase (or) make them less attentive to psychological problems that surface during the remainder of the month,’ she added.","Research by psychologists at Université Laval in Québec City, Canada .

"Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan, the last man on the moon, has revealed he left a camera on the lunar surface, hoping it would be recovered by future astronauts to measure radiation levels. The camera, a Hasselblad used to capture many of the iconic images from the mission, was left with its lens pointing into space. Cernan had hoped it could be used as the mission's final experiment, with future astronauts measuring the radiation collected on the lens. Astronaut Eugene Cernan on the moon on December 19, 1972. Today he revealed he left a camera on the lunar surface, hoping future astronauts would recover it. Speaking on the 40th anniversary of the mission, Cernan expressed regret his footprints are still the last left on the moon. Now 78, he told Bloomberg he . thought his voyage 'wasn't the end but the beginning' for manned . exploration of the Moon - and that he thought an astronaut would have . set foot on Mars by the end of the century. The Apollo programme cost American taxpayers more than $150 billion (£93 billion) in today's money. However, after Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 crew  reached the moon and ended the space race, support among the American public waned and turned towards the Vietnam war. This led to scathing budget cuts for Nasa, with dozens of projects cancelled and three Apollo missions cancelled. Three further missions planned to follow Cernan's crew were scrapped due to budget cuts. Now, he admits leaving his camera may have been a mistake. 'I left my Hasselblad camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith, the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass. 'So, going up the ladder, I never took a photo of my last footstep. How dumb!

I’m not willing to spend nine months getting there, then wait 18 more . months until the planets align to come home. 'For Mars we need propulsion . technologies to get us there in say, 60 days, then spend whatever length . of time we want to spend – two months, six months – and return when we . want to come home.

"Families face punishing food price rises triggered by a catastrophic U.S. drought, experts warned yesterday. They said the American crisis is forcing up the global price of crops used to make staples such as bread and pasta. Meat is also tipped to cost much more because animal feed costs have soared, again because of the drought. Prices in UK supermarkets will rise because of a catastrophic U.S. drought, experts warned . The miserable summer in the UK has made the situation worse because even common vegetables such as potatoes and peas are having to be imported from as far away as South Africa, Guatemala and Israel. British farmers say heavy rain and lack of sunshine has decimated or delayed harvests. In the U.S., more than 35 states have declared disaster areas due to drought. Arable land covering an area larger than Belgium and Luxembourg combined has been abandoned. A spokesman for the British Retail Consortium said: 'The drought is not yet having an impact but it will work through to meat prices because of the price of animal feed and ultimately to things such as bread and pasta.' One Tory MP warned last night that high food prices were already having a severe impact on millions of families, with some parents forced to skip meals to feed their children. Incomes are under huge pressure from inflation that has been above the official target for many months. Fuel bills are predicted to rise this winter with some suppliers already putting up their charges. Families will be hit as the price of bread, pasta and meat rockets because of drought in the U.S. The food price threat is a blow to George Osborne's election strategy, which focuses on bringing inflation under control. Tory high command believes it can win the economic battle with Labour in 2015, despite the double dip recession. But party strategists warn it is essential to get real incomes rising again. 'We need to get inflation under control so that people start to feel a bit better off again,' said a source. 'We can make the case that the deficit is unfinished business, but without some sort of feelgood factor we are in trouble.' The BRC says food price rises have slowed to 3.1 per cent over the past year compared with a high of 10 per cent in 2008. Stephen . Robertson, the consortium's director general, has warned 'the relief . may not last' because the poor US harvests are 'creating a build-up of . inflationary pressure'. This view of Salamonie Lake in Indiana shows how the water levels have dropped amidst severe drought sweeping parts of the U.S. Barren: The shore of the lake was once covered with water but all that remains is dried mug and washed up twigs because of the dry conditions . The dried up reservoir in Indiana that has seen water levels fall 12ft and is now beginning to reveal a ghost town sacrificed in 1965 . Soaring food prices are forcing many parents to go hungry in order to feed their children, a Tory MP warned last night. Laura Sandys, MP for South Thanet, warned the era of cheap food could be drawing to a close, with potentially serious consequences for many families. Miss Sandys, whose Kent constituency contains pockets of severe deprivation, said: 'We've got to understand that this is really impacting families, certainly in my constituency, who have got the lowest incomes and these families are actually making choices that are undermining their family's nutritional intake. 'Sometimes parents are skipping meals regularly just to feed their children.' Speaking on BBC Radio Four's World at One programme, Miss Sandys said Britain needed to 'change our attitude and possibly some of our policies in relation to food'. She said supermarkets should be encouraged to stock cheaper 'ugly fruit and vegetables' to make healthy food more affordable. And she suggested ministers should encourage the big retailers to do more to help the poorest customers eat healthily. 'Public health information must also incorporate cost – the cost to the family,' she added. He pencilled in poultry and eggs for further hikes. Around two thirds of American farmland is in mild or extreme drought, according to the BRC. Corn production has been especially badly hit in a country that is responsible for nearly half of the world's exports of the staple. Yesterday the price of soya beans – another key U.S. export – hit an all-time high. Soya beans and corn can be made into oil and animal feed, as well as fuel ethanol, but they are also found in snack products, fast food and soft drinks. The drought has led to calls for the G20 group of leading industrialised economies to hold an emergency meeting to tackle the world food supply problem. Jose Graziano Da Silva, who is the director general of the UN's food and agriculture organisation, said yesterday: 'We need co-ordinated action and I believe that the G20 is responsible enough for this action.' The threatened price rises will hit families struggling to survive the worst recession for decades. According to analysts at Incomes Data Services, private sector workers are getting average pay rises of 2.5 per cent – below the 2.6 per cent level of inflation. Millions have been hit by at least one pay freeze since the downturn began in 2008 and others have been made redundant or lost out on over-time or extra shifts. The Office for National Statistics puts annual food price inflation at 2.4 per cent but with beef costing 10.5 per cent more than a year ago. The third price surge in four years has come after the drought in the US and poor crops from Russia and the Black Sea region. Senior figures from the G20 will discuss the food price rises this week, but any decisions on action are unlikely before a mid-September report on grain supply, officials have said. Mr Da Silva said he would not characterise the situation as a crisis, but it could reach that level next year if harvests in the southern hemisphere disappointed. He said that even if wheat prices rose 10 to 20 per cent that did not mean bread prices would rise by the same amount.","Family staples will cost much more because of animal feed costs rise .

"Adam Lallana is beginning to settle on the pitch at Liverpool but the midfielder has encountered difficulties off it in one of the most bizarre circumstances. The 26-year-old recently had his car vandalised by baboons during a family trip with his two-year-old son Arthur to Knowsley Safari Park on Merseyside. The £25million summer signing was driving his car through the monkey enclosure when the animals pounced upon his vehicle. Adam Lallana was involved in a spot of monkey business when he visited a Merseyside safari park . The Liverpool midfielder's car was vandalised by some of Knowsley Park's baboons . Despite the act of destruction to his car, Lallana could see the funny side. 'I went to Knowsley Safari Park with my little boy recently and ended up coming back with bits of the car missing from going into the monkey bit, so I won't be going back there in a rush.' he told the Daily Star. After an initial slow start to the season with  Liverpool due to injury, the former Southampton captain has become a regular fixture in Brendan Rodgers' first-team picture, having made 11 appearances for the Reds so far. And Lallana, who is in line to feature in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off away to Newcastle, attributes his relatively smooth transition at Anfield to being happy with his new northern surroundings. 'I'm settling in well. I've got my family up here, which always helps,' he added. 'I can't complain and after my injury, I'm just delighted to be back playing.'

"If you’re stuck up a tree, it’s nice to know you can rely on your big brother to help you down – even if it means standing on his head. The lion had climbed into the tree in search of some shade but ended up clinging on after his cheeky brother dragged him down. But the joke soon backfired on the bigger brother, who ended up being used as a sturdy platform by the younger sibling. He ain't heavy, he's my brother: The stranded lion stands on his sibling's head . The two lions, named Echo and Etosha, left onlookers at Antelope Park in Zimbabwe roaring with laughter. Although they are both related, Echo is better known for his pussycat demeanour, while Etosha has a reputation for being a fearless hunter. Photographer David Jenkins, 40, was the only person to snap the big cats in action but thankfully the only thing that took a bruising was the lion's pride. David, from Dublin, Ireland, was one of a lucky handful of people who managed to witness the comical moment and said: 'Echo had no trouble getting into the tree but was not so confident climbing down until his brother arrived. That looks nice and cool... can I have a turn? The brother approaches the shady tree spot . Sting in the tail: The lion's nap is disturbed when Echo is pulled out of the tree by his tail . 'It was really funny to watch as Echo got himself more and more into trouble. 'He was hanging from the branch by his front paws and was clearly searching for some solid ground under his back legs, until eventually he found his brother's head. 'They are both extremely playful with each other but they have very different personalities. 'Echo is very friendly and very lazy while Etosha is a great hunter - he always comes back to look for his sleepy brother. 'Lion cubs love to climb but it becomes more difficult as they get bigger and heavier.' I'm not gong anywhere! Determined Echo clings on for dear life as Etosha looks around... then gets stomped on . Don't worry, I've got you! Eventually Echo loses out to the power of grrrr-avity .","The lion climbed a tree to enjoy some shade at Antelope Park in Zimbabwe .

"A goal in the first minute from Gary Gardner gave Brighton a 1-0 victory over Wigan and their first league success in 12 games to relieve the pressure on manager Sami Hyypia. The Seagulls fast start proved enough to give them their first Championship win since August 23, leaving fellow-strugglers Wigan with just one victory in their last 11 games. Brighton boss Hyypia called up winger Elliott Bennett, on loan from Championship rivals Norwich, and he immediately made his presence felt as Albion dramatically took the lead after just 54 seconds. Brighton midfielder Gary Gardner scored what turned out to be the winning goal in the first minute . Kazenga LuaLua of Brighton & Hove Albion is tackled by Wigan Athletic's James Perch . Brighton: Walton, Calderon, Greer, Dunk, Bennett, Gardner, Forster-Caskey, E Bennett (Halford 89), J. Teixeira (Ince 70), Lua Lua, Baldock (Mackail-Smith 78) Subs not used: Colunga, Ankergren, McCourt, Holla . Wigan: Carson, Tavernier, Kiernan, Figueroa, Perch, Cowie (Riera Magem 75), Forshaw (McCann 84), McClean (McManaman  68), Maloney, Espinoza, Waghorn . Wigan subs not used: Taylor, Nicholls, Kvist, Watson . Referee: Lee Collins . Attendance: 23,044 . Bennett released Sam Baldock down the right and his accurate low cross was driven in from 12 yards by midfielder Gardner for his first goal since joining on loan from Aston Villa. Brighton had gone behind in 10 of their previous 15 league games and this was just the start that Hyypia would have been praying for. Former Newcastle winger Kazenga LuaLua caused plenty of problems early on and his good play set up Joao Teixeira in front of goal, but his powerful shot came back off the crossbar. Wigan threatened for the first time midway through the half when midfielder Roger Espinoza crossed and striker Martyn Waghorn put a glancing header wide of keeper Christian Walton's left-hand post. England Under 20 stopper Walton, 18, was making his home debut, with the Seagulls unable to play Ali Al-Habsi against his parent club. Waghorn was off target again with a shot on the turn which flew over after a cross by Irishman James McClean. Brighton's Elliott Bennett  is fouled by Adam Forshaw of Wigan during the Sky Bet Championship match . Wigan keeper Scott Carson made a straightforward save to take a header from Elliott Bennett before opposite number Walton held a 20-yard free-kick by defender James Tavernier. LuaLua found himself in space on the edge of the area shortly after the interval and his low shot was taken by the alert Carson. Walton came to Brighton's rescue by saving a low shot from Waghorn before parrying a goal-bound drive by Adam Forshaw. Waghorn threatened again by getting in between Albion's two centre-halves but his left-foot shot was well saved by the diving Walton. Wigan made their first change when James McClean gave way to Callum McManaman while Brighton boss Hyypia sent on Rohan Ince in place of Teixeira. Utility player Greg Halford, signed on loan from Nottingham Forest, came on for his Seagulls debut in the closing stages with Bennet forced off after taking a blow to the calf. Wigan improved after the break but Brighton held on quite comfortably to record a much-needed victory.","Brighton picked up their third league win of the season against Wigan .

"A driver who found a gray kitten frozen to the road in Ohio and rescued it says she initially thought it was a dirty chunk of ice. Which is exactly what the 5-month-old cat was encased in when Dara Taylor saw it on her way to work Monday, stopped the car and pried the helpless animal off the road. 'I thought it was a chunk of ice in the middle of the road,' Taylor said. 'When I got closer, it moved. That freaked me out.' Frosty: An Ohio driver spotted a dark chunk of ice that turned out to be a 5-month-old kitten frozen to the road on her way to work Monday . Taylor told the Lorain County Chronicle-Telegram the cat was even unable to open its own eyes, but he tenaciously clung to life . 'As I got out of the car, I could hear him meowing so loudly and pitifully and his little heart was beating so fast,' she said. Taylor took the kitten to the Friendship Animal Protective League, where workers immediately set to warming him up. They also named him Frosty. Rescued: Dara Taylor of Elyria pried the crying kitty off the road and took it to an area animal rescue where workers managed to warm him up and named him Frosty . Frosty also had an infection that left him unable to open his eyes. Rescue workers say they've never seen a cat frozen to the road before, even in frigid northern Ohio . The group's chief financial officer, Shelley MacDonald, said Frosty is being treated for a respiratory infection. Officials are hopeful he will fully recover. McDonald said she's never seen a cat frozen to the road before. She also thinks this one may not even be a stray. Frosty's warm demeanor around people suggest he's been taken care of by humans in the past. The organization says it is already getting adoption requests for the kitte since Taylor--who has a cat, dog and a dander allergy already--is unable to take him in. Looking for a home: Now Frosty is in search of owners. Taylor already had a cat, a dog and a dander allerfy to deal with and was unable to take the little guy in .","Dara Taylor of Elyria, Ohio found the 5-month-old kitten on her way to work Monday .

"Labour will pledge to cap the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals in a bid to tackle Britain’s epidemic of childhood obesity. Andy Burnham, the party’s health spokesman, said it was wrong that youngsters were starting their day with a bowl of Kellogg’s Frosties – a cereal he said contained 38 per cent sugar. He told House magazine that he had been prompted to act after his wife alerted him to the damaging effects of excess sugar on the nation’s health. Labour's shadow health secretary said children should not be eating bowls of cereal that were 38 per cent sugar . The announcement comes a week before the Department of Health publishes new research on the health effects of sugar and the options ministers are considering to deal with it. Some campaigners are calling for a sugar tax to reduce consumption, but the government is sceptical about the idea. Almost a third of two-to-15-year-olds are overweight, and over the past three years, at least 932 children under the age of 15 have needed urgent medical attention as a consequence of their obesity. Mr Burnham will unveil Labour’s full plans for a cap in two weeks’ time as part of a public health ‘white paper’. The shadow health secretary told the magazine that Frosties would still exist after his cap is introduced. ‘I’m not comfortable with the idea that any child in my constituency sits down at breakfast time to a bowl of food that is 38 per cent sugar,’ he said. ‘And if people are comfortable with that, well I’m going to disagree with them. ‘I don’t think any child should be regularly taking in sugar of that level.’ It is understand the policy would affect a range of brands, including Tesco Choco Snaps which have 36.1g of sugar per 100g according to Which? research. Mr Burnham said he would consult on the level of the cap, and denied the policy was ‘anti-business’. Campaigners want limits on the amount of sugar in cereals to help combat childhood obesity . He also appeared to rule out a sugar tax, saying: ‘It’s just not something that would fit well with any Labour person – taxing food. So I’ve always been pretty clear that that isn’t the answer. ‘But there is a problem with rising levels of sugar in people’s diets. Sugar particularly, but also fat and salt.’ The former Health Secretary said it was his wife, Marie-France van Heel, who had got him on to the issue of sugar. He said that when he goes round Asda on a Sunday afternoon, his wife often picks things he has put in the trolley and says ‘look at this’. ‘She’s the one who got me on to it. She’s always been very big on it. You buy some of the products that look as though they’re slightly healthier, they’ve got grain in or whatever, they don’t have “sugar” in their name on the box. But you look at them and go “oh my god it’s loaded!”. ‘In the old days we had it from the bowl on the table, on your Weetabix. It’s built in now isn’t it? So I just don’t think people are able to monitor and control the amount of sugar that they’re taking.’ Mr Burnham said a Labour government would act ‘unapologetically, firmly and decisively’ on children’s diet, smoking and access to cheap alcohol. But for adults, he said the ‘finger-wagging nanny state message does turn people off’. ‘You know “don’t do this, don’t do that”. That’s run its course,’ he said. ‘We’re saying, where is it right for the government to act and where is it right to let people make their own choices? We’re saying it’s absolutely right for the state to intervene, and probably do so even more decisively than we did when we were in government, to protect children. ‘Because children don’t control the situations they’re exposed to, the environment they’re exposed to or the food that’s put down to them. Therefore I do think the state has an absolutely clear moral and intellectual basis for saying “we will act to protect all children”. ‘It’s trying to deal with the nanny state charge that gets thrown all the time whenever you try to do something on health.’ Mr Burnham said he was not consulted about Mr Miliband’s decision to pose for a photo holding the Sun newspaper, and that he ‘was right to apologise’. He also revealed he was ‘looking at’ curbs on e-cigarette advertising, and called for a new national campaign to get 50 per cent of the population doing some physical activity by 2025 – up from 25 per cent at present. And he said the decisions to award the World Cup to both Qatar and Russia were ‘flawed’.","Children should not have  Kellogg’s Frosties for breakfast, say party .

"The season 13 premier of Family Guy had a plotline that millions of fans have been waiting years for--the Griffins finally met Fox's other venerable cartoon family, The Simpsons. The hour-long episode saw the Griffins of Family Guy stranded in Springfield, where their friendly rivalry was placed at center stage and won Family Guys its biggest premier ratings in four years. But did the long-awaited television event satisfy fans? In the words of Chris Griffin: 'Yay...a crossover always brings out the best in each show.

Finally: The Simpsons and the Griffins of Family Guy fame finally met in a crossover episode many have been waiting all of Family Guy's 13-plus years for .

"He has faced accusations of chillaxing ever since he was appointed – not least because of his tendency to fall asleep on the job. But it seems Larry the Downing Street cat is at last taking his duties as Chief Mouser to the Cabinet seriously. After a barren year he leapt into action yesterday, and was found sitting proudly alongside a dead mouse outside No 10. Bring out the bunting: Larry is shown here outside No. 10 and to the far left you can see his victim lying on the small lawn . First kill: A year after arriving at Downing Street Larry is shown on the left just after pouncing on a mouse, which was then tossed on the grass, right,  just outside the Prime Minister's official residence . It was believed to be his first  ‘confirmed kill’, with the prey itself as evidence. Larry, five, was recruited last . February to rid No 10 of its rodent problem, but swiftly earned a . reputation for napping rather than ratting. Until yesterday, when it appears he discovered his killer instinct. Olly Grender, deputy director of . communications at No 10, tweeted: ‘Just arrived at work. Larry the cat . sitting proudly outside No 10 front door with a dead mouse next to him.’ She added: ‘Contrary to popular . belief Larry is not a tart for the cameras and moved.’ While the other . residents of Westminster still have weeks until the end of the summer . recess, perhaps Larry has tired of the easy life. In June, he was photographed soaking up the sunshine in the middle of Downing Street. But he soon found himself hoisted up . by a police protection officer and dumped unceremoniously by No 11, . where David and Samantha Cameron live. Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea . Dogs and Cats Home, was hailed as a ‘good ratter’ and having ‘a high . chase-drive and hunting instinct’ when he first arrived in Downing . Street.

"Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's brother-in-law has broken his silence over allegations the MH370 pilot was in no fit state to fly after his wife left him. Mr Asuad Khan also dismissed rumours that Captain Zaharie had practiced dangerous maneuvers on his home flight simulator, flatly denying claims he'd deleted the machine's data and insisting Zaharie not even used the equipment for a year because it was broken. The 53-year-old pilot has been under intense scrutiny since flight MH370 disappeared March 8, with rumours swirling that his personal life and his political leanings had led to him taking the plane and its unwitting passengers on a suicide mission. Scroll down for video . Zaharie Ahmad Shah, pictured here with his wife Faisa, was not angry with her when he was piloting the MH370, his brother-in-law says . Mr Khan said Zaharie's wife Faisa had not left him, he had not plotted to take the aircraft down and he was not a political activist who had attended a court hearing of an opposition leader who'd been sentenced to prison. Mr Khan came to the defence of his brother-in-law in a documentary aired tonight by the ABC's Four Corners program. Denying the pilot's marriage was in trouble over a rumoured affair, Mr Khan said Faisa had never left Zaharie. 'I don't believe it because she's at home,' he said. 'The normal procedure...whenever the husband flies the wife will go to another house where the younger son is staying. Otherwise, she will be alone in that big house. That's been practiced since they bought the house.' Brother-in-law Asuad Khan said Zaharie Ahmad Shah's (pictured with his family, second from the right) flight stimulator in the family home had been broken for a year . There have been claims that Zaharie received a telephone call shortly before take-off from a woman who had used a false identity to purchase a SIM card. Mr Khan dismissed suggestions that the pilot was having an illicit affair because, as a Muslim, he could marry up to four women. Asked about a girlfriend, Mr Khan said: 'That I do not know about. Even if I know...why not? We are allowed to, as long as you take good care of your wife. Even if you ask my sister (Faisa)...she don't care. 'He can marry another one. Why not - we can marry four. We are Muslim.' Asuad Khan is the first family member to speak out about the pilot and quash rumours Zaharie Ahmad Shah's wife was having an affair . Mr Khan was asked about the flight simulator which Zaharie had set up in his Kuala Lumpur home, and which has been the subject of heavy speculation. Experts in the US are understood to be still trying to recover data which, it has been claimed by airline officials, had been deleted. However, Mr Khan insisted that the simulator had not even been used this year. 'I don't think so because the simulator is not working,' he said. 'That simulator was dismantled already. The things crash. It don't work so he got to reformat the drive.' Mr Khan also denied reports that Zaharie had attended the trial of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim in the hours before he took MH370 to the air - and had been angered by a five-year jail sentence handed down to the politician for sodomy. It is understood US experts are trying to recover data which, it has been claimed by airline officials, had been deleted from Zahaire's home flight stimulator . 'No, I asked my sister personally, even my sister herself informed him on what happened that day.' In further revelations, the program claimed that military officers on duty at an air base on the Malaysian island of Penang had failed to act when their radar picked up an unidentified aircraft - believed to be MH370 - flying virtually over their heads. Malaysia's Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who has become the 'face of the MH370 mystery', was being questioned why Malaysia's military did not send jets up to investigate an unidentified aircraft that had appeared on their radar. He admitted that the country's Civil Aviation Authority had telephoned the military as early as 2am - about half an hour after contact with the Boeing 777 was lost. Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed MH370 appeared on military radar, but was deemed 'not hostile' and ignored . It was tracked by the military in 'real time', he confirmed, but it had been dismissed as being not hostile. Instead, the program said, the plane had been allowed to 'disappear' - continuing flying  towards the Indian Ocean. Asked why Malaysian air force jets were not sent up to check out the aircraft, Mr Hishammuddin said: 'It was commercial, it was in our air space, we were not at war with anybody.' Pressed on why the jets were not sent up, he said: 'If we are going to send it (jets) up, are you going to say we were going to shoot it down? 'If we weren't going to shoot it down, what is the point of sending it (a jet) up?' It was suggested to him that the purpose of that would be to see where the aircraft was going. 'If I did shoot it down,' he said, 'you would be the first to say ""How could you shoot down a commercial airline with 14 nationals, half of them Chinese?"" I would be in a worse position, possibly.' 'Why shoot it down if it's not hostile?' the Minister was asked. 'Well, the Americans would,' he replied. A number of aircraft experts also confirmed what has been generally believed - that someone on board the aircraft had deliberately switched off its two main communication systems. Some aircraft experts have confirmed that someone on board the flight deliberately switched off two main communication systems . But one expert suggested that the systems could have broken down if a fire had broken out in the electronics bay which is underneath the cockpit. The aircraft, it was also claimed, had disappeared in a critical few seconds - a 'grey area' - between leaving Malaysian air space and entering Vietnamese air space. After someone on the flight deck signed off to Malaysia, no contact was made with the Vietnamese. Nik Huzlan, a former chief pilot with Malaysian Airlines said: 'It should have been ""Good night Malaysia, good morning Vietnam"" - as quick as that. It didn't happen.' Malaysian air traffic controllers were also criticised for logging that Boeing 777 was flying over Cambodian air space even after it had turned back to the Malaysian peninsula. The log showed that this error was corrected to point out that the reference to Cambodia was the 'projected' direction of the plane.","Asuad Khan is the first family member to speak out and defend the pilot .

"Mobile phones have become an unexpected threat to a rare breed of bird. A number of mobile apps mimicking the song of the elusive nightjar are diverting the birds from the  nesting. Now, Dorset Wildlife Trust is launching an online campaign to raise awareness after several incidents were reported of visitors to Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour using the mobile apps. A number of mobile apps mimicking the song of the elusive nightjar (pictured) are diverting the birds from the  nesting . Visitors to the nature reserve have used apps imitating the unusual 'churring' call of the nightjar to attract the elusive birds so they can be photographed more easily. The app mimics the distinctive call of the male nightjar, and is usually the only way to know if the birds are about. Nightjars are usually 28cm long . Average wingspan: 60cm . Average weight: 83g . Can live up to 11 years . Protected in the UK . Migrate annually  to UK from Africa in April-May . Found in England, Wales and Southern Scotland in summer . A large number of apps imitating the calls of over ,2000 both rare and common birds are available from iTunes and other mobile sites. Apps like Bird Songs from Google Android Apps include live field recordings, while iTunes has geographically-oriented  apps that teach users the bird songs of over 2,000 local birds. Most of these apps are billed as educational, with little thought having been given to the negative effects they might have on mating and migratory birds. The trust is advising photographers not to use bird apps on any of its 42 reserves and signs have been put up on Brownsea Island to remind visitors. The nightjar is rare but enjoys a refuge on Brownsea Island where, like all nesting birds, it is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it an offence to intentionally disturb any nesting bird. In addition, Brownsea Island has special protection area status for the habitats it provides for birds. The nightjar arrives in the UK in April and May from their wintering grounds in Africa. It is a nocturnal bird that is usually only spotted at dusk in May or June, when male nightjars put on a demonstrative show of wind-clapping, flying in circles and calling repeatedly in hopes of attracting a mate. Brownsea Island Castle as seen from Poole Harbour, Dorset . Chris Thain, reserve manager on . Brownsea Island, said: 'The apps are becoming quite common, and are . great, but their use needs some guidance, I feel. 'I’m . sure visitors would be devastated if they realised the possible . disturbance they were causing to wildlife. We need to spread the word . that use of these apps is not suitable for nature reserves and can be . potentially harmful to sensitive species.' Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB, said: 'Repeatedly playing a recording of birdsong or calls to encourage a bird to respond in order to see it or photograph it can divert a territorial bird from other important duties, such as feeding its young. 'It is selfish and shows no respect to the bird. 'People should never use playback to attract a species during its breeding season.'","A number of mobile apps mimicking the song of the elusive nightjar are diverting the birds from nesting .

"The cure for all society’s problems is for people to have frequent orgasms. At least that was the claim of Austrian psychoanalyst, Wilhelm Reich, in 1940 when he created a sex box dubbed the ‘Orgone’. Now a replica of the contraption, along with various other sexual devices, is being put on display in London at the Wellcome Collection's ‘Institute of Sexology.’ Scroll down for video . In 1940, Wilhelm Reich, created a box dubbed the ‘Orgone’. Alternating layers of organic and non-organic materials inside the walls supposedly increase the energy leading to orgasms. Now a replica of the contraption, along with various other sexual devices, are being put on display in London at the Wellcome Collection's ‘Institute of Sexology.’ Pictured is an example of the Orgone . The Orgone was essentially a metal-lined box that claimed to harness a mysterious atmospheric force that would bring people to new heights of sexual pleasure. Alternating layers of organic and non-organic materials inside the walls supposedly increased the energy inside the box causing intense orgasms. Reich’s patients would sit inside the device to treat illnesses, leading to newspapers stories about sex boxes that cured cancer. The curators of the exhibition now hope that visitors will try the box out for themselves, in an attempt to generate debate about sexual behaviour and identity. Opening this month, the exhibition explores the study of sex and the work of ‘sexperts’ such as Sigmund Freud, Marie Stopes, Alfred Kinsey and Masters and Johnson. Displayed alongside the Orgone are strange sex aids and leaflets giving advice – including on that explains how bicycle repair kit can be used to repair a contraceptive cap. Opening this month, the exhibition explores the study of sex and the work of ‘sexperts’ such as Sigmund Freud, Marie Stopes, Alfred Kinsey and Masters and Johnson, as well as works of art (pictured) that explore sexual behaviour at the beginning of the 20th century . Pictured is  Ye Olde Sex Chart created by Carolee Schneemann, in 1975, listing her sexual activities. The artist is best known for the provocative use of her nude body to explore personal expression . On the left is a a collection of sexual aids, date of which unknown, with instructions, in a wooden box. Pictured on the right is a vintage poster for the Institute for Sex Research requesting volunteers for studies into sexuality . It also explores the history of research into sexuality with, overall, more than 200 artworks, objects, photographs and archived material. The material takes visitors on a journey, revealing the amusing and conservative views of sexologists from different decades. One of these doctors, Jean-Martin Charcot, who turned the study of sexuality into a sordid-type of entertainment. An engraving by André Brouillet reveals Charcot giving a lecture on hysteria in the hospital of La Salpetrière, Paris, in 1887 with his subject being an undressed woman. The exhibition also follows key sexologists including Sigmund Freud, Marie Stopes, Alfred Kinsey, Wilhelm Reich, Magnus Hirschfeld and Margaret Mead. The sexologists in the show are all, at heart, collectors, whether of books, testimonies, erotica, photographs or statistics. The first section, ‘The Library’, highlights the systematic archiving and accumulation central to the craft, including objects from Henry Wellcome’s vast collection of erotica. The device promised to deliver what he called 'orgastic potency', despite being little more than a plain wooden cupboard lined with metal . James Bond tried one. So, too, did writers Jack (On The Road) Kerouac and J.D. (Catcher In The Rye) Salinger. The artist who created Shrek swore by his, and spent half an hour inside it at least once a day. They were all devotees of the original love machine, invented in the Fifties by psycho-analyst and therapist Dr Wilhelm Reich as a pathway to a better, if not the best ever, sexual experience. Alternating layers of organic and non-organic materials inside the walls supposedly increase the orgone concentration inside the enclosure. The device promised to deliver what he called 'orgastic potency', despite being little more than a plain wooden cupboard lined with metal. No wheels, no whistles, no ticklers or teasers, no bells. It was just a box. Yet, according to author Christopher Turner in a new biography of Reich, Sean Connery had one at the height of his James Bond fame. But whether sitting in the box delivered what its designer promised is another matter. If Connery was shaken or stirred, he never said. William Steig, author of the original Shrek comic book, revealed his gave him 'an inner vibration, a little bit like an orgasmic feeling' — which is a long way from blowing your socks off. American author Norman Mailer, who desperately searched for what he called the 'apocalyptic' sexual experience, admitted just before he died that he never achieved it with his version. Pictured is a Japanese ivory statue of a man and woman having sex created in the 19th century. The material takes visitors on a journey, revealing the amusing and surprisingly unconservative views of sexologists from different decades . On the right is a cylindrical lekythos from Greece, with black figures engaging in sexual acts decorating the outside created 550BCE-500BCE. On the left are Jugum penises, anti-masturbation devices that had jagged metal rings fitted to the base of the penis used in 1880-1920 . Opening with the Nazi burning of archives amassed by Magnus Hirschfeld’s Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin, it explores how Hirschfeld’s material on homosexuality was assembled against prevailing social codes. This is the first exhibition in a £17.5 million ($27.7 million) expansion of Wellcome Collection in London and occupies a new gallery dedicated to year-long shows. ‘The Institute of Sexology’ will evolve during its run bringing in new commissions, live events, discussions and performances as part of a ‘Sexology Season; of activity across the UK. The sexologists in the show are all, at heart, collectors, whether of books, testimonies, erotica, photographs or statistics. Another room, called ‘The Lab’ points to the bespoke laboratory William Masters and Virginia Johnson secretly established at Washington University to observe and record hundreds of individuals having sex. Sculptures showing people having sex are among the items on display at the Wellcome Collection's exhibition.

On the left is a erotic hinged fruit created before 1936. The terracota lamp is thought to be first century CE . Their measurements of real-time physiology – heart rate, lubrication, blood pressure, brain activity, organ size – during stimulation and orgasm established the complexity orgasms, especially by women. The room explores how their findings and campaigns for gendered equality in climactic response fed into the zeitgeist of the 1960s sexual revolution. ‘The Institute of Sexology offers a complex, often contradictory story of the study of sex, and highlights the profound effect that the gathering and analysis of information can have in changing attitudes about the human condition,’ said curator Kate Forde. ‘It presents typed diagnoses alongside handmade campaign material, scientific charts next to handwritten testimonies. ‘But all are caught up in attempts to free us from the tyranny of preconceived ideas about sex, and suggest that our understanding about our sexual identities is a story of constant evolution.” ‘The Institute of Sexology’ runs from 20 November to 13 September 2015 at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road in London. Pictured are two phallic sculptures which will be shown as part of the exhibition which opens on 20th of November. On the left late period (664–332 BCE) sculpture of the Egyptian god Horus. On the right is a solid bronze phallic amulet in form of pripus with hindquarters of horse created around 100BC .

"With Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel preparing to say their 'I dos' this weekend, the pair are undoubtedly busy with last-minute preparations. The couple kept a low profile on Friday, as they prepare to exchanges vows against a rustic Italian backdrop, believed to be taking place in a sunset ceremony on Saturday evening. On the eve of the wedding, some of their guests were spotted relaxing at the local beach in Southern Italy and taking in the sights on a bicycle ride.

Horses graze next to a ramshackle stable, along with hay bales and a rickety teepee style structure with fire underneath. There are several loungers and beds laid out among the grounds, with a basket of apples dangling over one double bed. There . has even been a sighting of a group of Italian entertainers dressed in . traditional costume while guests enjoyed a country-style picnic of . tomatoes and potatoes, along with obligatory peasant clay pots on .

Location location location: Interior photographs of the château which is said to be where the nuptials are taking place . Picturesque: Justin and Jessica are said to have chosen the southern Italy location as it 'means a lot to both of them' In the country: The grounds of the venue featured beds and cushions dotted around . The happy couple: Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake were all smiles at the Costume Institute Gala in New York City on May 7 . An insider told the New York Post that Justin, 31, and Jessica, 30, chose the Italian location, near Naples, because it 'means a lot to both of them.' According to the newspaper, Jessica's maid of honour will be her best friend Lindsay Ratowsky, while the A-Team star's stylist Estee Stanley, who is also a partner in his home décor business HomeMint has been helping to plan the wedding. 'A private plane was flown out of New York to take guests to Italy, including both their publicists,' a source told the newspaper. 'But the event has been shrouded in a lot of secrecy, and not even the guests were told the exact location or day of the wedding before they left.' Samberg and music producer Timbaland are both said to have been flown out to Italy by private jet. The . couple are reported to have sent 'vague save the date notifications' back in the spring, and guests are reported by the newspaper as being . 'prohibited from bringing cameras or phones.'

December and the pair are widely reported to be tying the knot in at . some point this weekend. An insider told Us Weekly the couple is taking 'extra precautions' to keep details of their nuptials secret. Spokespersons for Biel and Timberlake have not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Fruitful occasion: A basket of apples hangs down over a bed in the grounds of the Italian castillo . Old fashioned fun: Men dressed in country costume carry baskets of must through the rustic grounds . Authentically olde: Hay lies around the ground, while a ladder is held against a tree . The couple became engaged in December 2011, after he proposed in the mountains of Jackson, Wyoming. The singer-turned-actor is said to have celebrated his bachelor party in September. Photos . of the star surfaced with a group of . male friends - first in Las Vegas, and later in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico - . amid reports the days to Timberlake's wedding date were . winding down. Although they have been tight-lipped . about their plans, the Alpha Dog star recently reminisced . about when he asked his fiancée on their first date. That was back in 2007 - after Timberlake got her details from a friend. Glass of bubbly: Samberg dressed in casual clothes as he drank from a champagne flute . Picturesque setting: The guests appeared to be socialising in front of some giant white lanterns and next to a white outhouse . The night of a thousand stars: The guests drunk and chatted as the night went on, standing next to giant lanterns . Picturesque: Guests enjoyed a dramatic setting next to lit up lanterns outside the chateau . He told UK's Hello! magazine: 'I did . it the old fashion way - by telephone. That’s something I learned from . both my stepdad and my grandfather - that there is a thing called . chivalry and it doesn’t have to die with the birth of the internet. 'The way I see it, if you’re asking a girl out on a date, it’s only right to do it in a way that she can hear your voice.' But because he was a big name popstar at the time, not to mention a former Mouseketeer, it was not an easy sell. Getting ready: Some guests stroll through the grounds of the château where the nuptials are said to be taking place . Pre-party: The wedding guests dressed casually for the drinks, as they mingled in the rustic surroundings . The SexyBack singer admitted: 'I had to be pretty persistent in order to get her to say yes. 'But I have a fair amount of tenacity and if I want something I stick to it. And in the end she agreed.' He also said that their most important quality as a couple is their willingness to work hard on their relationship. He said: 'Some days are better than . other days for all of us - and if we have our good days and bad days . individually, and then we’re dealing with someone else’s good and bad . days on top of that, it’s going to add up. 'But what I have learned from my stepdad is something as important, which is patience and compassion. 'Because when you are living with someone else, those two qualities go a long way.' Jessica has meanwhile insisted she has not turned into a fearsome 'bridezilla' in the run-up to the big day. She told E! News earlier this month: 'I'm just pretty much cool as a cucumber in general in my life. So no, I'm cool.' The new issue of Life & Style Weekly is on newsstands now. Wedding celebration?

"Heartbreaking: This is one of the last photos showing Justine Davis together with her 3-year-old son, Cameron, at a Cuban turtle preserve just hours before he was struck and killed by a truck . A Canadian mother who has been detained in Cuba since Christmas in connection to a scooter crash that killed her 3-year-old son learned today that she will be allowed to return home in time for his funeral. Justine Davis, a General Motors worker from Toronto, went on a last-minute vacation with little Cameron on the small island of Cayo Largo del Sur during the winter holidays. On December 23, three days into their trip, the mother and son rented a Jeep and then a gas-powered scooter to explore the island around the Playa Blanca resort where they were staying. About 5 minutes after leaving the hotel area, Davis' scooter was struck by a large truck on a partially paved road. Miss Davis was airlifted to a hospital in Havana to be treated for serious injuries, including a broken arm and fractured leg, which required five surgeries. It was not until a day later that the woman learned from a Canadian embassy official that her only son, a sweet, curly-haired toddler, was killed the collision. While the Toronto resident has not been charged with any crime, Cuban police ordered her to remain in the country for six weeks as they continued to investigate the crash. Under Cuban law, traffic accidents are treated as crimes, and the victims are considered prime suspects until they are proven innocent. Trapped in limbo: Davis, of Toronto, has been stranded in Cuba for more than six weeks while local police continued to investigate the scooter crash that took her son's life . Tropical paradise: Davis and her son traveled to the island of Cayo Largo del Sur off Cuba, where they stayed at the Playa Blanca resort . Trip gone awry: The mother and son rented a scooter, and five minutes later they were hit by a truck, which killed the 3-year-old on the spot and left Justine with broken bones . Three-year-old Cameron's body was released from custody in mid-January and flown back to Canada in preparation for his funeral. Miss Davis had spent the past month-and-a-half convalescing in a foreign country against her will, and wondering if she would make it back home to attend the toddler's funeral and deliver a eulogy, which she had already written, Toronto Sun reported. Justine Davis' plight has been extensively covered by Canadian news media, while the woman’s friends and family took to social media sites to drum up support for her cause and pressure the Cuban government to let her go. A Facebook page called 'Bring Justine Davis Home for Cameron's Funeral February 8, 2014' has drawn more than 6,500 'likes,' and the mother's supporters also have been spreading the word about her tragic ordeal through the Cameron Davis Foundation. Call to action: Davis' friends have been busy drumming up support for her cause and putting pressure on Cuban and Canadian officials to allow the mother to return home so she could attend Cameron's funeral . In order to give Justine Davis time to heal from her injuries and return home, Cameron’s memorial service was delayed as long as possible, but because of Cuba’s sub-par embalming techniques, the child must be laid to rest no later than Saturday. “This has been a total nightmare … it’s going to crush me,’ Davis told CTVNews.ca Wednesday in a phone interview. ‘I just can’t imagine not being allowed to go. I’m his mother.’ When news came down Thursday that Justine will be allowed to go home after all, her close friend Amber Hussey said the mother was both 'excited' and 'completely overwhelmed.' Hussey revealed to the news station that her friend lost her father to brain cancer just a moth before the fatal scooter crash that killed her son. This morning, officials at the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa and Canada’s Minister of State Lynne Yelich confirmed that Davis would be coming home, according to Toronto Star. Bittersweet news: Miss Davis was notified Thursday that she will be able to make it to her son's funeral Saturday, where she plans to deliver a eulogy that she had already written . ‘Pleased to relay that Ms. Davis is free to leave Cuba. We appreciate Cuba’s efforts to resolve this situation,’ Yelich tweeted. Deborah Ojeda Valedon, deputy chief of mission at the Cuban embassy in Ottawa, said Davis would arrive in Canada on Friday. Cameron’s funeral will take place Saturday morning at St. Chad’s Anglican Church in Toronto.","Justine Davis was vacationing on Cayo Largo del Sur off Cuba with her 3-year-old son in December when they were involved in deadly collision .

"The notorious Ku Klux Klan have opened the doors to their secretive and hate-filled world as they prepare to train their members in military style combat for the first time. Insistent that a racial civil war inside the United States is imminent, one family belonging to the Loyal White Knights (LWK) allowed cameras to follow them to a secret Klan meeting in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Mum, Amanda, dad, Sam and their two boys, Mike, 14 and Dustin, 11, attended the rally in late April, where members openly spat the 'n-word' and screams of white power could be heard echoing from huts across the remote field. Scroll down for video . Klan family: Sam and Amanda with their kids at a Ku Klux Klan rally held at Mountwood Park on April 26, 2014 in Parkersburg, West Virginia . The rally was the result of weeks of recruiting and discreet publicizing that saw 40 people come together and is proof that the racist group is fully active today. Dad Sam was one of six main speakers at the rally where he announced they are arming for a race war they believe will soon grip America. He refused to give his family name over fears his family would be victimized, but warned of his group's controversial plans in his speech. He said training would begin when existing and new KKK members leaving the military returned from overseas campaigns in 'the next couple of weeks'. 'This is something that no Klan has ever done before,' he said. 'We've organized training in survival, firearms and unarmed combat to prepare for the war that is coming. 'All our boys are finally coming back home from the military and we're getting a lot more military members joining.'

Cross burning: Ku Klux Klan members stand around giving a salute as it emerges a group of Klan members is planning its first military style combat training camps . Heil: Members of the Loyal White Knights (LWK) faction, which has Klan members made up of men, women and children across at least three states pose up for a picture at the rally in West Virginia . To the delight of the rallygoers, he added: 'We're going to to arm and train in hand-to-hand combat for the upcoming battle. 'The women might not like it but we're going to use live animals and show people how to skin deers, rabbits, and squirrels. 'In the end we're gonna need this to survive.' Klan members at the rally believe America is a 'house of cards' on the brink of collapse. 'We already know what's coming, Sam added. 'China and Germany don't want mess with us no more. 'Hell our dollar ain't worth but 65 cents right now. And that's according to the last news report. 'So we're gonna have to start training the men, the women, and the kids and get ready.' Racial symbols: Crosses are burned by the Klan members in these pictures as members pose provocatively without their ceremonial head pieces on .

Family affair: Sam and Amanda with their kids at the Ku Klux Klan rally held at Mountwood Park . Once America's government crumbles, the KKK predict 'all out war' between people of different races trying to gain control. In preparation the LWK have been increasing their recruitment drives like many other Klan factions around the States,. And unlike KKK members of the 20th century, members in 2014 use social media to attract new members and spread their views. University student and LWK Grand Dragon for Virginia State James Moore, 23, was another of the six rally speakers. He plays hate rock on his acoustic guitar - while wearing his KKK hood - and runs a Youtube channel where he preaches anger-filled Klan material. Racists: James Moore, Sam and John Himmler pose for a photograph at a Ku Klux Klan rally held at Mountwood Park on April 26, 2014 in Parkersburg . One of his online posts reads: 'White unity from Amerikkka!!! unite against the sharpies and scum! skins and klans unite!!! WHITE PRIDE!!!!' Like James, the LWK leaders maintain a website http://www.kkkknights.com/ where they run special sections for Klanswomen and even a 'Kids Kadet Klub'. Junior members, who are requested to be age 13 to 17, are told to pledge that they will keep their membership 'a secret'. The chat room section of the website warns users: 'Caution - the 'N' word spoken here' The 'Ladies' section of the site warns against the dangers of 'race mixing'. Some kids, like Mike and Dustin, are simply enlisted by their long-serving Klan parents. Both boys attended the Parkersburg rally bur couldn't be photographed without their hoods on. Like her husband Sam, mum Amanda refused to give the family surname over fears her boys would be targeted at school. Racist rocking: James Moore plays the guitar and sings and plays bigoted white power songs while (right) the Klan sells cakes to make money for their cause . She said: 'Being around the Klan all their lives has given the boys good judgement. 'It's helping them face the situation here in America. 'We teach them to keep their Klan activities a secret and in the home. 'They aren't allowed to talk about it outside school unless they are with us at a rally like this. 'The Klan is a Christian organization, so they get to read the bible and they enjoy going to rallies and they get to play with kids their own kind. 'I was going to rallies when I was pregnant with both the boys, and they've been gong to rallies since before they could crawl. 'We didn't teach our kids that they couldn't have African-American friends, but raising them in the Klan meant they chose the right way themselves. 'They don't choose to have black or Mexican friends on their own.' Terrifying: Membership application for the Junior Order of KKK and the Klan proper . To attract newcomers the lower-ranking members of the Klan go on 'night rides' where they litter small towns with the leaflets under cover of darkness. The night riders drive slowly through neighborhoods and throw leaflets in sandwich bags weighed down by grains of rice to stop them blowing away. Some pamphlets they drop vary from neighborhood-watch-style flyers to mock World War I style 'Your Klan Needs You' posters. At the . rally that follows, awards are presented to the foot soldiers who . dropped the most leaflets or who had worked especially hard on . recruitment. One . member, a single dad named David in his 30s, who hides his identity . with a black baseball cap and sunglasses, said: 'The night rides are . good but I prefer to just speak to people. 'I am permanently recruiting because that's what we need - more members. 'And . we're willing to try anything. Even if I am in there supermarket, I . start speaking to people and feel them out. Good chance you'll see them . at our next rally.' The LWK themselves span at least three US states including Virgina, West Virginia and North Carolina. They are one of several Klan factions totalling up to 6,500 members across the US. Professor . of criminal justice Brian Levin, who has been working in and around the . KKK since the 1970s, said: 'Groups like the Ku Klux Klan sometimes . choose to arm themselves because it's a way of saying 'we mean . business'. 'The danger the Klan poses won't come in the form of a national army because their numbers are just too small. Friends: James Moore, Roxanne, Sam and John Himmler salute for the cameras in West Virginia . 'The real danger is more likely to come from small splinter cells, sometimes with new leaders aiming to make a name for themselves. 'The KKK is a shadow of it's former self, which had far greater numbers. 'But now, it's like a cornered rat and they can be even more dangerous.' On April 13, a former KKK faction leader, Glenn Miller, a.k.a Frazier Glenn Miller Jr., was arrested and later charged after a rampage-style shooting at the Overland Park Jewish Community Centre in Kansas. Three people died in the shootings, including 14-year-old Reat Griffin Underwood and his grandfather Dr William Lewis Corporon, 69, and a woman, Terri LaManno, 53. Professor Levin added: 'They are becoming less culturally significant but this can lead to desperate acts in some extremist groups like the KKK. 'Today the KKK is targeting younger people for two reasons. 'They are traditionally made up of members from an older demographic, but young people help keep your organization alive. 'They also give you a cultural boost in terms of modern approaches to recruitment and technology like the internet.'","Secret Ku Klux Klan rally in West Virginia attracts families with their hate-filled rhetoric .

"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid shocked Washington by withdrawing support for President Barack Obama's minimum wage proposal on Tuesday, showing that Democrats are getting cold feet following a devastating report that predicted massive job losses if the wage floor were to rise. But while the Democratic leader has withdraw the measure from the Senate calendar, leading liberals in the House of Representatives are preparing an attempt to force a minimum wage vote over the objections of House Speaker John Boehner and conservative Republicans. Raising the minimum wage was expected to be the centerpiece of the Obama administration's 2014 agenda, and White House surrogates planned just a week ago to spend the last days of February arguing in favor of the initiative. But Reid and Obama hit a roadblock on Feb. 18 when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report predicting a loss of 500,000 jobs by 2016 as a consequence of a $10.10 minimum wage. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid yanked the president's national minimum wage proposal from the Senate calendar this week, admitting defeat -- at least for now . Executive action: President Obama went around Congress on Feb. 12 to sign an order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 for employees of federal contractors, but he's powerless to do more without backing from lawmakers . Combined with a labor participation rate at its lowest point since 1978, Capitol Hill insiders say the news made all momentum vanish. 'Harry Reid simply can't move forward with this idea unless he wants to surrender the Senate in November,' a senior aide to a Senate Republican told MailOnline on Wednesday. 'There's just no way he's going to go down in history as a greater job-killer than he already is.' Democrats already run the risk of losing control of the Senate this year, with some prognosticators saying Republicans will pick up as many as 10 seats, more than the six they need in order to return in 2015 as the majority. That scenario would put all of Congress in GOP hands, turning President Obama into an instant lame duck and killing his chances of passing legacy-building legislation during his final two years in office. Labor unions have lobbied for years to raise the current minimum of $7.25 per hour, arguing that a full-time job at that wage puts most earners below the federal government's poverty line. But academic research shows that most minimum wage earners are not heads of households, and few earn the minimum for very long. Labor unions have organized strikes and demonstrations in U.S. cities, demanding higher wages for service industry workers, farmhands and other low-paid employees . In addition, many organized labor contracts include scores of higher salaries that are indexed to the minimum wage, meaning that they would also rise – winning union leaders plaudits from the rank and file and greater legitimacy at a time when private-sector union membership has dwindled to just 6.7 per cent. Only 32 of the Senate's 55 Democrats have signed on to Sen. Tom Harkin's bill, written to carry the president's minimum wage agenda. Pressing the issue: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi plans a maneuver to force a minimum wage vote on the House floor, but needs at least 18 Republicans to support her . And most Democrats who have backed away from Reid are facing difficult re-election bids, The Hill reported on Wednesday. Those vulnerable senators include Mark Warner of Virginia, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. The sole liberal contrarian is Sen. Mark Begich, a red-state Democrat from Alaska who leads in the polls but expects a tough fight in November. Begich, however, has already distanced himself from President Obama. On Jan. 29 he told CNN that he's 'not really interested' in having the president campaign for him. 'I don't need him campaigning for me,' he said. 'I need him to change some of his policies.' Republicans have jumped on the Feb. 18 report as new ammunition in the national fight over jobs, already tilting in their favor because of another CBO report that predicted that the Affordable Care Act would trim the equivalent of millions of full-time jobs from the U.S. economy. 'You couple that with CBO’s estimate of 2.3 million fewer jobs created under Obamacare and you’ve got a pretty big hit on an economy that is already suffering from way too much joblessness,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday of the minimum wage report. 'The last thing we need to be doing right now in our country is passing legislation that destroys even more jobs.' White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman told reporters during a hastily planned Feb. 18 conference call that employers dissatisfied with a new minimum wage didn't necessarily need to trim jobs. Instead of eliminating positions in the face of a static salary pool, he argued, company owners should take into account 'the overall benefits for productivity, plus the other margins on which firms can adjust – for example, reduced profits.' The wrath of John: Speaker Boehner would not look kindly on Republicans who cross the aisle to support a 'discharge petition' that would overrule him and put Obama's minimum wage legislation up for a vote . The CBO found that as many as 1 million jobs might be lost after a minimum wage hike to $10.10 per hour, but determined that its 'central estimate' was 500,000 jobs . Reid is putting on a brave face, vowing to bring the bill back in November – perhaps in a lame duck session after the fall election – if members of his own party keep balking. But while senators in job-protection mode dither, House Democrats led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are planning an unusual maneuver to force a minimum wage vote. Boehner has said he won't bring the bill to the floor because fewer than half of the Republicans in his caucus want it. But Democrats, betting that enough in the GOP would favor a vote, are preparing a 'discharge petition.' That measure would force a floor vote if at least 218 of the 435 House members supported it. With 199 Democrats already locked in, 18 Republicans would have to join them. While there are likely at least that many who would feel pressure from their constituents to vote in favor of a final bill, any Republican who supports a Democratic discharge position would risk the wrath of Boehner, whose power extends to crucial fundraising help and committee assignments. 'It's a nonstarter,' a House aide told MailOnline,' asking for anonymity. 'If Pelosi wants to force the issue she's going to be sorely disappointed.' 'It will keep the minimum wage in the news for a bit longer, though.'","The majority leader quietly pulled the president's minimum wage bill from the Senate calendar on Tuesday .

"UKIP is on course to crush the Conservatives in the Rochester and Strood by-election, according to a new poll last night. The Survation poll for the Unite trade union gave Ukip candidate Mark Reckless a 15-point lead over his former party. The lead has widened by six points since an identical poll last month, and suggests that a huge Tory effort to hold the seat is failing to gain traction. Former Conservative MP Mark Reckless is on course to win the Rochester and Strood by-election . The poll puts support for Ukip on 48 per cent, with the Conservatives on 33, Labour, who came second in 2010, on 16 per cent, the Greens on two percent and the Lib Dems on just one per cent. Ukip’s vote has risen by eight points since last month, while the Tories and Lib Dems have both fallen by two points and Labour’s support has slumped by nine. The development is a serious setback to David Cameron, who has pledged to ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the attempt to hold the seat, in a bid to halt the Ukip surge. It comes amid warnings that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge if the Conservatives fail to win. Former leadership contender David Davis was yesterday reported to be taking soundings about a possible plot to depose Mr Cameron if the seat is lost. Mr Davis, who could not be contacted for comment yesterday, is said to have told fellow MPs that there is a ‘window’ of opportunity to organise a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron between the 20 November by-election and Christmas, if rebels act quickly. Mr Cameron yesterday tried to steady the ship by summoning his MPs to an away day in Oxfordshire to discuss how to get back on the front foot. MPs were told that George Osborne plans to use next month’s Autumn Statement to ram home the Tories successful record on the NHS. It comes amid warnings the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge if the Conservatives fail to win . And Tory strategist Lynton Crosby told MPs that the party could still win next year because of Ed Miliband’s unpopularity. But one MP who stayed away, warned that the Tory leadership was underestimating the threat posed by the current situation. ‘I didn’t go, because I thought I was better off putting in a day’s campaigning. The message is always the same – Labour are so hopeless that we are going to somehow pull things out of the fire. It’s just like 1996.’ The Prime Minister was rocked earlier last month by the Clacton by-election, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell crushed his former party to become Ukip’s first elected MP. A second defeat by Ukip would be a body blow to Mr Cameron just six months out from the General Election. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is predicting that more MPs will defect to the anti-EU party if Mr Reckless wins, sparking further debilitating by-elections. Mr Reckless enraged the Tory leadership when he defected to Ukip on the eve of the Conservative Party conference. Senior Tories were initially confident they could hold the seat, and Tory MPs were ordered to campaign in the Kent constituency at least five times. At the 2010 election Mr Reckless took Rochester and Strood for the Conservatives with a majority of almost 10,000 over Labour. Ukip did not stand in the seat last time. Tory sources acknowledge they have flooded the constituency with leaflets since Mr Reckless quit. This has included a personal letter from Mr Cameron to every home in the constituency inviting voters to take part in an ‘open primary’ election to select Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst. But Ukip has also piled huge resources into the fight and appears to be picking up votes from across the political spectrum.","UKIP on course to defeat the Conservatives in by-election on November 20 .

"A 1,400-year old mass grave of decapitated prisoners of war has been discovered in the Mayan city of Uxul in Mexico. The 7th-century grave contained dismembered skeletons of 24 victims, thought to have been prisoners of war, in what was once a water reservoir. The finding provides the first physical evidence that the violent murder of opponents, which was so often shown in Maya art, was in fact practiced. Scientists from the University of Bonn discover the remains of dismembered human bodies in an artificial cave in the Classic Maya city Uxul in Mexico. The image shows the artificial cave's interior during the excavations with several skulls, lower jaws and ribs . ‘It is absolutely rare to find such a mass grave in the Maya area,’ Nicolaus Seefeld, who discovered the mass grave, told MailOnline. ‘The only other archaeological evidence of such a dismemberment of victims was in the site of Cancuén, Guatemala.’ Due to being covered by clay, the bones were so well-preserved that it was possible to distinguish the age and sex of 15 of the 24 individuals. They included 13 men and two women who were aged from 18 to 42 at the time of their death. The mass grave was found in what was once a water reservoir. The light grey surfaces around the entrance is an impermeable stucco floor, which was destined to catch runoff and divert it into the interior of the reservoir . Analysis of teeth and bones showed that several of the deceased suffered from malnutrition and had lost several teeth to tooth decay. Some of the dead had tooth inserts of jade. The scientists interpreted this as a sign of high social status. The bones also provided clues about how each victim met their violent death. ‘I observed complete legs, whose bones were still in the correct anatomical articulation from the hip, to the femur, the kneecaps until the smallest toe-bones,’ said Mr Seefeld. ‘Apart from that, I also observed other detached body parts such as severed heads, complete hands, detached feet.’ The image shows the left side of another individual's skull whose upper part has been entirely chopped off. The fine nature of the breaking edge shows that  the destruction of this skull did not occurr after its deposition . Some of the dead had tooth inserts of jade. The scientists interpret this as a sign of high social status . After cleaning the bones, Mr Seefeld found traces of the violent killing, such as blunt force trauma on the foreheads and traces of sharp blades, which had cut away parts of skulls and had severed the heads. ‘This observation excluded the possibility that this mass grave was a so-called secondary burial, in which the bones of the deceased are placed at a new location’, he said. Archaeologists from the University of Boon had been excavating in the historical Maya city of Uxul in Campeche for the past five years to uncover the origins and the collapse of regional states in the Maya lowlands. The image shows the bones of a complete foot, during the excavation. It shows how all the bones are still in the anatomical natural state, which means that the foot was severed from the rest of the body and was then immediately buried on the location where it was documented . Sculpture from the late Mayan period depicts the sacrificial rites of an ancient ball game, at the end of which the captain of the losing team would be ritually decapitated . The researchers do not yet know whether they are prisoners of war from another Mayan city or were sacrificed in Uxul or nobles from Uxul itself. Mr Seefeld is yet to excavate the western half of the water reservoir, and is hopeful more artefacts will be found. The project was headed by Dr Nikolai Grube and Dr Kai Delvendahl from the University of Bonn, as well as Dr Antonio Benavides from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History.","The 7th-century grave contained dismembered skeletons of 24 victims .

"Aaron Smith has been held up at gunpoint by a gang member in Rio de Janeiro, went through a brutal tribal initiation in the Amazonian jungle and spent 24 hours with former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel. From Thursday Island, located in the Torres Stair Islands in far- north Queensland, he travelled through South America from 2006 to 2009, exploring everything the country had to offer from its night life to witch doctors and its hallucinogenic drinks. He has now penned a book about his outrageous adventures called 'Chasing El Dorado, A South American Adventure'. Aaron Smith, seen here canoeing down the Amazon with a cup of san pedro tea, has penned a novel about his wild and unpredictable adventures travelling South America . Raised as a 'strict atheist', Mr Smith - who is now the editor of a weekly Torres Strait newspaper in Queensland - landed in Brazil and then went onto to Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador and Colombia. He said the trip changed his life and turned him into a 'squirmish agnostic'. During his time in Rio, Mr Smith, 44, had a near-death experience where he was held up at gunpoint in a gang-operated neighbourhood on his first night in town. It was also the same night he met his future wife, Viviane, who took him out for an 'authentic' night out in the Brazilian city. During his trip Mr Smith met his wife Viviane, who saved him from execution on the first night they met . The Queensland man, pictured swinging through the trees at the Ayahuasca retreat in Peru, said his trip which spanned from 2006-2009 changed his life . He took a trip down the Ucayali River with Matse Indians, a semi-nomadic Indian group that are spread through the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon . 'She took me to a Samba school to go dancing and we were drinking and the urge to take a p*** came along,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia. 'I walked into the ghetto [trying to find a toilet] - which controlled by gangs - it's even off limits to police let alone a drunk. 'I had a young man point a large machine gun at me. He was 12 or 13, he could barely lift the gun. 'Within minutes, Viviane realised I had gone down the wrong way and came after me. 'She convinced them not to execute me on the spot, which is not uncommon there, and I thought she was a keeper on the spot. 'There’s nothing scarier than a man with gun, other than a boy with a gun.' But strangely, Mr Smith's Rio experience would not be the most surreal of his trip. Las Huaringas Lake in Peru was also paid a visit by Mr Smith during his adventures . In the middle of the Amazonian jungle the now 44-year-old took part in an ancient ritual which involved him being burned with a hot stick on his chest before he had monkey tree frog poison rubbed into the wounds . If you survive the ritual you become a Matses tribe warrior. Mr Smith's guide through the Matse Jungle Auckoo is seen here passed out drunk . The journalist ended up in the middle of the Amazonian jungle where he went through an ancient tribal ritual which involved him being burned with a hot stick on his chest, before he had monkey tree frog poison rubbed into the wounds. Monkey tree frogs produce a defensive substance that is harnessed by Indian tribes in the Amazon to use in blow darts or to improve their senses for hunting due to the poison's hallucinogenic properties. 'It basically shut downs central nervous system. You get tunnel vision, you get chronic vertigo and lose your balance that was within first 30 seconds,' he said. 'You just throw up until you throw up bile. You feel like you're basically dying. 'If survive that, then you become a Matses warrior.' Another highlight of the adventurer's trip was meeting music legend Peter Gabriel in the Peruvian city of Iquitos . Mr Smith (far right) is seen here on the first night he met his future wife (second from right) Viviane . The first night they met Viviane took Mr Smith to a Samba school to go dancing . The Matses tribe is a semi-nomadic Indian group and are spread through the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon. Another highlight of the trip was meeting former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel in the Peruvian city of Iquitos and spent 24 hours with him, his daughter, band and entourage. Mr Smith said the music legend was surprisingly down-to-earth and 'approachable'. 'I got tipped off by a hotel manage that [Peter Gabriel] was coming to Iquitos,' he said. 'It's funny because before I met him, the hotel manager showed me a 10-page contract, which gave me the impression [Gabriel] was a prima donna. Mr Smith (centre) Viviane (left) are seen here with 60 Minutes' Charles Wooley at the Rio Carnival . 'I positioned myself where I knew he would walk passed and he sat next to me and stuck out his hand and said: ""Hi, my name's Peter"", so he was very approachable.' Mr Smith describes his book, 'Chasing El Dorado, A South American Adventure', as an 'an existential road trip, a gonzo travelogue and a continental love story'. The book is published by Transit Lounge and is available online. Mr Smith's book detailing his escapades around South America is available online now .","Queensland's Aaron Smith spent three years travelling in South America .
