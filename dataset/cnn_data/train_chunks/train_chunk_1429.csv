"Arsene Wenger is adamant his squad is ready to challenge for the title and believes they will be crowned Premier League champions within three years. Arsenal are 13 points adrift of pacesetters Chelsea after an indifferent start to the season which has seen them win just five times in the league and crash out of the Capital One Cup at the first hurdle against Southampton. But ahead of his side’s clash against the Saints on Wednesday, Wenger, under fire from a portion of Arsenal supporters, insists his side can turn their fortunes around.

Danny Welbeck, in training at Arsenal's London Colney on Tuesday, scored against West Brom last time out . Asked if he could win his fourth title as Arsenal boss before his contract expires in 2017, Wenger said: ‘Of course. We have not started very well, but we never had the squad together since the start of the season. It was a post-World Cup start typically. ‘I think we have what is requested to do it. We have to fight like mad now to come back as much as possible to show that we can compete in every single game.’ Arsenal have gone 10 years since they last won the Premier League, but claimed their first silverware since 2005 after winning the FA Cup last year. And despite Chelsea emerging as runaway favourites to win the title, Wenger insists the race isn’t over. Arsene Wenger speaks to Calum Chambers ahead of Arsenal's clash against Southampton on Wednesday . VIDEO Wenger pleased with return to defensive . Some Arsenal supporters have vented their frustrations towards Arsene Wenger in recent times . ‘We have fought many times for the title. People always remember who won it, but the fight has been very tight for long periods in the last eight or nine years. We have a big competition in England, we have to accept that. ‘The Premier League level goes always up and this season Chelsea have started very well. They will be difficult to catch, but everybody will fight to come back on them. ‘After 13 or 14 games, you cannot say that the title race is over. You cannot say that is not catchable.’ Arsenal tackle Southampton at the Emirates with injury concerns  over Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs, which could see Mathieu Flamini asked to play in defence. Hector Bellerin, 19, is also on stand-by.","Arsene Wenger is confident his side can be crowned champions again .

"They might be famous for their sun-kissed skin but  where fake tan is concerned, Essex girls are mere amateurs, according to a new report. Geordies take the top spot as Britain's biggest bronzers as it was revealed that Newcastle sells the most tanning products in the UK. The research comes from Debenhams which conducted a study to uncover the nation's make-up habits. Scroll down for video . Newcastle girls like Geordie Shore's Vicky Pattison, left, and Charlotte Crosby are Britain's biggest bronzers . Essex girls may love their year-round colour but sales of fake tan are 13 per cent higher than the national average in Tyneside. Reality star Vicky Pattison from Geordie Shore has even released her own line of faux glow, VIP Tan with shades including Golden Goddess, Bronze Babe and Tropical Tan. In fact, Essex  failed to secure the place of runner-up as Manchester's sales of 8 per cent above average clinched second place for the city, just marginally ahead of Liverpool (7 per cent). However, foundation  is the true beauty staple for northern women, accounting for a third of all cosmetics spend in Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool. Essex girls are the biggest fans of false eyelashes with TOWIE stars like Sam Faiers helping to  boost sales . Eye make-up is the biggest seller in Leeds and Sheffield, with  eyeliner  top of the sales charts there, at 6 per cent above the average. Yet mascara, eye lash curlers and eye shadow are more popular in Birmingham than anywhere else (8 per cent above average sales). The Only Way Is Essex stars such as Amy Childs, Lauren Pope and Sam Faiers have been credited with boosting sales of false eyelashes in their county. More fake lashes are sold in Essex than anywhere else in the UK, with sales 11 per cent higher than the average. Meanwhile, TOWIE hunks including Mark Wright and Joey Essex are thought to be behind the increased demand for male grooming products. Former TOWIE star Mark Wright, recently voted off Strictly Come Dancing, has helped boost male grooming . Sales of hair care, moisturiser and facial scrubs for men are 14 per cent higher here than the average across the country. Yet in London, staying young takes priority. Sales of anti-ageing products, like wrinkle-busting serums, are 9 per cent above average. Perfume is also most popular in the Capital, accounting for a 4 per cent higher spend here than in other areas. In Scotland, shoppers splash out the most on dry skin products such as hand cream and lip balm (3 per cent above average). Wales's cities Cardiff and Newport show strong demand for lipstick (6 per cent above average), just ahead of the Midlands cities of Nottingham, Leicester and Derby (sales 5 per cent above average). In Bristol, sales of nail varnish are up 13 per cent on other areas but apart from blusher, make-up sales are below average. Debenhams' health and beauty director, Sara Stern, says that beauty sales will soar even further in the run-up to Christmas. She said: 'We generally always see a peak in make-up, fragrance and skincare sales before Christmas and it's fascinating to see how buying habits differ across the country. 'At this time of year there is more emphasis on metallics and glitter for the eyes and cheek bones and pearlescent lipsticks and glosses as women definitely like to add some sparkle to their festive party look.' Sara added that the results of the study had come as quite a surprise and adds that reality TV shows such as The Only Way Is Essex had definitely aided the change in beauty habits. 'There are also some clear regional trends, as well as a few surprises, such as Newcastle topping Liverpool and Essex for all things bronzed. 'The size of sales of male grooming products in Essex immediately brought to mind Joey Essex and Mark Wright who are famous for their immaculate hair, using moisturiser and having facials. 'But in recent years many men across the country have become far more knowledgeable about the benefits of skin and hair products and are open about buying and using them.'","Sales of  tanning products are highest in Newcastle and Manchester .

"Anyone taking a stroll down this central London street might be forced to do a double take when they see this unusual property. With its front doors high up in the air and its roof running along the pavement, this building has seemingly been flipped upside down. Artist Alex Chinneck built the new facade on to the existing building to create the new piece of art for the annual Merge Festival in London. Artist Alex Chinneck turns the world on its head by creating this upside-down house in London . The 29-year-old, who lives in Hackney, east London, started work on the piece in October, the day after his 'sliding house' in Margate had been completed. He has worked with a range of construction companies since October to create the artwork, called Miner On The Moon, on a building in Blackfriars Road, London, which is due to be demolished. Mr Chinneck said: 'I'm keen on this idea that when people go to an art gallery they go there through choice and they enter into that experience. 'But with public sculpture, people don't necessarily make that choice - they may not like the artwork or may not want the artwork and therefore I think it's important for the work to be able to disappear and not dominate its environment, but be harmonious with the environment. 'For that reason I used only the materials which feature across Southwark and Blackfriars so although the artwork is quite bold it also has subtlety and the ability to camouflage into its environment.' Built in 1780, the building was originally used as livery stables, housing horses and carriages for hire. Mr Chinneck created the artwork as part of the annual Merge Festival, in London . Mr Chinneck (right) has worked with a range of construction companies since October to build the piece . The access through the building was also used to transport live cattle and goods from the courtyard to trade along the Thames. Mr Chinneck said the conecpt for the artwork had been inspired by the shape of the building and the links to its heritage. He said: 'The original building had been conceived with a function in mind. 'There was a yard at the back of the building and that was used to store cattle and the alleyway that is now used for vehicular access was used to move cattle and they would lead the cattle to the Thames and to the market. 'Because the shape of the building was so closely intertwined with its heritage, I created a concept, an artwork, that actually responded to the shape of the building. Mr Chinneck started work on his latest piece after completing this 'sliding house' in Margate . 'So I have created seemingly two buildings which are seemingly upside down.' The building itself was used as a residential unit for families and workers. In 1880 the ground floor shop unit changed use and was listed in the local Post Office as a Pawn Broker, while the passageway to the side was used to gain access to the Tress and Co site. From the 1800’s onwards the history of the building is unknown. Donald Hyslop, chairman of Better Bankside and Head of Partnerships at Tate Galleries, said: 'In the space of little over a decade, Bankside has been transformed into one of the most unique places in London, the UK and internationally for a cultural, business, residential and visitor experience. 'We are immensely proud that these artists are giving their time to help us celebrate that success through the Merge festival.' Other works by Mr Chinneck includes a factory in Tudor Road, Hackney, with 312 identially smahed windows.","Artist Alex Chinneck created the piece for annual Merge Festival in London .

"Gedis Grudzinskas, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, believes 'menstrual leave' would boost women's motivation and productivity when they are in the workplace . Women who suffer from period pains and feel under the weather each month should get paid leave, a leading doctor has suggested. Gedis Grudzinskas, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, believes 'menstrual leave' would boost women's motivation and productivity when they are in the workplace. He even goes as far as to question if a woman were to accidentally become pregnant, should her employer pay for the termination - although concedes that 'society is unlikely to be ready for that'. Mr Grudzinskas, formerly of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London - and who now practices in Harley Street - is a leading international figure in the field of Reproductive Medicine, Surgery and Obstetrics. Explaining his reasoning, he told MailOnline: 'Some women feel really grotty when menstruating. Coming into work is a struggle and they feel lousy. 'When you feel like that, it's harder to take pride in your work or perform as well. This is about employers being sensible and aware.' Like maternity leave, he proposes the menstrual leave should not interfere with career progression or structure. 'It would be one to three days each month, separate to sick leave entitlement – it is not sickness, after all.' Menstrual leave is already recognised in some countries in Asia, such as Japan and Indonesia. The concept is believed to have started in Japan in the early 20th century. Writing in the journal Health Care for Women International, Alice J. Dan, of the University of Illinois, explains that menstruation leave first emerged as an issue in the 1920s and 1930s when employed women were mostly young, and working conditions for them were difficult. 'The lack of adequate sanitary facilities and materials made management of menstruation especially difficult for factory and transportation workers,' she said. As a result, it was bus conductors and textile workers who were among the first workers to request menstruation leave. Scroll down for video . 'Since the majority of women workers were under 21 and unmarried, menstruation leave had a broader appeal than maternity leave,' she adds. In Japan, legislation passed in 1947 permitted leave for any woman who 'suffered heavily' with menstruation or the work was 'injurious to her body during menstruation'. However it does not specify the number of days or whether the leave is to be paid. There was also a belief that taking leave while menstruating prevented problems during pregnancy and childbirth, such as miscarriage and premature labour. However the number of women taking up menstrual leave over the years declined. Ms Dan said reasons for this include the average age of women workers increasing - with older women having less need for the leave - and ambitious, career-minded women becoming increasingly concerned that taking it could harm their career prospects. Explaining his reasoning, Mr Grudzinskas told MailOnline: 'Some women feel really grotty when menstruating. Coming into work is a struggle and they feel lousy. When you feel like that, it's harder to take pride in your work or perform as well' Taiwan's current menstrual leave legislation guarantees female workers three days of menstrual leave a year, in addition to the 30 days of half-paid sick leave allotted to all workers. Indonesian women are entitled to take two days a month of menstrual leave, though many companies simply ignore the law, and others have even been accused of forcing women to 'prove' their need for time off, some reports have claimed. The concept is also being discussed in Canada. However when the issue was debated last year in the Russian Parliament, it caused uproar and was thrown out. Women's rights activists in the country reacted with anger to proposals by Mikhail Degtyaryov, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, who proposed the draft law to increase the protection of women at the workplace.

The concept is also being discussed in Canada. However when the issue was debated last year in the Russian Parliament, it caused uproar and was thrown out. 'During that period, most women experience psychological and physiological discomfort,' said Mr Degtyaryov, 32, who is married with two sons. 'The pain for the fair sex is often so intense that it is necessary to call an ambulance.' But human rights campaigners dismissed Mr Degtyaryov's idea as sexist. The matter reared its head recently at the Festival of Ideas in Cambridge. Mr Grudzinskas, who was on the panel, said: 'We heard from one man in the audience that women in a particular work-place in Indonesia were all absent on the same days. 'Was this menstrual synchrony - where the women experience their menstrual cycle at the same time? 'No one knows, but the wife of the employer stumbled upon these ladies shopping together in the local mall. 'He devised a plan where women were offered a bonus payment if they worked while menstruating - effectively a menstrual bonus. 'This resulted in full attendance in this workplace - I think it's brilliant - this boss is a smart cookie.' Mr Grudzinskas told MailOnline: 'The issue goes back 100 years when sanitary and hygiene facilities were different, when opportunities for women to look after themselves while menstruating were simply not there. 'Today, the issue is about enlightenment - that is what interests me. 'Menstrual leave will make people feel more happy and comfortable in the workplace, which is a positive thing.' He cites further examples of 'enlightenment' as Google, Facebook and Apple proposing egg freezing for female employees who are worried about their biological clocks. He also praises recent egg freezing initiatives proposed by Apple and Google for female staff . The idea of menstrual leave matter reared its head recently at the Festival of Ideas in Cambridge.

'This resulted in full attendance in this workplace - I think it's brilliant - this boss is a smart cookie.' 'These employers are being sensible and looking after the wishes of modern women in the workplace,' he said. 'And what many people forget is - women make up half the workforce. If they feel supported, they will be a happy and productive workforce. Maternity leave is just part of the deal.' So how would menstrual leave work, exactly? Would a woman have to prove she was menstruating? 'I don't think women should be shy about it,' said Mr Grudzinskas. 'There should be no proof needed - employers should take it on good faith.' He added: 'It's not a case of policing, it's about taking it on face value. Over time, records will show is there is a pattern of cycles, and so on.' And what of the critics who argue some women would abuse the system? 'I see it as an indication of how employers can be sensible to women in the workplace – and keep them there,' he told MailOnline. 'I am not suggesting the UK advocates it - but we could work out how to do it. 'If you want to keep everyone happy in the workplace, don't do Big Brother stuff, like CCTV in the toilets, just be fair and respect people and use your judgement.' And what about men, who will question why women should get up to 36 days of paid leave a year? 'Because,' he said. 'Do you want a cup of tea when you get home in the evening? 'Do you want your wife to be in pain?' 'It's not men who have to get pregnant, go through IVF and childbirth. 'Men will just have to understand.' He also praises recent egg freezing initiatives proposed by Apple and Google for female staff. He said: 'Apple and Google have done nothing more than acknowledge that women can and should manage their reproductive health and well being as they see fit, whether it is the contraceptive pill, having a termination of pregnancy for social reasons or exploiting IVF technology. 'Google should be applauded for its initiative. 'Will we soon hear about employers offering to pay for termination of pregnancy if unwittingly conceived in the workplace? 'Or is this a step too far for the nerds of Silicon Valley?' He added that all the changes in women's fertility and reproduction that came in the second half of the 20th century brought about considerable change and also caused a great deal of comment. 'The launch of the contraceptive Pill in 1961 has been described as the most significant medical advance of the 20th century and it was followed by the Abortion Act of 1967,' he said. 'These changes were all hotly debated at the time of their introduction but they have made an enormous change to women's ability to follow a career.

"A pregnant woman has safely given birth in hospital after a horror crash in New York last night that claimed the life of her 10-year-old daughter. Sara Friedman, 33, and her little girl Blima were crossing the street in Borough Park, Brooklyn, about 9.15pm when they were both struck down by a grey Honda minivan traveling north on 8th Avenue and 60th Street. Witnesses at the scene say the mother was screaming for her daughter after being pinned underneath the vehicle, but remained conscious throughout. The male driver, identified as 22-year-old  Bilal Ghumman, had reportedly taken the car from his job as a valet parking attendant so that he could run an errand. Horror crash: Mother, 33, and her daughter, 10, were struck down by this minivan on 8th Ave in Borough Park, Brooklyn, on Tuesday night . Scene: Belongings were strewn across the road following the crash, which killed the 10-year-old girl . A shoe belonging to one of the victims is seen on the road in Borough Park, Brooklyn, on Tuesday night . Emergency crews were able to free Friedman from underneath the car, according to The Yeshiva World. The mother was rushed to Lutheran Medical Center and her daughter was transported to Maimonides Medical Center. While the mother's condition was said to be serious but stable, her daughter Blima was pronounced dead from severe trauma. Doctors took Friedman, who was nine months pregnant, straight into delivery. She gave birth to a baby girl and both were in a satisfactory condition on Wednesday. Ghumman was taken into custody on an outstanding marijuana warrant. The New York Daily News reported that he passed a breathalyzer at the scene. However, he was reportedly working as a valet  at the time of the crash and was arrested for unauthorized use of a vehicle. He told police he had taken the car to buy cigarettes and a drink. On his Facebook page, Ghumman lists his job as a Rite Aid cashier. Investigation: Police have seized security footage from this store to determine whether to press charges . Closed: 60th Avenue was shut off on Tuesday night as police investigated the scene . Police will now determine whether Ghumman will charged over the crash. They have seized surveillance footage from a nearby 99 cent store. Footage taken at the scene showed a shoe and some other belongings strewn across the road. Witness Angel Santos told CBS New York the scene was upsetting . 'When I rounded the corner I saw the lady on the ground, the kid by her and she was holding her stomach,' he said. 'A guy was pacing — the guy from the car pacing. 'He wasn’t saying anything. He was just like, mad worried; he was just in total shock.' Sadly this is not the first time the family have been hit by tragedy. In 2009, another daughter of Sara and Yakov Friedman was critically injured in a house fire. The three-year-old girl suffered third degree burns following the fire in the home at 47th Street in Borough Park. The tot was able to survive the injuries and recovered.

Monk's men dominated throughout but had to rely on goals from Ki Sung-yueng and Wayne Routledge in the final 12 minutes to finally break Rangers' spirited resistance. 'The message at half-time was to keep on moving the ball quickly and keep our attacking play as sharp as possible,' Monk said. 'I felt if we created chances the way we did in the first half then hopefully we would take one or two and secure the game. 'We were able to do that and deserved at least the two goals and the clean sheet.

"A friend and I recently discovered that we were travelling from New York to London on the same day. 'Which airline?' she asked. 'BA or Virgin?' As it happened, I was flying neither. Instead, I was flying Norwegian, a budget Scandinavian airline that has been muscling in on the competitive London-New York route with significantly lower prices. But her question showed just how heavily the British airlines (along with American Airlines and Delta) dominate the market. As a Brit living in New York, I make the trip frequently, and earn airmiles with both Virgin and British Airways. But I was curious to know whether the heavily-advertised Norwegian flight could compete on comfort as well as cost. Scroll down for videos . Undercutting the competition: Budget airline Norwegian is offering flights from London's Gatwick to New York's JFK from just £150 one-way . With prices from as low as £151 one-way, I was prepared for a less-than-luxurious experience. My booking confirmation indicated that one can pay £35 extra per leg for one piece of checked-in baggage, a pre-ordered meal with drinks and seat reservation. As a Premium passenger however (prices from £560 one-way), such 'luxuries' are included along with a blanket and earbud headphones. I was lucky enough to be seated in that Premium cabin - seat 1J no less - which boasts a spacious 2-3-2 seat formation. And while it cannot be compared with the comfort of BA's business class flat beds, it certainly beats its Premium Economy in terms of space. Modern: All of Norwegian's Transatlantic flights are on new 787 Dreamliner planes which boast large windows with a 'sunglasses mode' in lieu of blinds and cabin lighting designed to ease the effects of jetlag . At 5ft 4in, legroom is rarely an issue for me, but there is no question that there was ample space for the tallest of passengers. And while the seats don't go totally flat, the seat-back went far enough for me to easily nod off, a foot-rest elevating my body into an almost-horizontal position. For those in economy, creature comforts can be ordered at an extra cost  via the Android touchscreen at each seat - and you can pay by swiping your credit card. Should you choose not to pre-order a meal, you can order drinks and snacks via the service too. While fairly pricey, it's a system that makes sense to my mind - especially on a red-eye when all I want to do is sleep. I'd rather have a cheaper ticket without drinks, dinner and headphones (I carry earbuds in my handbag in any case). What's more, I usually travel hand-luggage only. If you plan to booze your way across the Atlantic though, you might find yourself racking up quite a bill. The plane itself is impressive too. All Norwegian's transatlantic flights (routes also include LA and Fort Lauderdale, Florida) are on 787 Dreamliners - they boast huge windows with a 'sunglasses mode' in lieu of blinds, the cabin lighting is designed to ease the effects of jetlag and even the engines are quieter. Spacious: The Premium cabin boasts a spacious 2-3-2 seat formation. While the seats don't go flat, the seat-back went far enough for me to easily nod off, a foot-rest elevating my body into an almost-horizontal position . Stretching out: At 5ft 4in, legroom is rarely an issue for me, but there is no question that there was ample space for the tallest of passengers in the Premium seats . It is these Dreamliners, the company says, that allows it to charge  less for tickets. The new planes use less fuel and this saving is passed onto the customer. While my usual flight experience is an economy one, and I have not experienced Norwegian's economy class, this is not the most direct comparison. That said, new planes and pleasant staff make all the difference when crammed into the middle seat of a middle row. And though flight prices will always dictate my airline choice, I'd be tempted to pay extra for Norwegian's Premium cabin if it was particularly important that I sleep during the flight. It is no wonder that the airline is racking up awards: This year Norwegian was voted the airline offering Best Value for Money by SkyScanner and Best Low-Cost Airline in Europe by SkyTrax. Creature comforts: Blankets and headphones can be ordered at a cost via the Android touchscreen at your seat - and you don't need cabin crew to make a purchase - the screen has a facility to swipe your credit card . Time-killer: The touchscreen also boasts an interactive map that even allows you to check out the pilot's view . Passenger numbers are on the up, too - Norwegian carried over 2 million passengers in September, an increase of 16 per cent compared to the same month the previous year. But Norwegian is not always the cheapest. Both BA and Virgin undercut its prices when I was booking my Christmas flight home last week - you'll save if you plan your trip in advance, but not if it is last minute. Additionally, it does not fly every day - just Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays - which can be quite limiting if your dates are fixed. But with departures from Gatwick doubling next year to six flights per week, the established transatlantic airlines have some serious competition on their hands. Perhaps my friend and I will be finding ourselves travelling side-by-side in a Norwegian cabin in the not-too-distant future.","Norwegian airlines has been operating flights from London's Gatwick to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, since July .

'He told the detective that he had been on the 'Subway Diet' and it had not worked for him and he felt like he wanted his money back,' Hueytown Police Chief Chuck Hagler said. 'The detective felt like he was being serious.' Angry customer: Zachary Rapheal Torrance was arrested in Hueytown, Alabama, on Thursday on suspicion of robbing four Subway restaurants because the 'Jared Diet' of two sandwiches a day failed him, police say . Fight The Fat: The Subway diet, created by longtime Subway pitch man Jared Fogle (pictured), who claims he lost more than 200 pounds on it, is built around two low-fat sandwiches from the restaurant chain per day . The robbery happened about 8.45 pm at the Subway located at 810 Allison-Bonnett Memorial Highway. Hagler said a man dressed in bright orange shoes walked into the store, produced a handgun and robbed the store of an undisclosed amount of money. No one was injured in the robbery. A second store, in nearby Midfield, was robbed on Monday at about 9.11pm. The suspect used a gun in that hold-up as well.

Torrance was arrested in a Walmart store after after a patron there recognized him from surveillance footage that police had posted online.

He has been charged with first-degree robbery and is being held in the Jefferson County Jail with a $250,000 bond, Hagler said, adding that he does not yet have an attorney. Police declined to disclose how much money Torrance is suspected of stealing.

"Friday 13th lived up to its chilling reputation today for two separate groups of hot air balloonists - after their craft blew off course. One stray balloon narrowly avoided tragedy after blowing into power lines in North Yorkshire, while another caused chaos at Gatwick Airport by straying into the path of departing flights. Amazingly nobody was hurt - but they will prompt some people to question if superstitions about the unluckiest day of the year are true after all. A Hot air balloon with 9 passengers and one pilot collided with 66,000 volt power lines in North Yorkshire today . The stricken balloon hangs over power lines after coming down . The balloon crash landed perilously close to a pond . Nine passengers and a pilot were onboard the balloon that crashed into cables carrying 66,000 volts of electricity as it attempted to land near Selby, North Yorkshire at 8.15am. The power automatically shut down . after the collision and the people in the basket, which crashed to the . ground just feet from a large pond, were able to scramble to safety. Part of the blue and yellow balloon was hanging over the power line and . in the water as emergency teams arrived at the crash site. The Air Accident Investigation Branch has launched an investigation have interviewed the pilot, John Russell. Mr Russell, who has 25 years’ experience, said he was trying to land at . an arranged location and was coming down at 3mph, when a 20mph gust of . wind blew the balloon 200 metres across an embankment and into power . lines beside a pond. He said: “I have never had anything like this happen in 25 years - but what day is it today? - Friday the 13th.” A spokeswoman said engineers were . attempting to remove the balloon from the lines before repairs can . begin, but the supply in that section of the cables had been isolated . and there had been no power disruption to homes in the area. Suspended: Five flights were delayed at Gatwick this morning by the drifting balloon (file photo) The balloon was being operated by . Balloon Rides, a subsidiary of Hampshire-based Adventure Balloons which . runs flights in Yorkshire. A spokeswoman for Adventure Balloons said: “On landing, there was an . increase in the surface winds and the balloon caught the wire, but there . were no injuries and minor damage to the balloon.” Just 45 minutes after the balloon . came down in Yorkshire, a second craft was spotted drifting into the flightpath at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport. No planes were able to take off for a . little under half an hour while police and air traffic controllers . searched for the balloon in thick fog. A Gatwick spokesman said: 'The airport is not closed and arrival flights are . still landing, but departing flights were suspended for safety reasons.' The delays prompted stranded passengers to take to Twitter to share Friday 13th conspiracy theories. One flyer with the user name @SkyOlympicOrla wrote: 'Sat on a plane for . the last hour because of fog. Now told a hot air balloon is overhead and . Gatwick's shut. Is this Fri 13th or April Fool?!' But not every delayed passenger was complaining. Travellers on one flight . were kept occupied with guided tours of their jet's controls. Twitter user Eleni Read wrote: 'Hot air balloon over Gatwick so the pilot is giving tours of the cockpit while we wait.' The identity of the Gatwick balloon pilot has yet to be revealed.","Balloon 1 was blown off course as it tried to land and slammed into cable .

Barcelona's first ever jersey in 1899 was half red, half blue. Over time this design evolved into vertical stripes, and the club have alternated between the two ever since. But now the club intend to have a hooped kit for the 2015-16 season, although it is believed the away kit would not bear the new design. Head here to Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"A global fight against ISIS militants will likely take years to fully succeed, but nations are prepared to engage 'for as long as it takes' to defeat the bloody insurgency, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said today. Nearly a year after the Islamic State overran key cities in western Iraq, diplomats from more than 60 counties and international organisations gathered in Brussels to plot a way forward against what has since become one of the world's worst terror threats. 'We recognise the hard work that remains to be done,' Kerry told the gathering at NATO headquarters, which hosted what was, to date, the largest meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the Islamic State. 'Our commitment will be measured most likely in years, but our efforts are already having a significant impact. We will engage in this campaign for as long as it takes to prevail'. His comments come as the Pentagon revealed Iran had join the fight against ISIS, launching airstrikes against militants in eastern Iraq. Scroll down for video . 'Our efforts are already having a significant impact': US Secretary of State John Kerry updates the media on the offensive against the Islamic State at a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the terror group . An F-4 fighter, similar to those used by the Iranian air force, was filmed by Al Jazeera attacking targets in the eastern province of Diyala (pictured). Iran has joined the fight against ISIS in recent days . A Pentagon spokesman said Tehran has targeted the terror group in recent days, but is not co-ordinating attacks with the U.S. and the UK and has not been invited to join the coalition. The mostly Sunni Muslim insurgency now stretches across much of northern Iraq and Syria, attracting thousands of foreign fighters from around the world, including Europe. Its elusive leadership is flush with financial support from illicit donations and black-market oil sales. Kerry also met privately with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who asked for 'a lot of support to be able to crush Daesh' - the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. 'I think we're the only country in the Middle East who is really fighting Daesh on the ground,' al-Abadi said. While at NATO, the Iraqi leader announced his country was submitting a formal request to the alliance to help improve its military capacities, NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said. The request will have to be reviewed by representatives of NATO's 28 member nations, she said. 'Anything that NATO might do in support of Iraq's defense-capacity building would need to be complementary to the considerable efforts already undertaken by the U.S.-led coalition and individual NATO allies,' Lungescu said. Since August 8 - nearly two months after militants seized control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city - the U.S. and allies have launched more than 1,000 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Attack: Yemeni police troopers gather at the damaged residence of the Iranian ambassador in Sanaa, after a car bomb exploded on the street outside, killing three people . Possible retaliation: Iranian ambassador Hassan Sayed Nam was not in the house when the attack took place . Kerry said the attacks have greatly hampered the insurgency and cited training missions and equipment being supplied by other nations that have joined the coalition since it was created less than three months ago. Meanwhile, Rear Admiral John Kirby said the U.S. believes this may be the first time Tehran has launched manned aircraft from inside Iran to strike targets in Iraq. The fight against ISIS has seen Tehran and the Washington set aside their customary hostility to battle a common enemy  which both governments view as a dangerous threat. Earlier this week, an F-4 fighter, similar to those used by the Iranian air force, was filmed attacking targets in the eastern province of Diyala, and its nationality was confirmed by Pentagon yesterday. 'We have indications that they [Iran] did indeed fly air strikes with F-4 Phantoms in the past several days,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said. Iranian forces have been active on the ground in Iraq assisting Shiite militia and Baghdad government units, but this was the first time the United States had confirmed the Iranian air force was conducting strikes against the IS group. Kirby said the United States was not coordinating with Iranian forces and that it was up to the Iraqi government to oversee military flights by different countries. Suicide mission: Witnesses say a suicide attacker drove a car laden with explosives at the residence of the Iranian ambassador in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, but this has not been confirmed . 'We are flying missions over Iraq. We co-ordinate with the Iraqi government as we conduct those. It's up to the Iraqi government to deconflict that air space,' Kirby told reporters. 'Nothing has changed about our policy of not coordinating military activity with the Iranians.' Shortly after Tehran's airstrikes were confirmed, Iran's ambassador to Yemen was targeted in a bomb attack in the capital of Sanaa. A car bomb detonated outside the residence of Ambassador Hassan Sayed Nam in Sanaa this morning, killing at least three people, security officials and witnesses said. The ambassador was not in the house when the attack took place, and it  was not immediately clear whether the attack was in retaliation for Iran's airstrikes against ISIS. It is also not known  if the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber or if the device was remotely detonated. Shiite-ruled Iran has close ties to the Shia-led government in Baghdad, and Tehran quickly came to the government's aid after the Sunni jihadists overran Iraqi army units in western and northern Iraq earlier this year. Iran also has provided weapons to Shi'ite fighters in Iraq and several fighter jets, amid widespread speculation that the planes are flown by Iranian pilots. Joining forces: Iran has launched airstrikes against militants in eastern Iraq alongside coalition forces (pictured is two U.S. Navy F-18E Super Hornets  over Iraq) The commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, Major General Qassem Suleimani, led a counter-attack in Iraq over the summer that pushed back IS militants from a key route leading from Samarra to Baghdad, according to Lebanon's Shiite movement Hezbollah. Even if there is no direct communication between Iranian and U.S. forces, the Americans likely would be aware and easily monitor flights over Iraq by Iran's less sophisticated air fleet, which uses a fighter jet that dates back to the Vietnam War . A US air command center in Qatar coordinates American fighters, bombers, drones and surveillance aircraft flying round-the-clock missions over Iraq along with other coalition warplanes from European governments as well as Australia and Canada. The onslaught of the IS in Iraq has forged an unlikely alignment between Iran and the United States, which have been locked in a cold war for more than three decades. The fight against the IS has come amid a US diplomatic drive to agree a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and officials acknowledge the two sides have discussed the war in Iraq on the margins of the nuclear talks. But the two rivals remain deeply opposed over Syria, with Iran providing crucial military backing for President Bashar al-Assad while Washington has vowed to train a moderate rebel force to eventually confront the Damascus regime. Analysts and former US officials say neither country appears ready to pursue elaborate cooperation for military operations in Iraq, but there appears to be some level of tactical communication at least to avoid accidents. As the two governments expand their military activity in Iraq, there is a growing risk of potential crossed signals or conflict as Washington and Tehran remain bitter enemies.","U.S. Secretary of State says coalition will battle ISIS 'for as long as it takes'

"An Iraqi official denied that a woman detained in Lebanon is a wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, adding that she is the sister of a terror suspect being held in Iraq. Wednesday's denial comes a day after Lebanese authorities said they are holding a woman believed to be al-Baghdadi's wife. They said she was detained for travelling with a fake ID and had herself claimed that she is the reclusive extremist leader's spouse. Scroll down for video . This file image made from video posted on a militant website  purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq . The statement by Iraq's Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim adds to the confusion surrounding the identity of the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID. Lebanese officials said the woman, Saja al-Dulaimi, is believed to be the wife of the reclusive IS leader. She was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida branch, earlier this year. The interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor. It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas. On Wednesday, Ibrahim told The Associated Press that al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi national who traveled to Syria before arriving in Lebanon, is not al-Baghdadi's wife. He identified her as the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, who is being held in Iraq as a terror suspect. He added that al-Baghdadi has two wives but neither is named Saja al-Dulaimi. There was no immediate comment from Lebanese authorities. In Lebanon, a military expert was killed and two others wounded Wednesday when a bomb they were about to dismantle near the border with Syria exploded, the army said. The explosion comes a day after an ambush by suspected Islamic militants in the same area killed six soldiers and wounded one.

It was the first time a Saudi official publicly comments on the incident since a video was released by alleged IS supporters claiming responsibility for the drive-by shooting in Riyadh Nov. 22. The Danish citizen survived the shooting. Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki's comments were published Wednesday in the Saudi Al-Eqtisadia newspaper. The video was released online this week by a group purporting to be IS supporters. It shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing at the driver. It identifies the target as Thomas Hoepner. It was not immediately possible to confirm the authenticity of the video.

This is a guy who has never been stopped in 36 fights – he is seriously durable. He has been in with Vitali Klitschko, Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora – none of them could stop him. He also has a bit of a mouth on him and is a great character, which will be a new challenge for AJ. He will be called all sorts in the build-up and it will be interesting to see how AJ handles the hype. Personally, I expect Anthony to stop him inside the distance and do what other big heavyweights failed to do. It’s amazing that within 10 fights AJ is already the most popular heavyweight in the country. We have already sold 6,000 tickets for his fight at the O2 Arena and the fight is nine weeks away. Johnson has never been stopped in his 36 fights, including this one against Vitali Klitschko (right) England's Dereck Chisora (right) couldn't stop the incredibly durable American either . We are moving towards the inevitable, which is a fight with Fury and the other top domestic fighters. It's going to be great times for British boxing. I watched the main event from the show at the ExCel at the weekend and I have to say Fury-Chisora was one of the dullest heavyweight fights I have seen. With the fight starting well past midnight and many missing their transportation home, boos rang out after only a few rounds as the crowds started to disperse. Fury is a great character and a quality fighter but do you really see him coping with Anthony’s power, speed and work rate? Do you not think Anthony would have blasted Chisora out of there far earlier? People ask if AJ is ready to fight Fury but, to be honest, is Fury ready to fight AJ? I believe this is a fight that will bring both men to new levels in terms of financial rewards. It's a numbers game and these numbers add up. A heavyweight clash between AJ and heavyweight title contender Tyson Fury may happen in 2015 . Fury and Chisora's fight at London's Excel was one of the dullest heavyweight fights I have seen . While Chisora didn't come out for the 11th round, AJ would have got him out of the ring earlier . I’m currently planning the next move for Tony Bellew after he got his revenge over Nathan Cleverly. We all expected fireworks and unfortunately the main event just didn’t live up to it. But Tony did what he had to do and now has a great future in front of him – I’m in talks with both Marco Huck and Yoan Hernandez about cruiserweight world-title fights with Tony. The rest of the division know that he sells. The numbers from the weekend were very good and that makes him commercially attractive to all of them. Cruiserweight world title fights against Marco Huck or Yoan Hernandez could be on the cards for Tony Bellew . The next move for Bellew is being planned after he did what he had to do to beat Nathan Cleverly (left) At the moment, it looks like his next fight will be for a world title in the spring. We are already in discussions with Huck, the WBO champion from Germany, and I can reveal we are also talking to Hernandez, the Cuban who has the IBF belt. We have seen the city of Liverpool get behind Tony and I am in talks about putting on a fight for him at Goodison Park. The question is whether we could get one of the world champions to fight over here. From that point of view, Hernandez seems more willing to travel, so we’ll wait and see how it pans out in the next few weeks. I can reveal here that I am close to securing a world title rematch for Paul Smith against Arthur Abraham. Hopefully it will all be finalised in the next few days. Smith lost a hugely contentious points decision in the first fight in September and now he will likely have his second chance in Berlin on February 21. A Paul Smith-Arthur Abraham rematch is likely to be confirmed for February 21 in the next few days . The fight that shifted the tickets on Saturday was Billy Joe Saunders versus Chris Eubank Jnr. The fight was close and competitive but technically it was poor, with Saunders winning by a couple of rounds. When your dad is telling everyone that you’d beat Gennady Golovkin and that you’re the best since Sugar Ray Leonard, you are already in a no-win situation. Billy Joe Saunders celebrates his points victory over Chris Eubank Junior at the Excel on Saturday . The Saunders (right) and Eubank Jnr bout was close and competitive but technically it was poor . Those claims have put Eubank Jnr in an awkward position as, to be honest, he looked like a talented novice. In the ring it was a bit strange. When he really needed direction from his corner, there was none. I thought he could have been better served because clearly he is a talented fighter. If he started quicker and put more pressure on from the early rounds, I think he would have got the win. Billy Joe will now go on to fight for world honours, but you have to respect Eubank Jnr – he took a huge risk for short money. Forgetting the noise around him, he is a talented fighter and I'm sure he will come again. When your dad is telling everyone you’re the best since Sugar Ray Leonard, you are in a no-win situation . Eubank Jnr throws a big right, which Saunders manages to evade, in his defeat but he will come again . I flew to LA last week to speak to Al Haymon about making a number of huge fights and also about staging fights in the US. The talks were extremely productive and I should have some exciting news on that front soon. The always popular Prizefighter series returns to Sky Sports this Saturday and you can expect fireworks from this exciting line up. Eight lightweights battle it out for the £32,000 first prize - it's a fascinating line up with experienced former domestic champs Gary Buckland and Stephen Foster Jnr the favourites - look out for the lively young Irishman Jono Carroll who is all action! Also on the bill one of our top young fighters Martin J Ward takes on Maxi Hughes in a super-featherweight eliminator. It's a cracking little fight - we have high hopes for Ward and expect him to shine bright.","Kevin Johnson will try to rile Anthony Joshua at Wednesday's conference .

"Nigeria and Senegal are set to be declared Ebola-free after completing a 42-day period with no new cases detected. The World Health Organization (WHO) will declare the end of the outbreak of the Ebola virus  in Senegal today  after active surveillance found the country to be free of the disease. Senegal had one patient who was confirmed to have Ebola but he recovered and appears not to have infected anyone else. Nigeria will also be declared Ebola-free, so long as no new cases are detected before next Monday October 20. A teacher uses a thermometer to test students' temperature to check for symptoms of Ebola at a school in Lagos. Nigeria will be declared Ebola-free if no new cases are detected before next Monday October 20 . One traveler from Liberia triggered an outbreak in which eight people - most of them health workers - died in Nigeria, before it could be contained. But in the three worst affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, 'new cases continue to explode in areas that looked like they were coming under control', WHO said. 'An unusual characteristic of this epidemic is a persistent cyclical pattern of gradual dips in the number of new cases, followed by sudden flare-ups,' the organization added. WHO says that waiting for 42 days from the time when the last person with high risk exposure tests negative for the virus gives sufficient confidence to declare an outbreak over. The 42-day period is twice the generally accepted maximum incubation period of the virus. WHO said that in 95 per cent of cases the incubation period was between one and 21 days. In 98 per cent, it was no longer than 42 days. But the health agency has said that it is possible for the virus to survive even longer, remaining for as much as 90 days in the semen of an infected man. WHO said in the three worst affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, 'new cases continue to explode in areas that looked like they were coming under control' Outside West Africa, the spread of the disease has been confirmed in Spain and the United States. Possible cases have been investigated in several other countries, but none has yet turned out to be Ebola. WHO said it was concerned by media reports that some countries facing a possible first Ebola case had declared the cases to be negative within hours. 'Such rapid determination of infection status is impossible, casting grave doubts on some of the official information that is being communicated to the public and the media,' it said. Countries without recognized laboratories specializing in viral hemorrhagic fever testing should send their first 50 negative specimens to a WHO collaborating center, the agency added. All countries should have their first 25 positive tests double-checked.","Agency will declare the end of the outbreak of Ebola virus in Senegal today .

"It is easy to be dazzled by a Scottish player shining in the brilliant white of Real Madrid. The image could hardly be more romantic for fans dreaming of the national side rising once again. In that respect, those who saw footage of the UEFA Youth League on Tuesday afternoon would be hoping they caught a glimpse of the future. Jack Harper produced a fine headed goal as part of a starring role within Madrid’s 2-0 win over Basle in the baby of Europe’s elite competition. Remember the name of Jack Harper, the 18-year-old Scot starring for Real Madrid's youth team . Harper in action for the Real Madrid Academy during a UEFA Youth League match against Basle on Tuesday . Harper starred for Real's young guns as he scored a goal, rattled the woodwork and forced a numer of saves . It was a performance which showed why the 18-year-old is rated as one of the brightest youth talents at perhaps the world’s most famous club. He was born in Malaga shortly after dad John and mum Tracey — originally from Barrhead — moved out to Spain. The young Harper’s promise was quickly evident, with Madrid making a move to snatch him from under the noses of Sevilla when he was 13. He currently has three years left on a five-year contract with the Champions League holders. Despite growing up in far warmer climes, the teenager remains a passionate about the old country and is already integrated within the SFA’s youth structure. Performance director Mark Wotte has been out to the Spanish capital to visit the Real academy and is in little doubt of the talent Harper possesses. Yet the Dutchman also urges caution about burdening him with excessive expectation. While the sight of a Scot representing Les Merengues is seductive, Wotte believes Harper is only now reaching the critical stage of his development. Harper is a tricky No 10 with the poise and guile to run games in the final third . Harper with a pre-season trophy (left) and in Madrid's away kit (right) Portugal legend Luis Figo poses with Harper at the club's training ground . Harper has similar qualities to Cristiano Ronaldo cutting off the left winger . Iker Casillas is said to have lent Harper a helping hand during his formative years at the Bernabeu . ‘People might look at the fact he is playing for Real Madrid and think it his progress is automatic, but that’s not the case,’ Wotte told Sportsmail. ‘There is still a lot of work for Jack to do before he can step up to the Under-21s or even the A squad. He is not there yet. ‘He is in the most important part of his pathway. Between 18 and 20, so many things can go wrong. ‘Do you have an opportunity to play first-team football? Do you have a manager who is brave enough? How do you deal with stronger defenders? How do you cope with everyone expecting you to be fantastic? ‘Jack is definitely very talented and has the right mind-set, very down to earth. Every ingredient is there but he also has to take some really big steps to become the player everyone hopes he might be. Gordon Strachan could be tempted to throw Harper into the deep end in Euro 2016 qualifying . Real Madrid spotted the Scotland Under 17 international when he was just 13 . ‘This is his last year in youth football with Real Madrid. Probably in the second part of this season, they will decide whether he will go on loan to their B team Castilla or still play for the Under-19s. ‘Jack also has to finish secondary school and take a decision on whether to study or just focus on football. ‘But if you start for Real Madrid Under-19s in an important game, score a goal and have an assist you are not doing too bad, are you?’ Wotte has previously spoken about some similarities between Harper and a teenage Robin van Persie. As well as signifying ability, it is also a note of the hurdles he will have to overcome. ‘I spoke with the people at Real when I was out there and we are not yet sure where Jack’s best position is – is he a No 9 or a No 10?’ said Wotte. ‘I worked with van Persie (at Feyenoord) and he was a similar style of player – left-footed and long-legged. Sometimes you didn’t see him for 20 minutes then he did something magnificent. ‘The discussion was always about where to put Robin. Eventually he ended up being a top No 9 but there were a lot of seasons when he didn’t fit the system. ‘Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying Jack Harper is going to be the next Robin van Persie. Not at all. But there are similarities in terms of the style and the issues at that age. ‘There are lot of very good things about Jack but there is also a lot he needs to improve on and I’m sure he’s working hard on that.’ VIDEO Ancelotti pleased with Real Madrid reaction .","Jack Harper scored a header against Basle for Real Madrid in Youth League .

"At 95, an elderly man from Denmark is still able to lift weights that most people a quarter of his age wouldn't be able to budge from the ground. Even more astonishingly, it was only two-and-a-half years ago that powerlifter Svend Stensgaard was rushed to hospital after having a heart attack. Yet a video filmed of him working out at the gym - in a room full of boys young enough to be his great-grandchildren - proves just how fit and healthy he is in later life. In the footage, the jacked Dane defies stereotypes of pensioners as frail and feeble beings clad in their bedroom slippers. Both standing and lying on his back, he is seen shifting a whopping 290 pounds of weight as he controls his breathing to establish a rhythm. Mr Stensgaard says in the interview that exercising, which releases a lot of stress-fighting endorphins, is comparable to a 'dosage of morphine' for him. Power pa: Svend Stensgaard, 95, showcases his impressive strength while powerlifting at his local gym in Denmark . Superman! The pensioner suffered a heart attack more than two years ago but that has not stopped him from doing what he loves the most . He explains that those closest to him are 'very impressed and also amazed' that he has continued to train despite his recent health troubles. 'I could barely lift more than 1kg in each hand,' he recalls. 'And so to add to their admiration, I lifted 130 kg in a deadlift.' At the end of the video, Mr Stensgaard adds that he was born to do this and has no plans to stop despite growing older. It gives him something pleasurable to do and look forward to. 'For me, I exercise because I can't think of myself sitting at home and doing nothing.' Determined: After suffering health problems, he could barely lift 1kg but now he is back to shifting 290 pounds above his head .

"Many world leaders have said they wouldn't miss Nelson Mandela's funeral for anything, but Czech Prime Minister Jiri Rusnok isn't among them. Rusnok's conversation with Defense Minister Vlastimil Picek in parliament on Friday was broadcast by the Czech public television news channel and quickly went viral. When Picek reminded him that President Milos Zeman might be unable to fly because of a knee injury, Rusnok reacted with a vulgar term and then, addressing his companion by the Czech equivalent of 'dude', said: 'I'm dreading that I will have to go.' Is this thing on: Czech Prime Minister Jiri Rusnok's (centre) conversation was broadcast by the Czech public television news channel . Oops: Jiri Rusnok, Czech Prime Minister, was caught expressing his irritation at the prospect of going to Mandela's funeral. File picture . He complained that he had other plans - a lunch and a dinner- and that a South Africa trip would be too long. The recording became widely popular in local media Saturday and on the Internet. 'I apologise for those words,' Rusnok said in a statement sent to The Associated Press via his spokeswoman Jana Jaburkova on Saturday. 'It wasn't right to use such terms in connection with the death of Nelson Mandela.' Rusnok said it would be difficult for him to find time for unexpected events in his busy December schedule. He added it will be decided in the next few days who will represent the Czech Republic at Mandela's December 15 funeral. Rusnok swore and said: 'I'm dreading that I will have to go.' File picture .

Mandela visited Prague in 1992 to meet with then-President Vaclav Havel who had led the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended 40 years of communism in his country.

"It is the bane of every household – and following a ruling by Brussels bureaucrats it is about to get worse. Home owners will find their armoury in the battle against dust and dirt weakened by a ban on powerful vacuum cleaners. Under European Commission ‘eco’ rules that will come into force next September, the power of new vacuum cleaners must not exceed 1,600 watts. Under threat: The 2,300W Hoover Dust Manager (left), which will be outlawed by new EU regulationsand the Vax U90-MA-R (right), which outsells its rivals on Amazon.co.uk . That figure will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017. Current cleaners boast an average of 1,800 watts. The . move angered manufacturers, who say it will do nothing to make cleaners . more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the . home. Justin Binks, director . of Sebo UK, which produces a range of vacuum cleaners, said the . regulations would limit performance using ‘unrealistic criteria’. ‘If . the proposed regulations come into force as planned next year, they . could hugely frustrate anyone trying to clean their home,’ he said. Critics . say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power, but . householders will have to use them for longer so they are likely to use . the same amount of electricity in the long run. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso says the new rules will save energy equivalent to that produced by four nuclear power stations . European Union flags outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels . Here are five of top selling vacuum cleaners on Amazon.co.uk that will be banned when new regulations come in . 1.

Hoover Smart Pets SM1901 Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner. 1,900W. BANNED BY NEXT SEPTEMBER . Under . the regulations, appliances will be rated from A to G depending on how . much noise they make, the energy efficiency of their suction and the . levels of dust pumped out by their ‘exhaust air’. Similar labels are . already displayed on washing machines. Despite . his company not producing any vacuum over 1,400 watts, Sir James Dyson, . the billionaire entrepreneur who pioneered ‘bagless’ vacuums, is also . angered by the proposal. He . says the eco-labels will be misleading because they will not take into . account the cost and waste of vacuum bags and filters and will give an . advantage to competitors who use ‘bag’ technology. He is seeking a . judicial review of the proposal at the European Court of Justice. The new measures will be extended to other appliances, including water pumps, water heaters and tumble dryers. The Brussels bureaucrats have also angered British farmers with changes to meat labelling. Meat and poultry is currently labelled with information about where the animal was born, reared and slaughtered. But . in a proposal to deal with the trade in animals raised in one country . and fattened for market in another, they will be required to spend only a . few weeks in the UK for the meat to be labelled British.

"Poachers and bush meat hunters are putting some species of giraffe in danger of extinction and the overall population has dropped by 40 per cent in the last 15 years, conservationists have warned. There are now fewer than 80,000 giraffes in Africa, 60,000 less than the 140,000 recorded 15-years ago, according to alarming new research. 'Many of the threats to rhinos and elephants are the same for giraffes,' Dr Noelle Kumpel, from the Zoological Society of London told Mail Online. 'The threats are local. It's loss of habitat and increasingly it's poaching, but not for the international trade, it's bush meat hunting.' The prominence of giraffes in zoos has disguised the fact some giraffes are in danger of extinction.  There are now fewer than 80,000 giraffes in Africa, 60,000 less than the 140,000 recorded 15-years ago . Poachers kill giraffes in the wild because they are easy to hunt and provide a lot of meat . Trapped in a snare, a dead giraffe lies prostrate with its head removed. In certain parts of Africa the heads and bone marrow from the creatures are prized as a cure for Aids . She added: 'There's a difference between poaching for elephants and rhinos for example. But with increasing social problems like poverty or the displacement of people, it is becoming more prevalent.' 'Of course some parts of Africa bush meat is part of the staple diet of some, but really this is a bigger issue of food security.' Poachers also view the giraffe as an easy source of meat, she said, adding that giraffe would be an easy target for the armed gangs hunting for ivory. 'Traditionally they get caught in snares by the poorer local people just looking for food,' she said. 'But those hunting higher profile animals have the firearms and automatic weapons which make it simple to kill the noticeable giraffe.' Their prominence in zoos has disguised the fact that there is very little conservation effort is made with them, she added. While giraffe heads and bones can fetch a high price in Tanzania, where some people believe that their bone marrow can cure Aids, many are killed for their meat which is both sweet and popular. Elephant poachers, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where ivory is traded for ammunition, arms and food, are known to favor the creatures. It is then shipped on to China and Vietnam where despite an international ban, demand for the bone remains high. 'Being delicious is one thing, but there's also a bucket-load of meat, and they're not difficult to hunt,' said Dr Julian Fennessy, the world's only full-time giraffe conservationist. 'People love giraffes but they're taken for granted,' he added. 'People assume that they're everywhere. They see them on branding and postcards and think they are okay. But the decline of their natural habitat has seen their numbers fall dramatically.' However,  some of the sub-species of giraffe are so rare that they could soon be classified as a species in their own right. If this happened, the West African giraffe would instantly become the most endangered large mammal in Africa. The Giraffe Conservation Foundation estimates that only 300 remain on the whole continent. The Rothschild giraffe would also be at risk, according to the Red List, the wildlife conservation inventory compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But despite the dangers a lack of resources prevented a thorough assessment of the entire giraffe population was not even attempted in 2010 the last time they were surveyed, according to Dr Fennessy, who is also a director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. However, along with 14 colleagues Dr Fennessy has spent the past year collating the numbers of giraffe and the findings will be presented next year. 'The is quite a bit of attention paid to elephants and rhinos but the giraffe is iconic to Africa,' said Dr Fennessy. 'But no one has really paid attention to giraffes and they are not really in as good condition as we thought. Unless something is done soon, we will lose some of these glorious creatures before we even know it.'","There are fewer than 80,000 giraffes in Africa according to new research .

"Between issuing chilling threats of nuclear warfare and allegedly launching a cyber attack on a Hollywood studio, North Korea has working on a website to entice tourists to the secretive state - complete with pictures of a ski resort, grinning children... and missiles. The site, www.dprktoday.com, provides foreigners with detailed information on the secretive communist nation's tourist attractions, hotels and tour programmess through related stories and video clips.

The resort boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms, complimentary toiletries, and spa facilities and 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes . The sprawling 1,400-hectare resort was built in just ten months as part of a push by leader Kim Jong-un to increase overseas tourist numbers from 200,000 to 1 million per annum by 2016 .

"Iraq's new government has discovered 50,000 'ghost soldiers' who received army salaries without showing up for work - a practice which accelerated the military's collapse in the face of ISIS fighters six months ago. The names, equivalent to almost four full army divisions, were uncovered in an investigation launched by Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, who took office in September. 'Ghost soldiers' were men on the army payroll who paid their officers a portion of their salaries and in return did not show up for duty - enriching their commanders and hollowing out the military force. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Iraq's new government has discovered 50,000 'ghost soldiers' who received army salaries without showing up for work (file picture) The Prime Minister's spokesman, Rafid Jaburi, said: 'Those 50,000 soldiers were revealed after an intense search through military documents and there will be a field search in order to put an end to this phenomenon and any other form of corruption.' Local officials in Mosul said the city should have been defended from an ISIS attack in June by 25,000 soldiers and police - but in reality the number was at best 10,000. ISIS militants took control of the city with barely a fight. The United States spent billions of dollars trying to build up Iraq's armed forces before it pulled out of the country in 2011. It has since sent military advisers back to Iraq to train them to take on the ISIS fighters who now control much of the north and west of the country. Investigation: New Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi launched the inquiry which discovered 50,000 'ghost soldiers' Iraqi troops confirmed the existence of 'ghost soldiers to AFP. 'There are two kinds of 'fadhaiyin',' one experienced officer in the security forces said, using a word which, literally translated, means 'space men', and refers to the fictitious soldiers crowding the payroll. 'The first kind: each officer is allowed, for example, five guards. He'll keep two, send three home and pocket their salary or an agreed percentage. 'Then the second and bigger group is at the brigade level. A brigade commander usually has 30, 40 or more soldiers who stay at home or don't exist. 'The problem is that he too, to keep his job as a brigade commander, has to bribe his own hierarchical superiors with huge amounts of money.' The officer explained that, for those reasons, the thousands of soldiers who defected or were killed this year across Iraq were rarely declared as such. Dozens of military officials appointed during previous PM Nuri al-Malik's (above) eight-year rule have been sacked in the new leader's pledge to root out corruption . Blame: Local officials in Mosul (above) said the city should have been defended from an ISIS attack in June by 25,000 soldiers and police, but in reality the number was at best 10,000 . Since taking over as premier from Nuri al-Maliki, Haider al-Abadi has sacked dozens of military officials appointed during Maliki's eight-year rule and pledged to root out corruption. On Monday, Abadi's office announced he had retired 24 senior Interior Ministry officials and replaced them with new officers under a reform plan to make the security forces 'more effective in confronting terrorism'. Finance Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters last week there was a need for deep-rooted reform of the security forces to fight what he called corruption and mismanagement. 'The military has to be cleaned of all these numbers, figures of ghost soldiers and other mismanagement,' he said. Abadi's spokesman Rafid Jaburi added: 'Haidar al-Abadi is setting integrity, efficiency and courage as the criteria to appoint a new military leadership. 'This weeding out process will extend beyond the military to all state institutions.'

"David Souaan, 20, a Serbian student standing trial for preparing terrorist acts in Syria had a video referring to the 'flag of tawheed flying over London' A student arrested on his way to fight for Islamic State was caught with footage of a man having his throat cut, a court heard yesterday. David Souaan also allegedly had videos of himself with automatic weapons. The court heard the 20-year-old wanted to see the terrorist group’s black flag flying over Downing Street. Anti-terror police discovered that the undergraduate at London’s Birkbeck College was a close supporter of hate cleric Anjem Choudary. Yesterday, Souaan appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey where he is accused of preparing terrorist acts. Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said he was a ‘nice, quiet, softly spoken young man’ when he arrived in Britain in September 2012 from Serbia to study international relations. But the following year, the devout Muslim secretly spent his Christmas holiday with fighters in Syria and returned with hardline views. He began calling non-Muslims ‘kuffar’, became serious when anyone mentioned women or alcohol and showed off photographs of himself in combat gear holding a gun. Souaan was stopped at Heathrow by police as he was about to board a flight to Serbia with his mother on May 31. They examined his laptop and mobile phone and uncovered a hoard of extremist material as well as evidence of his plans to return to Syria, the jury heard. Souaan is believed to have visited the country in both December 2013 and January this year. And on January 3, he sent a message to a friend reading: ‘Hello from Syria.’ He sent Skype and text messages praising Islamic State, saying he and his younger brother were prepared to die as martyrs and threatening to ‘cut the throats’ of opponents. One image showed Souaan and four others walking through a derelict urban site carrying automatic weapons. Another video clip was described as ‘so graphic and so shocking’ it cannot be played in court. Instead, it will be described in detail to the jury by a police officer. The Old Bailey heard extremist videos were found on David Souaan's computer and phone after his arrest . Outlining the horrific contents, Mrs Whitehouse said: ‘It shows a young man kneeling while his head is held back and another man cuts his throat. 'The victim was pushed face down in the mud where his last breaths can be heard.’ Souaan, who has a Syrian Muslim father and a Serbian Christian mother, also had film of himself at a demo led by Choudary referring to the ‘flag of tawheed in London’. Mrs Whitehouse said: ‘This is a reference to the fervent wish of Muslim extremists to see the tawheed – the black flag of Islam – one day flying in Downing Street.’ In May this year, Souaan wrote that he planned to fly to Belgrade in Serbia and ask his father for money to buy a weapon. He said that the two brothers had been to the ‘front line’ and added: ‘I can’t wait for the summer to go to Syria, then I’ll be happy.’ The court was told Souaan arrived in Britain on a six-month visitor’s visa in September 2012 and was given a three-year student visa in October 2013. His passport, issued in 2009, showed he had also visited Syria in December 2009 and December 2010. Souaan, who lived in student accommodation in Bloomsbury, Central London, denies preparing terrorist acts. The trial continues.

"Rihanna: Her record label, Universal Music, was the biggest loser from a YouTube video view crackdown . The world's biggest recording companies have been stripped of two billion YouTube hits after the website cracked down on alleged 'fake' and 'dead' views. Universal, home of Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber, lost a total of one billion views in the video site’s biggest ever crackdown on its viewing figures. Sony was second hardest hit, with the label behind such stars as Alicia Keys, Rita Ora and Labrinth losing more than 850million views in a single day. The dramatic cuts came as YouTube conducted a crackdown on fake views, but music industry sources have blamed it on housekeeping related to the migration of their videos across different channels. The unprecedented move left Universal with just five videos on the site - none of which were music - and Sony with just three. 'This was not a bug or a security . breach. This was an enforcement of our viewcount policy,' YouTube . announced. It marks a huge commercial blow to all the artists involved as YouTube is now the web's most important outlet for music videos . Over four billion hours of video are watched by over . 800million unique visitors to the site each month. The dramatic falls, highlighted by . figures compiled by YouTube statistics analysts at SocialBlade, came . after YouTube conducted an audit of its viewing figures aimed at . combating 'black hat' view count-building techniques. That is the term used when hackers artificially . build up the numbers of views or likes on a YouTube video - enabling . them to make clips appear far more popular than they really are and . increase their exposure on the site. The number of views attracted on YouTube . are these days regarded as an unofficial worldwide popular music chart, . so once it became clear that hits had been inflated, fingers immediately pointed at the record industry. YouTube viewer figures are doubly valuable to channel owners since it is also the primary way in which the site works out how to share its advertising revenue with partners. The Daily Dot reported how many of the . channels affected - which also include ones belonging to Michael . Jackson, Chris Brown and Beyonce, among others - had also had many . videos deleted. Universal, which previously had dozens of clips on its YouTube channel, has had its offering slashed to just five - none of which are music videos or last more than about a minute and a half. Sony's page was also left practically bare following the cull, with just three videos left. Affected: The official channel of YouTube success story Leona Lewis (left), a protégé of Simon Cowell (right), lost nearly 24million page views in the crackdown by YouTube against 'viewcount gaming' Among the channels affected was that of British X Factor success story Leona Lewis.

Record labels have blamed the cuts in their viewing figures on a change in the way that YouTube has changed its view count. Billboard reported how the Google-owned company recently decided to remove view counts for so-called 'dead videos', which were no longer live on the channel. A senior label executive told the music industry trade magazine that since thousands of videos had in fact been migrated to Vevo, the views those clips accrued during their time on their dedicated label channels were taken away in YouTube's 'clean up'.

"Phone hacking and other illegal information gathering was mostly committed on behalf of law firms, telecom companies and insurers – not by journalists, it has emerged. The Serious Organised Crime Agency knew that businesses other than journalists hired criminals to access people’s voicemails six years ago, but did nothing to intervene, according to a report by the agency. One of the main ‘hackers’ involved in the practice said 80 per cent of companies hiring criminals to hack phones were law firms, wealthy individuals and insurance companies, according to the report. One of the individuals was ‘a celebrity who broadcasts to millions every week’. 'Cover-up': Lord Justice Leveson knew about an explosive report on phone-hacking but did not reveal its existence in the report issued by his inquiry . Just 20 per cent of hackers’ clients were in the media – which came under fierce scrutiny from the Leveson inquiry, costing taxpayers £6million. The other corrupt practices mentioned in the report included live phone interceptions, police corruption, computer hacking and perverting the course of justice. SOCA’s findings were privately presented to the Leveson inquiry in 2012, but the report was not made public or included in the Leveson Report. Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘What is astonishing about this whole murky affair is that SOCA had knowledge of massive illegal invasions of privacy in the newspaper industry – but also in the supply chains of so-called blue-chip companies. He said: ‘I believe they are sitting on physical evidence that has still not been disclosed fully to forensic investigators at the Metropolitan Police. The law should also be rigorously applied to other sectors that have got away with it.’ Police investigations reviewed by SOCA found that 20 per cent of calls in the reports were being listened to by private detectives in real time. Anger: MP Tom Watson called for the report to be shared in order to uncover wrongdoing . The report, seen by The Independent newspaper, said a ‘telephone interception specialist manufactured several devices which were physically attached to the target’s landline at the relevant signal box by a British Telecom-trained telecommunications engineer’. A document entitled The Blagger’s Manual was unearthed by another police inquiry. It gave advice on accessing personal details held by companies, banks, HM Revenue and Customs, councils, utility providers and the NHS. An extract said: ‘It is probably a good idea to overcome any moral hang-ups you might have about “snooping” or “dishonesty”. The fact is that through learning acts of technical deception, you will be performing a task which is not only of value to us or our client, but to industry as a whole.’ The source who was aware of the report, codenamed Project Riverside said clients who hired illegal private investigators included a major telecoms company, a celebrity broadcaster, a media personality and a businessman negotiating a £500million takeover. But the most prolific clients were law firms, particularly those involved in lucrative marriage and fraud litigation. The criminals, who were paid as much as £14,000 to hack phones and track bank transactions, were found to be ‘developing and cultivating useful relationships’ through ‘socialising with law enforcement personnel’. Despite the trade in criminality identified in the report, which dates back to 2006, none of the offenders hired to perform the illegal snooping was charged with criminal offences until after the phone hacking scandal. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘I am deeply concerned about these revelations. I will be seeking an explanation from SOCA as to why this was not told to the committee when we took evidence from them about the issue of private investigators. ‘It is important we establish how widespread this practice was and why no action was taken to stop what amounted to criminal activity.’ A SOCA spokesman told The Independent: ‘SOCA produced a confidential report in 2008 on the issue of licensing the private investigation industry. This report remains confidential and SOCA does not comment on leaked documents.’","Vast majority of phone hacking was not carried out by newspapers .

"Adam Steele (pictured) was sacked after he left his friend and colleague 'bleeding profusely' when he headbutted him . A favourite chef of The Queen who headbutted a colleague in a drunken rage during a party at the Buckingham Palace staff living quarters has been handed a community order. Adam Steele, 28, was popular with the Royal Family and was regularly requested by Prince Philip to cook for his guests. But the experienced sous chef was sacked after he left his friend and colleague James Thompson 'bleeding profusely' after telling him he was going to 'f*** him up' during a party at the Palace's staff accommodation. He had downed ten cans of lager and four shots before suddenly turning aggressive and launching the unprovoked attack on October 17. Steele pleaded guilty to common assault at an earlier hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court and was given community service and a fine today. Prosecutor Izolda Switala-Gribbin said: 'The defendant and victim were chefs working together at Buckingham Palace. On the day in question, Friday the 17th of October, they were having a party at the premises. 'The individual had some alcohol on the night in question and they were playing games. 'At some point he was seen becoming aggressive towards Mr Thompson, who asked the defendant if he was OK before he headbutted the victim in the face and was swinging punches at him. 'He had a split eyebrow and was bleeding profusely from his nose and eyebrow area. 'Prior to headbutting the complainant, the defendant said I'm going to f*** you up.' 'He was being aggressive for no apparent reason and there were complaints about his behaviour becoming difficult when consuming alcohol in the past.' Ms Switala-Gribbin said that after his arrest Steele told officers he had drunk 'eight to ten cans of lager and three or four shots of spirits'. 'He couldn't remember the incident and admitted to it being stupid.' Edward Jones, defending Steele, told the court his client had been dismissed from work over the assault and was still looking for a job.

Police were called when the fight broke out at the impromptu Friday night gathering in the Royal Mews (pictured), which was also attended by footmen, housemaids and other servants . He said: 'He has no previous convictions and does display remorse. He realises what he did was incredibly foolish and very costly for him. He let himself down very badly on this occasion.' Mr Jones added that Steele had 'lost a friend' in Mr Thompson over the incident and had tried to apologise to him in person. Magistrate Christina Townsend ordered the chef to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work over the next 12 months. He was also made to pay £200 compensation to Mr Thompson, £85 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge. She said: 'This offence is so serious it should be dealt with by a community order.'","Adam Steele left his colleague 'bleeding profusely' after a fight at a party .

"Warnings have been issued over fake bracelets made to look like merchandise from Disney film Frozen that could slash children's wrists when they are worn. The counterfeit snap bracelets - made up of a flat steel spring band covered with plastic and decorated with characters from the film - are being sold on eBay at £5.75 for a pack of 10. Julie Brooks, a mother of two from Nottinghamshire, discovered that the novelty merchandise is actually made of sections of cut steel measuring tape, covered in cheap thin plastic that could easily tear exposing the sharp metal. She reported the discovery to Nottinghamshire County Council which has now issued a safety warning over the 'lethal' bracelets. Scroll down for video . Nottinghamshire County Council has issued a warning over dangerous fake 'snap bracelets', which feature characters from Frozen but are made from cut metal measuring tape and could slash a child's wrist . The bands, which feature counterfeit Disney branding, are referred to as 'snap' or 'slap' bracelets as they wrap around a child's wrist when slapped against it. They feature the main characters from the film, including Elsa the Snow Queen, whose popularity among children has led to a high demand for Frozen merchandise in the run up to Christmas. Nottinghamshire County Council said it had received a number of complaints from parents concerned about the bracelets being sold. It issued the warning because of fears the plastic casing is so thin it could easily tear, exposing the sharp metal to children's wrists. Glynn Gilfoyle, chairman of the county council's community safety committee, said: 'As Frozen merchandise is the latest craze this Christmas, many parents are struggling to find items for sale and may be tempted to buy counterfeit versions online. 'As this example shows, cheap toys from outside the European Union available from online auction sites are often not well made and have not undergone any safety tests so can be lethal for children to handle. 'As these snap bracelets come into close contact with a child's wrist, these versions could cause a lot of harm so we are urging parents to avoid them at all cost.' Mrs Brooks, 42, bought two packets of the bracelets online for a children's birthday party but was shocked when she discovered beneath a simple plastic cover they were made from cut sections of steel measuring tape. The mother of two, of Newark-on-Trent, then reported her discovery to Nottinghamshire County Council's Trading Standards department. She said: 'I saw on Facebook a story where a cheap snap bracelet cut a child's face. It was a link shared by my friends. There are fears the fake Frozen bracelets could harm children who want them due to the popularity of the film . The fake bracelets, in packs of 10, are being sold on eBay for cheap prices as demand for merchandise grows . Elsa the Snow Queen in Frozen is a popular character in the Disney film, leading to demand for merchandise . 'I was horrified when they arrived as they looked so poorly made, so I decided to cut one open and found a cut up metal tape measure inside, so it was clearly designed not to be used as a toy. 'I got a refund but I just want to warn other parents to steer clear of these dangerous items before there's an accident. 'It is quite a big, serious thing. 'It is measuring tape, like what you would use in your home. It has even got the numbers on it. 'As soon as I opened one, I could see they were very dangerous. The metal inside is really sharp. It could slice a child's wrist. 'If I chucked them in the bin, someone could have still got them. So I contacted Trading Standards straight away. Shoppers at Poundworld in Nottingham stripped the store of all Disney's Frozen goods within 10 minutes . 'I knew they were dangerous and I just don't want any kids to get hurt.' The council said it had received a number of complaints about the fake bracelets being sold, including about some being sold at a shop in Newark. Coun Gilfoyle said the store has been advised of the dangers of the bracelets and has now stopped selling them. Different versions of the fake bracelets are being sold cheap online, with some being put up for sale for as little as 99p for a single band. Concerns over the bracelets came to light because Frozen merchandise has became so popular recently following the release of the Disney film. Last week parents stripped a new Poundworld store in Nottingham of all Frozen merchandise within 10 minutes, some working as tag teams to ensure they got the best bargains on cups, lunchboxes and advent calendars featuring characters from the film.","Fake bracelets are made from metal measuring tape covered in plastic .

"Rolf Harris has lost the first round of his appeal against conviction for a string of indecent assaults . Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris has lost the first round of his bid to appeal against his convictions for a string of indecent assaults. Harris was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse in July for attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986. The Australian presenter and artist even abused his daughter Bindi's best friend while she slept feet away - but the 84-year-old has refused to show any remorse for his sex crimes. This afternoon a spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed  that a judge has refused his application for permission to appeal. But it is still open to the 84-year-old to renew the application before three judges at the Court of Appeal. The artist and musician was convicted of 12 indecent assaults at London's Southwark Crown Court on June 30. One was on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter's friend over 16 years. The appeal move was refused by a single judge considering the application on the case papers. Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked during his trial as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls. Jurors were told that his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide. His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed. During his trial, Harris was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls. Jurors were told how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide. Passing sentence, Justice Sweeney said: 'You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.' Jailed: Harris pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court with daughter Bindi (right), wife Alwen (second left) and niece Jenny (left), who have stood by him despite his string of sex offences . New home: HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire is where Rolf Harris, 84, has been held for the majority of time so far, and reportedly spent a month creating the didgeridoo during art classes . Liz Dux, abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon, who represents victims of Rolf Harris, said: 'The victims will be very relieved. They have already been through the horrific ordeal of a long and extremely stressful trial. 'They want this over so they can get on with their lives as best they can, although for some the damage Harris has done will sadly be irreparable. 'We must not forget the very serious nature of the crimes Harris committed. Justice has rightly been done and the victims will be pleased at the outcome.' While in prison Harris has worked hard to endear himself to other inmates after a rocky start. In July it was claimed that Harris was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service, an incident which was said to have sparked a mass brawl. He was also accused by a fellow prisoner of 'jumping the queue' into a paid gardening job in the grounds of the Oxfordshire jail. Prison officers are said to be keeping a close eye on him to ensure he is not targeted. Since then he has been handing out signed drawings for free to inmates while at Bullingdon jail in Oxfordshire, until he was moved to HMP Stafford recently. Last week it was reported he spent a month making a didgeridoo, which is about 3ft long and has been decorated on the outside with figures and images. The artist, who famously painted a portrait of the Queen, also created a sculpture of interlocked chains out of wood to 'represent his time in jail'. Upsetting: Disgraced Harris unveiling his portrait of the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2005 to mark her 80th birthday, before his crimes were revealed . Keeping busy: The entertainer, famous for his artwork, (pictured painting Lily Cole) has been creating sculptures in prison . He has applied to have the instrument and sculpture transferred to his new cell on the vulnerable sex offenders wing  but is is thought guards have refused on the basis that inmates are not allowed to have large personal items. He has also joined the prison church choir, which came as a shock to many after he previously shunned religion in his autobiography. Harris' frail wife Alwen is understood to also regularly visit her husband in Bullingdon prison, arriving in a wheelchair. She stood by Harris as he was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls during his trial at Southwark Crown Court.","A judge has refused the entertainer's application for permission to appeal .

"The strain placed on the NHS by patients from abroad is revealed by figures showing that around half a million immigrants sign up at GP surgeries every year. The startling finding has come from independent research because the Government has failed to look into the impact of immigration on the health system.

Scroll down for video . More and more patients are having to wait longer for an appointment with their GP as half a million immigrants sign up to GP surgeries .

He told the BBC’s Question Time audience that ‘the rate and pace of immigration’ was creating particular pressures, including those ‘on access to GPs and hospitals’. Experts do not know how many immigrants registering at GPs come from within the EU, but it is estimated they account for about 40 per cent, or 200,000 each year. Despite growing worries, the Department of Health has not carried out a single study into the impact of a decade’s worth of mass immigration on use of the NHS. It has only researched the sensitive issue of ‘health tourism’. However, analysis by the highly respected Nuffield Trust think-tank has found immigration is leading to about half a million joining GPs’ books every year. Researchers Adam Steventon and Martin Bardsley looked at the number of people aged 16 and over registering with a GP for the first time. Mr Steventon said: ‘The method is not perfect, but we identified 550,000 probable immigrants registering in the year 2003-04. This rose to 583,000 for 2004-05 and to 625,000 for 2005-06.’ In the absence of Government research, the Trust’s estimates are the most recent figures available. However, since immigration has remained high, the pressure is continuing to grow on GP surgeries. In the year to June 2014, 583,000 people came to live and work in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics, and 325,000 left. Separate figures show that the average length of GP patient lists has increased in 198 of 211 health authority areas across England since April 2013. Dr Richard Vautrey, a member of the British Medical Association’s General Practice Committee, said that although doctors were concerned about being overwhelmed, the pressure was not down to immigrants, but the ageing population. He said: ‘They [GPs] say they are struggling, but it’s not because of changes in the population.’ Dr Vautrey added that immigrants tended to be younger and healthier than the general population, elderly people used the NHS far more and GPs were having to carry out more work traditionally done in hospitals. However, he said migrants with poor English did tend to need longer consultations and also the use of interpreters. Last year 42,500 women from Eastern Europe gave birth in NHS hospitals, new figures have revealed . Births to women from Eastern European countries in the EU have leapt tenfold over the past decade at NHS hospitals. In 2004, there were about 4,500 births in England and Wales to women from Poland and other former Eastern bloc nations that are now members of the EU. But by 2013 that figure had risen to 42,500, according to the Office for National Statistics. Polish women account for about half of these births, with their number rising from 1,830 a decade ago to 21,275 in 2013. The ONS regards ‘new EU countries’ as those that have joined the European Union since the start of 2004 – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. With the average hospital delivery costing around £1,500, the NHS’s total maternity bill may have risen by around £57 million due to immigration from these ‘new EU’ countries. Women from these countries used to account for a tiny proportion of births in England and Wales overall – just 0.7 per cent in 2004. By 2013 that had grown to 6.1 per cent. Over a similar period, the ratio of UK births to all foreign-born mothers rose from 19.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent – up from 124,563 in 2004 to 189,075 in 2012. Births to UK-born women numbered 515,144 in 2004 and 540,572 in 2012. The rises have left maternity units struggling, with the Royal College of Midwives demanding 3,200 more midwives.","Many surgeries are leading new arrivals to believe that all care is free .

"He got very publicly naked in Las Vegas and was last seen twerking on a yacht in Abu Dhabi. So it might be thought that Prince Harry has very few secrets left to reveal. But the fourth in line to the throne admitted today that he still gets ridiculously nervous when asked to speak publicly. Harry, 30, was confessing all in his role as founder of Sentebale, the charity he set up in 2006 to help children afflicted by HIV and Aids in the poverty-stricken African kingdom of Lesotho. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: Prince Harry has revealed that he gets 'ridiculously nervous' about public speaking . Speaking out: Harry hopes the campaign will encourage AIDS sufferers to seek the help they need . Part of a social media campaign to mark World Aids Day, #FeelNoShame aims to encourage celebrities and members of the public to share their deepest secret in a bid to highlight the shame that prevents many HIV sufferers from seeking help. In his video clip, which can be viewed online, the royal says: 'On today, World Aids Day, my secret is, believe it or not, I get incredibly nervous before public speaking, no matter how big the crowd or the audience. 'Despite the fact that I laugh and joke all the time, I get incredibly nervous, if not anxious, actually, before going into rooms full of people when I am wearing a suit. ‘And now I have confessed that I’ll probably be even more worried that people are looking at me. ‘ . The prince’s secret, while not exactly revelatory, is surprising as he has become an increasingly assured speaker with a developing public role in recent years. Over the summer he launched the inspiring Invictus Games for injured servicemen as with a moving speech in front of thousands and ad-libbed to a sell-out crowd in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park at a closing concert. No fear: Despite Harry's claims, he has proved an assured public speaker - notably at the Invictus Games . Campaign: Harry's revelations came as part of a social media campaign for his charity Sentebale . Celebrities supporting the initiative included Nicole Scherzinger, who said: ‘My secret is sometimes I don’t feel like I’m enough, I’m worth it and I don’t fit in but #feelnoshame.’ Boxer Ricky Hatton said; ‘My secret is a big embarrassing in that when I was one years of age my next door neighbour’s cat had just take it upon itself to scratch me down my face and taken near enough half my skin off. ‘Ever since that day I have been scared of cats and whenever one comes across my path now I’m petrified of them. I know it’s a bit strange a secret like that coming from a world champion but I am absolutely scared and terrified of cats.’ Singer Joss Stone also admitted – rather too candidly, perhaps: ‘When I was 11 I drank rather too much tea when I was out with my mum and then I went into Superdrug [the chemist] and weed myself. 'Now, today, I cannot stop at a service station, at a petrol station, without going to the loo even though I don’t need the loo. I still go. It’s ingrained in my brain, I know it won’t happen again but I feel no shame.’ Africa: Sentebale's work focuses on helping those with HIV and AIDS in the tiny country of Lesotho . Stigma: The new campaign aims to encourage sufferers to speak up and get the help they need . On a different tack, actress Gemma Arterton admitted she had never seen Star Wars. The campaign, which was created by charity Sentebale – which Prince Harry co-founded – aims to raise awareness of how eradicating this shame and stigma can save the lives of HIV sufferers, empowering them to seek medical support and education about their condition, and preventing the virus from spreading. In a video released to mark the start of the initiative, the prince said: ‘Globally, HIV is the second highest cause of death amongst those aged between 10-19 years old, and it is the number one cause of death across Africa. 'One tragic issue in particular is the shame and stigma linked to HIV. This causes thousands of children to needlessly die each year because they’re keeping their illness a secret and not getting the medical attention they need. ‘To show our support for the children of Lesotho [where Sentebale works], and help reduce the stigma for all those affected by HIV, we are turning this World AIDS Day into a day in which no one should feel any shame about their secrets. 'Together, we can tackle the stigma surrounding HIV and give the young people carrying it the childhood they deserve. The childhood so many of us take for granted.’ Secret: Joss Stone also revealed her deepest secret - that she once wet herself in Superdrug aged 11 . Revelations: Gemma Arterton has never seen Star Wars while Ricky Hatton was once scratched by a cat . Cathy Ferrier, CEO of Sentebale, said: ‘This World AIDS Day Sentebale is launching an important campaign. Too many children are not receiving the treatment and care they so desperately need due to the stigma attached to HIV. 'Today we will celebrate the sharing of secrets with #FeelNoShame, to help spread the word that eradicating the stigma surrounding HIV will help save the lives of many HIV-positive children.’ Prince Harry co-founded Sentebale in 2006 with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, following a visit to the country two years earlier, when he was struck by the effect the HIV/AIDS pandemic was having on the country, particularly its children. Lesotho has the third highest HIV/AIDS prevalence in the world. More than 37,000 of Lesotho’s 500,000 children are HIV positive, and approximately 200,000 have lost parents to AIDS, forcing them out of school and into hazardous forms of labour including prostitution and trafficking. Since 1996, the country’s average life expectancy has fallen from 59 years to below 48.7 years. Sentebale provides accommodation, hot food, access to medication and education for Lesotho’s children – preventing the virus from spreading – as well as vital psycho-social support to help them tackle stigma and cope with the emotional repercussions of their condition and live normal lives. It also encourages children and young people to come together through week-long Mamohato camps and regular clubs, to talk about their health issues and fears of living with HIV. Often for the first time they learn to talk openly to one another about being HIV-positive, learning about their medication, building friendships and a sense of normality, as they realise that, with the correct medication, it is possible to lead a long and healthy life.","Harry admitted to his fear of public speaking in HIV video campaign .

"A massive power outage across downtown Detroit has hit several government buildings, forced schools to close early and left some parts of the city without working traffic lights. Detroit's public lighting department, which serves areas of the city affected by the outage, said 'a major cable failure' around 10.30am on Tuesday caused the grid to lose power. Power was slowly being restored to the city on Tuesday afternoon, officials said, but they still do not know the cause of the shutdown. DTE Energy Co.said it is looking into the problem. The outage plunged employees into darkness, trapped others in elevators and cut off power to police departments, fire stations, schools and jails. Scroll down for video . Plunged into darkness: A student at Wayne State University shared a photograph of her darkened classroom after 100 buildings on the grid in Detroit were hit by a huge power outage on Tuesday morning . All quiet: Work stopped and construction workers were sent home from Cobo Hall during the power outage . Heading to the light: Another student shared this image of State Hall on the university's campus. She also commented that even the bathroom faucets, which have sensors, were out of order . Good work: One student, Kristen Shaw, shared this photo to Twitter, writing: 'Detroit power outage hits class during infrastructure discussion - prof keeps teaching in the dark. @waynestate' Manpower: Temporary stop signs are placed in the middle of Michigan Avenue on Tuesday after the Detroit downtown area was hit by a massive power outage, causing traffic lights to switch off . Evacuation: The Frank Murphy Hall of Justice was among the public buildings left without power after the 'major cable failure'. The trial of Bob Bashara, who is accused of murdering his wife, was put on hold . 'We have isolated the issue and are working to restore power as soon as possible,' according to a statement from the City of Detroit. Following the outage, Detroit Public Schools said it was dismissing students at midday on Tuesday. More than 1,200 jail inmates at two locations have been locked down until power is restored, said Lieutenant Brian Earle with the Wayne County Sheriff's Office, USA Today reported. The Detroit Medical Center is rerouting its highest-level trauma patients to Henry Ford and St. John's main hospitals but officials assured families in a statement that its emergency power system has kept patients 'safe and well cared for'. Powerless: The Detroit Institute of Arts shared images of its hallways on Tuesday morning . Ushered out: The museum also evacuated its visitors after the sudden outage on Tuesday .

Young Municipal Center after being assisted down 11 flights of stairs in her wheelchair after the elevators cut out on Tuesday morning . Conrad Mallett Jr., chief administration officer of DMC, told the Detroit News that the outage was a 'substantial inconvenience' but that the hospital has 'plenty of available power'. Fire stations have been relying on generator power and have all been able to take calls by landline or radio, according to Detroit Fire. Many responded to calls from people stuck in elevators. All have now been freed, the Detroit News reported. Some police officers told their dispatchers that they were worried about running out of gas because gas pumps were down. Other affected facilities include Joe Louis Arena, home of the Detroit Red Wings and parts of Wayne State University, where classes on the main campus have been canceled. Kicked out: Employees stream into parking lots outside government buildings after the power outage . Heading home: Offices have shut down and schools announced they would be finished for the day at noon . At the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, the ongoing murder trial of Bob Bashara, who is accused of hiring a hitman to kill his wife Jane, was also stalled after the lights went out. Service also has been temporarily suspended by the Detroit People Mover, an elevated rail line that loops downtown. Traffic lights started coming back on at intersections around 11.45am and power started to flick on again in the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, WJBK-TV reported.","Detroit's public lighting department said 'a major cable failure' is responsible for cutting out the power around 10.30am .

"Kurt Zouma's Chelsea career got off to a flying start on Wednesday night when the 19-year old scored on his debut, but's it not just his goal that has got people talking. The French centre back scored the opener in a2-1 win against Bolton in the Capital One Cup, but something catching people's eye just as much is his full name - Kurt Happy Zouma. Born in Lyon, France, Zouma takes his first name from a film character played by Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. Kurt  Zouma is very happy as he celebrates after scoring the opening goal at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday . Zouma fires past Andy Lonergan in the Bolton goal to open the scoring . Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, who must must learn the ancient kick boxing art of Muay Thai in order to avenge his brother, who was paralysed by a rival during a fight. The 1989 film is considered a cult classic. His parents, evidently fans of the 1989 movie Kickboxer, named their son after the star, 'Kurt Sloane'. Zouma explained the revelance to Chelseafc.co.uk: . 'In the film, he helps everyone and is super strong,' the France U21 defender revealed. 'So my parents decided that if they gave me that name I'd be hard and always have a smile. Apparently it worked.' And that certainly seemed the case on Wednesday night, as Zouma's smile stretched from ear to ear during the celebrations for his goal. The youngster joined Chelsea in January 2014 for £12million, but was immediately loaned back to his selling club Saint-Etienne for the remainder of the season. Another quirk in Zouma's profile is his middle name - Happy. In some African culture, it is common practice to relate middle names to virtues, and the defender will certainly have been happy after his goal and a win on his debut.

"U.S. health officials on Tuesday released a draft of long-awaited federal guidelines on circumcision, saying medical evidence supports having the procedure done and health insurers should pay for it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines stop short of telling parent to get their newborn sons circumcised. That is a personal decision that may involve religious or cultural preferences, said the CDC's Dr. Jonathan Mermin. But 'the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks,' added Mermin, who oversees the agency's programs on HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. New evidence: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines stop short of telling parent to get their newborn sons circumcised . These are the first federal guidelines on circumcision, a brief medical procedure that involves cutting away the foreskin around the tip of the penis. Germs can grow underneath the foreskin, and CDC officials say the procedure can lower a male's risk of sexually-transmitted diseases, penile cancer and even urinary tract infections. The CDC started working on the guidelines about seven years ago, when a cluster of influential studies in Africa indicated circumcision might help stop spread of the AIDS virus. 'The benefits of male circumcision have become more and more clear over the last ten years,' said Dr. Aaron Tobian, a Johns Hopkins University researcher involved in one of the African studies. But the guidelines are important, because the rates of newborn male circumcision have been dropping, he added. The guidelines are being published in the federal register Tuesday. For the next 45 days, the CDC will receive public comment before finalizing them next year. They are likely to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups, said Dr. Douglas Diekema, a Seattle physician who worked on a circumcision policy statement issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2012. 'This is a passionate issue for them and they feel strongly that circumcision is wrong,' said Diekema, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington. The CDC guidelines largely mirror the pediatrician group's statement, but the CDC's document incorporates more research and comes from an organization that many may see as more neutral on the topic, Diekema said. The thinking on circumcision has swung wildly over the years. It's been practiced by Jews and Muslims for thousands of years, but didn't become common in this country until the 20th century. By one estimate, only 25per cent of U.S. male newborns were circumcised in 1900. It gradually became the cultural norm, and in the 1950s and 1960s surpassed 80per cent. But then the trend reversed. Part of it had to do with changing demographics, as the U.S. population grew to include larger numbers of Mexican-Americans and other ethnic groups that didn't traditionally circumcise their children. Controversial: The new guidelines, which state how the procedure can cut risk for HIV, STDs and penile cancer, are expected to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups . Also, opposition to the procedure grew from advocates who decried the pain, bleeding and risk of infections to newborns. Their message was aided by the Internet and by the neutral stance of physicians groups - including, for a time, the American Academy of Pediatrics. A wave of state Medicaid programs stopped paying for newborn circumcisions, which cost roughly $150 to $200. The list eventually rose to 18 states, according to CDC numbers. By 2010 the newborn circumcision rate was down to about 58per cent, according to one CDC estimate. But even as the circumcision rate dropped, more medical evidence came in supporting it - particularly three rigorous and influential studies in Africa that looked at the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in circumcised and uncircumcised men and their partners. In the new guidelines, the CDC says there is now strong evidence that male circumcision can: . Studies have not shown that circumcision will reduce an HIV-infected man's chances of spreading the AIDS virus to women. And research has not found circumcision to be a help in stopping spread of HIV during gay sex. The guidelines say circumcision is safer for newborns and infants than for older males, noting the complication rate rises from 0.5per cent in newborns to nine per cent in children ages one to nine, according to the CDC. Minor bleeding and pain are the most common problems, experts say. CDC officials are recommending doctors tell parents of baby boys of the benefits and risks of circumcision. Mermin did not say how that information should be presented. Because circumcision can be beneficial to men as well, the CDC says information about the procedure also should be given to sexually active uncircumcised men - especially men considered to be at higher risk of catching HIV, the guidelines say.","These are the first federal guidelines on circumcision .

"Conspiracy theorists have accused Nasa of cutting its live feed from the International Space Station whenever a 'UFO' appears. On two separate occasions this month, alien hunters claim to have spotted mysterious objects appearing on their screens before it goes blank. UFO watcher Toby Lundh recently spotted a UFO outside the space station, moments before the stream was interrupted for 10 to 15 seconds. Scroll down for video . Last week, a grey object was seen coming up over the horizon and then disappearing moments before Nasa switched to a different camera. One possible is that it was a bit of debris that hit the lens, or even the moon . Mr Lundh told Disclose.TV that there are 'always some UFOs showing up,' and 'Nasa always cuts the feed when a UFO gets close to the station.' The alien hunter claims to have captured a still photo of the unidentified object from the feed - and it looks remarkably like the Starfleet insignia in Star Trek. He also says that Nasa has removed the recording from its archives as part of efforts to conceal alleged communication between astronauts and UFOs . In a separate incident last week, a grey object was seen coming up over the horizon and then disappearing moments before Nasa switched to a different camera. UFO watcher Toby Lundh recently spotted a UFO outside the space station, before the stream was interrupted for 10 to 15 seconds. The alien hunter claims to have captured a still photo of an unidentified object (pictured) that appeared on the live feed on January 6. It look remarkably like the Starfleet insignia in Star Trek . One possible is that it was a bit of debris that hit the lens, or even the moon. But 'Streetcap1', the YouTuber who posted the video isn't convinced. 'Please bear in mind that the moon appears white when it shows,' he writes. Meanwhile on October 7, UFO watchers said they witnessed a strange object near the station during a spacewalk by astronauts Reid Wiserman and Alexander Gerst. The object was later identified as being either a speck of dust or a lens flare from the sun. That didn't stopped some conspiracy theories arising though, with ufologists somewhat speculatively claiming it was proof that we are not alone in the universe. One of the most interesting cases in the files is the Lubbock Lights incident was reported August 30, 1951 in Texas . In 1948, the US government launched several inquiries into UFO sightings, which many believed were sparked by Cold War paranoia. In what became known as 'Project Blue Book,' more than 12,000 encounters with UFOs were looked into by the Air Force. Now, decades after the files were closed, the microfilms have been made available online for free – allowing anyone to re-examine the evidence. The USAF says that the Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files. The files, which can be accessed here, were previously only available by visiting the National Archives in Washington. Professor Andrew Balogh from the Imperial College London Department of Physics tells MailOnline: 'Generally speaking UFO sightings are either explained by some artefact effect - even some space junk - or left unexplained as there is not enough evidence. 'It's difficult to judge from the video in this instance, because of its poor quality. If Nasa has access to high quality images, they may investigate further.' Nasa is yet to comment the incidents. The space agency's ISS live stream and rover photos have become a huge source of 'evidence' for conspiracy theorists. Many scientists believe UFO sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia. This describes the brain's response to seeing significant objects in random places. 'The vast majority of these images are as vague and elusive as those posted by UFO witnesses on Earth, and many have a fairly mundane explanation, 'Nigel Watson author of the UFO investigations Manual told MailOnline. 'The problem is that the more Nasa denies such things or explains them the more people think there is a conspiracy to hide the truth that aliens are visiting our planet.'

"The shocking failure of the Government to live up to its promise to restore weekly bin collections is laid bare today. Families are having to wait 12 days on average to have general rubbish collected – and face spiralling charges for extra waste-removal services, it has been revealed. This comes despite the Conservatives’ repeated pledge that they would restore people’s ‘fundamental right’ to have their bins emptied once a week. Figures from a comprehensive survey suggest that just 6 per cent of local authorities in England collect all bins weekly. Scroll down for video . Families are having to wait 12 days on average to have general rubbish collected – and face spiralling charges for extra waste-removal services, it has been revealed. File picture . And there is a creeping trend for councils to issue fees for basic services such as garden waste collection, garden rubbish bags and the disposal of bulky waste – with increases of almost 5,000 per cent in the worst-hit areas. Overall, families now have to wait one week and five days on average for black bag rubbish to be collected and have to contend with an average of nearly four bins, according to figures gathered from Freedom of Information requests to every council in the country. Shadow communities and local government secretary Hilary Benn said the findings meant boasts by ministers that they would restore weekly bin collections had been exposed as ‘pompous hot air’. Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875. But after Labour’s 1997 election victory local authorities were encouraged to move towards alternate collections of general and recyclable waste. In opposition, David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles repeatedly pledged to restore the weekly bin round, and on winning power unveiled a £250million fund to encourage councils to do so. Today’s research, however, suggests the Government’s measures have been a crushing failure. It involved Freedom of Information requests to all 325 councils responsible for waste collection, of which nearly nine in ten responded. It found that only 17 of 285 authorities collect all bins weekly – covering 4.3million people. The 48.7million living in the other 268 areas have bins collected less-frequently. On average, general waste bins are now collected every once every 12 days, while recycling bins are collected every 13 days. Food waste, collected separately in 116 areas, is picked up on average every nine days. Garden waste is collected every 13 days. And the survey showed that while in 2011/12, councils across England made £36.2million from extra charges – for services such as garden waste collection, extra waste bags and bulky waste collection – by last year, the figure had risen to £54.3million. The biggest charges are in Purbeck, Dorset, where residents have to pay £40 a year for fortnightly collections of a wheeled bin containing garden waste. There are also now charges for collection and disposal of bulky waste – £30 for a single item followed by £6 per subsequent item. In 2011/12, the council earned £101,802.19 from such charges, but by last year, the figure spiralled to £869,796.79, the survey revealed. North Kesteven, Lincolnshire, has seen the biggest increase in revenues – up 4,676 per cent to £750,283 over the same period. Its garden waste charge for 2014/15 is £25 per bin, while bulky collections are charged at £11 for up to three items and £22 for up to six items. Mr Benn said: ‘This comprehensive study fatally undermines Eric Pickles’ boast when he was in opposition and in government that he would return Britain to weekly bin collections and keep extra charges down. 'The reality that we expose today is very different. It is Tory councils that are charging the most – three times as much as Labour councils – and there was a 50 per cent increase in charges across England in the last two years. ‘He said the public should hold him to account for his record so as we approach the general election I hope people will recognise that he made claims he never had the power to bring to fruition.’ He added: ‘Eric Pickles blustered for years that he would impose new controls on local authorities and local communities but this has now been exposed as pompous hot air. This is precisely why people have lost faith in politics. You need to say what you mean and mean what you say. Eric Pickles does neither.’ Government sources said Labour’s analysis was misleading, since it counted garden waste as something that should be collected weekly, when that has never been the case in most places. Fourteen million homes in England still have weekly collection of smelly rubbish ‘in some form’, the Government insists. Mr Pickles said: ‘The Labour Government bullied councils into axing weekly collections and were planning new bin taxes on family homes. 'Conservatives in Government have kept to our promises; we have abolished Labour’s bin taxes, reined back in bin snoopers and have actively supported weekly collections, whilst keeping council tax down.’ He also insisted he had changed the law to scrap unfair fines for not putting rubbish out correctly. The Government is considering introducing new laws to force more councils to bring back weekly bin collections. Mr Pickles said it had taken Labour ten years to ‘destroy’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it.","British families wait an average of 12 days for a collection .
Just six per cent of councils make collections once a week .
Councils across England made £54.3m from extra charges .
A spokesperson for Adur and Worthing Councils has asked us to clarify that, because figures supplied to the Labour Party for this report were an amalgamation of costs for two councils' households rather than simply for Adur households, the average household charge relating to ancillary, elective, waste collections services for households in Adur and Worthing is in fact £9.75 rather than the figure of £26.81 as calculated by the survey's researchers. We are happy to set the record straight.
We have been asked by Purbeck District Council to make clear that while the article states that Purbeck, Dorset is the area with the highest charges for waste collection services, in fact its service charges are lower than those of many other local authorities. The discrepancy arose because the response to the Freedom of Information request, on which the survey was based, came from Purbeck Council rather than Dorset Waste Partnership, which administers the service to six district and borough council areas not just Purbeck District Council."
"Giving a thumbs and smiling for the camera, this African migrant celebrates after successfully storming a barrier to make his way into Spanish territory. The migrant, accompanied by another man who drapes his arm over him, was one of 600 Africans, who charged at the border fence separating the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco today. Only 30 of them successfully managed to climb over before running to safety prompting the group to congratulate themselves for succeeding in their dangerous mission. Scroll down for video . A migrant gives a thumbs up for the camera and celebrates with a friend after the pair become successful in managing to storm a barrier in Morocco to make their way into Spanish territory . Only 30 men successfully managed to climb over the 20-foot high fence before running to safety prompting the group to congratulate themselves for succeeding in their dangerous mission . According to the Spanish government, the group were the latest in a flow of migrants who have been trying to reach Melilla and the other Spanish north African territory of Cueta, which together have Europe's only borders with Africa. Several migrants remain perched at the top of the  fence, refusing to come down, with Moroccan authorities waiting for them at the bottom for when they decide to come down . In a statement the government explained that the group stormed the 20-foot, triple layer fence around Melilla early this morning, with 30 succeeding in climbing over. Shortly afterwards, a separate group charged at another part of the fence, but they were kept away by Moroccan security forces in co-ordination with the Spanish police, the statement added. The two groups totalled more than 600 migrants and several remain perched on top of the fence, at the foot of which Spanish police remained deployed. No migrants nor police were known to have been hurt in the incident - unlike during some earlier attempts this year. The flow of migrants seeking to enter Europe via Ceuta and Melilla has intensified this year. Some 16,000 migrants have tried to storm the Melilla fence and more than 2,000 have made it over, the Spanish government delegation there says. There have been at least 65 attempts by groups of Africans to climb the fence this year, compared to a total of 38 in 2013. Spanish authorities accuse human-traffickers for bringing the migrants to the border in the hope of reaching European soil. Fleeing war, persecution and poverty in their home countries, hundreds of these men arrive every month, and will regularly rush the high wire fences in order to climb over. Many will injure themselves in their frustrated attempts - cutting their hands and feet to pieces on barbed wire, or hurting themselves falling over the other side. The migrants who were pictured trying to climb over the fence close to a luxury golf course in Melilla, while golfers teed off . From there, they are scooped up by border guards who watch the fence day and night. They will be taken to a migrant centre in the nearby town where they will either be released - or deported. In October, 20 migrants were pictured climbing over the fence close to a luxury golf course in Melilla, while golfers teed off. They could be seen perched at the top of the 20 foot fence in the background of the fairway while golfers, playing at the exclusive course, lined up their shots in the foreground.","600 migrants attempted to storm a barrier to make their way into Spain .

"Only a brilliant late save from Barcelona's debutant goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen prevented Barcelona dropping two points at the Camp Nou against Apoel. The club's relentless production line of young players ticked off another couple of teenage debuts as Luis Enrique gave 19-year-olds Sergi Samper and El Haddadi Munir their first Champions League starts but the understrength team selection made for a nervy 1-0 win sealed only by Gerard Pique's first half header. Coach Luis Enrique marked his first game in charge in Europe by blooding the two teenagers and by giving goalkeeper ter Stegen his first start and he was the later hero saving from Gustavo Manduca. Barcelona's Gerard Pique (second right) finds a small gap in the Apoel defence to head in the opener at the Nou Camp . Pique's header makes it 1-0 for Barcelona against the Cyprus champions in their opening Champions League Group F match . Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Bartra, Dani Alves, Pique, Adriano, Sergi (Alcantara do Nascimento 79'), Samper, Xavi (Iniesta 61'), Neymar, El Haddadi (Ramírez 68'), Messi . Subs not used: Rakitic, Bravo, Pereira dos Santos, Mathieu . Goal: Pique . Apoel: Pardo, Antoniades, Da Cruz Junior, Sergio, Leme Amorim, Oliveira Franco, Figueiras Gomes (Manduca 62'), Morais, Aloneftis, De Vincenti (Charalambidis 79'), Sheridan (Djebbour 75') Subs not used: Artymatas,  Alexandrou, Chiotis, Bezerra Da Silva . Booked: Antoniades, Oliveira Franco . El Haddadi Munir has now debuted for Barça, Spain and in the European Cup in the last month and for Samper it was a European start before he has even played a league game. There were seven products of the youth academy Barcelona will have to rely on more than ever if the Court of Arbitration in Sport upholds the FIFA ban on them making transfers for a year, on the pitch, and there was even a former Barça youth player on the Apoel side with Urko Pardo. He said before the game that he had grown accustomed to saving Messi shots coming up through La Masia and he was tested on 11 minutes palming the Argentine’s free-kick away for a corner. Messi then dribbled across the face of the Apoel penalty area before setting up Neymar who shot wide. On 28 minutes the breakthrough came when Messi whipped in a free-kick from the right-hand channel and Gerard Pique got in front of Vinicius, much to the defender’s visible fury, to head past Pardo. Messi looks back to his sonic best and he played the pass of the night to Neymar five minutes before the break. Neymar returned the favour but Messi’s shot was blocked by Pardo. With Barcelona in total control they started the second half parked in the Apoel half and with goalkeeper Ter Stegen at times situated 10 yards outside of his penalty area. He had already headed one long ball forward away from outside the penalty box. But there was a dangerous complacency to the ease with which they were dictating play and Apoel grew in confidence. Pique gestures to the crowd after he scored the opening goal of Barcelona's 2014-15 Champions League campaign . Barcelona players celebrate Pique's goal after 28 minutes . Messi troubles Apoel early on in the match with a sweetly struck free-kick . Barcelona manager Luis Enrique gave 19-year-olds Sergi Samper and El Haddadi Munir their European debuts . Against the run of play they created their first real opening when Irish forward Cillian Shreridan beat Pique in the air and nodded the ball down to Tomas de Vincenti whose shot was blocked by Marc Bartra. Then they broke down the right and only the intervention of Dani Alves prevented a yellow-shirted forward getting on the end of Gustavo Manduca’s cross. Luis Enrique brought Sandro on for Munir in an attempt to find the second goal. The 20-year-old has already netted once this season in a 1-0 win over Villarreal but was another Champions League debutant. Munir almost scored with his last touch before being taken off, heading home from an offside position. Barcelona's Lional Messi gets caught late by Apoel's Vinicius and Carlao .

Barcelona teenager Munir El Haddadi attempts to hold off a physical challenge Apoel's Da Cruz Junior . Brazilian star Neymar shows his frustration against a spirited if outclassed Cypriot side . German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, making his first start for Barcelona, was called upon to make a key save that preserved maximum points for his side . There was still time for Mario Sergio to save Messi's goalbound shot and Apoel to so nearly steal a point only for Ter Stegen to deny them. It had also been a night for anniversaries with Messi marking 14 years at Barcelona and Barcelona supporters remembering former coach Tito Vilanova, who would have been 46 on Wednesday. Both are in their own way symbols of Barcelona’s youth system and it was La Masia that had benefited most from this victory. Beating the Cypriot champions 1-0 will not reverberate around the rest of Europe but Luis Enrique will count the debuts to his young stars as victories and be satisfied to have seem them take all three points.

"There can't be many days in the year when pedestrians, cyclists - and skateboarders - reign supreme on some of Israel's busiest roads. In a scene which could have come straight from a movie, there isn't a car in sight as families, teenagers and Rabbis freely roam the empty streets. On any other day, you might expect the highways in and around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to be teeming with traffic, choking fumes rising above the cityscape. Deserted: These youngsters on a bike and a skateboard take advantage of the empty streets of Jerusalem during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur . Pedestrians crossing: An Israeli family takes a stroll on a deserted highway in Tel Aviv . Nice day for it: Two Orthodox Jewish men walk down a road surrounded by cyclists . But thanks to the holiest Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur the streets are empty and the air is clear, allowing many to enjoy a rare car-free day. Yom Kippur - or Day of Atonement - is the holiest of Jewish holidays, when observant Jews atone for sins of the last year. Israel came to a standstill for 24 hours during the holiday, in which Jews fast and Israelis are prohibited from driving their cars. As these incredible pictures show, youths on skateboards and bikes, joggers - and even Orthodox Jewish men - take to the tarmac making some of Israel's busiest cities look like ghost towns.

A third photograph showed a broken tombstone but none of the photographs could be independently verified due to the fast day's traditional travel limitations. The 'price-taggers' have vowed to avenge any move by Israel to uproot settlement outposts built in the occupied West Bank without Israeli government permission and have torched mosques and vandalised both Israeli and Palestinian property. City of the cyclists: These Israeli boys ride their bikes down an empty motorway in Tel Aviv . Police and Jewish Israeli officials were not available for comment during the Yom Kippur fast day and a local Muslim community leader in Jaffa quoted in the article did not reply when contacted. Jaffa is the ancient part of Tel Aviv which has a mixed Arab and Jewish population. On Monday, a mosque in a Bedouin village in northern Israel was set on fire and graffiti sprayed on its walls in an attack authorities have blamed on hard-line Jewish settlers. The torching drew broad condemnation from top Israeli leaders and President Shimon Peres and the country's chief rabbis also visited the scene to calm tensions. In 2005 a Jewish couple was charged for throwing a pig's head into a Tel Aviv mosque in an attempt to derail Israel's then pullout from the Gaza Strip which went ahead in August of that year. In 2008 riots erupted in the coastal city of Acre in northern Israel when Jews accosted an Arab man who drove his car into a predominantly Jewish neighborhood during Yom Kippur when all traffic halts and the country shuts down for 24 hours.

"The Whopper has some new competition in a vintage favorite. Four decades after it was discontinued, Burger King is bringing back their Yumbo sandwich with a marketing campaign full of 1970s nostalgia. The hot ham and cheese sandwich is back on the menu for a limited time starting Tuesday, and to mark the occasion, the chain has filled their Facebook with throwback posts to the disco era. Burger King first introduced the Yumbo to the menu in 1968, but it had a relatively short run and was eventually retired in 1974. Scroll down for video . Welcome back, Yumbo: Burger King is now offering the 'Yumbo' on their menu again, four decades after the hot ham and cheese sandwich was retired . However, Burger King regulars haven't forgot the cult classic. 'Our franchisees came to us after years of hearing requests' for the sandwich, Burger King's Chief Marketing Officer Eric Hirschorn told BurgerBusiness.com.  'There is a lot of nostalgia around the brand and these classic sandwiches, and we’re also excited to introduce it to new generations.' 'It got to the point where it’s one of those things we can no longer ignore,' he added to Bloomberg. The Yumbo is made with black forest ham and melted American cheese, with the addition of lettuce, mayo and a hoagie bun for it's latest reincarnation. It costs $3.69 and is also a new option on the 2 for $5 menu. Hirschorn says the Yumbo will only be back for a limited time, but wouldn't specify for how long it will be on offer at the chain's more than 7,000 North American restaurants. The Yumbo's return follows Burger King's successful reintroduction of chicken fries earlier this year. But Hirschorn insists the company is not focused on redesigning their menu around nostalgic items. Last month, the chain posted stronger than expected sales with a third-quarter gain of 3.6 per cent in the U.S. and Canada.

"Boris Johnson wants a personal drone to deliver his internet shopping from the sky at the touch of a button. The London Mayor said a surge in online shopping had triggered a sharp increase in the number of vans delivering 'dropping this stuff off'. Speaking on a trade visit to Singapore, Mr Johnson said he wanted to be able to use a mobile phone app to guide flying robots anywhere in the capital. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson is attending a FinTech event at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, where he appealed for technology to be used to deliver parcels . Web firm Amazon is developing drone technology to deliver its orders and has advertised for a flight operations engineer in Cambridge . It emerged this month that Amazon is to run trials on drones that will deliver parcels by air at a testing facility in Cambridge. The company is advertising for a flight operations engineer who will test how the drones would work and ensure they are safe. Amazon has refused to discuss its UK trials, however it is also running tests on Prime Air drones in the USA. Mr Johnson said he hoped the use of drones would help to alleviate the pressure on the roads caused by increasing numbers of delivery vans. New figures from the Office for National Statistics showed 20 per cent of business turnover in 2013 came from internet sales, up from 14 per cent in 2008. The total value of web sales but £557billion, up 66 per cent in six years. Mr Johnson urged London's financial technology sector - dubbed FinTech - to invent a solution to congestion caused by ever-growing numbers of parcel delivery vans. Mr Johnson tried out the future of online retailing during the event at the ArtScience Museum which allows a shopper to browse a store online by virtually walking down aisles and looking at products on the shelf . The London Mayor also took a ride on the Metro in Singapore, on his way to see the country's Prime Minister . He issued his challenge at a FinTech launch in Singapore during his six-day tour of the Far East. Mr Johnson said: 'We have a problem, folks - all this internet shopping is leading to a massive increase in white van traffic dropping this stuff off - 45% it's going to go up on London in the next seven years. 'That's going to be terrible for congestion in our city and doubtless the same will be true of Singapore as well. 'I look out at this brilliant audience here today, bulging with ideas, and I ask you possibly to solve it. 'We need a solution... Is it, as I hope, going to be drones? I want to be controlling an app that enables my shopping not only to be click and collect... I want my own personal drone to come and drop it wherever I choose.' Research commissioned by London and Partners ahead of the event showed more than half of senior executives believed London was the best global location for the first technology. FinTech companies work to make online transactions easier, faster and less expensive in financial services and other businesses. New figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal a sharp rise in the value of e-commerce sales . The Singapore event saw a launch for Startupbootcamp, a London 'accelerator' which offers mentoring and advice to new companies. The Asia accelerator is aimed at building links between London and Singapore. Nektarios Liolios, the firm's managing director, said: 'Over the last 12 months the Startupbootcamp team has visited south east Asia on several occasions. 'We have been impressed by the quality and innovation levels of the start-ups we have encountered. 'Singapore, with its concentration of investors, financial institutions and mentors ... makes an ideal innovation hub.' As well as a speech at the FinTech event, Mr Johnson saw a demonstration of innovative apps, including Vieweet which allows a shopper to browse a store online by virtually walking down aisles and looking at products on the shelf. The mayor told the audience it offered a solution to his family buying the same food every time it shops - leading to a surplus of value chickpeas. Vieweet co-founder Domenic Versace said: 'Online shopping is largely about picking things off a list. 'It doesn't really engage the consumer in the same way as actually being in a shop. What we're trying to do is bridge that gap. 'Our technology was originally conceived as a tool for the real estate industry but we're demonstrating, with Tesco labs, that it has potential to revolutionise ecommerce too.'","London Mayor blames popularity of online sales for surge in delivery vans .

"Tracy Morgan was seen weak and limping as he headed into a New Jersey post office with his fiancee Megan Wollover on Wednesday afternoon, just the third time the actor has been seen in public since he was involved in a horrifying car accident this past June. The actor was leaning on a walker as he slowly moved down the sidewalk and said he was still 'fighting every day' after being involved the crash, which claimed the life of his friend James McNair and injured three others. Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as a broken leg, a broken nose and broken ribs in the accident. Scroll down for videos . Recovering: Tracy Morgan was seen in public for just the third time since being involved in a fatal car crash this past June . Helping hands: The comedian was joined by his fiancee Megan Wollover (above) and as aide as he headed into a New Jersey post office . Heartbreaking: The usually gregarious Morgan was quiet and appeared weak as he slowly moved with his walker . Now, his attorney has revealed Morgan is still struggling to simply return 'to the way he was' after this trauma. On Wednesday, Morgan appeared a far cry from the extroverted and gregarious characters he has played on film and television, and was barely audible as he spoke to a nearby photographer. At one point as he returned to his car from the post office, the actor even had to briefly stop and catch his breath before moving on. In addition to his fiancee he was also accompanied by an aide who was there to help him get into the car. Fighting: Morgan revealed he is still 'fighting every day' to recover following the crash that claimed the life of his friend, James McNair . Injuries: In addition to broken bones and ribs, the actor also suffered a traumatic brain injury . Morgan was critically injured in early June when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer rammed into a limousine bus he and his friends were travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike. The comedian, known for his roles on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock, was returning home to New York City from a show at a Delaware casino. He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown. 'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last month. 'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.' The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted back in October being pushed in a wheelchair. Baby girl: Morgan and Wollover have a daughter, Maven, who is 17 months old . The driver of the tractor-trailer, Kevin Roper, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in a New Jersey state court. Earlier this week, Morgan and his attorneys accused Wal-Mart of stalling in a federal lawsuit that have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash.

"Families SA considered the parenting skills of Chloe Valentine's drug-using teenage mother to be 'good enough' despite evidence of neglect, an inquest has heard. Chloe was four years old when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 after being forced to ride a motorbike and repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard. An inquest into the girl's death has heard her short life was marred by horrific squalor and chronic neglect but she was never removed from her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Scroll down for video . Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 . Social worker Leanne Stewart told the inquest on Wednesday she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. Chloe's teenage mother allowed the 18-month-old to be supervised by other teenagers for extended periods, despite being warned by Ms Stewart that this was not acceptable. Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother. But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships. An inquest into Chloe's death heard that social workers knew that her mother, drug user Ashley Polkinghorne, was neglecting her daughter from 18-months-old . Chloe died at the hands of her parents after she was repeatedly forced to crash a  motorbike over a three-day period . Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' and found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her often rubbish-strewn house, Ms Stewart said. Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned why Ms Stewart was excusing Polkinghorne's behaviour, saying her obligation was to protect infant Chloe. 'She was a teenager with a baby,' Ms Kereru said. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months . Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . 'You're there to protect the baby, not make excuses for the mother, aren't you?' 'That's what you just did.' Ms Stewart denied that she was reluctant to act on the child abuse allegations, saying it took time for parents such as Polkinghorne to make sustained changes. Polkinghorne, now 22, and a later partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest continues.","Chloe Valentine  died at the hands of her neglectful mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner Benjamin McPartland in 2012 .

"Microsoft is developing a fitness band aimed at computer game fans, it has been revealed. One of the firm's suppliers says a band linked to the firm's hugely successful Xbox One console is set for release next year. It will be linked to games on the console, and is also expected to make use of the Kinect sensors the console has to track players. Scroll down for video . Late on the bandwagon? Microsoft has launched a device called 'Microsoft Band' (pictured) that will allow users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime. now it is believed to be working on an Xbox version. Speaking to PCR Joe Officer, head of attach at Exertis - an Xbox One supplier - said: 'The wearable market is always growing and we can expect to see Microsoft rolling out a spate of devices next year in this space,' according to PCR. 'These will be linked to the Xbox One which has loads of health and fitness apps already in it - add that to real time heart rate monitors, health bands, scales and video sensors and users will have day in, day out, real time monitoring of themselves.' The Xbox One already offers fitness games for users that can track their movements in real time. Fitbit and rival exercise bands have been around for a few years, but the world's largest . software company's has only now made its debut into the wearable technology market, launching an exercise band, smartwatch hybrid. Microsoft has revealed its device, called 'Microsoft Band,' which will allow users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime, as well as check their texts and emails. The wrist-worn device has 10 smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, . measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said in . a blog post. It also offers guided workouts, which are drills designed to meet a user's needs and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have run or cycled. The Kinect sensor for the Xbox can already track a  user's movements as they work out in front of the camera . 'Microsoft Band makes it easier to reach your fitness goals. You can track your daily physical activity and review your stats with a glance at your wrist,' the Redmond, Washington-based company writes on its website. 'Just like a personal trainer, Microsoft Band guides you to improved wellness by constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and your future needs.' Unlike the forthcoming Apple Watch, people won't be able to make phone calls from the device, but like other smartwatches, such as the Motorola 360, they will be able to read texts, emails, social media updates and other notifications. 'It also helps you be more productive with email previews and calendar alerts - right on your wrist,' the company,' Microsoft said. Users will be able to talk to their device using the Cortana personal assistant, which is similar to Apple's Siri. Using Windows 8.1, users can ask Cortana to take notes or set reminders. 'She'll give you driving directions and keep you on top of traffic spots, weather and more,' according to Microsoft. The wrist-worn device (pictured left) has sensors that monitor pulse rate,measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said. It works alongside a health app called 'Microsoft Health' (shown on various devices) that includes a cloud service for users to store and combine health and fitness data . Fitness functions: The band is primarily a fitness band. It features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, measure calorie burn and track sleep quality. The device also offers workouts put together by Men's Health, for example, and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled. Smartwatch features: The device doesn't allow people to make calls directly, but does push notifications about calls, texts and emails from a user's smartphone to their Microsoft Band. It has Microsoft's Cortana personal assistant built-in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders, for example. Appearance: The band is primarily made of rubber and features a sleek colour touchscreen. Users can change the background screen's colour and design. Sensors: It has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to UV, prompting wearers to apply sunscreen. Price: $199. Availability: US only from today. UK prices and availability haven't been announced yet. Microsoft Band has a rubber strap and colour touch screen with a customisable background. It also has a UV sensor that tells wearers when to apply sunscreen. The device is designed to work alongside iPhone, Android and Windows Phone handsets, and will be available in the United . States from today for $199. UK availability and pricing has yet to be announced. It will compete with the highly anticipated Apple Watch, which was unveiled  on September 9 and is set to go on sale in early 2015 for $349. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics is already selling its Galaxy Gear smart watch and Motorola and LG also have versions on the market. Microsoft also launched a health app called 'Microsoft . Health' that includes a cloud service for users to store and . combine health and fitness data. The  app will collect data from the fitness . band and will work on iPhones and Android smartphones, as well . as the Windows Phone. Microsoft Health will unite data from different health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper, in a single location. Data from different devices and services, such as steps, calories and heart rate will be combined, enabling an 'Intelligence Engine' to say which exercises were most effective during a workout and suggest a recommended recovery time. Over time, data can be combined with a calendar, enabling the Intelligence Machine to get smarter and offer suggestions for workouts that fit with a user's schedule, Microsoft said. As well as being a fitness tracker, the band enables wearers to see their emails, calender, texts, social media updates and other push notifications on their wrist. The device will be available in the US in limited quantities from today for $199 . Microsoft Band contains built-in GPS and 24-hour heart rate monitoring, which the company says is to help wearers reach their fitness goals. 'By combining the power of each of our sensors, Microsoft Band is able to give you real-time insights into your performance today and your milestones into the future,' the company says . Ben Wood Chief of Research CCS Insight said Microsoft's move to launch a health-tracking wearable isn't surprising and puts it in direct competition with Apple's iHealth and Google Fit as well as the plethora of proprietary health platforms from companies such as FitBit, Jawbone and Withings. 'Consumers now have an overwhelming choice of health-related cloud platforms to choose from...It's going to be a tough decision to choose whether to place their loyalty with Apple, Google or Microsoft given the immaturity of all three platforms. 'The Microsoft Band enters a highly competitive market where the company has little or no brand. At $200 Microsoft is targeting the higher tiers of the fitness band market – its going to have make a big marketing investment to raise awareness with US consumers. 'There are already numerous other products with heart rate sensors that track fitness and sleep including the new product Fitbit announced earlier this week. 'It's interesting that Microsoft is clearly positioning its product as a fitness band rather than a smart watch given it has many of the features several smart watches already support. It is banking on the fact that consumers don't want to replace their watches and that this will be what it calls the 'band for the other hand''. Fitbit has revealed a trio of new trackers this week - including a $250 smartwatch, which it hopes can take on the Apple Watch. Called Surge, the watch has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality. The firm has also added a heart rate monitor to its traditional tracing wristband, now called the chargeHR. Fitbit's new range includes the $129 Fitbit charge, the $149 chargeHR while also has a heart rate sensors, and the $249 Surge which has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality. Fitbit's new range: The $129 Fitbit charge, the $149 chargeHR (pictured) have a heart rate sensors, and the $249 Surge comes with GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality . 'Continuing our mission to inspire people to lead healthier, more active lives, we're releasing these three new innovative devices to help reach everyday, active or performance health and fitness goals,' the San Francisco firm says. The Surge watch will put the firm on a collision course with Apple - and now Microsoft. 'Surge is Fitbit's most advanced tracker to date: a sleek 'Fitness Super Watch,' designed for those looking for peak performance,' the firm said. 'Featuring 8-sensor technology that combines all-day fitness tracking with GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality. 'Surge is ideal for users committed to training, dedicated to health and consistently looking to improve progress.'","Firm developing a version of its $199 band for Xbox One owners .

"Tornado crews flying over  Iraq say their mission is 'personal' as they seek 'some sort of justice' for murdered RAF engineer David Haines. The 44-year-old British aid worker, who served with the force for 12 years, was beheaded by ISIS militants in a shocking propaganda video after being taken hostage in Syria. Now servicemen and women based in RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus - who have so far not unleashed firepower on any suitable targets in nothern Iraq - say they want to stop other captives suffering the same fate as their former colleague. British hostages Alan Henning and John Cantlie are still being held under threat of execution by the same fighters. Scroll down for video . David Haines, 44, a former RAF engineer, pictured, was murdered by ISIS militants in a horrific video after being taken hostage in Syria . Servicemen and women based in RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus say they want to stop other captives suffering the same fate as their former colleague . An RAF source told The Telegraph: 'Any human being would be horrified by what Isil is doing to British hostages and that applies as much to the RAF as to anyone. 'Add to that, one of their victims was a former RAF serviceman, and it definitely feels a bit personal for all of us here. 'It's not about revenge but perhaps some sort of justice – and certainly the hope that we can stop more people suffering the way David and other captives have.' Their comments came as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons. Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres. But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic State. On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets - which they failed to find and bomb, again . Military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria. A female fighter pilot led Britain's first combat mission against Islamic State. The woman, who has not been named, flew one of the RAF Tornados on the perilous sortie over jihadist-held territory in northern Iraq on Saturday. Stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, she is believed to be a weapons systems operator. She sits in the jet's rear seat and fires the aircraft's Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles and Paveway IV bombs. The airwoman, who serves with II (AC) Squadron, flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues. A Ministry of Defence source said: 'No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.' The involvement of a woman RAF pilot comes amid reports that the family of Major Mariam Al Mansouri of the United Arab Emirates, who flew an F-16 jet in bombing raids against positions in Syria last week, has disowned her. While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had – like on Saturday – failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre. The mobile refineries generate up to £1.2million a day for the militants. On Friday, David Cameron won Parliament's backing for air attacks against fanatics in Iraq but, crucially, he stopped short of seeking permission to allow UK jets to bomb targets in Syria, where IS has its stronghold. By contrast, the US and Arab nations – including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan – have sent their jets to bombard IS positions around the city of Raqqa, in northern Syria, where it is believed British hostages Alan Henning and John Cantlie are being held under threat of execution. Lord Richards, who retired as head of the Armed Forces last year, was among a number of senior military figures who warned that the extremists could not be defeated by air attacks alone. He said Western governments had blundered by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and suggested a military campaign on the scale of the attacks that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 was needed to crush IS. Then, a force of 380,000 troops – including 45,000 British service personnel – invaded Iraq. Lord Richards said: 'How the hell can you win the war when most of your enemy can end up in a country you can't get involved in?' He said Iraqi and Kurdish forces should be trained and armed to fight a ground war against the militants. But if they fail, the West should be prepared to send in troops. 'Ultimately, you need a land army to achieve the objectives we've set – all air will do is destroy elements of IS,' said Lord Richards. 'The only way to defeat IS is to take back land they are occupying, which means a conventional military operation.' Major General Julian Thompson, a former commander in the Royal Marines who recaptured the Falklands, agreed that an air campaign by itself would not be enough. Stand ready: A British tornado fighter jet crew member stands on his Tornado jet at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus . Armed: A Tornado at RAF Akrotiri is loaded with a laser-guided bomb . 'I think we should have forward air controllers to ensure that targeting is done properly.' Lord Dannatt, a former Chief of the General Staff, said: 'Attacking Isil from the air solely above Iraq is dealing with half a problem, not all of it. The US has correctly concluded that carrying the fight against Isil into Syrian airspace is right – we may yet come to the same conclusion.' Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned that the RAF's mission – codenamed Operation Shader – could last years. 'This is not a weekend campaign,' he said. 'This is going to take a long time.' Britain has deployed six two-seater Tornados, a refuelling aircraft and a spy plane from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. Airmen spoke yesterday of their mission against IS feeling 'personal' following the beheading of former RAF serviceman David Haines. One ground crew member, who declined to be named amid security concerns, said: 'Any human being would be horrified by what IS is doing to British hostages. Add to that one of their victims was a former RAF serviceman and it definitely feels a bit personal for all of us here. It's not about revenge, but perhaps some sort of justice.'","Source said RAF crews in Cyprus hope to stop any more captives suffering .

He was found by his butler dressed only in a T-shirt and shorts, in his bedroom at 9am on Tuesday. Bullet cartridges were found next to . Mr Dray, with detectives saying they were fired from a pistol which was . around 15 years old. No weapon was found. Claude Dray (left) with his wife Simone and Francisco Salgueiro at a reception  in Miami Beach in 2008. Mr Dray has been found shot dead in his Paris mansion . There were no signs of a struggle and . nothing was stolen from the palatial 'Villa Madrid’, which is considered to be one of the most secure houses the French capital. Police said it had the hallmarks of a ‘professional hit.' ‘Somebody got in and fired three . bullets into the victim's neck,’ said one detective at the scene, adding . that a silencer had likely been used as domestic staff heard nothing. His wife, Simone, was in the US, where four years ago her husband bought the famous National Hotel in South Beach, Miami. Mr Dray, one of the most prominent . Jews in France, also owned the Hotel de Paris in St Tropez, one of the . most popular celebrity institutions on the French Riviera, as well as a . string of other hotels around the world.

Mr Dray had been the subject of threats . in the past, and his home, which was equipped with anti-intruder . measures including cameras and infra-red alarms, was regularly . surrounded by police and private security guards.

Mr Sarkozy has lived in Neuilly for most of his life. He still owns flats there, but now divides his time between his quarters at the Elysee Palace and a town house belonging to his third wife, the Italian heiress Carla Bruni.

"Had he stayed in Russia, Andrew Mironov would be settling in to a stable job with an oil company, likely with a newly awarded doctoral degree in electrical engineering. Instead, he faces an uncertain future in New York City as one of scores of Russian gays seeking asylum in the United States because of hostility and harassment in their homeland. 'In Russia, I would have gotten my Ph.D. this fall, had a job and health insurance,' said Mironov, 25. 'Now, here, I'm nobody.' Seeking equality: In addition to Andrew Mironov, Russian gays such as Andrew Nasonov, right, and Igor Bazilevsky,left,  pictured on their wedding day, are seeking asylum in the US . Yet the sacrifices have been worth it, Mironov says, given the fears that lingered after he was severely beaten by several assailants in the lobby of a gay bar in his home city of Samara. 'Which is more important, happiness or success?' he asked over coffee in midtown Manhattan. 'I would say happiness. I feel no fear here.' There are no firm statistics on the number of gay Russian asylum seekers; U.S. government agencies that handle applications do not report such details. However, the Department of Homeland Security's latest figures show that overall applications for asylum by Russians totaled 969 in the 2014 fiscal year, up 34 percent from 2012. The increase is due in part to the worsening anti-gay climate in Russia, according to Immigration Equality, a New York-based organization which provides legal services for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender immigrants. The organization says the number of inquiries it received from gay Russians seeking U.S. asylum has risen from 68 in 2012 to 127 in 2013 and 161 through Oct. 30 of this year. During that period, gay-rights gatherings in Russia were frequently targeted by assailants, and the parliament passed a law targeting 'gay propaganda' that was widely viewed as a means of deterring gay activism. Said Mironov of that law, 'It helped homophobic people feel the government is on their side.' To get an application approved, an asylum seeker must present a convincing case that he or she has a 'well-founded fear of persecution' in their home country. Russia's anti-gay policies and its record of anti-gay violence are factors that could strengthen an individual's case. Wanted more: The couple came to the United States from Russia in July, and are preparing to file an application seeking asylum in the U.S. Aaron Morris, Immigration Equality's legal director, said most of the recent asylum inquiries came from gay men in their 20s and 30s who had been targeted by anti-gay attacks, while only a handful have come from gays or lesbians raising children. 'If you have kids, it can be really hard to leave everything behind,' Morris said. In several U.S. cities, programs have been launched to assist gay asylum seekers from Russia and elsewhere as they await processing of their applications, which can take six months or more. For the first five months, the asylum seekers are barred from taking paying jobs, so they often struggle to support themselves, even with resumes illustrating professional success in Russia. In Washington, D.C., housing is among the major challenges, according to Matthew Corso, who has helped the DC Center for the LGBT Community create a program to assist people who are seeking asylum. 'We have no trouble finding them legal representation, but trying to find someone willing to give part of their home or money for food or transportation is not easy,' Corso said. Another group aiding gay Russian asylum-seekers in the Washington area is the Spectrum Human Rights Alliance, founded in 2011 by Russian immigrant Larry Poltavtsev. Gender equality: The legality of gay marriage and a more accepting culture are pushing gay Russians to move to the U.S. for asylum . Poltavtsev, who studied chemistry at the University of North Carolina in the 1990s, is frustrated by the rules that bar asylum-seekers from working. ""It makes no sense because most of our arrivals have advanced degrees and speak good English,"" he said. ""They're capable of being productive, paying taxes, but we are not letting them do those things while they're waiting."" Soon to join the queue of applicants are Andrew Nasonov and Igor Bazilevsky, longtime partners from the Russian city of Voronezh who wearied of threats, harassment and beatings and came to the United States in July. They're now assembling the paperwork for their case and getting Russian documents translated into English. 'Of course we are worried, but we hope for the best,' Nasonov said. Nasonov, 25, was a journalist and human-rights activist in Russia; Bazilevsky, 32, was a graphic designer. They hope to pursue those careers in the U.S. if their asylum applications are approved. Meanwhile, they've been provided with lodging by a gay couple in a Washington suburb and took a step in October that would have been impossible in Russia - they got married. 'We were finally able to say that we are a real family - there are not enough words to describe how wonderful these feelings are,' Nasonov wrote in an email. 'But of course, we are still faced with a lot of difficulties,' he added. 'It was hard to leave our relatives, friends, and parents behind in Russia. ... We have nothing here, and in many ways are completely dependent on the assistance of the people who surround us.' Rise in attacks: Russia, led by controversial politician Vladimir Putin, has seen a rise in anti-gay attacks . In New York City, many asylum seekers have received advice and support from Masha Gessen, a Moscow-born journalist and activist whose family moved to the U.S. in 1981 and who holds U.S. and Russian citizenship. She said her family, as Soviet Jews, had group refugee status, allowing for an immigration process far easier than that faced by today's asylum seekers who must prove their individual case. 'There's no worse way to immigrate to the U.S. than the way these people are doing it,' Gessen said. 'You have nothing, and you have no right to work or public assistance. We've seen people end up on the streets.' She and her allies have lobbied the State Department to extend refugee status to LGBT people from Russia, but thus far to no avail. So for now, asylum seekers arrive unsure of their long-term prospects. 'After your tourist visa runs out, you're basically undocumented,' Gessen said. 'It can be hard to rent an apartment or get a cellphone. You have problems navigating everyday life.' The United States is among several countries favored as havens by LGBT Russians who emigrate from there. Canada, Finland and Israel are among the others. Gessen said the U.S. is more receptive than many Western European countries, and Aaron Morris, the Immigration Equality lawyer, said his legal team had been able to win approval for most of the Russian asylum cases that it has handled. Morris commended the Department of Homeland Security for asking Immigration Equality to train its asylum officers on distinctive aspects of LGBT asylum cases. 'They understand our community is a little different,' Morris said. Acceptance: 'Americans don't care if you're gay, but the Russians here, they still have a problem with it,' said Andrew Mironov (not pictured) Among the many pending cases is Andrew Mironov's asylum application, buttressed by photographs showing the injuries he sustained in Russia that required a hospital stay. He's not sure when he'll be called for an in-person interview but says his lawyer believes the case is a strong one. Mironov has been in the U.S. since November 2013, spending his first night in a homeless shelter run by the Metropolitan Community Church of New York. He now lives in Brooklyn but continues to attend the church, which serves the LGBT community. The past 12 months have been challenging. One obstacle, he said, is a chilly reception from many non-gay Russian immigrants in New York. 'Americans don't care if you're gay, but the Russians here, they still have a problem with it,' he said. Mironov worked for several months as a bartender at a restaurant in Manhattan but said his manager often mistreated him, calculating that he wouldn't complain because of his uncertain legal status. Now he's trying to establish a photography business, called Strekoza - Russian for 'dragonfly.' 'It's hard to not be sure about your future,' he said. 'In Russia, I'd planned my whole life out.'","Russians seeking U.S. asylum has risen from 68 in 2012 to 127 in 2013 and 161 through Oct. 30 of this year according to group Immigration Equality .

"A senior Conservative MP has been slammed for spending  £2,270 of taxpayers' money on black dresses for work. Eleanor Laing bought two frocks and a jacket for her role as deputy House of Commons speaker, filling in for John Bercow when he is not in the Chamber chairing MPs' debates. Other senior politicians, including the Prime Minister David Cameron have to buy their own clothes for work. Deputy House of Commons speaker Eleanor Laing has been criticised for spending more than £2,000 on two dresses for her role in Parliament . But Ms Laing, whose salary is £103,420, charged the cost of her outfits to the taxpayer, according to the Sun newspaper. Her bill was nearly double that spent on two ornate costumes for the Associate Serjeant-at-Arms, which cost £1,282.50. Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said people would be 'shocked' by the extortionate cost. He said: 'Few begrudge costumes but it is unreasonable for the public to pay for clothes that can be worn outside the Commons.' But a Commons spokesman defended the expenditure. He said: 'The items for the Deputy Speaker are expected to last for a number of years.' Ms Laing paid back £25,000 in the expenses scandal after anger that she sold her state-funded second home for a £1million profit without paying capital gains tax. She was elected as one of the three deputy Commons Speakers in October last year. The Conservative MP for Epping Forest beat six other challengers for the right to fill in for Speaker John Bercow in his absence. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow wears a suit and tie instead of traditional dress in his role chairing MPs' debates . There had been a vacancy on Mr Bercow's team since Nigel Evans stood down to fight sex offence charges for which he was later cleared. The deputy Speaker's position carries a salary premium of £36,360 in addition to the standard MPs' salary. Ahead of the election, Ms Laing had said: 'I'm passionate about freedom through democracy, about the dignity of the House of Commons, and about its vital, essential role as a forum for national debate. 'I would like to be part of the Speaker's team, not just to keep order in the chamber but to stand up for the rights of the backbenches... against overbearing governments.'","Eleanor Laing bought two frocks and a jacket as deputy  Commons speaker .

"A British ISIS fighter has blown himself up in a car on a suicide mission in Iraq using 1800kg of explosives to kill a number of the country's security force soldiers. Abu Hajar al-Britani reportedly carried out the attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji today and ISIS claims the Brit also destroyed a significant number of tanks and artillery equipment. A photo was released by ISIS' media branch for the province of Salahuddin, showing Abu Hajar al-Britani in full military uniform. Blew himself up: Abu Hajar al-Britani reportedly carried out the suicide mission in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji, northern Iraq, today . His face is covered with a black balaclava and his gloved left hand is raised, with his index finger extended to the sky to signify his belief in Allah being the one true God. In his right hand, Abu Hajar carries a machine gun, its wooden barrel appearing polished in the photo. A gold decorated copy of the Qu'ran can be seen tucked into the pocket of his rucksack strap - the holy book is positioned right next to his heart. There have been no further details released about the real identity of the deceased British fighter. Second attack: Today's suicide mission is the second carried out by a British militant in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji (pictured) this month . Abu Hajar is the second British ISIS extremist to blow himself up in a suicide bomb mission in Baiji. Earlier this month, it was announced that Kabir Ahmed had  carried out a suicide bombing mission for ISIS - killing eight Iraqi police officers. Known as Abu Sumayah al-Britani, the 32-year-old from Derby was a father of-two who had previously told BBC Newsnight that he was desperate to join the 'waiting list' to become a suicide bomber. Ahmed had been jailed in the UK for gay hate crimes after handing out leaflets calling for the execution of homosexuals. Abdul Waheed Majid, aka the 'Crawley bomber', was the first British fighter to carry out a suicide operation in Syria. Brit suicide bombers: Abdul Waheed Majid (left), aka the 'Crawley bomber', was the first Brit to carry out a suicide operation in Syria, while Abu Hajar killed eight Iraqi policemen in a suicide mission this month . Known as Suleiman al-Britani, the 41-year-old was seen calmly chatting to several fighters before his death in a video released by the Al-Qaeda affiliated group, Jabhat an-Nusra. The video showed Majid wearing a white robe with a black headband, inscribed with the motto of Jabhat an-Nusra. He admits he cannot even speak Arabic but seems calm prior to carrying out the suicide mission. It goes on to show Majid climbing into a heavily armoured lorry, packed with explosives. The father-of-three is later filmed driving the lorry into the gates of Aleppo jail, detonating the vehicle on impact. According to the international Centre for the study of Radicalisation and Conflict Violence, Abu Hajar, who carried out today's attack, is the 29th British fighter to die fighting in Syria and Iraq. Strategic: The town of Baiji, located around 110 miles north of Baghdad, is home to Iraq's largest oil refinery .","Abu Hajar al-Britani used 1800kg of explosives to blow himself up in car .

"New Orleans police say a drag queen is now behind bars for allegedly causing the death of a man by injecting him with consumer grade silicone to help him look more like a woman. Armani Nicole Davenport, 33, whose birth name is Larry T. Bernard, allegedly injected silicone into the buttocks and hips of Breneisha Hall, 25, born Brad Hall, leading to the woman's death. Armani Nicole Davenport, 33, whose birth name is Larry T. Bernard, turned herself in at NOPD headquarters. The procedure took place on October 24 at a house in the 1200 block of Salcedo Street. Behind bars: Armani Nicole Davenport, 33, pictured, whose birth name is Larry T.

Pageant queen: Police said Davenport, pictured in costume,'travels the southeast gay pageantry circuit and has won several titles and is also practicing medical procedures without proper credentials' Following the injection, Hall began having trouble breathing, and was rushed to Interim LSU Hospital. She fell into a coma and died two months later on January 1. It is the first case of its kind in New Orleans, although deaths caused by illegal injections have been reported in several states across the country. NOPD homicide detectives last week looked for Davenport at her Baton Rouge home, but could not find her. Police said in a statement that Davenport, 'travels the southeast gay pageantry circuit and has won several titles and is also practicing medical procedures without proper credentials.' Homicide detectives secured an arrest warrant for Davenport on one count of negligent homicide. She was jailed in November with negligent injuring, a misdemeanor, and released. But . her charge was upgraded after the Orleans Parish coroner's office ruled . Hall's death a homicide two weeks ago, after it was initially ruled to . have resulted from natural causes. Victim: Brenisha Hall, pictured left and right, a 25-year-old from New Orleans, died on New Year's Day after the illegal silicone injection . 'It's a foreign body, and it was injected into her body,' John Gagliano, the coroner's chief investigator, said at the time. 'You can't just walk around and give anyone an injection.' Hall's death initially was ruled to have resulted from natural causes by doctors at Interim LSU Hospital, who performed an autopsy. Crisis of conscience? : Davenport (seen here in both pics) turned herself into police in New Orleans on Monday . Gagliano said that the coroner's office reversed the initial findings after reviewing thousands of pages of medical records, re-examining the results of the initial autopsy conducted by doctors at University Hospital, and performing further examinations. She was buried on January 11. There have been other reports across the country of men getting illegal injections of silicone from hardware stores to enlarge their breasts and other body parts as they attempt to appear more like a woman.","New Orleans woman Armani Nicole Davenport, 33, allegedly injected silicone into the body of Breneisha Hall, 25, leading to the woman's death .

"A 35-year-old father who died of an aggressive brain tumor handled his death with humor - by comparing his battle with the disease to a living a double-life as Spider-Man. Aaron Purmort, from Minneapolis, was diagnosed with a glioblastoma in 2011, and died this week - but not before writing his own obituary along with his wife, Nora. The piece, published Sunday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, phrased his life in terms of Peter Parker's famous alter-ego, with cancer as the villain he tried to defeat. 'Spider-Man': Aaron Purmont's obituary, published Sunday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, compares him to a superhero who fought cancer . Documented: Nora Purmont, above with Aaron, wrote a blog detailing her husband's struggle with the disease . It described his death as the result of 'complications from a radioactive spider bite that led to years of crime-fighting and a years long battle with a nefarious criminal named Cancer, who has plagued our society for far too long.' 'Civilians will recognize him best as Spider-Man, and thank him for his many years of service protecting our city. Together: Nora and Aaron, who is holding Ralph, are pictured above dancing at a friend's wedding . 'His family knew him only as a kind and mild-mannered Art Director, a designer of websites and t-shirts, and concert posters who always had the right cardigan and the right thing to say (even if it was wildly inappropriate).' The piece then goes on to describe his career, his childhood and his family, including his son, Ralph, who is almost two. The obituary says he will grow up to 'avenge' him, and Ralph now associates his father with the superhero. Speaking to MailOnline about the obituary, Nora said: 'Living with cancer is no battle - you show up and hope you don't die is the battle. 'What sets Aaron apart is not just the obituary but literally the entire way he lived his life. He had this unbridled joy about him. 'We spent so much time in hospital, where mostly other people are in terrible moods and feel sorry for themselves, and Aaron didn't feel spend one second of his entire 35 years on earth feeling sorry for himself. 'When we were writing this we were laughing so hard, we had to take some parts out... We had so much fun these past three years. 'A lot of the stuff we went through was pretty terrible but it didn't feel as bad as it looked'. Nora said Ralph, who will have his second birthday in January, now associates her father with Spider-Man, a comic-book figure his father loved well into adulthood. She said: 'The night that we told our family Aaron was going into the hospice, Ralph walked over, crawled between us, hugged Aaron and just kept saying 'I love you, Papa. I love you, Papa''. 'I don't know what he knows - but I think he knows enough. Yesterday was the first time he asked me 'Where's Papa?' Together: Nora said that the optimism with which Aaron lived his life is in keeping with the style of the obituary . 'I said 'He's in your heart now, and he's in my heart. You won't see him with your eyes any more put you can feel him here. He just kept patting his heart and said 'OK!'' 'And when he sees Spider-Man he says 'Papa!' - which is all Aaron ever wanted'. During the progress of Aaron's disease, Nora, whom he married after the diagnosis, kept track of their life together on her blog. In a post describing his last moments, she wrote: 'It ended today at 2:43pm, in the middle of a run-on sentence, my head on his heart and my arms around him in a hospital bed built for one, but perfect for the two of us.' Family: The obituary mentioned that the couple's son, Ralph (center), will 'avenge' his father . 'One quiet second': Nora Purmont movingly described her husband's last moments in a recent post - before revealing how the two co-wrote his obituary . 'He breathed out, and I readied for the sharp inhale that would follow 8-10 seconds later, rattling through his body. It never came. 'That's how it ends. One quiet second.' After the obituary was published today, she described how the two of them had agreed the text of the obituary towards the end of his life. She said: 'Before [he] died, we had time to sit down and write his obituary. I've never laughed and cried more in one sitting, but I'm so glad we got to do this. I love this man so damn much.' The family has also started a crowdfunding page to raise money to support the family in the future.","Aaron Purmort, 35, was diagnosed in 2011 and died this week .

"Gable Tostee - the man who is accused of murdering New Zealand woman Warriena Wright - claims he was 'distressed' during his time behind bars in a Queensland prison. In newly released documents, Tostee said he also held concerns over other prisoners gaining access to his cell. The 28-year-old was granted bail last month under strict conditions, including not drinking alcohol and is required to live with his parents. Scroll down for video . Gable Tostee is accused of murdering New Zealand bank clerk Warriena Wright (above) in August . The Gold Coast tradesman wrote in an affidavit he was 'struggling' while he was in custody at Wacol's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre - in Brisbane's west,The Courier Mail reported. Tostee has social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder which he said was getting worse because of his time in prison. 'I accept that the stress of my situation will exacerbate my symptoms but I am very concerned that as the months pass by, I am becoming more and more distressed and unwell. My memory, concentration and ability to prepare my defence are all deteriorating over time,' he wrote. Tostee is accused of being responsible for Ms Wright falling off the 14th floor of an apartment building in Surfers Paradise in August after meeting her on dating app Tinder. Accused Gable Tostee (left) walked free last month from Queensland's Arthur Gorrie prison after he was granted bail . In his affidavit, the carpet-layer also told of his strange encounter with a fellow prisoner, who claimed to be a family friend, sneaking his way into his cell. The accused killer was in protective custody. 'On 9 October 2014 a man gained access to my cell area and told me that he was a ""family friend"" and had ""sorted out special privileges for [me] with the screws [prison guards]"",' Tostee wrote. 'This man seemed to have bypassed officers... in getting access to my area despite my telling the officers that I did not want to see him and did not know him.' Tostee has been in jail since he was charged with Ms Wright's murder. She was killed after falling 14 storeys from a Surfers Paradise apartment building . This comes after another of Tostee's desperate attempts to get out of jail was revealed. In a handwritten note to police, Tostee apologised for drink driving and admits to 'drowning myself with alcohol'. The one page letter, obtained by Daily Mail Australia, was penned at Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in a scrappy style with occasional spelling errors and includes an admission by Tostee that 'I have a problem with binge drinking' and that he has put people's lives at risk. Written on November 11, exactly a week before he was granted bail on strict conditions, Tostee's note specifically apologises for drinking in the early hours of July 27. Less than two weeks before the 28-year-old allegedly murdered Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor balcony, police detected Tostee at 3am  on the highway across the NSW border. The note Tostee penned to help secure his release from prison, apologising for drinking in the early hours of July 27 - weeks before Ms Wright died . He was 'travelling at high speed' and when eventually he was stopped, in Queensland, was charged with high range drink driving in an incident Tostee describes in his handwritten note as 'immature and dangerous'. 'I am completely ashamed of myself,' he wrote, 'I ... put the lives of my friends, other road users and yourselves as officers at risk. 'I have disappointed myself and my family who have done their best to raise and support me. Since then I have finally come to accept that I have a problem with binge drinking and I am taking measures ... to deal with my issues in ways that do not involved drowning myself with alcohol. 'My foolish and immature attitude has cost me ... being stopped that night was the wake-up call I needed and I am thankful that it happened before something potentially much worse happened.' In his latest affidavit, Tostee said he was 'struggling' while behind bars and also told of a strange encounter with a fellow prisoner . Twelve days later, following an alleged drinking session at his Surfers Paradise apartment, Ms Wright - a 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk - died at 2.20am. The note was among several court documents filed by Tostee's lawyers to gain freedom on bail while he awaits his murder trial, which is unlikely to proceed before late 2016 to early 2017. In an affidavit  filed by Tostee in the Queensland Supreme Court, he recalled 'being in a state of panic' during the July police pursuit and that 'I 100% accept I screwed up' and had been 'so reckless'. He also claimed he was 'wittier' when drinking alcohol and admits he has been a 'danger to the public' while binge drinking since the age of 17. Tostee left prison on a $200,000 surety put up by his parents on November 18, three months after he was arrested for Ms Wright's alleged murder. Other bail conditions include not using the mobile dating app Tinder, and other social media sites including Facebook. The US administrators of Tinder are being pushed by Australian authorities to aid their search for more than 50 women from Australia and overseas who were allegedly contacted by Mr Tostee via the app. Bail documents indicate that investigators are pursuing statements from the women and have requested data from both Mr Tostee and Ms Wright's Tinder accounts, reported The Australian. Recordings made by Tostee on the night he met Ms Wright are being used by police prosecutors and  to build a case against the 28-year-old. Tostee is accused of pushing Ms Wright off his Avalon Apartments balcony in August . He must live with his parents, Gary and Helene, in Carrara while on bail, not drink alcohol, not use dating app Tinder but wants to 'go out' and have his curfew eased tom 10pm to 4am .

"A British jihadi who fled the UK to fight alongside the Islamic State terror group has been killed in a firefight with Kurdish Peshmerga forces in Iraq. Abu Musa al-Sumali is understood to have been shot dead in a fierce gun battle with local resistance troops in Kirkuk province in the north of the country, where ISIS has carried out repeat attacks in recent weeks. Fellow militants took to social media to pay tribute to the dead terrorist, revealing that he had travelled to the Middle East from Britain and sharing images of him taken from a recent ISIS propaganda video in which he appeared  wearing full military fatigues and reading a copy of the Koran. Scroll down for video . Militant: ISIS sympathisers were quick to share an image of him taken from a recent propaganda video in which he is seen calmly reading a copy of the Koran while sitting on a Toyota pick-up truck . Terror: Abu Musa Al-Sumali (left) is known to have been close to a fellow British terrorist of East African origin - Muslim convert Abu Abdullah al-Habashi (right), who was killed in the Syrian city of Kobane last week . The true identity of al-Sumali is not yet known, but he is believed to have arrived in northern Syria earlier this year, before travelling with the terror group on the frontline in neighbouring Iraq. Al-Sumali's kunya, otherwise known as a nom de guerre, suggests he is likely to have a Somalian heritage and may even have been born in the East African country before moving to Britain as a child. Reports of his death have not been independently verified. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Iraq.' 'The difficulty of collecting information in a conflict zone, in particular when individuals have often deliberately chosen to disguise their intentions and their identity, means that HMG has no means of reliably assembling this information.' ISIS sympathisers were quick to share an image of Al-Sumali taken from a recent propaganda video titled 'Enter the Door on Them', in which he is seen calmly reading a copy of the Koran while sitting on a Toyota pick-up truck. In the photograph Al-Sumali is seen wearing full military fatigues and red Nike trainers, and there are a number of large assault rifles resting against a small mound in the background. The rest of the video shows ISIS' renewed attempts to seize control of Kirkuk province in recent weeks and contains a number of gruesome images of dead Peshmerga fighters. Other shots from the propaganda footage show smiling ISIS militants praying together in a wooded area, as well as playing with kittens. A Kurdish Peshmerga fighter holds an rocket propelled-grenade near a flag of the Islamic State group hoisted a bridge at the frontline of fighting against Islamist militants in Rashad, on the road between Kirkuk and Tikrit . Killed: Abu Abdullah, 20 (left) and the man believed to be Abu Dharda, 20 (right) were killed fighting in Kobane . Al-Sumali is known to have been close to fellow a British terrorist of East African origin - 20-year-old Muslim convert Abu Abdullah al-Habashi. Al-Habashi, who was also known by a second nom de guerre of Abu Abdullah al-Britani, was killed by another Kurdish force - the Syria-based YPG - while fighting for ISIS in the besieged city of Kobane. The pair were recently photographed together, with a heavily bearded Al-Sumali looking relaxed and smiling as he strands next to Al-Habashi. Al-Habashi, from north London, was of Eritrean origin and converted from Christianity to Islam during his teenage years. He is understood to have travelled from the UK to join the Islamic State in Syria in December 2013. Threat: In his video appearance last month, al-Habashi gesticulated wildly as he said 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring' Sick: Abu Abdullah al-Habashi made headlines in August when he posed next to a decapitated Syrian soldier . Shortly after Al-Habashi's death in Kobane, another British national was killed fighting for ISIS in the besieged Syrian city. Abu Dharda, 20, also known as Abu Dhar Somali, came from a British-Somali background and travelled to Syria via Turkey in December 2013. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were aware of the reports but that it was extremely difficult to get confirmation of deaths of injuries, due to UK consular services being suspended. Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances. In August, he was interviewed on BBC Newsnight, where he admitted that his family had been trying to persuade him to return home but he had insisted there was 'no going back.' He confidently says in the interview: 'They say what all parents would say, 'come back you're crazy etc.' But I'm here for the sake of Allah.' Militant: Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances . Location Abu Abdullah al-Habashi was killed fighting for ISIS in the Syrian city of Kobane (pictured) Last Wednesday, the Peshmerga held off a major attack by ISIS forces in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk, officers said. 'They are targeting Kirkuk and they want to control the oil sites,' said Peshmerga Major General Westa Rasul. The attack began early last Wednesday morning against three villages west of the city of Kirkuk, sparking fighting that lasted for hours, Rasul and two other officers said. ISIS managed to seize one village, but Kurdish forces backed by air strikes later succeeded in retaking it. One policeman and five Peshmerga, including a colonel and the son of a Kurdish politician, were killed and 28 wounded in the fighting, officers and a doctor said. When federal security forces crumbled under the weight of the June offensive, Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region took control of a swathe of disputed northern territory it wants to incorporate against Baghdad's wishes. But IS turned its attention north in August, driving Kurdish troops back toward their regional capital Arbil and helping spark the US-led air campaign.","Abu Musa al-Sumali shot dead by Peshmerga troops in Kirkuk province .

Volunteering for the role, the patient, named only as James, explained he was already a father of five. He told viewers: 'My wife and I have five children and we love them dearly, but we don't want any more surprises.' This Morning viewers were shocked to tune in and see a man having a vasectomy live on air . Presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden express their own discomfort at the procedure, as they aimed to dispel the myths and worries surrounding vasectomies ahead of World Vasectomy Day tomorrow . Dr Jon Unwin, a Gloucestershire GP, performed the procedure, while This Morning's resident GP Dr Dawn Harper observed. In the studio, presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden looked visibly uncomfortable at the graphic procedure taking place before their eyes. The camera left little to the imagination, zooming right in to the patient's genitalia and graphically showing them being operated on, as Dr Unwin described the procedure. The feature comes after the programme's resident GP Dr Dawn Harper had a smear test live on air. And earlier this year, a couple drank their own urine on the show to try and advocate the health benefits. Speaking before the procedure, James, who was given local anaesthetic, added: 'For us this is a fail safe option. 'We haven't considered any other form of contraception. Now our family's complete this is the option for us. 'I have a bit of anxiety about the procedure but we have got to move forward and so unfortunately I have to go through it.' His wife, Carolyn, added: 'We definitely don't want any more children. 'I don't have any nerves about it. It is just something he has to have done.' But having watched the eye-watering segment, some This Morning viewers took to Twitter to express their shock. But viewers tuning in expressed their shock, with @jaschambers1 accusing the show of going too far . @MrHairyBrit accused the show's images of men's genitalia of ruining his breakfast . Another viewer, @pipbrowyn1, said the segment on the show had ruined her appetite . While @perla_illy told her followers the live operation had left her feeling sick . And @stuartaelmore tweeted 'a warning would have been nice' @jaschambers1 accused the show, which has recently aired a live smear test and a breast examination on air, of going too far. She tweeted: 'oh my lord, this morning has crossed the line, no one wants to see a vasectomy live.' Another viewer @pipbrowyn wrote: 'Um #thismorning cheers for showing a live vasectomy. That's my appetite gone for the next 1,000 years.' And @perla_illy added: 'I can't believe I'm actually watching a live vasectomy on itv this morning... literally finished my breakfast an about to see it again (sic).' Earlier in the segment, Dr Harper had explained the 'simple' procedure is carried out under a local anaesthetic, but warned it is considered irreversible. 'Vasectomy is really just dividing and tying the vas, the tubes where sperm get out from the testicles to the ejaculate,' she said. A vasectomy is a minor operation which is relatively painless and carried under local anaesthetic. The tubes that carry sperm from a man's testicles to the penis are cut, blocked or sealed with heat. The procedure can be carried out at your local GP surgery, in hospital as a day patient, at a sexual health clinic or a private clinic. There are two types of vasectomy. The tradtitional procedure, a conventional vasectomy, involves making two small incisions in the scrotum using a scalpel. The 1cm incisions allow the surgeon to access the tubes, known as vas deferens. Each tube is cut and a small section is removed. The ends of the tubes are then closed, either by tying them or sealing them using a high heat. The incisions are stitched using dissolvable stitches that disappear within about a week. The other type, a no-scapel vasectomy, is a newer technique. The doctor will feel for the vas deferens under the skin and hold them in place using a small clamp. A special instrument is then used to make a tiny puncture hole in the skin of the scrotum. A small pair of forceps is used to open the hole, allowing the surgeon access to the vans deferens without the need to cut the skin using a scalpel. The tubes are then closed in the same way as in the conventional method. @probnotbob joked: 'I just watched a live vasectomy on daytime TV and this is why I work' @liamhulmes_ joined the viewers shocked at the segment, adding 'I can't believe they're showing a live vasectomy on this morning' 'The idea is that by cutting and tying it off, sperm can't get into the ejaculate. 'You will still produce ejaculate because sperm is just a tiny part of it.' Amanda raised the question on the minds of most thinking about the technicalities of a vasectomy, asking Dr Dawn 'where the sperm goes'. 'The sperm can't go beyond the tied vas, and so it is reabsorbed by the body,' Dr Dawn said. 'It is a natural process, but is something that can cause concern. But it doesn't cause any problems.' She said the procedure has a high success rate, with just one in 2,000 failing. 'One of the reasons we cut and tie the tubes is to prevent the tubes reattaching,' she said. And she warned the procedure is considered irreversible on the NHS, while it is possible in some cases to perform reversals, though they are generally done privately. A This Morning's spokesperson said: 'Today's live vasectomy, on the eve of World Vasectomy Day, aimed to dispel myths and fears about this operation. 'The item also featured expert advice from leading doctors about this procedure and other methods of contraception. 'Warnings were given at the start of the item, and many positive comments were received.' A spokesman for the TV watchdog Ofcom said they have received one complaint relating to the live segment earlier today. He said: 'We will assess this complaint before deciding whether to investigate.' @allanfoy questioned the decision to air the live op as many will have been tucking into a morning coffee .","This Morning aired the procedure to dispel myths and worries about op .

"Women in South Korea are resorting to dangerous and painful surgery in their quest for a more western face. Demand for double jaw surgery, a bone-cutting procedure that involves realigning the upper and lower jaws to achieve a softer silhouette, has soared in the last few months . And now a photograph has appeared on a social networking site seeming to show a woman who has undergone surgery to lift the corners of her mouth into a permanent smile. Although the photograph, which appeared on Reddit, hasn't yet been authenticated the Huffington Post reports that there is a clinic in South Korea offering this procedure. A photograph of a young women who has seemingly undergone perma-smile surgery has appeared on social networking sites . The AONE clinic performs the ‘Smile Lipt’ procedure to both lift and curl drooping mouth corners by manipulating the facial muscles supporting the mouth. A Youtube video produced by the clinic about the procedure explains that some people have sagging mouth corners due to low strength of the muscles that lift the mouth edges, and overly strong jaw muscles that pull the mouth down. The video says that ‘even among ordinary people, some have beautifully upturned mouth corners,’ and that ‘in general Western people have longer mouths and higher mouth corners than Korean people.’ Once the procedure has been performed the mouth will always been turned up, even when the patient is not smiling. The Business Insider reports that plastic surgeon at the AONE clinic, Taek Keun Kwon spoke in 2012 about developing the procedure saying: . ‘Up until now, mouth corner lift couldn't be widely used due to its ineffectiveness and high risk of side effects such as scars. The before and after pictures are shown on the AONE clinic's YouTube video . The muscles in the yellow circle pull the corner of the mouth down if they are too strong and so are cut, while the red arrow and blue circled muscles are repositioned . An advertisement in a Seoul subway encourages women to have double-jaw surgery, one of the plastic surgery trends to hit Korea, in order to have a smaller face . ‘Downturned mouth corners give off gloomy and melancholy impression. 'On the contrary, upturned mouth corners create bright and smiling appearance as well as confident expression. ‘It is very difficult to elevate mouth corner by just excision and closure of the skin around the mouth corner area. To turn up the mouth corner effectively, it is necessary to weaken the lip depressors to gain unopposed mouth corner lift.’ It appears that there is a growing number of people willing to risk the side effects of such a procedure which include scarring and ‘over correction’ to achieve a ‘upturned’ look. A drooping mouth 'gives off gloomy and melancholy impression' according to surgeon Taek Keun Kwon . The results of the procedure (right) lengthens the mouth as well as lifting the corners . South Korea has one of the highest rates of plastic surgery in the world so it is little wonder that such a niche procedure has its origins in the country. It remains to be seen whether the slightly cat-like look will become popular, but thus far the reaction to the photo on Reddit has been more comical than admiring with two top rated user comments being ‘joker’ and ‘Imagine trying to eat noodles or soup with this!'","New plastic surgery offered in South Korea to curl lips upwards .

"Mary Kidson was charged with child cruelty . Mary Kidson's daughter was eight when she started having problems at school. 'She'd never been a high achiever,' recalls Mary. 'But it was as if she was going backwards: she was finding it harder to keep up in class and she got tired very easily. She complained of pains in her arms and legs and bad headaches.' At first Mary, a former foundry manager for British Steel, thought it was a temporary blip. But her daughter got worse. Over the next five years there were frequent visits to doctors, yet time and again Mary was told there was nothing wrong - the tests all came back clear. Eventually, three years ago, in desperation she visited Dr Thierry Hertoghe, an endocrinologist who runs a clinic in Brussels. He found her daughter lacked several important hormones, and prescribed replacements including a thyroid hormone. The treatment worked wonders, says Mary, who now runs an online educational service for children with learning difficulties from her home in Herefordshire. 'My daughter was transformed. She became a bright and happy child. 'Within a month the headaches were gone and she'd got her energy back.' Little did Mary know, however, that this breakthrough would lead to her being charged with child cruelty, and her daughter being taken from her. Mary and her daughter had entered one of the most hotly disputed areas of medicine - the diagnosis and treatment of an underactive thyroid. Known as hypothyroidism, the condition affects three million adults in the UK. It leads to a lack of the thyroid hormone, which helps regulate the metabolism, and causes symptoms such as low body temperature, fatigue, weight gain, depression, cold, muscle aches, headaches, and water retention. The condition is detected with a blood test, and most of those affected are successfully treated with a form of thyroid hormone known as T4. But as the Mail has previously reported, patient groups and some experts claim the blood test for it is unreliable because it measures levels of only one thyroid hormone - and there are two, T4 and T3. Campaigners believe as many as 300,000 adults and an unknown number of children are missed by standard tests. The problem, as they see it, is that NHS doctors are advised not to give hormone replacement to people with a 'normal' blood test even though they have typical symptoms of an underactive thyroid. Indeed official advice is that prescribing hormones to these patients could cause long-term problems such as damage to the heart and bones. Instead, patients report being offered psychological counselling or are given a prescription for depression. Her daughter lacked several important hormones, and was prescribed replacements . And this is where Mary's story turns dark. A year after Dr Hertoghe started prescribing the hormones, police and social workers suddenly arrived at her home and her weeping 14-year-old daughter was taken into care. Mary believes the raid was triggered by a complaint by her ex-husband - her lawyer has a copy of a letter from a GP advising him to contact child protection services. Mary was arrested on suspicion of child cruelty and last month appeared before Worcester Crown Court on a charge of 'unlawfully and maliciously administering a poison or other destructive and noxious thing' - in other words the hormones - with intent to endanger her daughter's life. The prosecution said the hormones could cause heart and bone problems and dismissed the Belgian doctor as a quack. Last week the trial was stopped on the grounds there was no evidence for the charge. Mary is now free but her child - who cannot be named for legal reasons - is in a psychiatric clinic, following a breakdown. This extraordinary story raises worrying questions about whether the full weight of the law should be used in disagreements between doctors and parents about how best to treat a child. There are obvious echoes of the Ashya King case - the boy who was taken by his parents to Spain from Southampton General Hospital against the advice of his doctors. The parents wanted him to have a brain cancer treatment not available and they, too, were imprisoned. Mary's ordeal started when her daughter was a toddler. 'She never babbled like normal babies and by three she still wasn't speaking,' says Mary. 'I asked my doctor about it several times but was told there was nothing wrong.' The little girl was eventually diagnosed with severe oral and verbal dyspraxia - a developmental disorder that makes it hard to precisely control the mouth and tongue - and needed intensive therapy. But she was otherwise healthy and able to attend school. Mary and her daughter had entered one of the most hotly disputed areas of medicine - the diagnosis and treatment of an underactive thyroid . Then, at eight, she began to develop a range of health problems. As well as chronic tiredness she started to put on weight, and by nine was officially obese. 'Every day she'd complain about bad headaches. Most mornings her fingers would be stiff and puffy. 'We went to see the GP and she got referred to various specialists such as a rheumatologist for the fingers, someone else for the headaches and a dietitian for the weight, and they all did tests. I think she may have had a thyroid test then, but they all came back negative. 'I think part of the problem was that nobody took an overview and looked at the pattern of symptoms. Each one was treated separately. For instance, she was 12 and still showing no signs of puberty, which made sense in light of the very low levels of oestrogen that Dr Hertoghe picked up on later, but it is also something that could contribute to tiredness. 'I knew what a healthy child was - John, her older brother, was sporty and had no problems. My daughter was different.' At the end of 2011 the family GP said that if the paediatricians could find nothing wrong with her then she wasn't likely to, and there was nothing more she could do. So Mary turned to the internet. 'As soon as I put in my daughter's symptoms, details of treatment with thyroid and other hormones started coming up,' she says. 'I learned that the NHS test for low thyroid could show you as having a healthy level when you didn't. That's because the test tells you how much of the version of the thyroid hormone known as T4 you have. But T4 has to be turned into the active form called T3, and some people have a problem converting T4 to T3.' She also learned that European countries such as Germany and Belgium had lower thresholds for treating T4 deficiency. Sheila Turner, who chairs the charity Thyroid Patient Advocacy says: 'While we estimate that there are about 100 doctors in the UK who are prepared to treat patients with symptoms but supposedly 'healthy' levels according to the blood test, most are not prepared to treat children in this situation for fear of legal proceedings.' A sympathetic private doctor in the UK put Mary in touch with Dr Hertoghe in 2011 when her daughter was nearly 14. 'He ran blood tests that had not been done in the UK,' she says. Dr Hertoghe told the Mail: 'As well as a low level of thyroid hormone, I found she was not making enough oestrogen or cortisol. Being short of any of these would be enough to make you feel very tired and explained other symptoms like low mood and constipation.' He is critical of the official UK approach. 'There, doctors only treat thyroid deficiency when it reaches around 70 per cent, but in Europe many start to treat at the 25 per cent mark. British hormone specialists don't listen to what patients are telling them about their symptoms, they just tell them if they are deficient or not and that's it.' Mary began treating her daughter with the hormones and some mineral and vitamin supplements prescribed by Dr Hertoghe. 'It all cost several thousand pounds - it was worth it.' The hormones - a thyroid extract used for more than 100 years, oestrogen and cortisol - were the 'poison or other destructive and noxious thing' that formed the basis of the charge Mary was attempting to harm her daughter. 'If I was going to poison her there are lots of cheaper ways to do it,' says Mary wryly. The transformation in her daughter was 'wonderful - she slept well. Even patches of eczema that would flare up disappeared. Her education got back on track' And then suddenly it was all taken away from her. 'If only they had talked to me and the doctor involved first,' says Mary. 'Then we could have discussed it and worked out what was best for my daughter. If the NHS doctors had insisted that the hormones be stopped then I would have said 'OK, let's do it for three months and then reassess'.' 'Instead they did something very harmful to both of us.' For their part, UK hormone experts are confident their tests are reliable. 'We have very robust methods for detecting if someone is hormone deficient in this country and the same diagnostic criteria apply to teenagers and adults,' says Dr Mark Vanderpump, endocrinologist and president of the British Thyroid Association. 'So if a patient has tested and been found not to need replacement, giving them unnecessary hormone treatment or supplements could do damage in the long term. 'A patient requires a diagnoses but sometimes there is no clear diagnoses and it is only possible to say that an endocrine cause has been excluded. It is difficult to explain reports of symptom benefit. Sometimes there may be a placebo effect which may only be temporary. In other patients, symptoms spontaneously improve with no intervention. Assessing each case individually and holistically is important.'","Mary Kidson's daughter was eight when she started having problems .

"Hundreds of thousands of patients are languishing for more than 24 hours in A&E before being seen, according to figures by the care watchdog. The most seriously ill are lying on trolleys waiting for a bed on a ward while others are forced to wait just to be assessed and sent home. A survey of almost 40,000 patients by the Care Quality Commission found that a third spent at least four hours in A&E – the Government's target. If the Care Quality Commission's findings are representative of the 22 million patient visits in a year, as many as 650,000 people will wait at least 24 hours in A&E (file picture) Of that third, 6 per cent were there for at least 12 hours and 3 per cent for 24 hours or more. If the CQC's findings are representative of the 22 million patient visits to casualty in a year, as many as 650,000 will wait at least 24 hours. The watchdog's findings come as emergency wards across England are facing unprecedented pressures, with many urging the public to stay away unless they are very seriously ill. Several hospitals are on black alert in which operations are cancelled to free-up beds and ambulances are diverted elsewhere. Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said: 'These figures will alarm people about what lies ahead in the coming months. 'A&Es were telling patients to stay away before winter even started. Under this government, over a million patients every year wait too long to be seen in England's A&Es. Hospitals have missed the waiting time target for 71 weeks in a row as more and more patients wait hours on end. 'This should have been ringing alarm bells in the Department of Health months ago, but the truth is ministers failed to listen and act on concerns.' The figures also show that 13 per cent of patients waited at least half an hour for pain relief after asking a nurse for help. Of that, 8 per cent were given no help at all. Some 11 per cent of patients who arrived by an ambulance had to wait outside for at least 30 minutes because the casualty department was too busy. This included 5 per cent who were stuck in the vehicle for an hour – and 2 per cent for two or more hours. The CQC has also named and shamed the ten worst A&E units based on the responses of patients. They include Medway, in Kent, where a damning report by the watchdog last week revealed how patients were spending 35 hours on trolleys. The survey is undertaken every two years and the results are broadly similar to 2012, although some questions differed slightly. Some 80 per cent rated their overall experience in A&E a score of 7 out of 10 or higher, a rise from 76 per cent two years ago. And 77 per cent said doctors and nurses listened to them, while 72 per cent said staff had enough time for them. Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said the overall results of the survey were 'encouraging'. 'However, we do see significant variations between trusts,' he said. 'This highlights the need for all trusts to review their own results and to take action where necessary.' Each of the 142 A&E units was rated based on patients' responses and the CQC compiled a league table. The bottom ten included Tameside in Greater Manchester, Medway in Gillingham, Kent, and Barking, Havering and Redbridge in East London. At the other end of the scale were Dorset County, the Royal Surrey and Salford Royal in Greater Manchester. Each of the 142 A&E units was rated based on patients' responses. The bottom ten included Tameside on Greater Manchester (pictured) Patient numbers in A&E have risen by 50 per cent in a decade partly due to an aging population and a lack of GP availability. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt revealed last week how he had taken one of his children to casualty because he did not want to wait to see a family doctor. Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: 'Its horrendous. The problem is that people cannot see their GP, and this is just rebounding up the system. But it's an untenable situation and there just doesn't seem to be a solution.' Dr Katherine Rake of Healthwatch England, which campaigns for patient rights, said there is 'clearly room for improvement'. NHS employees file more than 33 complaints about staffing shortages every day, figures reveal. There were 4,000 gripes in the past six months – plus 1,343 about shifts being filled by underqualified staff and 196 about employees being overworked, according to Freedom of Information requests by 5 News.","Care Quality Commission (CQC) surveyed almost 40,000 patients .

"Half of babies are at risk of suffocating in their sleep because they are put in cots with unsafe bedding, blankets and pillows. Parents must be better informed, experts said today, after a study revealed 'too many babies' are still at risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Sleeping with loose bedding or soft objects poses a risk of suffocation in babies, especially those under the age of one. Half of babies born in the U.S. are at risk of suffocating in their sleep because they sleep with 'potentially hazardous bedding', the American Academy of Paediatrics found (file picture) Although the use of blankets and other bedding has declined, around half of U.S. infants are still placed to sleep with 'potentially hazardous bedding', according to the study by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP). Experts investigated the type of bedding chosen by parents from 1993 to 2010, from the National Infant Sleep Position study. Blankets, quilts and pillows can obstruct a baby's airway and, if they become caught over a child's head, they can cause suffocation. The AAP advises parents to put their babies to sleep in a cot with no loose bedding or soft objects, including cuddly toys, under or over the infant. That is not to say babies should risk feeling cold in the night. Instead, experts advise using a firmly tucked in sheet, or a baby sleeping bag. Lucy McKeon, research and information manager at The Lullaby Trust said: 'We know the safest sleeping environment for a baby is on its back in a cot or Moses basket in the same room as a parent for the first six months of life. 'We advise parents not to use loose bedding, pillows, cot bumpers or have soft toys in the cot – this is because some of these items cause an accident risk and others increase the chance of SIDS occurring. 'This new study suggests parents are using loose bedding which is considered less safe than well-fitted blankets or a baby sleep bag. Experts advise babies are not put to sleep with any loose quilts, pillows, blankets or cot bumpers. The concern is the bedding can obstruct a baby's airways in their sleep (file picture) Parents are advised to remove any soft toys from a baby's cot before putting them to sleep, for fear of the toys suffocating the baby (file picture) Sudden infant death syndrome describes the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained. Cot death was a term commonly used in the past. It has largely been abandoned, due to misleading suggestions that sudden infant death can only occur when a baby is asleep in a cot. Causes of SIDS may include accidents, infections, congenital abnormality or metabolic disorder. For those deaths that remain unexplained, experts believe there are likely to be undiscovered causes. SIDS statistics: . Source: The Lullaby Trust and Office for National Statistics . 'It's important that parents are given all the information about safer sleep so that they can make an informed decision. Evidence-based advice is available on The Lullaby Trust website, www.lullabytrust.org.uk.' Using a pillow has been shown to increase the chance of SIDS by up to 2.5 times, the charity said. 'A simple mattress in your cot with no loose bedding or bumpers is the safest sleeping place for a baby,' the trust advises. Although uncommon accidental suffocation is the leading cause of injury-related deaths in infants. While sudden infant syndrome deaths have declined in recent years, they still totalled around 2,000 deaths in the U.S. 2010. The suffocation rate doubled from 2000 to 2010, when around 640 infants died from accidental sleep-related suffocation, U.S. government data showed. Meanwhile, in the UK in 2012, 221 infant deaths were attributed to SIDS. The team of researchers found that over the 17-year period, the use of loose bedding did decline but remained a common practise. The rate of loose bedding use averaged around 86 per cent in 1993 to 1995, but declined to 55 per cent in 2008 to 2010. Teenage mothers were found to be most likely to use the dangerous bedding (83.5 per cent), while those babies born at full term were least at risk (55.6 per cent). The study also found the at-risk bedding was most likely used for infants who slept in adult beds, those put to sleep on their sides, or babies who shared a cot or bed with others. The authors concluded that while the numbers have improved significantly, babies are 'still being put to bed in an unsafe sleeping environment; about half still sleep with blankets, quilts, pillows and other hazardous items'. Study co-author Marian Willinger, a SIDS expert at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said these infant deaths 'are tragic and they're just not necessary'. The AAP said it is vital parents 'know and understand the risk factors associated with this dangerous practise in order to help reduce the number of sleep-related infant deaths'. Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. analysed telephone surveys involving a total of nearly 20,000 parents. The study was published today in the journal Pediatrics.","Parents 'must be better informed' of the risk of sudden infant death (SIDS)

Cream of the crop: Lachiram is a farmer by profession . 'I saw people performing dangerous stunts on national television. I thought ""if they can do it why can't I?"", so I started practicing yoga on my bike,' Lachiram said. 'I can stop doing my work but I can't stop performing. 'I completely love doing stunts on my bike and I will continue to do so for the next 15 years.' Happy to stare death in the face, the bike adventure enthusiast hits speeds of 40mph during his act - which he can maintain over a distance of three miles. He said: 'Many people ask me about my stunts. People who have not witnessed my performance ask me to perform stunts for them.' Fame hungry Lachiram says performing bike stunts has made him a hero in his home town. He said: 'People who age around 45 to 50 years say ""Lachiram this is not good for you"", but today's youth appreciates and supports me. They want me to continue performing.' And Lachiram's biggest fans include his son, G Govardhan. He said: 'When I first saw my father doing stunts I got afraid. 'But I am proud of my dad and I would want him to continue performing this brave act.' Lachiram says he now intends to keep pushing the barriers of his extreme sport. He added: 'My future plan is to perform stunts on a national level. I want to perform not for myself but for my nation.'","Gugulotu Lachiram, from India, practices yoga on the back of a motorbike .

"Over the years, political correctness has seeped into many areas of every day life. Christmas time in particular is a period where every effort is made to include even those of non-Christian faiths in the festive cheer. So, with the huge growth sales of Crimbo sweaters over the last few years, it was only a matter of time before someone invented the 'Multicultural Christmas Jumper.' A British website is selling the Multicultural Christmas jumper for £40. The company wants to make season a time for celebration and togetherness . And the website Britishchristmasjumpers.com are the first past that particular politically correct finishing post. Their multicoloured offering features several different signs of faith including; Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Sikh, a form of scientific atheism, Chinese philosophy and also the peace sign. The woolly garment can be pre-ordered from the site for £40, with the company shipping the prodcuts from December 1 onwards. A spokesperson for the company said: 'For us, the festive season is a time for celebration and togetherness. And we think that now more than ever, the world could use a little more unity. 'Which is why this year, British Christmas Jumpers has made the Multicultural Christmas Jumper. 'It is a Christmas jumper for modern Britain.' They claim it is a sweater for 'Modern Britain' The website reads: 'Britain has never been more multicultural, so we thought we’d create a Christmas jumper with a twist . 'We think everyone should be able to wear a British Christmas Jumper and celebrate the festive season - however they wish, no matter what their colour, creed or culture. 'This is why you’ll see all the world's major religions represented on this Christmas jumper, proudly made in Britain.'","British website is selling the Multicultural Christmas jumper for £40 .

"Colourful Christmas jumpers have become all the rage during the festive period - but now it seems even animals have joined the fashion herd. Adorable fashion-conscious cow Gloria has got into the festive spirit by modelling her own Christmas jumper to help fight poverty in Africa. This year, the charity Send a Cow is aiming to send 20,000  gifts, sold through its Christmas catalogue, to stricken families living in seven African countries. Scroll down for video . Fashion-conscious Gloria has got into the festive spirit by modelling her own Christmas jumper to help fight poverty in Africa . And, to kick-start the cause, the Jersey purebred - who is the charity's ambassador - has posed in her own custom-fitted knitted jumper. Arts and crafts specialist Elise Hurcombe, from Bristol, visited Gloria at her farm in Devon to measure her up for the patterned red and blue festive jersey. Gloria - who even added a Santa's hat as the finishing touch - did not bat an eyelid as Ms Hurcombe attached Velcro straps to her existing coat. Unlike more conventional Christmas jumper, Gloria's garment features chickens, cows and vegetables - the gifts the charity hopes people will buy to help the families. The countries the charity helps are Uganda, Lesotho, Zambia, Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia. Grandmother Christine, a 68-year-old farmer living in Uganda, told how the charity helped change her family's life. She said: 'Since I started working for Send a Cow I have learnt how to make my land thrive. The Jersey purebred is the charity ambassador for Send a Cow, which hopes to send 20,000 Christmas gifts to stricken families living in seven African countries . Gloria was measured up for the garment by arts and crafts specialist Elise Hurcombe, from Bristol, who visited the cow at her home in Devon . 'We eat vegetables every day. I've really noticed the difference in my grandchildrens' health and they really don't get sick often anymore.' The charity wants to provide livestock for families and teach them how to farm. In their new gift catalogue, one present is a 'Local Cow' which, for £205, provides a family with milk and manure for farming, the charity says. Simon Barnes, CEO of Send a Cow, said: 'This year we've taken the idea of the quirky Christmas jumper one step further, to encourage people to think differently about the gifts they buy this Christmas. 'We really hope that you will support us this year by buying a gift, to help us change even more lives this Christmas and beyond.'","Gloria the Jersey purebred is the charity ambassador for Send a Cow .

"A group of Russian teenagers has bypassed airport security by sneaking onto a runway and sharing their pictures on social media. Despite increased security around the world in the aftermath of 9/11, members of the notorious 'roofer movement' scaled security fences, pulled on high-vis jackets, and posed next to and inside aircrafts at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo International Airport. The group took pictures of themselves in and around various aeroplanes, and then one teen was also snapped in the cockpit of a helicopter. A group of teenagers climbed over a security fence and onto the runway at St Petersburg's Pulkovo International Airport . In a shocking photo, one girl even managed to get into the cockpit of an aircraft . Wearing high-vis vests amde the teenagers look 'slightly' more genuine . They then made their escape the same way they entered. The photos first appeared on social networking site VK  via user 'Kosta SV,' who also gave a description of his group's actions one evening. Vocativ reported that Kosta had evidence of similar security breaches in other albums he shared on the website. The group are thought to be a part of the 'roofer' movement, who take on challenges to breach security at buildings and landmarks in Russia . The pictures released on social media have led to many voicing their concerns at the security breach . 'Anyone can walk on the runway,' he writes. 'It may sound funny, but in fact it's dangerous. The helicopters were open, right next to the booth with a guard, perhaps there is generally no security, or they went to drink tea.' Since the pictures went viral, it has led to many members of the public voicing their concerns over security at Russian airports. What's more, the group have recently posted a video online that shows them returning to the airport, complete with high-vis jackets, and again making it onto the runway. The group had plenty of time to capture some special pictures from their trip to the runway . The pranksters left the airport the same way they entered, completely undetected . The group went on to upload a video which shows them returning to the same scene some days later . The group are often pictured scaling various buildings and landmarks in Russia, many of which are supposed to have high security. There are estimated to be at least 50 serious 'roofers' in Russia, often taking on the challenges posed by buildings in and around Moscow. They tend to scale buildings without safety equipment - and of course a video camera to snap the moment.

"Tokyo kept its crown as the Michelin Guide's gourmet capital  with the most starred restaurants for the eighth consecutive year. Among the establishments that gained the top three-star rating in the 2015 guide to Tokyo was one that serves poisonous blowfish. And, for the first time,  eateries serving chanko nabe, a rich stew that helps sumo wrestlers pack on weight, as well as several specialising in dishes featuring loach, a type of fish, have been featured. Clean flavours: Three-Michelin starred Ishikawa (pictured) focuses on a number of key ingredients for each dish. Tokyo has the most Michelin-starred restaurants in the world with 267 eateries gaining the accolade . 1. Esaki . 2. Ishikawa . 3. Joel Robuchon Ebisu . 4. Kanda . 5. Makimura . 6. Quintessence . 7. Ryugin . 8. Saito . 9. Sukiyabashi Jiro Honten . 10. Usukifugu Yamadaya . 11. Yoshitake . 12. Yukimura . As many as 267 restaurants gained stars, 19 of them for the first time. The coveted three-star rating, the Michelin Guide's top honour, went to 12 restaurants, down one from last year. Newly promoted to three stars from two was Makimura, a traditional restaurant whose owner, Akio Makimura, said he could not believe he had won. 'When I got the phone call this morning informing me of the promotion I thought it was a joke,' Mr Makimura said. The chef said he felt tremendous pressure when he made his debut on the list - and had dreamed of gaining a top rating one day. 'I'll just keep on doing what I've always done. The best part of Japanese food is the freshness of the ingredients and bringing that to life in your cooking.' Fugu sashimi (right), made from the poisonous blowfish (left), can be fatal if improperly prepared . Joel Robuchon's Ebisu restaurant  serving classic French cuisine retained its three-Michelin star status . Other restaurants that won the three-star rating included Usukifugu Yamadaya, which serves fugu, poisonous blowfish, which can be fatal if improperly prepared. Another winner was Sukiyabashi Jiro Honten whose master chef is in his late 80s and which was the site of an informal leaders' dinner when US President Barack Obama visited Japan in April. This is the first guide released since Unesco-listed Japanese 'washoku' cuisine an 'intangible cultural heritage' earlier this year. The guide, which used to include the neighbouring city of Yokohama and the coastal Shonan area, was limited to Tokyo this year to allow a wider listing of Japanese food in the 'Bib Gourmand' section that emphasises cheaper restaurants, Michelin said. The first Michelin restaurant guide, aimed at drivers in the early days of motoring, was publishing by the tyre company in 1900, with the star rating system introduced in the 1920s. Tokyo was the first Asian city to have a guide devoted to it. In 2010 it surpassed Paris as the city with the most Michelin-star rated restaurants.","Japan's washoku cuisine a UNESCO listed 'intangible cultural heritage'

"Preparing for Christmas is a mammoth task for everyone, but for grandmother Sylvia Pope getting ready for the big day requires three months of hard work. The bauble-loving pensioner is forced to start hanging her decorations in September to make sure they are all up by Christmas Day because it takes so long to attach each one to her ceiling by hand. The 72-year-old spends a few hours each day creating the festive masterpiece, that will this year contain a staggering 2061 balls - 10 more than last year. Bauble-loving grandmother Sylvia Pope, 72, started putting the Christmas decorations up at her home in Swansea, South Wales, in September . Mrs Pope  spends a few hours each day  perfecting the colourful creation to ensure that it is complete by December 25 . 'I absolutely love Christmas and my grandchildren's faces light up when they see all the baubles. It really is magical for them and that is all that really matters,' said the 72-year-old. The living room at her home in Swansea, South Wales, is plastered with baubles from around the world. She says: 'This year I've bought 10 new baubles and my new addition include Mary Poppins, Captain Hook and Peter Pan. I already had Tinkerbell. My grandchildren love the films those characters are in. 'My favourite Christmas film is Miracle on 34th Street, but I haven't managed to find a bauble for that film yet.' She started collecting them in 1999 and has ones from around the world. Once Christmas is finished Mrs Pope carefully removes each bauble from the ceiling, individually wraps them and stores them in 36 boxes in her attic. She then has the 2,000 holes in her ceiling filled in, before re-painting it, so that it is ready in time to start again for next year. She started collecting the baubles in 1999 and now has a massive collection of 2061 festive balls from across the globe . Once Christmas is over the 2061 festive balls will be carefully taken down, individually wrapped, and stored in 36 boxes in the grandmother's attic . Mrs Pope said that she may be forced to have her ceiling re-skimmed after Christmas this year to fill in all the holes created by her decorations. This year Mrs Pope has added 10 new additions to her display, including baubles featuring Mary Poppins, Captain Hook and Peter Pan . After the festivities this year the grandmother thinks that she may have to have her ceiling re-skimmed by a professional plasterer. 'Some people think it is over the top and tacky but when they see it for real its completely different. Most people love them and think they look fabulous'. Mrs Pope's collection also includes Disney characters, a London red bus, a New York taxi, aeroplanes, an old fashioned telephone and helicopters. She said: 'I normally spend about £100 a year on new baubles and visit all the festive markets to find new ones. This year I have spent about £80 so far but I haven't finished yet. 'When I go to the markets I normally find one I want to buy. I never get bored of buying new baubles.' 'My grandchildren and play 'I Spy' with the different baubles. We have great fun. 'Who knows maybe I could make the Guinness Book of Records one day.' Mrs Pope said: 'I normally spend about £100 a year on new baubles and visit all the festive markets to find new ones' The 72-year-old explained that she 'absolutely loves Christmas' and her 'grandchildren's faces light up when they see all the baubles' She said her grandchildren enjoyed playing 'I Spy,' in a bid to spot all  the different baubles .","Grandmother Sylvia Pope spends three months decorating her house in Swansea, South Wales for Christmas .

"Dogs and wolves evolved from a common ancestor between 11,000 and 34,000 years ago, according to new research. U.S. scientists said that part of the genetic overlap observed between some modern dogs and wolves is the result of interbreeding after dog domestication and not a direct line of descent from one group of wolves. They believe their research reflects a more . complicated history than the popular story that early farmers adopted a . few docile, friendly wolves that later became our modern canine . companions. Dogs and wolves evolved from a common ancestor between 11,000 and 34,000 years ago but modern canines are more closely related to each other than to wolves,  according to new research . Instead, the earliest dogs may have first lived among hunter-gatherer societies and adapted to agricultural life later, according to the study which is published in the journal PLoS Genetics. Researchers from the University of Chicago said that dogs are more . closely related to each other than to wolves, regardless of geographic . origin as they do not descend from a single line of wolves. John Novembre, associate professor in the Department of Human Genetics at the university, who is also the study’s senior author, said: ‘Dog domestication is more complex than we originally thought. ‘In this analysis we didn't see clear evidence in favour of a multi-regional model, or a single origin from one of the living wolves that we sampled. ‘It makes the field of dog domestication very intriguing going forward,’ he added. This graphic shows how genetic relationships evolved over time, based on three dogs, three wolves and a jackal . The scientists sequenced the genome of three grey wolves from different geographic areas, as well as  produced genomes for two dog breeds: a basenji (pictured), which originates in central Africa and a dingo from Australia, as both areas that have been historically isolated from modern wolf populations . The team of scientists sequenced the genomes of three grey wolves – one of which was from China, one from Croatia and another from Israel – to represent the three regions where dogs are believed to have originated. They produced genomes for two dog breeds - a basenji, which originates in central Africa and a dingo from Australia - as both areas that have been historically isolated from modern wolf populations. The researchers also sequenced the genome of a golden jackal to serve as an ‘outgroup’ representing earlier genetic divergence. Analysis of basenji, dingo and boxer genomes showed that the dog breeds were most closely related to each other. A dingo is pictured . Their analysis of the basenji and dingo genomes, plus a previously published boxer genome from Europe, showed that the dog breeds were most closely related to each other. Likewise, the three wolves from each geographic area were more closely related to each other than any of the dogs. Dr Novembre said the findings of the study tell a different story than he and his colleagues anticipated. Instead of all three dogs being closely related to one of the wolf lineages, or each dog being related to its closest geographic counterpart, they seem to have descended from an older, wolf-like ancestor common to both species. ‘One possibility is there may have been other wolf lineages that these dogs diverged from that then went extinct,' Dr Novembre said. ‘So now when you ask which wolves are dogs most closely related to, it's none of these three because these are wolves that diverged in the recent past. ‘It's something more ancient that isn't well represented by today's wolves,’ he added. The study shows how complex the early domestication of wolves was and Dr Novembre said his team is trying to collect every scrap of evidence to reconstruct what happened in the past. ‘We use genetics to reconstruct the history of population sizes, relationships among populations and the gene flow that occurred. So now we have a much more detailed picture than existed before, and it's a somewhat surprising picture,’ he said. Dogs were man’s best friend as far back as the Ice Age and dogs and humans first bonded between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago, according to a study published in November. That was when wolves, ancestors of domestic dogs living today, were first tamed by ancient hunter gatherers, according to genetic evidence. Early tamed wolves may have been trained as hunting dogs or even protected their human masters from predators. The findings challenge a previous theory that dog domestication happened some 15,000 years ago in eastern Asia, after the introduction of agriculture. In reality, the history of the bond between dog and man appears to go back much further, to a time when fur-clad humans were living in caves and hunting woolly mammoths. Scientists used DNA analysis to establish what populations of wolves were most related to living dogs.","U.S. scientists believe the genetic overlap observed between some modern dogs and wolves is the result of interbreeding after dog domestication .

"The biggest road-building programme for almost half a century is unveiled by ministers today. Ministers will announce a £15billion masterplan to build or upgrade 1,300 miles of roads. The move is an echo of the ‘roads for prosperity’ scheme unveiled by Margaret Thatcher in 1989 to boost ‘the great car economy.’ Scroll down for video and full list of road schemes . Details of exactly where the new roads will be built and when are yet to be finalised, but the 100 separate schemes include: . The package unveiled today by Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin includes £1.5billion to add extra lanes to key motorways. New charging points every 20 miles on most routes will promote the use of greener electric vehicles. ‘This is the biggest investment in our road network since the 1970s,’ said Mr Alexander, who chairs the Cabinet’s infrastructure committee. ‘My view is previous governments over the last four decades have systematically underinvested in our roads, railways, telecoms and energy. ‘That’s something that has really weakened our economic growth and has held Britain back. ‘We have to make very difficult choices in other areas of public spending in order to unlock this big investment. We’ve made the Treasury a department for infrastructure.’ The plans include making the A1 a dual carriageway almost all the way to the Scottish border . He insisted reforms to the Highways Agency will make it impossible for a future government to trim the programme to save cash. ‘The Highways Agency is becoming more autonomous, like Network Rail. It will be given a brief every five years and will go away and deliver it. So future governments simply can’t decide to turn this all upside down again,’ the Chief Secretary said. The Department of Transport said: ‘Over 1,300 new lane miles will be added by schemes being delivered over the next parliament on motorways and trunk roads, tackling congestion and fixing some of the most notorious and longstanding problem areas on the network. ‘With 90 per cent of journeys taking place on our roads, this work is vital to help people get on and get around.’ Spending during the next parliament on England’s roads network will be boosted further by maintenance funding worth more than £10billion across the road network. One of the flagship projects is a £2billion commitment to have dual carriageways for the entire A303 and A358 to the South West, including a twin-bore 1.8mile tunnel at the notorious Stonehenge bottleneck. This will allow road users to drive on a dual carriageway from London to within 15 miles of Land’s End. There will be improvements to a third of the junctions on the M25 ‘to aid frustrated commuters stuck in traffic around the capital’. In the North East, the Government is setting aside £290million to complete the dualling of the A1 from London to Ellingham, just 25 miles from the Scottish border ‘to make the Great North Road truly great again’. Across the North West and Yorkshire the Government aims to complete a ‘smart’ motorway along the entire length of the M62 from Manchester to Leeds along with improvements to transpennine capacity from Manchester to Sheffield. There will be a commitment to improve links to the Port of Liverpool as one of 12 projects designed to improve access to trading gateways. In the South East there will be funding for £350million of improvements to the A27 along the south coast to tackle severe congestion at Arundel, Worthing and Lewes. Some £300million has been earmarked to upgrade the east-west connection to Norfolk with new dual carriageway sections of the A47 and improved links to the A1 and A11. AA president Edmund King said: ‘All road users are entitled to safe and uncongested national arteries. We can no longer ignore the inadequate resources going into the mainstay of the UK transport system – our roads – which carry 86 per cent of passenger journeys and more than 90 per cent of freight. ‘We spend less than a quarter of motoring taxes on this critical national asset whilst many key competitor countries spend much more. ‘At long last the Government has recognised that we need a long term coherent plan for our roads, with guaranteed funding, to end the stop-start mess experienced over the last few decades.’ The Midlands will see improvements to the M42 to the east of Birmingham to improve connections, including to Birmingham airport.","Masterplan will see 1,300 miles of roads built or upgraded .

"In Siberia, there is an inconspicuous wooden hut that doesn't warrant a second glance. But this unremarkable building will  be the entrance to a vault that could one day save the human race. A storage facility dubbed the 'Noah's Ark for seeds' that will safeguard the planet's food supply and rare plants against Doomsday is about to be constructed underneath it. The pioneering facility will use the natural cold of Siberia's thick permafrost to preserve samples for up to 100 years. Wood you believe it? This unremarkable building will be the entrance to a vault that could one day save the human race . Protection: The vault will enable scientists to safeguard many of the world's most important foods against war and climate change. Pictured is one of Yakutsk's amazing permafrost caves . Unique: The building does not use any fans to keep the temperature under the ground cool and instead relies on the natural cold air . Move along, nothing to see here: The first part of the cryostorage facility in Yakutsk was opened in December 2012 . Being built at a cost of 227 million roubles (£3.2million), at least 1.5million seeds - from plants, vegetables, cereals and other food sources - will be housed in the special cryostorage unit in Yakutsk, the coldest city on the planet. It will enable scientists to protect many of the world's important foods and endangered plant life against climate change, war, and disaster, reported The Siberian Times. In 2008 a similar vault was created in Norway, but the new facility in northern Siberia is the only one of its kind that solely uses the unique natural permafrost cooling system. There is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples on the site, in the Sakha Republic, but a new purpose-built extension will turn it into the largest anywhere on the planet. Georgy Kuzmin, lead researcher of the Permafrost Institute - part of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences - said: 'The project does not use any machinery or electricity or gas. 'It only uses natural cold and, respectively, the operating costs are minimal.' The first part of the cryostorage facility in Yakutsk was opened in December 2012, some 35 years after Soviet scientists began an experiment in a mine at the Permafrost Institute. There is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples on the site, but a new extension will mean many more seeds can be stored . The vault will be able to accommodate 1.5million seed samples, and will be filled with collections from Russia and the rest of the world . Scientists in Siberia will be able to keep a stockpile of common seeds for up to 100 years without needing to replant them . Temperatures in Yakutsk's permafrost caves are so low that quirky ice sculptures like this office scene this can be made . Yakutsk has an average winter temperature of -34C, making it the coldest major city in the world . Brrr-ight idea: The vault is in Yakutsk, the coldest city on the planet - which is more than 3,000 miles from the Russian capital Moscow . At a depth of 12 metres they began the long-term storage of seeds from legumes at a temperature of about -7C using just the natural cold from permafrost. Scientists were able to prove that seeds can be stored at that temperature, rather than colder, without losing any of their germinating capacity. Later, about 1,000 seeds from crops common in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, were added to the vault along with some endemic, rare and endangered plant species. By the time the new facility opened in 2012, there were 11,000 samples and there is now currently space for about 100,000 seeds from around Russia. The unique building does not use any fans or pumps to keep the temperature under the ground cool and instead simply relies on the natural cold air. The new phase will be able to accommodate 1.5million seed samples, and will be filled with collections from Russia and the rest of the world. Scientists aim to preserve many of the most endangered species of plants as well as keep a stockpile of common seeds for up to 100 years that they won't need to replant. They will be placed inside special sealed glass containers, with the freezing temperatures outside preserving them in a giant natural refrigerator. There is a similar storage laboratory in Svalbard, in Norway, but it relies upon artificial cooling measures as well as permafrost to lower temperatures to -18 degrees Celsius. This, according to scientists in Siberia, makes it less safe because of the dangers of a power outage posing a risk to the ability to keep the facility cool. Global warming may also raise the temperatures of the Norwegian ice fields and melt the permafrost, something that is not possible in the Sakha Republic. Nikolai Goncharov, from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk, said: 'When global temperatures get warmer by five degrees, the glaciers on Svalbard will melt. 'To melt the permafrost in Yakutia temperatures need to rise by about 20 degrees. 'So we have quite a unique situation in which the permafrost can create storage in natural conditions that will keep the desired temperature. 'It is an eternal, and environmentally-friendly, system that cannot be affected by any disasters.'","Pioneering facility will use the natural cold of Siberia's thick permafrost to preserve samples for up to 100 years .

He wanted every aspect of  it to be perfect, . so I was able to locate a diamond of the finest quality and cut it to an . exact custom size and shape to suite Angelina's hand. He continued: 'Brad was always . heavily involved, overseeing every aspect of the creative design . evolution. 'The side diamonds are specially cut to encirlce her finger. Each diamond is of the highest gem quality.' Experts estimate the ring cost around $250,000. Angelina's father Jon Voight was among the first to publicly congratulate the pair, telling Us Weekly: 'I'm very happy for them.' Power couple: The Hollywood pair, pictured together here at the Oscars in Los Angeles back in February, have been together for seven years . Lord of the rings: Brad gave Jennifer Aniston a diamond and platinum engagement ring (right) in 1999. The actor is believed to have co-designed it with jeweler Silvia Damiani, with an estimated value of $500,000 . Angelina has been married twice before - to . British actor Jonny Lee Miller between 1996 and 1999 and then Billy Bob Thornton, from 2000 to 2003. Brad's marriage to Jennifer Aniston . lasted five years before they announced they were divorcing in early 2005 - which came after he had met Angelina on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith. Brangelina . - as they became known - quickly became a Hollywood power couple, with a . brood of six children; five-year-old Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne, aged three, along with three adopted children Maddox, 10, Pax, eight, and Zahara, seven. Showing her appreciation: Angelina was wearing the ring during her visit to the museum on Wednesday, where she looked at significant works from the LACMA's art collection . Delightful day: The couple mingled with fellow guests and enjoyed a buffet of drinks and food laid on . The couple once insisted they wouldn't wed until the legalisation of same-sex marriage in America. Beverly Hills jeweller Robert Procop worked closely with Brad Pitt on the engagement ring for more than 12 months. He has been the private jeweller to Angelina Jolie for over a decade and collaborated with the actress for Style of Jolie – a jewellery collection auctioned off for charity last year. He is the former CEO of Asprey & Garrard, the British jewellery firm which has worked with the English royal family. But Brad recently admitted he didn't feel they'd be to wait that long because of mounting pressure from their children. 'It seems to mean more and more to our kids,' he said in January. 'We . made this declaration some time ago that we weren't going to [get . married] till everyone can. But I don't think we'll be able to hold out … . it means something to me, too, to make that kind of commitment.' Angelina has also said that their children often ask why they aren't married like 'Shrek and Fiona'. She said just months ago: 'We've . explained to them that our commitment, when we decided to start a . family, was the greatest commitment you could possibly have. 'Once you have six children, you're committed.' Their high-profile romance has made headlines since sparks first flew on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith back in 2004. There was intense speculation they started up a relationship while Brad was still with his then-wife Jennifer Aniston. Brad . and Jen announced they were divorcing in early 2005 - but it wasn't . until early 2006 that Angelina and Brad acknowledged their relationship . when the actress revealed she was pregnant. In October 2008, Angelina told The New . York Times that her children loved Mr & Mrs Smith because: 'Not a . lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love.' Happy family: 'Brangelina' have six children, three biological and three adopted, seen here in New Orleans in March last year . However, the actress has maintained that . she and the heartthrob remained nothing more than friends until after . Pitt and Aniston announced they were divorcing. She once said: 'To be intimate with a . married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I . could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.' Angelina also said in a 2006 interview . with U.S. Vogue that when she met the actor, she had not known 'exactly . where Brad was in his personal life.' She said: 'But it was clear he was with . his best friend, someone he loves and respects. And so we were both . living, I suppose, very full lives. Chemistry: The pair met on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, which was released in 2005 . 'Brad was a huge surprise to me,' she . added. 'I think we were the last two people who were looking for a . relationship. I certainly wasn't. I was quite content to be a single . mom.' The star also said that she and Brad had taken a 'long time' before deciding to embark on a relationship. 'We spent a lot of time contemplating . and thinking and talking about what we both wanted in life and realised . that we wanted very, very similar things,' she said. Former flames: Angelina previous two marriages both lasted just three years, left with first husband Jonny Lee Miller, centre, with Billy Bob and, right, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, who he was married to for five years . 'And then we just continued to take time. We remained very, very good friends - with this realisation - for a long time. Angelina sought to explain how the film, a romantic comedy action film, had 'brought' she and Brad together. 'Because of the film, we ended up being . brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this . strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly . happened,' she said. 'I think a few months in I realised, ""God, I can't wait to get to work.""' Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie may have already picked out the perfect location for their nuptials. The pair are believed to be building a huge reception hall behind a chapel on their £35million estate in the South of France. Aerial image of the construction site in February show a large white building being erected next to the quaint chapel which is part of their Provence chateau. The perfect location? A huge white reception hall is being erected behind a chapel on their £35million estate in the South of France . It is believed that builders are working hard to have the venue ready for September. The couple are also understood to have visited the site to check on progress over the weekend. They were already in France to attend . the Paris premiere of Angelina’s directorial debut In the Land of Blood . and Honey on February 16. The pair purchased the Miraval . property but are yet to move in as the sprawling estate has already . undergone a series of renovations. Of course, the country is dear to the couple's hearts with Angelina giving birth to their twins in Nice in 2008.","A-list couple say their six children are 'very happy'

"The Syrian Electronic Army is believed to be behind a cyber attack on a series of high-profile websites after exploiting an ad network that runs on the sites. Visitors to the sites, including the Independent and the Daily Telegraph, saw random pop-up messages accompanied by a blank screen that says 'you have been hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA)'. The message appeared on websites for several UK newspapers, as well as CNBC and the National Hockey League. It also showed up briefly on some retail sites just as they prepared for the biggest shopping day of the year on Friday. The Syrian Electronic Army is believed to be behind a cyber attack on a series of high-profile websites after exploiting an ad network that runs on the sites . SEA is a state-sponsored organisation based in war-torn Syria that attacks public targets in order to gain publicity and promote its cause in the name of president Bashar Al-Assad. It has previously taken credit for hacking sites including the New York Times, Huffington Post, the Guardian, Microsoft, Reuters and the BBC. The latest cyber attack, which is thought to have potentially affected up to 700 firms, was based around an ad network that runs on the various sites. A Twitter account affiliated with the Syrian group posted an . image  that appeared to show it accessed the GoDaddy . account of gigya.com, a company that helps businesses identify . those who visit their websites. Gigya counts the NFL, NBA and NHL professional sports . leagues, and media outlets including the CBC, CBS, NBC, Forbes, . CNN, al Jazeera and Fox among its customers. It was not . immediately clear how many of them were affected. In a blog post, Gigya CEO Patrick Salyer said the company discovered 'sporadic failures with access to our service'. SEA has previously taken credit for hacking sites including the New York Times, Huffington Post, the Guardian, Microsoft, Reuters and the BBC . The executive said hackers had rerouted Internet traffic from Gigya's website to an outside computer server. That server generated the message saying that their site had been hacked by the SEA. The hackers rerouted Gigya's web traffic by tweaking the company's web address on Internet registry Whois.com so that it would point visitors to the outside server. Mr Salyer said the registry entry on Whois.com was fixed about an hour after the company detected the breach, and the executive sought to reassure the company's clients. He said: 'To be absolutely clear: Neither Gigya's platform itself nor any user, administrator or operational data has been compromised and was never at risk of being compromised,' he wrote.

"Andy Murray’s eyes blazed with furious intensity. He glanced up towards the familiar faces that have long accompanied him on these journeys to gladiatorial extremes. ‘Don’t worry about him,’ he muttered. ‘He does this all the time.’ Indeed he does. Novak Djokovic wins the Australian Open all the time. He beats Murray all the time, too; certainly of late. These qualities, combined in Melbourne, became close to irresistible. So Murray was right. Djokovic does this all the time. What does he do? He does Murray. Like a kipper. If this felt different to those other occasions it was because a third Grand Slam title was within Murray’s grasp. That may sound strange, considering he lost the fourth and final set 6-0. Novak Djokovic won his fifth Australian Open title on Sunday after beating Andy Murray in Melbourne . Murray eyes up Djokovic and his Australian Open trophy during the post-match presentations . Champion Novak Djokovic (left) lifts the  trophy while  Andy Murray (right) lifts the second place gong . Murray shouts out in frustration after losing a point during the first set tiebreak in Melbourne . Following his defeat, Murray sat down and promptly smashed two of his rackets on the ground . Yet Murray was serving to go 5-2 up in the first set tie-break, he won the second set and was a break up in the third. He failed, he said, because he became distracted. And what distracted him? That thing Djokovic does all the time. He was referring to a spell in the third set when his opponent gave every indication of being on his last legs. He limped, he grimaced in pain, he fell awkwardly after a couple of points, almost as if his knees had given way beneath him. It looked like a serious injury. Murray said he was under the impression Djokovic was cramping. And he let that news affect his game. By the time he realised Djokovic was either a gifted thespian, or had powers of recovery that would make Lazarus look like a hypochondriac, the momentum had been snatched away. Djokovic came roaring back, hence Murray’s urgent desire to refocus. It was too late. From appearing to be on the brink of conceding the match — in spirit, if not literally — Djokovic shed his woolly outer layer and bared his teeth. He won the last nine games of the match, straight, turning 3-3 into 6-3 in the third and winning the fourth set to love. It is his fifth Australian Open title, bettered only by Roy Emerson. Murray, meanwhile, claimed not to be greatly distressed by the bagel. It was the third set that troubled him. Djokovic lifts his trophy after wining a remarkable fifth title in his fifth final in Australia . Murray congratulates 2015 Australian Open champion Djokovic after the match . ‘In the fourth he was ripping everything, going for everything and it was going in,’ he said. ‘He got a break up and just let loose. The third was more frustrating. I got distracted. I let what was happening at the other end bother me.’ This may seem a strange explanation. What, after all, is so bad about being a break up and feeling your opponent was about to capitulate? Well, exactly that. Murray said he started feeling too good about the way the match was going and for 10 minutes his focus dropped. ‘Maybe the occasion had something to do with it,’ he added. In a nutshell, he fancied his chances of at last landing this prize after three losing final appearances. He let himself get sucked in and by the time the real Djokovic showed himself, Murray had settled into a complacent groove. It was his fault. He has played in enough matches not to surrender concentration and has indeed been accused of a similar tactic by rivals, exaggerating injuries or discomfort to encourage a false sense of security. British No 1 Murray returns a serve during the opening set of the Australian Open final . Murray slams his racket down in the net in anger after being broke in the second set . Within reason, there are no rules against it. Djokovic didn’t exactly take a dive and if Murray was mentally preparing his winner’s speech when he should have been staring down the No 1 player in the world, that is a tactical blunder of grand proportions. He will know better next time. And there is bound to be a next time. What cannot be ignored, amid the disappointment, is how far Murray has come since back surgery last year. If he ran out of resistance here, it was probably because the first three sets had taken three hours and 12 minutes to complete, and Djokovic was making his usual demands, physical and mental. The baseline rallies were quite immense. The difference between the elite quartet that dominate modern tennis, and the bulk of the field, can be measured in time. It might take three or four returns to gain a point from Tomas Berdych or Marin Cilic. Djokovic insists on greater investment. He uses the initial flurry of returns to get his range. Then he beds in. Epic slugfests are required just to secure a lousy 15-all. The first set took close to one-and-a-quarter hours to complete. The second was longer. Both went to tiebreaks, and Murray’s regrets will begin there. He raced into a 4-2 lead in the first, and was serving to secure a three-point advantage. What a time to record his first double fault of the match. A lengthy rally then ended with Murray hitting the net and he was long for the next point. From serving to lead 5-2, he was now 5-4 down. The shot that surrendered the set — 7-5 in the tie-break — was a tame return from Djokovic’s second serve. Murray had got into a winning position but had failed to win; against incredible competitors like Djokovic, such profligacy rarely goes unpunished. Yet, first, the revival. Murray took the second set after another mighty struggle that at one stage saw Djokovic win 13 consecutive points. Djokovic saved a set point with the score at 5-4 and just when Murray had four set points in the tie-break he hit arguably his poorest shot of the day, long with the court wide open, having manoeuvred his opponent into no man’s land. He recovered and closed it out 7-4 but the next 39 minutes decided the match. Murray began the third set by breaking Djokovic’s serve but then fell under his spell. Djokovic sprinted to the net but fell over and he later appeared to stumble forward as if afforded no balance when he served. Yet, reviewing the match, there were clues that this might be a temporary condition. Djokovic’s passing shot to secure his first point of the set was so magnificent, Murray exclaimed ‘oh no’. When he broke back to level the score at 2-2, Murray was so unnerved he struck a ball high through the gap in the open roof of Rod Laver Arena. With the scores tied at 3-3, Murray earned a break point with an exquisite forehand pass. Djokovic saw saving that game — he played a neat drop shot at the net to take it to deuce — as the turning point of the match. He won every game from there and soon Murray was striking the ground with his racket in frustration. Fans of the British No 1 show their support at the Rod Laver Arena in Australia on Sunday . Murray's fiancee Kim Sears looks up at the big screen in Melbourne after they notice her choice of top . The British No 1 connects with a backhand shot during the second set in Sunday's Australian Open final . Naturally, Djokovic’s explanation for his revival was considerably more innocent than Murray’s claim that he was hoodwinked. ‘At the start of the third set, I was in trouble,’ he said. ‘I needed to regroup and get back on track. I started coming to the net more, shortening the points, because I was exhausted. I had no reason to call a time-out because I was not injured, but I just felt weak. I had a physical crisis. The first two sets had taken the energy from me. ‘I haven’t felt like that too many times in my career. There was a lot of emotion, a lot of tension, but it was a Grand Slam and I wasn’t going to give up. When we played in 2013 it was a similar match, very long from the start, and I felt I had the physical edge over him so I used that memory. ‘I had to earn the right to win and the willpower got me to where I am now. I think in these matches the mental strength plays the most important role. There are a lot of things that can influence your state of mind when you are down — but I wasn’t aware that Andy got distracted.’ The packed Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne during the final of the 2015 Australian Open . Crowds gathered at Federation Square in Melbourne to watch the final on big screens . Put like that, so succinctly and simply, it is hard to dispute Djokovic’s version of events. He was exhausted by a quite superb game of tennis — he also caught a virus during a recent tournament in Doha which may have left its mark — but dug deep and recovered. The final set was extraordinary. In both his semi-final against Stanislas Wawrinka and against Murray in the final, Djokovic has claimed victory with a 6-0 finish. Breaking Murray for the second time, to take the score to 3-0, Djokovic lifted his racket as if giving the arena permission to begin their celebrations. The job duly completed soon after, Murray shook hands, returned to his chair and stared straight ahead. ‘Don’t worry about him, he does this all the time,’ he may have reasoned; but it will have been scant consolation in the circumstances.","Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-0 in the Australian Open final .

"When car crash victim Natalie Lander came out a coma, she was given news which left her torn between joy and terror. With her own life still hanging in the  balance from a broken back and brain injuries, doctors announced she had been four weeks pregnant at the time of the accident – even though the mother of one believed she was unable to have any more children. It was still unclear whether she would walk or talk properly again, and doctors recommended she consider a termination. Survivor: Natalie with partner Marcus and children Alfie 4, and baby Max.

But she came . out of a coma, and doctors carried out a routine scan to check she was . not pregnant before starting further treatment – and it showed that she . was. It was all the more surprising because Mrs Lander has Polycistic Ovary Syndrome, which makes it difficult to conceive. She has a four-year-old son, Alfie, . but thought she couldn’t become pregnant again. Mrs Lander, from . Walsall, said: ‘When I found out I was pregnant, I was torn between . being overjoyed and terrified. 'I was so worried that Alfie wouldn’t have . a mum who could look after him properly, let alone another baby. ‘The doctors recommended that we could consider terminating the pregnancy, but we wanted to fight for our baby.’ She added: ‘I was terrified that the . accident would somehow have affected my baby.

'I was paralysed down my . left hand side, and could barely speak in more than a whisper because of . the damage to my vocal cords – nobody could tell me how far I would . recover.’ While pregnant, Mrs Lander underwent four months of  intensive physiotherapy, which helped her learn how to walk and talk again. ‘I was trying to concentrate on getting myself better, but I was so worried about the little baby growing inside me,’ she said. ‘Medics kept telling me he would be . fine, but I wouldn’t believe it until I held him in my arms.’ Max was . born in March, and after a lot of hard work both mother and baby are . doing well.

"Ed Miliband kicked off the final Labour party conference before next year's General Election by promising to set out his 'new plan' for British families 'yearning for change'. Addressing activists gathering in Manchester, the Labour leader claimed that the country 'doesn't work for most working people' and  insisted that Britain 'needs a change of government and we are going to do it'. Mr Miliband, speaking passionately at the impromptu gathering outside the Midland Hotel, also suggested that he was moving on swiftly from any alliance formed between parties in the lead up to the Scottish referendum. Scroll down for video . The leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, speaks to activists as he arrives at the Midland Hotel in Manchester today - with wife Justine visible in the audience (left) The conference season will be dominated by the fallout from the referendum result and the divisions between the three Westminster parties over how the next stage of devolution will happen. David Cameron and Mr Miliband have clashed over how to proceed, with the Prime Minister determined to make changes to ensure 'English votes for English laws' at Westminster as part of a package of reform - something that Labour fear will erode the influence of their Scottish MPs. The Labour leader indicated that he was moving on from the alliance forged between the three Westminster parties in the Scottish referendum campaign as he spoke in Manchester. He said: 'The last few months have been about keeping our country together. The next eight months are about how we change our country together. 'And we know that yearning for change is there right across our country. Constitutional change matters, but we know that something else matters even more: this country doesn't work for most working people and we, the Labour Party, are going to change it.' Mr Miliband, speaking at the start of the Labour Party Annual Conference in Manchester, was pictured arriving with wife Justine (right) Setting out his priorities, he said: 'This conference is about all of those families treading water, unable to benefit from the recovery. This conference is about all of those young people who worry about their future. 'And this conference is about our National Health Service sliding backwards under this Government. 'This week we set out Labour's plan for Britain's future: rewarding hard work, ensuring the next generation does better than the last, protecting and improving our public services. 'And this week we show how we are going to change Britain so it works for everyday working people and not just a privileged few at the top. Addressing activists, the Labour leader said the country 'doesn't work for most working people' 'Our plan starts today by showing how we build the homes our country needs, because so many young families are struggling to get on the housing ladder. 'We are going to change it so we build a future for all our young people throughout the United Kingdom. 'This is the last conference before the general election. Britain needs a new plan for you and your family, Britain needs a new government and we are going to make it happen and we are going to show how this week.' The Labour gathering in Manchester begins with a women's conference addressed by deputy leader Harriet Harman, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and shadow equalities minister Gloria De Piero, before the main conference gets under way tomorrow. In an interview with the Guardian, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the party will seek to fight the election on the twin issues of stagnant living standards and safeguarding the NHS. But he stressed that Labour would only pursue changes that are 'credible and costed', ruling out free universal child care in the next parliament, as well as free bus passes for 16 to 18-year-olds.","Labour leader delivered unexpected speech at Midland Hotel, Manchester .

"Safaris are famed for offering the chance to get up-close with the world's most amazing wildlife. But one couple had a closer brush with nature than intended, after they returned to their hotel room to find a giraffe drinking from their pool. Kali Sakai and her husband had booked a room for two at the Kariega Game Reserve in South Africa and made the discovery after returning from breakfast to find the unannounced guest making use of their facilities. Scroll down for video . Caught in the act: The couple returned back to their hotel room after breakfast to find the giraffe happily drinking from the pool . Quick drink: The couple were staying at the Kariega Game Reserve in South Africa when they experienced the 'exhilarating encounter' Awkward moment: The giraffe seemed a little startled when Kali used her camera to snap some pictures . Kali, 40, said: 'When I looked out the window, my brain tried to makes sense of what I was seeing but it didn't quite compute initially. It just didn't seem real or even possible.' The giraffe had managed to discover a private plunge pool raised off the ground and protected by foliage and decided it would serve as a good watering hole. Kali said: 'It was exhilarating. Even though I crawled to the window and was below the window line, when I stuck the camera up on the windowsill, the giraffe was a little startled. But it held its ground. 'I peeked over and flashed a giant smile in hopes of reassuring it. It kept sticking its tongue out as it studied me. It was hilarious. 'Clearly it thought there was no danger as it bent back down and continued to drink. Time to go: After drinking all it needed from the room's plunge pool, the giraffe trundled off back into the wildnerness . Final goodbye: The giraffe didn't disappear without a last turn back in which it appears to stick out its tongue . 'Our ranger later told us that they have seen this giraffe before in the chalet area. 'For some reason this giraffe is very bold, curious and thirsty. I don't think they chlorinate the water in the winter since it's way too cold to use.

"A teenage girl with mental health issues was kept in a police cell for two days because there were no free NHS beds in the whole country. The 16-year-old was detained by Devon and Cornwall officers on Thursday after allegedly causing a breach of the peace at Torbay Hospital. She was sectioned under the Mental Health Act on Friday. But there were no free beds for children with mental health issues in England, so she stayed in a cell. Police bought her McDonald’s food and her mother visited, bringing officers chocolates to thank them. Devon and Cornwall officers on Thursday took the 16-year-old girl into custody after an alleged breach of peace. NHS England last night eventually provided her with a 'local bed' (file photo) The issue was finally resolved last night when NHS England said she would be put in a ‘local bed’ at once. Earlier, Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton had revealed his frustration on Twitter, saying: ‘This can’t be right! … Custody on a Fri night is no place for a child suffering mental health issues. Nurses being sourced to look after her in custody!?’ Police can detain anyone having a mental health crisis for up to 72 hours, but problems arise if detainees need an inpatient bed. A report earlier this year found that there are fewer than 2,000 beds for young mental health patients in England. MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, described the delay in finding a bed as ‘abhorrent’.","Detained by Devon and Cornwall officers after an alleged breach of peace .

"Caroline Foxley, pictured yesterday, as she was led away in handcuffs after being locked up over fears she was planning to evade jail for benefit fraud by fleeing to Russia . Handcuffed to a prison officer, wealthy benefits cheat Caroline Foxley heads to custody following fears she was preparing to flee to Russia. The 59-year-old was suspected of trying to leave the country ahead of her sentencing after attempting to move £40,000 to a bank in Moscow. A court heard she had also made a fresh application to claim benefits within a day of being convicted last month of illegally taking £20,000 in handouts for ‘pocket money’. The ‘greedy’ mother-of-two used the welfare system even though she had cash in a Swiss bank from the £306,000 sale of a Cotswolds home which she used to fund her childrens’ expensive private school education. Foxley was on bail awaiting sentence when she was summoned back to court on Thursday amid fears she was preparing to flee the country. Prosecutors called for her bail to be rescinded after describing how she had also defied a court order to surrender her passport. Gloucester Crown Court was told how Foxley made contact on Tuesday with Swiss bank Habibsons, where she had deposited the remains of the money from the £306,000 property sale. She was said to have been ‘anxious’ to transfer £40,000 from the account to her son’s bank account in Moscow. Prosecutor Martin Steen said: ‘She still has her passport and is seeking to transfer funds to Moscow, perhaps in preparation for flight. She is also seeking to move it outside the realm where she may be able to make recompense for the loss.’ He added: ‘In the absence of her abiding by her bail conditions and taking steps to move money we are concerned she will not attend for sentence.’ Mr Steen said Habibsons had been contacted by the prosecution and had agreed not to make the money transfer. The court heard how Foxley also tried to claim Jobseeker’s Allowance and housing benefit last month, shortly after her conviction for benefit fraud. Mr Steen added: ‘She asserted she had very little funds. She said she had just £100 in one bank account. She made no mention at all of any other funds which may be available to her.’ Foxley used the money she received through falsely claiming benefits to pay fees to private schools, including Cheltenham Ladies College, for her children . Judge Jamie Tabor QC agreed to the prosecution’s request and remanded Foxley in custody until sentencing. He said: ‘This lady has been obtaining benefits for a long time and has a Swiss bank account with a lot of money in it. During her trial, Foxley, pictured, was described as 'greedy' and 'thoroughly dishonest' for claiming the handouts, despite having over £300,000 in a Swiss bank account . ‘It would appear it has still got a bit of money in it because she tried to move it earlier this week.’ During her trial, Foxley admitted that the Swiss bank account was in her name, but regarded the money from the sale of the house bought by her late partner as ‘in trust’ for him and, after his death, for their children. She claimed she did not use the money except to pay for schooling and other expenses for her children. But trial prosecutors said the money disqualified her from benefits that are only open to those with assets of less than £16,000. Foxley had once qualified for income support, Jobseeker’s Allowance, council tax and housing benefits but only until March 30, 2007 – when she earned £306,000 from the sale of the house near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. She paid the money into a bank account in India and began using it to pay for schooling at Malvern College, Bloxham School in Banbury and Cheltenham Ladies’ College – where fees start at more than £21,000 a year. The remainder of the money was then ‘spirited away’ to Zurich. Referring to Switzerland’s tight-lipped bankers as ‘the Gnomes of Zurich’, trial prosecutor Stephen Mooney suggested Foxley was keen to make the most of the country’s famously secretive finance laws. He added: ‘No doubt she was taking advantage of the notorious and well-documented reluctance of the Gnomes of Zurich to give out information about their bank accounts.’ Mr Mooney said Foxley had treated the benefits as ‘pocket money to top up a wealthy lifestyle.’","Caroline Foxley, 59, was convicted of falsely claiming welfare benefits .

"A convicted Arizona serial killer whose body was discovered last month in an isolation cell committed suicide by overdosing on antidepressants, it was revealed today. Dale Hausner, 40, was found guilty in a series of random shootings on pedestrians, bicyclists and animals that terrorized the Phoenix area between 2005 and 2006. The former airport janitor was given six death sentences and hundreds of years in prison for shooting dead six people and attacking 19 others in the course of 14 months. Final act: Convicted serial killer Dale Hausner, pictured left during his initial court appearance in 2006 and right in his booking shot, committed suicide last month by overdosing on antidepressants . Death in gaol: Hausner was found dead his cell at the Eyman state prison complex in Florence June 19 . Hausner was found unresponsive June 19 in his cell at the Eyman state prison complex in Florence. He was pronounced dead about an hour later at a hospital in Anthem, according to Arizona Department of Corrections officials. Forensic pathologist Dr. Gregory Hess, of the Pinal County Medical Examiner's Office, said the cause of death was ‘amitriptyline intoxication.’ Amitriptyline is one of a variety of antidepressant medications sold under the brand name Elavil . A toxicology report stated that Hauser had more than 50 times the recommended dose of the drug in his system. Prison officials said it wasn't immediately clear how Hausner obtained the antidepressants. DOC officials said the department was conducting a complete investigation into the circumstances of Hausner's death and the autopsy report was part of that probe. Silent killer: Hausner's cause of death was 'amitriptyline intoxication.' Amitriptyline is one of a variety of antidepressant medications sold under the brand name Elavil . The report stated that Hausenr had left a suicide note, but its contents have not been revealed. Attorney Tim Agan, who represented Hausner during the trial told the station AZ Central that his former had been contemplating suicide for years, and that his fellow inmates on Death Row knew that he was stockpiling drugs. ‘My understanding is the other inmates knew it was coming,’ Agan said. Hausner always denied any involvement in the attacks and suggested his former roommate might have carried out some of the crimes. Hausner was arrested in August 2006 with his roommate, Sam Dieteman, at the apartment they shared in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. Inside, police found guns, news clippings of the killings and a city map marked with the locations of some of the shootings. Dieteman, who pleaded guilty in two of the killings and was sentenced to life in prison, testified against Hausner, saying they cruised around late at night looking for strangers to shoot. The ‘serial shooter’ attacks and an unrelated ‘Baseline Killer’ case kept neighborhood watch groups on high alert in the summer of 2006. Families stayed inside and authorities called meetings that drew hundreds of people. Outlaws: Hausner (left) was arrested in August 2006 with his roommate, Sam Dieteman (right), who pleaded guilty in two of the killings and was sentenced to life in prison . Death wish: Since his convictions, Hausner had waived his appeals and asked in a letter to the court 'to be executed as soon as possible' Police said their big break came when one of Dieteman's drinking buddies called police to say Dieteman had bragged about shooting people. On March 13, 2009, Hausner was convicted of 80 crimes, including six counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, cruelty to animals and other charges, according to the station AZ Family. Last victim: Hausner shot dead Robin Blasnek, 22, in Mesa on July 30, 2006, marking the end of his bloody rampage . Hausner was found guilty of murdering David Estrada, Nathaniel Shoffner, Jose Ortis, Marco Carillo, Claudia Gutierrez-Cruz, and Robin Blasnek. Even though Hausner had denied any involvement, he took an odd turn during the penalty phase of his trial when he apologized to the families of every victim. Since his convictions, Hausner had waived his appeals and asked in a letter to the court ‘to be executed as soon as possible.’ The 40-year-old inmate was scheduled to attend a hearing to determine if he was competent to waive the appeals. Dale Hausner’s brother Randy said, ‘It’s a shame it happened this way rather than the victims getting a final say at his execution, but either way, it’s over.’ County authorities have said that while he was awaiting trial in 2006, Hausner tried to kill himself with an overdose of cold tablets. Following Hausner's death last month, his most recent lawyer, Garrett Simpson, said, ‘I have rarely met a person who had a more miserable life. ‘He was a very wounded soul, and I am really sorry his life worked out like that, and that's taking nothing from the appalling losses that were afflicted.’ 2005 .

"An amateur mixed martial arts fighter at a Spokane event on Friday attempted a spectacular maneuver: an off-the-cage roundhouse kick aimed right at his unwitting opponent's face. It failed spectacularly. Instead of landing his kick, the ill-fated go-getter wound up landing face first in the middle of the ring. That left him wide open for his opponent to leap in and pummel him, which the opponent did.

"Killed: Ahmed Samir Assem, 26, was shot dead on Monday in Cairo . Shocking footage has captured the moment an Egyptian photographer filmed his own death through his lenses. The grainy footage shows an Egyptian solider aiming and shooting at Ahmed Samir Assem, before the film goes black. The 26-year-old photojournalist was shot dead on Monday as he took photos outside the Republican Guard building in Cairo, where some believe the ousted president Mohamed Morsi is being held. He was one of at least 51 people killed when security forces opened fire on a . large crowd that had camped outside. Mr Assam, a freelance photographer was working for Egypt's Al-Horia Wa Al-Adala newspaper. 'At . around 6am, a man came into the media centre with a camera covered in . blood and told us that one of our colleagues had been injured,' said . Ahmed Abu Zeid, the culture editor of Mr Assem’s newspaper told The Daily Telegraph. 'Around an hour later, I received . news that Ahmed had been shot by a sniper in the forehead while filming . or taking pictures on top of the buildings around the incident. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Shocking footage has captured the moment an Egyptian photographer filmed his own death through his lenses . 'Ahmed’s camera was the only one which filmed the entire incident from the first moment. 'He . had started filming from the beginning of the prayers so he captured . the very beginnings and in the video, you can see tens of victims. Ahmed’s camera will remain a piece of evidence in the violations that . have been committed.' The military claimed it opened fire because a ‘terrorist group’ attacked in an attempt to storm the building. Terrifying: The grainy footage captures two soldiers on the roof of a building in Cairo . Filming: The footage zooms in and out as photographer Ahmed Samir Assem surveys the scene . Planning: The soldier disappears out of sight behind the yellow stone building . Horrifying: He then reappears with his gun ready for action before he aims at the photographer . Moment of death: The grainy footage captures a solider aiming and shooting at Ahmed Samir Assem, before the film goes black . But Mr Morsi’s supporters said the shootings were unprovoked. In an emotional news briefing, Muslim Brotherhood members branded military chief General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi an ‘assassin and a butcher’. But Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the . country’s top Muslim cleric, urged Egyptians to ‘shoulder their . responsibility to stop the bloodshed’ instead of ‘dragging the country . into civil war’. Al-Shaimaa Younes, who was at the . sit-in, said military troops and police forces opened fire on the . protesters during early morning prayers. Tragic: Mr Assem was working as a photographer for an Egyptian newspaper . 'They opened fire with live . ammunition and lobbed tear gas,' she said by telephone. 'There was panic . and people started running. I saw people fall.' 'Women and children had been among the protesters, she said. Today Egyptian authorities escalated their crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood by ordering the arrest of its spiritual leader, while the group remained steadfast in its defiance of the new military-backed administration and refused offers to join an interim government. The prosecutor's arrest warrant . issued for the Brotherhood's supreme guide, Mohammed Badie, as . well as nine other leading Islamists will almost certainly stoke anger . among the group's supporters and fellow Islamists. The men are suspected of instigating . the violence on Monday, according to a statement . issued by the prosecutor general's office. Even as the new prime minister began reaching out to form a Cabinet and restore a measure of stability, the military-backed leadership has come under fierce criticism from those who supported its toppling of President Mohammed Morsi last week . Several groups in the loose coalition participating in the political process have sharply criticized the transitional plan, saying that sidelines them in the transition. After a week of violence and mass demonstrations, Egyptians were hoping that the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday will significantly calm the turmoil in the streets. The sunrise-to-sunset fast cuts down on activity during the day, but the daily protests have been largely nocturnal affairs, and some observers expect the Islamist camp will likely use it to rally its base. Still, the warrants highlight the . military's zero-tolerance policy toward the Brotherhood and other . Islamists, who continue to hold daily mass protests and sit-ins . demanding reinstating Morsi and rejecting what they describe as a . military coup. The military already has jailed five . of Brotherhood leaders, including Badie's powerful deputy Khairat . el-Shater, and shut down their media outlets. Morsi himself remains in . custody in an undisclosed location. In the face of Islamist opposition, . the military-backed interim president, Adly Mansour, issued a fast-track . timetable on Monday for the transition. His declaration set out a . 7-month timetable for elections but also a truncated, temporary . constitution laying out the division of powers in the meantime. The accelerated process was meant, in . part, to send reassurances to the U.S. and other Western allies that . the country is on a path toward democratically-based leadership. Army snipers were caught on camera shooting at a large crowd of Egyptian men this morning . The crowd of Morsi supporters had assembled in the square in the early hours of the morning. At least 51 people were killed . But it has faced opposition from the . very groups that led the four days of mass protests that prompted the . military to step in last Wednesday. The top liberal political grouping, . the National Salvation Front, expressed reservations over the plan late . Tuesday, saying it was not consulted - 'in violation of previous . promises' - and that the declaration 'lacks significant clauses while . others need change or removal.' It did not elaborate but said it had . presented Mansour with changes it seeks. The secular, revolutionary youth . movement Tamarod that organized last week's protests, also criticized . the plan, in part because it gives too much power to Mansour, including . the power to issue laws. A post-Morsi plan put forward by Tamarod called . for a largely ceremonial interim president with most power in the hands . of the prime minister. At the heart of liberals' objections . is that they wanted to write a new constitution, not amend the one . written under Morsi by an Islamist-dominated panel. That constitution . contained several articles that drew fierce criticism from liberal . quarters, and helped sparked street protests and violence in 2012. Other objections centered on superpowers of the interim president. However, the only Islamist party that backed military's ouster of Morsi . after millions took to the streets on June 30 demanding him to leave, . has been vetoing rewriting the constitution. Meanwhile, new Prime Minister Hazem . el-Beblawi, who was appointed by the interim president on Tuesday, is . holding consultations on a Cabinet that will face the difficult task of . guiding the deeply divided country through what promises to be a rocky . transition period. In what is seen as an attempt at reconciliation, . el-Beblawi has said he will offer the Brotherhood, which helped propel . Morsi to the presidency, posts in his transitional government. A Brotherhood spokesman said the . group will not take part in an interim Cabinet, and that talk of . national reconciliation under the current circumstances is 'irrelevant.' He spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his . security.","Grainy footage captures the soldier .

"Martin Sculpher said he joined the EDL, pictured clashing with police in Birmingham, after feeling 'let down' by politicians in the wake of the 7/7 attacks . A tube worker who cut the bodies of victims from the mangled wreckage at Edgware Road station in the wake of the 7/7 bombings claims he is 'fighting to protect Britain' after joining the English Defence League. Martin Sculpher, who was publicly honoured for his bravery, has turned to the far-right group after becoming disillusioned by politicians in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. The 52-year-old from east London believes by aligning himself with the group, which stages protests against what it sees as the spread of Islamic extremism, he is fighting to protect the country's future. He told The Sunday Times he joined because he felt 'let down' by ministers including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who 'pontificated about terror in London' with their 'heads in the clouds' about 'what's going on in this country'. Mr Sculpher, who met his wife through the EDL, does not feel guilty about being a member of the radical group, dismissing the idea they incite racial hatred blaming the media for its bad reputation. He said: 'It is not racist to challenge a radical ideology of Islam.' The father said the group was in its infancy and that it would make mistakes, adding 'I hate the Nazi element as much as I hate radical Islam'. Prior to his career on the London Underground, Mr Sculpher worked as a bomb disposal apprentice at the Ministry of Defence. When terrorist bombers Mohammed Sidique . Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Hasib Hussain and Germaine Lindsay, struck on . July 7, 2005, Mr Sculpher was head of the Underground's emergency . response unit. Mr Sculpher led a response team at Edgware Road tube station, crawling under the wreckage of the twisted carriage to cut the bodies of victims free from the tunnel . He was alerted to the bomb detonated at Edgware Road station by ringleader Khan, killing six people. He . led a response team to the scene and crawled under the mangled wreckage . of the train to help search for victims and free bodies from the . twisted carriage. Richard . Barnes, who chaired the London Assembly inquiry into the tragedy, . publicly recognised Mr Sculpher and his colleagues' bravery. Mr . Sculpher was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake . of his experiences, leaving him suffering insomnia, weight loss and . nausea when he smelt burning meat. He turned to alcohol and by 2009 was living in a hostel for the homeless in Luton.

During treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder, Mr Sculpher said his therapist advised he read the Koran to learn more about the culture. But he said he was shocked by what he read. He joined the United Peoples of Luton, formed by Tommy Robinson. Staying with the group when it was renamed the English Defence League, Mr Sculper met his wife through it.

"Nigel Farage faced criticism tonight after demanding to be allowed to join other party leaders at the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph this weekend. The Ukip leader claimed millions of Ukip voters had been snubbed while leaders of smaller parties were allowed to attend. But a senior government source told MailOnline Mr Farage was wrong to make the sombre wreath laying ceremony 'all about him'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage hit out at the 'closed shop' of British politics which meant Ukip would not be represented at the Cenotaph ceremony . David Cameron will lead other politicians including Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Alex Salmond in laying wreaths after the Queen during Sunday's service. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport today insisted said the long-standing position was to invite a representative from parties with six or more MPs. Ukip only has a single member in the Commons, Clacton MP Douglas Carswell. However it won the European Parliament elections in May, and Ukip is targetting 100 seats in next year's general election. Mr Farage complained that the 'closed shop' of the British political system prevented him from attending the event. He said: 'I think it's actually quite a snub to all the millions of people that have voted Ukip.' Prime Minister David Cameron will lead other politicians in laying wreaths after the Queen during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony . Speaking on his LBC phone-in, Mr Farage said: 'We're not invited and I could say to you that personally I would like to be because this is a subject that I care very deeply about. 'But what I think is, the whole point about political representation at the Cenotaph is it's not the politician that matters, it's the voters behind the politician that matter. 'And in the last national election Ukip got 4.4 million votes and none of those people are being represented on Sunday despite the fact there are political parties with far smaller votes than that being represented.' He added: 'Whether it's me or somebody else doesn't really matter. But I do think that we won the last election we should have had some representation on Sunday. And I think it's actually quite a snub to all the millions of people that have voted Ukip.' Mr Farage said it was for the Government to invite him 'but I'm afraid with this as with everything else, British politics operates like a closed shop and they don't' want anyone new to get involved'. 'Well they're in for a terrible shock and I'll tell you something, Ukip will be there next year.' But a senior government source said: 'How dare Nigel Farage make the day of remembrance and the laying of wreaths all about him? It tells you all you need to know about him.' The Ukip leader also expressed surprise that eBay had halted auctions for the Tower of London poppies - and admitted he wanted to use the website to buy one himself. Mr Farage also called for the Tower of London poppies to be allowed to stay for longer to give more people chance to see them . All the 888,246 ceramic flowers used in the Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red installation have sold for £25 each through Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the Tower, with the proceeds going to service charities. The internet auction site has cancelled any listings for the items following reports that one user had listed two of the poppies for sale, one at GBP49.99 and the other for GBP65. An eBay spokesman said: 'We are not permitting resale of the limited edition Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red ceramic poppies on eBay.' But Mr Farage said: 'I was very surprised to hear that eBay had done that, because whatever you think, you may say it's insensitive, but hang on - when people bought these poppies there was no commercial contract that said they couldn't sell them on. 'So I'm rather surprised by this. I have a slight confession, I didn't get in in time to buy any, nearly everyone I work with has got some, but I said to the children 'don't worry, we'll buy them on eBay in a few weeks time'.'","Nigel Farage claims millions of Ukip voters have been snubbed .

"Black Friday fatigue is setting in. Early discounting, more online shopping and a mixed economy meant fewer people shopped over Thanksgiving weekend, the National Retail Federation said Sunday. Overall, 133.7 million people shopped in stores and online over the four-day weekend, down 5.2 percent from last year, according to a survey of 4,631 people conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics for the trade group. Total spending for the weekend is expected to fall 11 percent to $50.9 billion from an estimated $57.4 billion last year, the trade group estimated. Scroll down for video . Crazy: Discount store shoppers were prepared to wait in long lines on Black Friday - but the decision of many retailers to open on Thanksgiving has affected the sales figures for the busiest shopping day of the year . Part of the reason is that Target, J.C. Penney, Macy's, Wal-Mart and other major retailers pushed fat discounts as early as Halloween. Some opened stores even earlier on Thanksgiving. All that stole some thunder from Black Friday and the rest of the weekend. Still, the preliminary data makes retailers worried that shoppers remain frugal despite improving employment and falling gas prices. Matt Shay, the trade group's CEO, said he thinks people benefiting from the recovery may not feel the need to fight crowds to get the deepest discount on a TV or toaster. And those who feel like the recession never ended may not have the money and will stretch out what they spend through Christmas. And shoppers are still feeling the effects of high food prices and stagnant wages. 'While they're more optimistic, they're very cautious,' Shay said. 'If the deals are not right for them, they're not going to spend.' Bottom line: Expect more deep discounts, all season long. 'Every day will be Black Friday. Every minute will be Cyber Monday,' he said. Shoppers walk through a Best Buy Co. store in Peoria, Illinois ahead of Black Friday sales across the nation . That could be what it takes to get shoppers to open their wallets for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for about 20 percent of annual retail sales. Besides economic factors, people are becoming more discerning when they shop. Armed with smartphones and price-comparison apps, they know what's a good deal - and what's not. Kimani Brown, 39, of New York City, was among the Black Friday defectors. After four years of braving the crowds, the sales failed to lure him out this year. 'I consider myself a smart shopper. And it's not as alluring as it used to be,' Brown said. 'It's a marketing tool, and I don't want to be pulled into it.' He also said the frenzy pushed him to overspend, and he paid the price in January on his credit card statement. Instead, he said he will look online Monday, the online shopping day often called Cyber Monday. Some who went shopping on Thanksgiving felt they were doing it against their will. Cathyliz Lopez of New York City said she felt forced to shop on the holiday. 'It's ruining the spirit of Thanksgiving,' the 20-year-old said Thursday. 'But I was checking all the ads, and the best deals were today.' The National Retail Federation is still predicting a 4.1 percent increase in sales for the season. That would be the highest increase since the 4.8 percent gain in 2011. Some stores and malls had reason to be optimistic. Dan Jasper, a spokesman at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, said customer counts are up 5 to 6 percent for the four-day weekend. One plus: Shoppers were buying more for themselves, a sign of optimism. 'They felt confident in the economy,' he said. People get an early start on Black Friday shopping deals at a Walmart Superstore in Rosemead, California, as many retailers stayed opened during the Thanksgiving celebrations . CEOs at Target and Toys R Us said they saw shoppers not just focusing on the doorbuster deals but throwing extra items in their carts. Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren told The Associated Press on Friday that he's hoping lower gas prices will help spending. 'There's reason to believe that confidence should continue to grow. That should be good for discretionary spending,' he said. Some of those discretionary dollars are migrating online. Target said Thanksgiving saw a 40 percent surge in online sales and was its biggest online sales day ever. And Wal-Mart reported Thanksgiving was its second-highest online day ever, topped only by Cyber Monday last year. From Nov. 1 through Friday, $22.7 billion has been spent online, a 15 percent increase from last year, according to research firm comScore. On Thanksgiving, online sales surged 32 percent, while Black Friday online sales jumped 26 percent. In stores, shoppers spent $9.1 billion on Black Friday, according to research firm ShopperTrak, down 7 percent from last year. That was partly due to a 24 percent surge in Thanksgiving sales, to $3.2 billion. ShopperTrak estimated that in-store sales for the two days combined slipped half a percent to $12.29 billion.","Retailers blaming fall on stores opening on Thanksgiving now instead of day after .

"What appears to be the first 'true-colour image' of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has been revealed by Rosetta scientists. And in a surprising twist, rather than being the 'charcoal black' that Esa expected, the image suggests the ancient comet is in fact a dusty red. Up until now, all of the spectacular images of the comet seen by the public have been taken by Rosetta's Navcam, which can only capture images in grey-scale. Scroll down for video . True colours? The image, due to be released at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco on December 15, was taken by the taken by a Rosetta instrument dubbed Osiris. Up until now, most of the spectacular images of the comet have been released in gray-scale . But the latest image, which is being described as 'true-colour' by Redditors, reveals what the comet would look like if it was to be viewed by the naked eye. The image is due to be released at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco on December 15. It was taken by an instrument dubbed Osiris, which is a dual imaging system operating in the visible, near infrared and near ultraviolet wavelength ranges. While it doesn't have colour sensors, it does have filter wheels to allow engineers to select of imaging wavelengths in red, green and blue. 'Darker than coal: In September, the Alice instrument on Rosetta mapped the comet's surface, recording the first far-ultraviolet light spectra of the comet's surface.From the data, the Alice team said the comet is unusually dark - darker than charcoal-black - when viewed in ultraviolet wavelengths. Pictured is an artist's impression of what they believed it may look like . Each photo can then be combined to create a 'true colour' image. The latest image is blurred because the comet moved between exposures. A summary accompanying the image says: 'will discuss the colour variegation observed on the comet surface and its relationship to surface morphology and cometary activity'. According to Business Insider, this suggests the image is a colour composite made to emphasis various features on the comet's surface, rather than being 'true colour'. In September, the Alice instrument on Rosetta mapped the comet's surface, recording the first far-ultraviolet light spectra of the comet's surface. From the data, the Alice team said the comet is unusually dark - darker than charcoal-black - when viewed in ultraviolet wavelengths. Back from the dead: Philae (pictured) broke hearts earlier this month when, in its dying moments, it managed to send back valuable data from comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko . Philae broke hearts earlier this month when, in its dying moments, it managed to send back valuable data from comet 67P. But, all is not lost. Rosetta engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as March next year, as comet 67P gets closer to the sun. The probe is currently receiving an hour of sunlight during the comet's 12-hour day, with its batteries frozen in temperatures of -170°C. In a recent Reddit 'ask me anything' session, engineers at mission control said: 'Philae needs to be heated until we can think of starting to charge the battery. The batteries were meant to be recharged by solar panels, but because Philae hopped a couple of times after the first touchdown, it ended up in shadow. 'It is like trying to power your house with solar panels when you live in Alaska just below the Arctic Circle during the winter,' said Michael Maibaum, Philae systems engineer. Engineers claim the seasonal change toward spring in Philae's hemisphere will bring the probe into much more sunlight over the next few months. That, coupled with the fact that the comet is getting closer to the sun, should warm up the batteries enough to keep them charged. Stephan Ulamec, manager of the Philae lander, added that he was 'very optimistic' that it would soon wake up. The amount of science that the team will be able to do will depends on how long it takes to recharge the batteries, he said. 'We're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water-ice it shows,' said Alan Stern, Alice principal investigator at the time. This finding contradicts this latest picture of comet 67P, and Esa has yet to confirm whether this is a 'true colour' image. For several months, there has also been controversy over why colour images, and other data, from Rosetta's comet have been kept behind closed doors. 'The scientists who develop the instruments that are put on Rosetta have the right to use the data for their own purposes for six months – we have difficulties to even get pictures from them,' Paulo Ferri, Rosetta mission director told MailOnline. 'After six months, they will be open to the science community. But they are very, very cautious.' Mr Ferri says, 'there must be something big' in the image which has caused the secrecy up until now. He believe data from Rosetta could help explain how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. There has also been some controversy over why colour images of Rosetta's comet have been kept behind closed doors.'The scientists who develop the instruments that are put on Rosetta have the right to use the data for their own purposes for six months – we have difficulties to even get pictures from them,' Paulo Ferri, Rosetta mission director told MailOnline.

"The two women in Nelson Mandela’s life sat three seats apart at his memorial yesterday. Widow Graca Machel exchanged only a few words with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the woman she replaced.

The pair embraced for a few moments before Winnie took her seat at the start of the memorial . The two women, both wearing black . jackets, dresses and turbans, held on to each other for a few moments, . but while Winnie was smiling, Graca simply stared ahead, her face drawn. Both . women are hugely respected by many in South Africa and were loudly . cheered by the crowd in the stadium. Winnie is admired for her role in . the struggle against apartheid; Graca for the selfless grace with which . she looked after Mr Mandela in his old age having married him in 1998. Firebrand . Winnie has also attracted a great deal of criticism, not least in 1986 . for endorsing the violent practice of ‘necklacing’ – burning opponents . alive using tyres and petrol. In . 1988 she was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault . in connection with the death of a 14-year-old boy who was accused of . being an informer, but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine . on appeal. Winnie has also . maintained a tenacious grip on the Mandela legend. Although married to . him for 38 years, 27 of those were while he was imprisoned on Robben . Island. Graca Machel married Mandela (pictured together in 2002) on his 80th birthday and is commended for nursing him through years of ill health . Graca Machel, pictured with US President Barack Obama, was given a warm reception at the memorial . Their divorce was . finalised six years after he walked free, but Winnie fought the divorce . in court and still uses the Mandela name, having added it to her maiden . name. Winnie, who was Mr Mandela’s second wife, visited him occasionally . during the 181 days he was ill before his death. Graca, . the widow of former Mozambican president Samora Machel, spent every day . by his bedside.

Holomisa said he could feel the ‘tension’, but it was not clear if he . meant tension between the two women or just their shared concern for Mr . Mandela. ‘They said on the . phone that Madiba doesn’t look good,’ Mr Holomisa said. ‘I immediately . drove straight to his home and went to his bedroom.

"A father-of-two and self-confessed 'caveman' has undergone a dramatic transformation, shaving off his unkempt beard and cutting several inches off his hair, as part of Good Morning America's new Valentine's Day makeover series. Arron McCall, 41, a CrossFit gym owner from Peoria, Illinois, was volunteered for the program's Make Over My Man series by his wife Kelly, who confessed that she had grown tired of being unable to see her husband's face, thanks to his lengthy beard and messy hairstyle. 'It's been three years since I've seen my husband's face,' Mrs McCall told Good Morning America host Lara Spencer. Scroll down for video . Before: Arron McCall, from Peoria, Illinois, had been growing his beard for a number of years . After: The 41-year-old CrossFit trainer was almost unrecognizable after undergoing the GMA makeover . A new man: GMA's team of style experts revamped Mr McCall's entire look, from his hairstyle down to his shoes and socks . 'He looks kind of like a wild man right now. Sometimes it's difficult when we go to restaurants as a family - you can see people turning around to stare at him. 'He looks scary to some people.' The couple's two children were also in complete agreement about their father's look, with his daughter telling the GMA cameras: 'I tell my dad he looks like a hobo when he embarrasses me. 'Like when we're in public and he'll have food stuck in his mustache or something.' Even Mr McCall admitted that his style was perhaps more than a little dated, although added that being on the pulse in term's of the latest fashions and styles means little to him in his job as a CrossFit instructor and gym owner. 'So if I had to describe my look, I would say maybe it's ""caveman""?' he said. Family man: The father-of-two had an emotional reunion with his wife Kelly following the 60-minute makeover . Style icon: After emerging from the show's 'time machine', Mr McCall was met with rapturous applause from both his wife and the rest of the GMA audience members . Surprise! Mr McCall was only allowed to see his reflection after showing off his new look to his wife . And it wasn't just Mr McCall's hair and beard that were being made over by GMA's team of experts; many of his favorite wardrobe staples were also up on the chopping block. 'My husband's closet is all CrossFit or workout T-shirts,' his wife explained, while his daughter added: 'It's not OK for my dad to wear cat shirts.' Undoubtedly realizing that partaking in GMA's makeover program would save him years of nagging from his beloved wife, Mr McCall agreed to put himself in the hand's of the show's expert team of stylists, which included stylist Gretta Monahan, hair stylist Ted Gibson and makeup artist Carmindy. The team had their work cut out for them, after being given just one hour to completely transform Mr McCall in time to spend a romantic Valentine's Day week with his wife, but managed to perform a style miracle before revealing the fitness fanatic's new look. Decked out in a blue suit from Zara, plain white shirt and sunglasses, Mr McCall emerged from the program's 'time machine' to rapturous applause, pausing to greet his wife before checking out his new look for the first time.

'Oh my god, I don't recognize myself,' Mr McCall exclaimed after looking in a mirror for the first time since his makeover. 'He looks so different, he looks great,' Mrs McCall chimed in. 'It's the best present ever.' And it seems that Mr McCall felt just as positive about his transformation; after being quizzed by GMA host Ms Spencer about whether or not he was missing his once-lengthy locks, he insisted that he hadn't even thought about it 'yet'. The doting husband added that he would perhaps like to try and style his beloved cat T-shirt with his new look however, saying: 'I could definitely still wear the cat shirt.'","CrossFit trainer Arron McCall, 41, from Peoria, Illinois, was volunteered for the show's Make Over My Man for Valentine's Day series by his wife Kelly .

"The former president of Europe will get nearly £600,000 of taxpayers’ money for doing nothing, it was reported last night. Herman Van Rompuy, 67, is entitled to the money as a ‘transitional allowance’ over the next three years after finishing his term as European Council president yesterday – to help ‘ease’ him back into life outside Brussels. The Belgian politician will be paid £133,723 a year – 55 per cent of his basic salary – until December 2017, on top of his annual EU pension of £52,000. Herman Van Rompuy is entitled to the money as a ‘transitional allowance’ over the next three years after finishing his term as European Council president yesterday . The Daily Telegraph said last night that Mr Van Rompuy will also receive a £21,000 one-off payment. Under EU rules, Mr Van Rompuy does not have to do any work for his ‘transitional allowance’, which will be eligible for reduced-rate EU ‘community’ tax, rather than the Belgian income tax rate. Mr Van Rompuy has been replaced by Donald Tusk, who is being offered a package of pay and perks which total more than five times what he was earning as Polish Prime Minister. Labour peer Baroness Ashton, who finished her job as the European Commission’s High Representative of Foreign Affairs in October, is receiving the same £133,723 allowance –although, at 58, she is not entitled to a pension. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the payments showed the EU was a ‘racket which looks after its own'. Mr Farage, who in 2010 was fined £2,700 by the European Parliament after he said Mr Van Rompuy had the ‘charisma of a damp rag’, said: ‘Van Rompuy’s term in office has seen millions driven into poverty and unemployment by the eurozone crisis but he himself has hit the jackpot. ‘The EU is a racket which looks after its own.’ Mr Van Rompuy’s golden goodbye is one of several ‘transitional allowances’ being paid out to numerous European Commissioners who are standing down from the last Brussels executive - with the bill totalling £30 million. David Cameron clashed with Mr van Rompuy during his term in office, once calling a halt to a meeting in Downing Street after a disagreement . The Belgian has been replaced by Donald Tusk, who is being offered a package of pay and perks which total more than five times what he was earning as Polish Prime Minister. His wife Malgorzata persuaded Mr Tusk to leave Polish national politics despite his initial reluctance, because of the “prestige, better money and less problems at work”. In his first day in the job, Mr Tusk likened Eurosceptics to the military threat posed by Russia in Ukraine. He spoke of “threats to the EU coming both from outside and inside”, adding: ‘Today not only are eurosceptics questioning the EU’s value, we have also enemies, not only sceptic.’ Mr Van Rompuy, a former Belgian prime minister, plans to steer clear of frontline politics in his retirement. He has revealed he will be concentrating on his hobby of writing Haiku poetry - although he will give occasional lectures at the College of Europe in Bruges, which is a training school for EU officials. Labour peer Baroness Ashton is in line for a £133,723 allowance after finishing her job as the European Commission’s High Representative of Foreign Affairs in October. Former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has replaced Mr van Rompuy . Mr Van Rompuy has been no stranger to enjoying the perks of life as a top Brussels bureaucrat since taking on the post at the end of 2009. On one occasion four years ago, he faced criticism after using his official motorcade - made up of five limousines - to ferry himself and nine members of his family on 325-mile round trip from Brussels to Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport for a private holiday in the Caribbean. In June, Mr Van Rompuy clashed with British Prime Minister David Cameron and was ‘shown the door’ at Downing Street after talks about the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission. When Mr van Rompuy refused to guarantee a vote of all 28 EU leaders over whether Mr Juncker should be given the job, Mr Cameron declared there was ‘no point in continuing this meeting’. The European Union last night defended Mr Van Rompuy’s transitional allowance as “the price for the total independence” of senior European Union officials - adding that recipients of ‘transitional allowances’ must also “ask permission for any job they would like to do for 18 months after leaving”.","Ex-President of the European Council given a 'transitional allowance'

"Gordon Brown has pledged to remain a backbencher despite mounting calls for him to return to front-line politics in the wake of his barnstorming pro-Union speech. The former Labour prime minister is credited with stopping the nationalist poll surge in its tracks. Former Tory defence secretary Liam Fox said he had ‘played a blinder’ while Labour MP John Mann said it had been ‘Gordon Brown who won it’ – and that he should lead the party north of the border. Scroll down for video . No return: Rumours of Mr Brown's return started after he made a comment which some mistakenly interpreted as a hint he may want to stand as an MSP - but he denied any wish to return to mainstream politics . But Mr Brown, who still sits as an MP but is rarely seen in Westminster, says he has ‘no desire to return to the political stage’. On the final day of campaigning for the Union on Wednesday, the former Labour leader made a powerful speech, urging voters to ‘hold their heads high’ and vote No. Better Together believes it persuaded many Labour voters to return to the No camp, eclipsing the contribution made by Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor and leader of the Better Together campaign. Yesterday, Dr Fox praised Mr Brown’s ‘positive contribution’ to the battle, saying he became ‘more likeable’. He added: ‘I think he did play a blinder. ‘And I think what was interesting was when Gordon Brown, who can often seem very cold and calculating, when he actually got his teeth into something that mattered to him he became much more animated, and I think much more likeable as a person. ‘Probably a lesson in there for all of us.’ Speaking before the vote, Mr Mann said: ‘Next first minister or first prime minister? Certainly the person to lead Scottish Labour.’ Quiet life: Mr Brown, pictured casting his vote on Thursday, sits as an MP but is rarely seen in Westminster . For Mr Brown, who visited a primary school yesterday morning, a decision to stand in the Scottish Parliament would be a challenge to the present Labour leader north of the border, Johann Lamont. Rumours of a return started after he made a comment which some mistakenly interpreted as a hint he may want to stand as an MSP in the Scottish Parliament. He said: ‘If (Alex Salmond) continues to peddle this deception then I will want to join Johann Lamont in fighting him and securing the return of a Labour Government as quickly as possible.’ But on Tuesday, when he was asked if he was going to return to frontline Scottish politics, Mr Brown said: ‘No. I’m in this debate for one reason and one reason only. ‘This is an irreversible decision affecting the future of children in Scotland including my children. This is a decision which will be important for generations to come. This is not like an ordinary vote – this is no going back. ‘That is why I am in this debate and I have no desire to come back into mainstream politics.’","Tory Liam Fox said he 'played a blinder' in thumping pro-Union speech .

"ISIS militants have blocked all mobile phone networks in the largest Iraqi city they control, as they fear people may tip off coalition forces about their whereabouts. The move represents a change of tactic by the extremist organisation who, up until now, have tried to win support of locals by targeting them through phone services. It also comes in the wake of a string of recent victories by Iraqi troops, backed by Shiite and Kurdish militiamen. Scroll down for video . ISIS militants took control of Mosul in June during their rapid advance across northern Iraq . Residents in Mosul described a scene of 'chaos' and paralysis' in the city after the militants announced their decision on their Mosul-based radio network. Businesses were at a standstill as residents tried to understand what was happening, they said. Some are still able to access the Internet, which operates under a different network. The militants took control of the city, in northern Iraq, in June during their rapid advance across northern Iraq, after the Iraqi military virtually crumbled when confronted by the group. The U.S. began launching airstrikes on August 8 and has conducted at least 22 strikes around the city of Mosul alone. The city has come to represent the expanding power and influence of the extremist group, which started in Iraq but spread to Syria, where it grew exponentially in the chaos of the country's civil war. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group's reclusive leader, made his first video appearance in Mosul in July to announce his vision for a self-styled caliphate, a form of Islamic state. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi outlined his vision for a caliphate, a form of Islamic state, in July . Baghdad-based political analyst Hadi Jalo said that the latest move by the IS group shows the militants are losing confidence after the recent victories by Iraqi troops. 'Even the people in Mosul, who hate the Shiite-led government, are becoming less sympathetic with the militants - whose main victims are Sunnis, not Shiites, nowadays,' said Jalo. An official in one of the Iraqi mobile phone operators said his company is investigating the issue, but declined to give further details. Until now ISIS had tried to win local support by targeting people's phones - but have now blocked all phone networks in Mosul, the largest city they have control over . In parts of Syria under its control, the group now administers courts, fixes roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology. In Syria, government warplanes kept up air raids on the northern city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State group, killing at least seven people today, activists said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one of the raids struck the house of a judge facing the Islamic State group's tax collection centre. Another air raid targeted an ISIS group checkpoint. An activist who uses the name Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi said eight airstrikes killed at least seven people, including four women and a child. Al-Raqqawi, who is based outside Syria, heads a collective of activists on the ground in Raqqa. On Tuesday, similar airstrikes killed at least 95 people in Raqqa, most of them civilians. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she is 'horrified' by the reports that Syrian government airstrikes had killed dozens of civilians and demolished residential areas.","ISIS militants have blocked mobile phone networks in Mosul, north Iraq .

"Britain's economy will experience the fastest growth in a decade in 2015 due to the slump in oil prices with household income expected to see a leap of 4%, according to economists. In a forecast due to be published today, the EY Item Club predicts a growth of 2.9% this year - the highest since 2005 - with families likely to see their real incomes rise by almost 3.7%. The numbers are significantly higher than the 2.4% prediction given by George Osborne in his autumn statement last year. Economists predict the fastest growth in Britain's economy in ten years thanks to the slump in oil prices . The Item Club, whose predictions are based on the Treasury's economic model, says the fall in oil price is acting as the catalyst. The forecast expects the price of crude to settle to between $40 and $60 a barrel, then recover, reported The Sunday Times. As well as oil prices tumbling, wholesale gas prices have fallen by a quarter in the past year and the price of coal has been falling for three years. And yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron urged companies to pass on extra profits made from falling oil prices to their employees. Mr Cameron said it was time for workers squeezed by years of austerity to get their reward. Speaking in Washington D.C., he told a press conference: 'Falling oil prices is going to benefit a lot of businesses and a lot of countries and we want to see those benefits passed through in all the ways they can be.' President Barack Obama gave Mr Cameron a pre-election endorsement last night, praising Britain’s economic performance. Ed Miliband, left, accused David Cameron, right, of denying the cost of living crisis, after the Prime Minister said 'Britain deserves a pay rise' Suggesting Britain should stick to its economic course, Mr Obama said: ‘On the economy, I would note that Great Britain and the US are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. So we must be doing something right.’ Mr Cameron's comments followed the release of statistics which showed falling oil prices, and the economic recovery, have pushed many companies' profitability to a 16-year high. But in response, Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the Prime Minister of trying to 'magic away' families' money problems. He said: 'Week after week, month after month, year after year, this Government has shown a tin ear for what is really going on. 'They have denied the cost of living crisis. They have been woefully out of touch with the daily struggles of families. They have rubbished the idea that people are worse off.' He added: 'Five years of denial, complacency and failure on living standards, and less than four months before an election, he claims to have woken up to the problem. 'You can't wipe out five years of failure on living standards with pre-election pleading. You can't magic away people being £1,600 a year worse off by trying to take credit for falling oil prices.' The Prime Minister, in Washington for talks with Barack Obama, said: 'Obviously I want to see companies' success passed through in terms of wage increases'","EY Item Club predicts a growth of 2.9% this year - the highest since 2005 .

"It is a milestone her parents feared she would not reach. Courageous Harmonie-Rose Allen began her very own countdown to Christmas today, opening the first door of her advent calendar, with help from her mother. The one-year-old watched in awe as her mother Freya Hall helped her daughter, revealed the festive chocolate lurking inside. Miss Hall and her partner Ross Allen, feared their daughter would not be with them to celebrate Christmas after she was struck by a vicious bout of meningitis. Harmonie-Rose lost both her arms and legs to the disease. Doctors were forced to remove the tip of her nose and warned her parents she could suffer long-term vision and learning problems. Brave Harmonie-Rose Allen opens the first door of her advent calendar today, with the help of mother Freya Hall, after losing all four limbs when she was struck by a bout of meningitis . The one-year-old is beaming again after the killer bug struck 10 days after she walked for the first time in September. Her parents feared she wouldn't survive to enjoy Christmas with them . Despite the ordeal she has faced, the toddler is finally smiling again. Medics warned her parents she had a 10 per cent chance of surviving when she fell victim to the killer bug in September - just 10 days after taking her first steps. Three months on and the family are preparing to spend Christmas in hospital. Miss Hall, 20, said: 'She has such a strong character and its beginning to come back now, she knows what she wants. 'She has got her smile back. Ross and I are extremely proud of Harmonie. She has come so far and fought so hard to be here with us. 'We will make her life as amazing, and fulfilling as we can. She's our perfect little princess and she will always be perfect. 'To be told that she had 10 per cent chance of survival and to be here now is incredible and means so much to us how hard she's fought. 'I don't know what I would do without her.' The couple first noticed something was wrong with Harmonie-Rose in September, when she woke in the night coughing and unable to breathe. They took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home. Harmonie-Rose's parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong when she woke in the night coughing and soon developed a tell-tale rash. Doctors told the couple their daughter had a 10 per cent chance of surviving, preparing them for the worst . Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland. This means that every day nine people become ill with the diseases. With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day. A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations. Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms. So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia. Symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia: . Other signs in babies: . Septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis. Not everyone gets all the symptoms and they can appear in any order. Source: Meningitis Research Foundation . But the next morning Harmonie-Rose turned blue and they took her back to the same hospital. Following an assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent home. But hours later Harmonie-Rose became floppy and lethargic and they rushed back to the hospital, where a rash was spotted. Within four hours, the toddler's body was covered with the purple rash, leaving her parents lost for words. Miss Hall, a full-time mother, said: 'She had a cold for about a week before we took her to the hospital but she was also teething. 'She was still happy and playing right up until we took her to the hospital the second time. 'We saw the spot on her nose and it did not go away, the nurse acted very fast and within seconds her room was filled with doctors and nurses. 'Every time we looked at Harmonie she was becoming covered with more purple like bruises. 'Harmonie was then taken to adult intensive care and we did not hear from them until about four hours later. 'When we walked in to see Harmonie I could have fainted. 'She was asleep and was more covered in the rash than before, this was when we realised it was really severe. 'The doctors told us she would lose the tip of her nose and that was only if she survived. 'He told us he was very worried about our little girl and that she may not survive, my whole life was turned upside down within a second I was so angry and upset. 'The rash was literally covering her from head to toe, it was purple and a dark purple. 'Gradually the whole of her arms and legs were purple; they weren't just dots anymore, they had changed the colour of Harmonie's skin.' Harmonie-Rose has undergone more than 10 operations and is now out of immediate danger, but her mother says she still faces a number of challenges on her road to recovery. Since the youngster's diagnosis, friends, family and members of the public have been raising funds to help Harmonie. The brave toddler, pictured with her mother, fought the bug, but doctors were forced to amputate her arms and legs, as well as the tip of her nose. She has undergone 10 operations but is now out of immediate danger . Friends and family have helped raise more than £60,000 for the Help4Harmonie appeal to help pay for the one-year-old's future rehabilitation, hydrotherapy and adaptations to her home .

"A bride-to-be became pregnant after having sex with a dwarf stripper on her hen night, it has been claimed. The woman had to confess to cheating on her husband with the adult entertainer earlier this year after giving birth to a baby with dwarfism at a hospital in Valencia, Spain, it was reported. It is alleged that the woman’s husband believed the child was his until it was born. Neither the couple nor the hospital have been named. Hen party: A bride-to-be became pregnant after having sex with a dwarf stripper on her hen night (file picture) Spanish news website Las Cinco del Dia (The Daily Five), which broke the story, said: ‘Neither her closest female friends nor her family knew she had had sex with the dwarf stripper. ‘But once she had her son in her arms, she broke down and confessed what had happened. As you can imagine no-one that sleeps with a stripper at her hen night broadcasts it, or at least they try to take their secret to the grave. ‘But the protagonist of this episode had no choice but to confess and could never have pretended the boy was her husband's because of a little problem - the child was born with dwarfism.’ A Spaniard working as a dwarf stripper, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ‘I know colleagues working out of Valencia but I'm not aware of any of them getting involved in something like this.

There must be about ten of us doing this line of work in Spain. ‘More often than not it's a joke thing and the women are very shy and don't even want you to touch them. You often go along with a normal stripper who blindfolds the woman and then you take his place and pretend it's him that's still dancing. 'You take the blindfold off, congratulate her and go. At most you sometimes get asked to stay behind and have your picture taken with the bride-to-be. I'm astonished at the idea someone's fallen pregnant like this and the woman has managed to keep it a secret even from her closest friends. ‘It's certainly something that's catching peoples' interest.

"It is the wish list of a dying Australian man who, doctors say, has just weeks left on Earth. Former corporate high-flyer Peter Short, 57, from Camberwell, Victoria, has terminal oesophageal cancer. Two weeks ago, he was told he has just 90 days to live. But, in his own words, 'everyday's a ball' - and there's just three things he wants to do before he passes on. 'That Bucket List movie did dying such a disservice,' he told Daily Mail Australia, referring to a 2007 comedy flick. 'It's not about rushing around and trying to do all the bloody things you wanted. 'It's about being close to the people you're close to.' Peter Short, centre, is pictured here with his wife Elizabeth and son Mitchell . Touching embrace: Short is pictured here with his son, Mitchell, during a forthcoming documentary about the end of Peter's life . Mates: Peter Short is currently spending precious time with his family including his son Mitchell and wife Elizabeth . Peter Short was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer five years ago. He recovered, but on January 28 this year doctors told him it had returned in a terminal form . He is going to tick off the first item on his list on Friday, when he goes for a drive down a windy road in his Porsche with his son, Mitchell, 27. They will rip through the Black Spur line of road in Yarra Valley and go for a dip in the Elidon Weir. 'That'll be a great day,' Short told Daily Mail Australia. Another wish will be completed on February 1. That's Mitchell's first day of work in his graduate job. That evening, Peter wants to crack open a bottle of red with him. And then there is his final hope. He told a Senate inquiry last month he wants to have a 'magnificent' death - 'not... swallowing a whole lot of pills hoping it works and spitting them half back up'. But voluntary euthanasia - also known as voluntary assisted suicide - is not legal in Australia. So as the final item on his bucket list, he wants to confront Prime Minister Tony Abbott about the Liberal Party's position against euthanasia. 'I'm not going to die with a thing on the wish list,' Short told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday, the 14th day of the 90-day death sentence he was given by doctors. '(But) if I'm going to die without Abbott having talked to me I would consider that a major failure for him as well as me.' Short wants to press Mr Abbott to consider a conscience vote on the issue - something that was recommended by a Senate committee early in November. A former executive at Coles and Shell, Short is the subject of a new documentary, Fade to Black, which concerns his fight for voluntary euthanasia in Australia. He has helped raised more than $100,000 for the film. In the trailer of his forthcoming documentary, Short says: 'I will go out of my wonderful life at a time of my choosing with my dog Missy's ears in my hands and my family by my side' On Friday, Short will ride in his Porsche through the Black Spur line of road to a freshwater dam in the Yarra Valley. There, he will paddle with his son . The cancer (the white bits in the above graphic) has metastasised to his lungs . 'I will go out of my wonderful life at a time of my choosing with my dog Missy's ears in my hands and my family by my side,' he said in the film's trailer. There are parallels between his situation and that of Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old US woman who killed herself as her body began to succumb to the ravages to brain cancer. Voluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. In some parts of the world, including Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the US states of Oregon and Washington, some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal. In 1996 in Australia the Northern Territory passed the world's first euthanasia legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996. Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, but the legislation was overturned by Australia's Federal Parliament in 1997. Short said he felt like a friend had died when Ms Maynard died last month. 'We're the two souls who, for whatever reason, have found themselves in similar spots,' he explained to Daily Mail Australia. Ms Maynard went on an extensive media campaign to promote voluntary euthanasia prior to her death. She tearfully told CBS News: 'I don't want to die. 'If anyone wants to hand me a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.' 'Anyone who has walked a mile in my shoes and knows what they're facing and has felt the just bone-splitting headaches I get sometimes or the seizures or the inability to speak or the moments when I'm looking at my husband's face and I can't remember his name...' Despite his tragic condition - the cancer has metastasised in his lungs - Short told Daily Mail Australia: 'I can do something good at the end of my life. 'It's great leadership for my son. And, you know, everyday's a ball.' Over the past year, he has had a stream of farewell events with family and friends where he has said a 'little speech' - but he has lived to tell the tale. 'You never know what's around the next corner,' he said. 'It's always another exciting something happening. 'Sooner or later, I'm going to turn around a corner and say 's*** it looks like it's all coming to an end.' His main fear is not death, but rather the pain he and his family will experience. Short hopes to live until the end of February. Lifeline 13 11 14 .

"Lee Gaskell’s late try was the difference as Bradford beat Leeds 20-14 in the last West Yorkshire derby between the teams before the Bulls are relegated to the Kingstone Press Championship. Matches between the two neighbours were season highlights through the 2000s as both clubs battled for Super League supremacy, but Friday’s encounter at a rain-sodden Headingley Carnegie was a world away from those days. Moments of quality were few and far between in a match punctuated by errors. Derby winner: Lee Gaskell goes over for a late try as Bradford Bulls beat Yorkshire rivals Leeds Rhinos . On-loan winger Danny Williams, a Leeds academy graduate, gave Bradford a fifth-minute lead, only for it to be wiped out by Mitch Achurch’s effort. The scrappy nature of the match continued after the break, with tries from Luke Gale and Brett Delaney both coming on the back of ball spills. Gale’s penalty gave the Bulls a 12-10 advantage heading into the final 15 minutes but Luke Briscoe appeared to have given the Rhinos bragging rights. However, Gaskell took Gale’s offload and jinked his way to the line to send the Bulls fans wild, before the latter’s last-minute two-pointer made sure of Bradford’s second major scalp in as many weeks. Delight: The soon-to-be relegate side celebrate Gaskell's late winner . Bradford have had the better of their West Yorkshire derbies with Leeds in Super League despite their recent woes and the four-time champions were quickest out of the blocks against a Rhinos side missing a host of stars. Gale’s break gave the Bulls good field position and the scrum-half then kicked for the corner, where Williams profited from a mistake by Tom Briscoe to touch down. Leeds were finding it difficult to match Bradford’s early enthusiasm and it took a storming run by prop Brad Singleton to spark them into life. His charge downfield took the Rhinos deep into the Bulls half before Leeds shifted the ball from left to right and levelled through Achurch, who showed good footwork to evade Joe Arundel. The hosts looked to be in again when Josh Walters galloped towards the Bradford line after pouncing on a Bulls mistake in his own 20, but he was hauled down by Elliot Kear. Roar: Luke Gale is congratulated by team-mates after going over in the first half . All was not lost for Leeds as Adam Sidlow was sin-binned for preventing Walters from getting a quick play of the ball. The Rhinos failed to make the Bradford forward pay for his indiscipline and were forced into a reshuffle themselves when Ben Jones-Bishop hobbled off with a leg injury. Luke Briscoe replaced the Salford-bound winger and his early fumble summed up a poor opening 40 minutes. The second period got off to a promising start as Sidlow and Rob Burrow both made good yards after breaking the line. Hope: Brett Delaney scores for Leeds Rhinos at Headingley Carnegie . But it was another error which led to the next score, Tom Briscoe again spilling a kick, this time allowing Gale to tap ahead and touch down. It was Leeds’ turn to profit from a mistake next, Delaney picking up close to the Bulls line after Zak Hardaker’s pass had gone to ground before going over. Bradford edged ahead once more when Gale slotted over a penalty from in front after the Rhinos were penalised for holding down. Leeds hit back again through Luke Briscoe’s try after Liam Sutcliffe was first to a Danny McGuire kick but Gaskell stepped his way to the line to give Bradford their first win over the Rhinos in six attempts.","Lee Gaskell late try the difference at Headingley Carnegie .

"The victims of a serial paedophile who carried out a sustained campaign of abuse against them while they lived in his care at a children's home today celebrated as they saw their attacker jailed for life. John Allen was found guilty of committing historical sexual abuse against 18 boys and one girl aged between seven and 15 at his residential care home in Wrexham, North Wales. The 73-year-old had already spent six years in jail over abuse in the 1970s and avoided prosecution in 2003 over more alleged attacks when legal proceedings collapsed. Stephen Fong (centre) celebrates outside court after seeing John Allen jailed for life at Mold Crown Court . The 73-year-old was jailed for life with a minimum of 11 years after abusing children between 1968 and 1991 . In the third dealing with the court, the paedophile was told he must spend at least 11 years behind bars for committing 'grave' offences against children at the Bryn Alyn care home he ran in Wrexham, north Wales. Mold Crown Court heard how the man's victims considered him 'untouchable' over decades of sustained abuse as they had no one to report his behaviour to while under his care. Today they hugged one another and their families after seeing the sex offender jailed, with one man telling Sky News he felt as though his 'life sentence' had been lifted. 'The validation of these crimes that happened 41, 42 years ago was more important than the sentence for me,' said Kevin Edwards. 'When you carry these horrendous crimes against you, you're carrying a sentence yourself far greater than prison. 'When someone comes along and says ""now we believe you,"" my life sentence has been slightly lifted. 'This trial will, I hope, send out a message to councils, social services and police forces.

The 73-year-old was taken into a police van to be driven to a cell where he will spend at least 11 years . 'One more victim is too many.' Stephen Fong, another of his victims, described Allen as 'a monster'. 'Hopefully he will die in prison. That is not a very nice thing to say and some people might not want to hear that but that is how I feel,' the 50-year-old added. 'It's fantastic to know that, after so many years, the ex-boys and ex-girls have come together collectively as one and I believe we have got the verdicts we needed. 'I was not a big fan of this justice system until today. Hopefully we can now put this to bed.' Sentencing today Mr Justice Openshaw said there were 'recurring themes' among the reasons why his victims hadn't come forward sooner. In 1995, after Allen was jailed for six years over a string of offences against young boys, an inquiry was launched to look at the abuse of children in Gwynedd and Clwyd areas. Following its publication in 2000, more complainants came forward with claims they had been abused by the 73-year-old. But the case was stunted by a Crown Court judge who reportedly ruled that Allen would not receive a fair trial because of the publicity about his previous convictions. In 2012 he was arrested amid fresh allegations and found guilty last week of 33 offences against young boys and one against a girl. 'Complaints were made with social workers and from time to time with the police but these were never investigated,' said the judge. 'These complaints were dismissed as, literally, incredible. 'The fact is the boys did not complain because they knew it would pointless to do so and it gave the belief that the defendant was untouchable.' Today the paedophile was condemned for his 'grave' offences against children over such a long period of time. 'There have no doubt been more prolific offenders but seldom can there be so many grave offences committed on so many victims over a long period of time, causing so much anguish and misery,' added Mr Justice Openshaw. In 1968 Allen, a hotelier with no background in child care, set up the Bryn Alyn care home (pictured) John Allen pictured in 1971 with children at the Wrexham care home where he abused young boys and girls . At its height, 120 boys were sent into Allen's care at Bryn Alyn by 14 different local authorities, with many coming from across the country, said the judge. Later, some girls were given accommodation in the home described as a 'highly sexualised atmosphere.' Allen denied all offences during the six week trial to the shock of complainants present at the sentencing. He was given a discretionary life sentence for seven serious sexual assaults and received concurrent terms of 10 years for 23 indecent assaults. One count of gross indecency with a child brought a sentence of two years. He was cleared of two other serious sexual assaults. Jon Brown, NSPCC lead for tackling sexual abuse, described the man as one of the most prolific sex offenders of his time. 'John Allen's reign of terror over a dark period of several decades puts him high up the scale of the most prolific child abusers of recent times and his sentence quite rightly reflects the severity of his despicable crimes. 'Instead of nurturing the vulnerable children in his care he abused his power and subjected them to constant, horrendous sexual attacks. 'His manipulative and devious behaviour allowed him to hide behind a shroud of respectability while his helpless victims suffered intense emotional trauma. 'Allen was able to evade justice for so long because he created an atmosphere of terror where no one was able to oppose him and where he effectively silenced his victims.' Allen was jailed for six years in 1995 for child sex abuse. In 2003 more charges were dropped against him . After John Allen was found guilty by a jury of historical sexual offences, it was alleged the 73-year-old had at one point supplied young boys for Westminster 'paedophile parties' alleged to have taken place at Dolphin Square, a luxury complex in central London. The apartments have been mentioned on numerous occasions amid allegations of abuse carried out by political heavyweights such as Sir Peter Hayman and Cyril Smith. Metropolitan Police are actively investigating claims of historical abuse, while the Home Secretary has ordered an inquiry into whether such atrocities ever happened under the noses of influential politicians. Last week Dennis Parry, a former leader of Clwyd County Council claimed Allen played a hand in the alleged ring of paedophilia. 'My information was that not only was he an abuser, he was a supplier. 'There was movement between Holland and this country, and Dolphin Square was part of the set-up,' he was reported as saying in the Sunday Times. Further inquiries are being made about claims the paedophile transported young boys between Ipswich and north Wales on the whims of other sexual offenders. It has been alleged that Allen was not only an abuser but also a supplier and helped transfer boys in his care to Dolphin Square, in central London, which is at the centre of an allegation that MPs used it to abuse boys .","John Allen has been jailed for life over decades of sustained abuse .

"This is the moment a disgusted takeaway customer caught a chef washing his feet in a kitchen sink. The picture, which appears to show a chef next to a food preparation area, was taken at the Neel Akash Indian and Bangladeshi Restaurant in Salisbury, Wiltshire. According to the restaurant owner the incident happened because the chef had dropped hot oil on his foot and needed to cool the area down. Scroll down for video . Putting his foot in it: A customer at the Neel Akash Indian and Bangladeshi Restaurant in Salisbury, Wiltshire, took this picture of a chef at the restaurant washing his feet in the kitchen sink . The restaurant has a five star rating from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) - the highest rating possible. The diner, who has asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, said: 'When I saw this chef washing his feet in the kitchen I felt sick to my stomach instantly. 'The only thing that I could think about was that nobody would believe me so I must get proof - hence the grainy photo. 'This is a restaurant I've eaten from many times, so I was totally shocked and upset. I will never step foot in there again. 'This is quite a popular takeaway in the area with people travelling from all over the rural surrounding villages to collect a curry. 'I used to really like the place, I just don't understand now how a five-star FSA rating was achieved.' The eaterie has a 5-star rating from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) - the highest rating possible . Restaurant owner Mohammed Shajahan, said it was an isolated incident and was not reflective of their consistently impeccable food hygiene standards. He said:'The only reason the employee had his foot in the sink is because he had dropped hot oil on his foot and quickly needed to cool the area down in order to stop it from becoming a severe burn. 'After the member of public sent me this picture I immediately apologised to him and asked the staff member why they had broken the health and safety rules. 'After the incident happened the member of staff was asked to hand in his resignation and has now left my restaurant. 'This type of incident will never happen again.' A spokesperson for the FSA said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases. 'However, food hygiene must be the priority for all food business operators and if any person has concerns about an individual business then they should report these to their local environmental health team.'","Incident took place at Neel Akash Indian and Bangladeshi Restaurant .

"BBC radio presenter who said women should 'keep their knickers on' during radio discussion about Ched Evans is to be investigated by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom. Nick Conrad was leading a live debate on BBC Radio Norfolk about Evans, a former Sheffield United striker, who was released from prison in October after serving half of a five year prison sentence for raping a teenage girl. There had been speculation Evans would return to play for the team, leading to criticism from sexual abuse charities as well as the resignation of a number of the club's patrons including Charlie Webster. Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from a stand at Sheffield United's ground if the player was reinstated. During the discussion about Evans on the BBC show Mr Conrad suggested women should be more aware of a man's sexual desire and how 'difficult' it is for them to stop. Scroll down for video . Nick Conrad (left) - a BBC Radio Norfolk talk show host - will be investigated by Ofcom after he suggested women should 'keep their knickers on' during a discussion about convicted rapist Ched Evans (right) He said: 'I think women need to be more aware of a man's sexual desire that when you're in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity there's a huge amount of energy in the male body, there's a huge amount of will and intent, and it's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm.' The 29-year-old presenter was labelled ignorant by rape charities after his comments. He also said: 'What I'm trying to say is that women also have to understand that when a man's given certain signals he'll wish to act upon them and if you don't wish to give out the wrong signals, it's best, probably, to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him. Does that make sense?' At the time Katie Russell, a spokeswoman for the Rape Crisis England and Wales charity, said the debate around Evans had highlighted broader issues about the way we discuss men and women and sexual abuse. She said: 'The idea that men's sexual desires render them incapable of taking responsibility for their actions or respecting another person's right to choose what happens to their body is unfounded, outdated and offensive to men.' Norfolk Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner Jenny McKibben also criticised Mr Conrad's comments, and a number of people posted tweets showing their distaste for his comments. Listeners also complained to the broadcaster and the BBC and Mr Conrad both apologised. The father-of-one found himself compared to fictional character Alan Partridge, who is known for making politically incorrect comments, after the show. He further attracted criticism when he said during the live debate he said: 'It's the old adage about if you yank a dog's tail don't be surprised when it bites you.' Ched Evans has continued to protest his innocence and is pictured with girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) Ofcom is now investigating after a number of complaints were received following Mr Conrad's comments. A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'Ofcom is currently investigating whether the use of derogatory language against women in this live debate about convicted rapist Ched Evans met generally accepted standards.' Ched Evans was released from prison in October after serving half of his sentence for the rape of a teenage girl at a hotel in Rhyl in 2011. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012, but his case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Since he has been released the 25-year-old has repeatedly protested his innocence and insisted that sex with the woman had been consensual. The former footballer also posted a statement on his website saying he will continue to fight to clear his name. Charlie Webster (left) stepped down as patron of Sheffield United after the club announced that Evans would be allowed to train with them agai,n while heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill (right) said if he was given a contract she wanted her name removed from a stand at the Bramall Lane ground, where the team regularly play . Singer Paul Heaton (left) and businesswoman Lindsay Graham (right) also stood down as patrons at the club . On November 11 - less than a month after Evans was released from prison - Sheffield United issued a statement confirming he would be allowed to train with them again. This statement provoked widespread criticism and speculation that he could be given another contract. The furore led to the club losing a number of its patrons and seeing many sponsors threaten to leave in the nine days that followed. After the announcement television presenter Charlie Webster stood down as patron. She was followed by singer Dave Berry and businesswoman Lindsay Graham. The next day heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill confirmed she would ask for her name to be removed from the stand at Bramall Lane if Evans was offered a contract. The stand was named after her in recognition of her success at the London 2012 Olympics. Mrs Ennis-Hill was then subjected to abuse from Twitter trolls threatening her with rape. Two days later former Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton also resigned as a patron of United's Community Foundation over the Evans affair. On November 20 Sheffield United confirmed it had revoked the offer for Evans to train with them and would not be offering him a contract. Evans was then understood to be in talks with Oldham, a league one team. But the club confirmed today they would also not be signing him. FA chairman Greg Dyke was also drawn into the row after he said discussion over whether Evans,  should play football again was ‘not an important issue’. The Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland's (PFAI) solicitor Stuart Gilhooly  also attracted criticism after he said Evans deserved a second chance.","Nick Conrad led live debate on BBC Radio Norfolk about rapist Ched Evans .

"Ahead of World Cup combat in Brazil, the Republic of Ireland blew a chance to provide England manager Roy Hodgson with another encouraging pointer. Six days after holding Italy scoreless, Ireland were a goal in front through Kevin Doyle, and a man to the good, against Costa Rica deep into the second half of the Freedom Cup and seemed set fair for only their second win under Martin O’Neill. But then, things went horribly awry. After Celso Borges converted a penalty in the 64th minute, Robbie Keane saw a penalty two minutes later saved by replacement ‘keeper Patrick Pemberton – it was only Keane’s second miss for Ireland. Matchwinner: Kevin Doyle hit the only goal of the game as Ireland saw England's Group D foes Costa Rica .

Costa Rica: Navas (Pemberton, 46) Umana, Gonzalez, Duarte; Diaz, Cubero, Borges, Mora; Campbell (87 Calvo), Urena (Brenes 78), Ruiz (Bolanos 74). Scorer: Borges 64. Ref: Raul Castro (Honduras) Referee: Alexandru Dan Tudor (Romania) On a . tempestuous night, which saw a spattering of cards, missiles thrown and . post-match invasions by fans, Hodgson will have noted another incident . which, unwittingly, may be of benefit to England.

It was Doyle’s 13th international goal and his first since September, 2012, as he seized his recall moment. Look out behind you: Costa Rica's Keylor Navas fails to stop Doyle's shot .

But Keane, complete with trademark shuffle, was thwarted as Pemberton dived correctly to his right to push the ball away.

"Toni Kroos has no intention of being a Manchester United player next season. The Bayern Munich midfielder has been a long-term target for the Old Trafford club, especially as his contract situation with the German champions remains unresolved. Kroos, 24, has a year left with Bayern and has yet to accept their offer of an extension, giving a nod to a possible move away. All smiles: Toni Kroos, in training for Germany on Thursday, believes he will be at Bayern Munich next season . Raring to go: Manchester United target Kroos will feature for Germany at this summer's World Cup in Brazil . Kroos flourished under new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal at Bayern and is thought to be keen to work under his old coach again, but he has since claimed the English giants are not on his radar. Speaking to Bild he said: 'I am expecting to play for Bayern Munich next season. There was a lot of speculation, but Manchester is and was not an issue. 'At this point in time I am fully focused on preparations for the World Cup.' Kroos was the subject of a £20million offer from United with the two clubs having agreed a deal for his services when David Moyes was still in charge. Meanwhile, Bayern's president Karl Hopfner, claims Kroos is unlikely to receive a better contract offer from the German club. Done deal: Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos for £20m . Green light: The deal to bring Kroos to Old Trafford was agreed when David Moyes was still in charge . Speaking to German sports magazine Kicker, Hopfner said that the offer Kroos has received will not go any higher at the moment. 'It was the same with Michael Ballack, and eventually we retracted our offer (to extend his contract). Kroos has a contract until 2015. 'There will definitely be further talks. At some point, the player has to decide what he wants. I'll be taking a leaf out of Uli's book certainly: certain financial boundaries will not be crossed.' When asked to talk about how Kroos' offer won't increase Hopfner said: 'That is how things stand. No question, but on whether a big offer could change their stance Hopfner replied: 'I don't know. Things change very quickly.' Kroos is currently training with the Germany squad ahead of the World Cup.","Bayern Munich ace Toni Kroos has been a long-term target for Man United .

But fans hoping to see the traditional grand unveiling for stars joining Barca will be disappointed. While the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez and Neymar have all been paraded in front of thousands of adoring fans at the Nou Camp in recent years, Suarez will have to make do with a plain old conference room.

"Football can be a wretchedly knee-jerk place sometimes. Only 10 days ago, when Manchester United appeared to be on an upward curve, young Tyler Blackett, so composed  in the victory over QPR, was hailed as the thoroughbred colt flying up on the rails to resolve Louis van Gaal's defensive malaise. One week later, after Manchester United's defensive capitulation at Leicester City - United conceded four goals in 21 minutes and Blackett was sent off in a 5-3 defeat - the defender was pitied as an over-exposed rookie. The reality for this young footballer most probably lies somewhere in between. Those who have worked closely with the defender truly believe that Blackett will train on, given time and opportunities. Tyler Blackett has broken into the first team at Manchester United this season . Blackett (third from left) playing football during his childhood before joining Manchester United . Blackett (bottom row in red tracksuit bottoms) celebrates winning a trophy with Fletcher Moss Rangers . Blackett (back row, third from right) had success with Fletcher Moss Rangers as an eight-year-old . At United, they are wary of making long-term predictions but they see a tall, athletic and pacy defender of significant potential. That Blackett is a left-footed centre half - confident in possession - only adds to the appeal. It is why England scouts will be monitoring his progress closely in the lead-up to Euro 2016. Blackett is undoubtedly improving and some of the snap judgements that have followed his performance at Leicester betray the work ethic and qualities that have so impressed the coaching staff at United in the past six months. His dedication and professionalism have been impeccable. On Tuesday, United players were granted a day off but still Blackett came in, determined to push himself, picking over his performances and organising an extra session in the gym. Blackett does not miss a chance to place himself ahead of his defensive rivals. Last week, the squad went out in Manchester city centre for an organised bonding meal, aimed at uniting the raft of new signings that have arrived this summer. Blackett has been promoted to the first team at Manchester United by Louis van Gaal . Blackett has shown his dedication to his career by training on his days off . The following day had been scheduled as a free but there Blackett was once more, using everything United's hi-tech training ground can offer to further his game. It is not only his attitude that has struck Van Gaal and his close-knit team of advisers. For a defender, the goals against column is the ultimate measure of success, but coaches have been lifted by Blackett's distribution. At home to QPR, 97.9 per cent of Blackett's 97 passes were successful, a better record than any other United player on the day. Even in defeat against Swansea and catastrophe against Leicester, Blackett's passing hit the right notes, extending beyond the 90 per cent mark in both games. It should also be noted that Blackett was not one of those involved in the humiliation at MK Dons. Blackett was sent off after he brought down Leicester's Jamie Vardy in the 5-3 defeat . We cannot airbrush the Leicester debacle from the scrapbook, but the one-match suspension against West Ham this weekend and the chance to come up for some air will do Blackett some good. There has been enormous pressure on the broad shoulders of the 20-year-old defender, who had not played a minute of competitive football for Manchester United before this campaign. He has now played 443 minutes and is only the defender to have started every game under Van Gaal. At the end of this season, Blackett's contract will expire. United, you would assume, will be looking to tie him down sooner rather than later, especially as uncertainty lingers over the club's desire to stay faithful to their roots and hand opportunities to local talent. On Sunday evening, when he lay down on his pillow with a whirlwind of thoughts swirling around his young mind, he will have been reassured by the presence of his loved ones. Blackett got his first taste of first team experience on loan at Blackpool last season . The young defender was also sent on loan to Birmingham in the second half of the season . In the inner city district of Hulme, Blackett still lives with his parents, who were this week described to Sportsmail in the most glowing terms: 'They are incredibly supportive and offer sensible advice,' said a source close to the family. Tyler Blackett's stats this season (via Opta) 'They are there at every single game and they are still in that wonderland as they realise their son is playing regularly for Manchester United. Can you imagine the pride they must be feeling?' Blackett's development has been quite remarkable. Only six months ago, he was cutting his teeth at the coalface in the Championship. Away from the sanitised environment of academy football, it was at times a brutal induction under Lee Clark at Birmingham City. His final appearance lasted only 45 minutes, as Blackett was withdrawn at half-time with Birmingham trailing 4-0 at home to Blackburn. Five weeks earlier, he was replaced after 23 minutes when Birmingham went 2-0 down to Sheffield Wednesday. Blackett's family have been a constant source of support, first cheering on their boy as a five-year-old with the local youth team Fletcher Moss Rangers. 'They'd be there every single weekend, in rain, wind or hailstorms,' says Tony Taylor, who coached Blackett in those tender years between five and nine, 'That's important. We could tell that Tyler was gifted from his very first sessions. At five years old, he was a stand-out player. He was strong, quick and technically excellent from a very young age.' Way back when, Blackett was a goalscoring winger, which perhaps goes some way to explaining his authority in possession. 'He was a tricky and skilful wide player,' Taylor continues, 'Maybe because he was tall and powerful, United saw his potential as a defender.' Blackett has progressed through the youth teams at Manchester United and into the first team . Fletcher Moss is one of the success stories in an era when youth football is increasingly threatened by depleted resources, below-par facilities and the disinterest of the PlayStation generation. The club, established in the 1980s after a group of eager teens went bucket in hand pleading for donations at the local pub, has produced a series of England internationals. Wes Brown, Danny Welbeck, Ravel Morrison, Ipswich's Cameron Stewart and Swansea's Kyle Bartley are all graduates of the Fletcher Moss academy, positioned near to Wythenshawe, one of Greater Manchester's more socially deprived districts. Blackett's family still reside only a stone's throw away. 'He comes back to see the coaches quite often,' Taylor reveals, 'He spends time talking with the younger kids and he comes in to help coaching them.' Manchester-born Blackett has been at United since he was seven . Both Louis van Gaal and England coach Gary Neville have been impressed by what they have seen in Blackett . Blackett speaks with Manchester United U21 manager Warren Joyce - who is one of his mentors . The defender's level-headed approach is admirable. His parents must take much of the credit. So too must the United academy, where Blackett first trained at the age of seven. United are sensible at youth level, operating within more modest means than several of their direct Premier League rivals. Money, United believe, can be a distraction, a complication and counter-productive to a player's development. A club source explained: 'They have good habits here. If you give them £20,000-a-week at a young age, then it could be the biggest contract they ever get. 'The lifestyle changes and the money soon runs out. They get the flash cars, the best clothes, the best food but then they may do the least work. We are giving them life skills and producing strong characters that want to work more and do more. Then the money will look after itself.' Blackett has represented England at U16 level through to U21s but qualifies to play for Barbados and Jamaica . This month, Blackett's emergence attracted interest from sportswear manufacturers Nike and he last week signed a commercial deal in London. This was another of those 'days off', a term which does not really exist in his vocabulary. Again, Blackett scheduled an individual session at Carrington before heading down to the capital. Senior figures at Old Trafford reassure Blackett constantly. Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt, now major figures on the coaching staff at Manchester United, are part of the fabric and a valuable source of advice. Gary Neville has offered his backing face-to-face. Reserve-team manager Warren Joyce is a personal mentor to many of the club's rising stars. And despite some teething problems, Blackett's star is shining brighter than most at Old Trafford.

Disturbing development: Police searching for missing couple Elrey 'Bud' Runion (left) and his wife, June Runion (right), have discovered two bodies near a lake in Georgia . Drowned: The Runions' Champagne-colored 2003 GMC Envoy was discovered submerged in a lake Monday . The grisly discovery came just hours after 28-year-old Ronnie Adrian 'Jay' was arrested in connection to the couple's disappearance and charged with giving false statements and criminal attempt to commit theft by deception. Steverson says Towns, who surrendered himself to police earlier today, was the last person to speak with the couple by phone. During a press conference held Monday afternoon, Sheriff Steverson told reporters that Bud and June Runion's Champagne-colored 2003 GMC Envoy was discovered drowned in a lake. Two bodies - a man and a woman - were found not far from the submerged vehicle. ‘It’s not the outcome we had hoped for, but obviously it’s one we have to deal with,’ said the sheriff, according to 11Alive Atlanta. He added that officers on the scene will collect evidence and analyze the vehicle and the bodies in order to find out what happened. So far, Towns has not been charged with harming the Runion couple, but Steverson said he believes the 28-year-old had something to do with their disappearance. Last Thursday, Bud Runion, a Vietnam War veteran, and his wife set out on a 180-mile journey from Marietta to McRae to meet a would-be seller of their dream car, a 1966 Mustang.

Daughter Virginia Owens said she became suspicious after her parents failed to show up to babysit her children on Friday and didn't answer their cell phone. The couple were driving a champagne colored 2003 GMC Envoy and cell phone data shows they made it to McRae by Thursday evening. Police say the phone number the Runions called traces back to a disposable cell phone, signals from which they are tracking in hopes of finding the couple.

"Sunderland ended their pre-season tour of Portugal with a 0-0 draw against Vitoria Setubal in Albufeira. The Black Cats recovered from their narrow defeat to CD Nacional last time out as they avoided a similar result against Setubal, however in truth it was a dull affair with few chances of note.

The former Manchester City winger also went closest to breaking the deadlock when his long-range effort went just wide of goal. After a quiet opening it was the home side who showed the first signs of threatening to break the deadlock, having the ball in the net as early as the 12th minute through Giovani - but the goal was correctly ruled out for offside. Just minutes later the hosts were again unfortunate not to take the lead when Queiros' effort was brilliantly blocked by Costel Pantilimon at point blank range. The visitors stepped up their game slightly in the second half, with Johnson's long-range strike inches away from giving the Black Cats the lead. Poyet's side ended their three-match tour with a win, defeat and a draw, scoring one goal in the process.

"Centres Adam Ashley-Cooper and Kurtley Beale inspired the Waratahs to victory over the Crusaders in a thrilling Super Rugby final. A blazing start brought 14 unanswered points in the first 15 minutes for the Waratahs, who enjoyed home advantage in Sydney. They were pegged back but Ashley-Cooper's second try and Bernard Foley's late penalty earned a 33-32 win. Winners: New South Wales Waratahs celebrate after defeating the Canterbury Crusaders in the Super 15 final . We're the champions: Rob Horne (left) and Israel Folau (right) celebrate with the prestigious trophy . Foley kicked 23 points while Beale provided the creative spark for the minor premiers. Matt Todd and Nemani Nedolo crossed for the Crusaders and Colin Slade kicked 20 points after assuming the duties from the injured Dan Carter. Foley slotted the Waratahs in front following a ruck infringement and they scored the game's opening try just four minutes in. Beale's misplaced pass to Foley opened up the space and when the ball was worked back across, it was Beale again who sent his midfield partner Ashley-Cooper crashing over. Foley missed the conversion but kicked two penalties to reward his side's early dominance, with the Tahs enjoying 75 per cent possession in the first quarter-hour. The .

Slade and Foley traded penalties and it was 20-13 at the interval but the lead lasted less than three minutes into the second half. The rolling Nadolo was adjudged by the television official to have dotted down without putting a toe in touch and Slade's conversion and subsequent penalty put his side ahead for the first time.

But the Waratahs were not to be denied and after a long spell of probing, Ashley-Cooper took another Beale pass and slipped past Dominic Bird for his second try, converted by Foley. Wing Rob Horne was unable to gather on the end of a fast but ragged Waratahs move and they were behind once more with four minutes left when an offside gave Slade an easy chance. But a ruck infringement allowed Foley to slot over from 40 metres and Ashley-Cooper gathered the kick-off to allow his team to chew up the final seconds.","Adam Ashley-Cooper and Kurtley Beale were in impressive form in the final .

"Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair faces being called to give evidence in Parliament about the letters to on-the-run IRA suspects . Tony Blair faces being called to Parliament over a secret deal with Sinn Fein which allowed suspected IRA bombers to avoid prosecution. The former Prime Minister is set to be summoned by the Northern Ireland select committee to explain the controversial 'comfort letters' sent to on-the-run suspects telling them they were not being sought by the police. MPs are warning that if he fails to appear there will be 'bad publicity'. The policy led to the collapse of the trial of suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downing in March. The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Mr Blair's Labour government saw around 200 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities. The letters did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence emerged. The Northern Ireland committee is investigating the deal after the collapse of the case against Downey, who was accused of the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombing which killed four soldiers. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the case against Mr Downey collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. The committee has taken evidence from senior police officers in Northern Ireland, and Labour politicians who served as Northern Ireland Secretary in the Labour government. Mr Blair is understood to have provided written evidence to the committee, but could be called to appear in person to answer questions direct from MPs. IRA suspect John Downey walked free from court in March after the Hyde Park bomb trial collapsed . Committee chairman Laurence Robertson told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Mr Blair has not found a date in his diary. ‘We are going to have to press him. Technically we can compel him to attend. ‘I don’t want to have to get to that point yet but others on the committee will want to do that. ‘There is going to be bad publicity … if he doesn’t come because people will draw their own conclusion. ‘I take the view Mr Blair has a duty to come and explain it. He is right at the thick of it.’ Mr Blair’s office has previously suggested the sticking point has been finding a suitable date to fit in with his role as a Middle East peace envoy and when the committee is sitting. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'Tony Blair has already given evidence in person to the Hallett Review and has said he is happy to also give evidence to the Committee, we are in discussions about the best way to do that given the current demands of his Middle East role.' The spokesman said they did not know anything suggestions Mr Blair could appear via video link. On Thursday the results of another inquiry into the affair, led by Lady Justice Heather Hallett, will be published. Lady Justice Hallett's report is expected to address secret negotiations between Mr Blair and Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, on how to deal with ""on-the-run"" suspects. Because they had not been convicted, they did not fall within the scope of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which saw jailed paramilitaries released early. For . more than 30 years, John Downey had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park . hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.","Former Prime Minister set to be summoned by Northern Ireland committee .

"The vice-chairman of the FA David Gill has called on Sepp Blatter not to stand for re-election as president of FIFA. Saying the FIFA president's decision to run for a fifth term in 2015 was 'disappointing' today, Mr Gill added: 'The very fact in 2011 he was clear it was just for four years, that should have been the situation. 'To change his mind is disappointing. He added: 'I think we need to move on. I think we need a full, frank and open debate about what Fifa needs going forward.' Scroll down for video . Vice-chairman David Gill, pictured, has said Sepp Blatter should not stand for re-election as president of FIFA . Mr Gill . also challenged Mr Blatter on his astonishing attack on the British media. 'The statement from Mr Blatter yesterday was totally unacceptable and . factually incorrect. 'To try to portray it as a racist or discriminatory . attack is sheer ... totally unacceptable.' Mr Gill . agreed Mr Blatter's comments had left 'a stain' on FIFA. The move came just hours after former UEFA president Lennart Johansson also called for Blatter not to stand again. Following UEFA's Congress meeting in Sao Paulo, Johannson said: 'I think it is time he went.' After Blatter spoke to UEFA's . Congress to announce his intention to stand for a fifth term as . president, both FA chairman Greg Dyke and Dutch football federation . president Michael van Praag spoke out against the Swiss.

They said they had no confidence in Mr Blatter to oversee the change that FIFA needs in the light of these corruption scandals. This followed Van Praag's earlier comments, in an interview with a Dutch newspaper, that Blatter had to shoulder much of the blame for the tarnished image of the world governing body in the light of corruption allegations around the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid. 'Mr Blatter, this is nothing personal but if you look at FIFA's reputation over the last seven or eight years, it is being linked to all kinds of corruption and all kinds of old boys' networks things,"" Van Praag said he had told Mr Blatter in the meeting from which reporters were barred. 'FIFA has an executive president and you are not making things easy for yourself and I do not think you are the man for the job any longer. 'I told him ""I like you very much ... this is nothing personal. But you are now saying that Qatar was the wrong choice (for the 2022 World Cup), but you are not blaming yourself you are blaming your executive committee. 'Yesterday you said something about racism against Qatar and people are not taking you seriously any more. This is not good for FIFA and it is not good for the game. 'Yes you are leading the reforms at the moment, but all these problems occurred in the period before the reforms and you were still president and you responsible and I believe you should not run any more.""' Kicking up a storm: Dyke, pictured during a England promotional event last week, has spoken out against Blatter . FIFA . has been rocked by allegations that Qatar bribed officials to secure . votes for the 2022 World Cup and Blatter did nothing to ease the . situation by accusing the British media responsible for the expose of . ‘racism and discrimination’ yesterday. Even though FIFA’s main sponsors . have now called for an investigation into the claims. Blatter attended UEFA’s Congress on Tuesday morning ahead of FIFA Congress – he required the protection of Sao Paulo’s Shock Battalion riot police officers to gain access to The Renaissance hotel where UEFA are staying – and Van Praag said he expected  members of Europe’s governing body to be united in opposing Blatter at next year’s presidential election. ‘The election for the FIFA presidency is only next year but it will be good if Europe is well prepared and ready to make its choice,’ he said. ‘If you are in a post for 16 years there comes a time when you have to ask whether you are still contributing.’ Not holding back: Jack Warner criticised Sepp Blatter during interview with ITV . The day began on Monday with a former Blatter ally – the now disgraced Jack Warner – claiming FIFA would not change until 78-year-old Blatter had gone. After three decades on ExCo a corruption scandal forced Warner to quit in 2011, having been linked to payments made by the man at the centre of the current Qatar scandal, Mohamed Bin Hammam. And while Blatter is expected to tell Congress this week that he intends to stand for a fifth term, Warner said: ‘If Blatter had one modicum of decency he wouldn’t even be at FIFA still. ‘I have been with FIFA for 30 years....I am still the longest serving elected officer of FIFA, and under Mr Blatter?

For the . tiny pocket of Iran fans - many of them here armed only with cash . because international sanctions mean they can't access their bank . accounts overseas – there was cause for excitement beyond the simple . fact that their team was playing Messi and his international colleagues.

But it did not take long . for Argentina to seize control of this game, with Javier Mascherano – . winning his 100th cap – and Fernando Gago very much in command in . midfield. The fact that Iran did not concede sooner than they . did owed much to the heroics of their goalkeeper, Alireza Haghighi . denying Higuain and Aguero with two marvellous saves.

"Tiger Woods was all smiles on Tuesday - thanks to a full set of teeth.

Tiger Woods chatted with the media during a practice round prior to the start of the Waste Management Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale on Tuesday in Arizona . Missing something? Tiger Woods lost one of his front teeth after a cameraman knocked it out last week before he congratulated his skier girlfriend Lindsey Vonn on her win at the women's World Cup in Italy . He said he was wearing his skeleton-patterned mask to try to blend in and was standing behind photographers at one of two podium presentations. Woods said a videographer stood up and banged into his mouth, adding the mask covered the blood and he was in pain. Woods said one tooth was chipped and the other was knocked out. They were permanent teeth — not caps - and he had them replaced. A race official said he was not aware of the incident and nothing was reported. Nicola Colli, secretary general of the organizing committee in Cortina D'Ampezzo, also claimed last week to have been alongside Woods during the so-called crush of paparazzi his agent claimed caused him to lose a tooth. 'I was among those who escorted him from the tent to the snowmobile and there was no such incident,' Colli said. 'When he arrived he asked for more security and we rounded up police to look after both him and Lindsey.' The golfer revealed the gap in his mouth as he congratulated Vonn following her winning run- her 63rd World Cup victory. 'During a crush of photographers at the awards' podium at the World Cup event in Italy, a media member with a shoulder-mounted video camera pushed and surged towards the stage, turned and hit Tiger Woods in the mouth,' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg said. 'Woods's tooth was knocked out by the incident.' The identity and network of the camera operator was not included in the statement, nor was it clear what Steinberg claims became of the tooth. Previous pictures of the golfer show the tooth that was knocked out was discolored. Something to hide? Woods, who surprised Vonn after her win, covered his face with a mask last week . Surprise!

"Julie Neville, wife of footballer Phil Neville (right), revealed her husband has never mopped or used a Hoover after he made his first coffee in December . Phil Neville has failed to tackle a single piece of housework during his 15-year marriage, his wife revealed yesterday. The football pundit, who has just made his first cup of coffee at the age of 37, has no idea where the ironing board is kept and would not know how to turn on an oven. ‘All his talent is in his toes, that’s for certain,’ a remarkably sanguine Julie Neville said. Mr Neville, who played 59 times for England and won six Premier League titles with Manchester United, first hinted at his lack of skill around the house on BBC Radio 5 at the weekend. In an insight into the cosseted life of top footballers, he said he ‘sprinted into the kitchen’ and phoned his wife to ask ‘how the hell do I make a cup of coffee’ after the Daily Mail’s chief sports reporter Matt Lawton asked for one during an interview at the couple’s £3.6million Cheshire home. The father of two later told how he made it with a ‘kettle… two little scoops of coffee’, and laughed: ‘I’ve lived in a bubble all my life.’ His wife then revealed in a separate radio interview that he had never used a vacuum cleaner, mop, dishwasher or washing machine. And yesterday, when asked if he had any redeeming talents around the house such as putting the rubbish out or mowing the lawn, she told the Mail he did neither. She added: ‘Ironing? Oh gosh no, he wouldn’t even know where we keep the ironing board… He wouldn’t know how to turn an oven on. ‘I’ve never known anything else and I’m super-domestic so I don’t really mind. Phil is an amazing father and husband – just not domesticated in any way.’ Speaking about her husband’s first attempt to make a cup of coffee, the 39-year-old said: ‘If you’d seen it you would not have thought it was classed as a coffee. I didn’t taste it, but it didn’t look good.’ But the Mail’s Matt Lawton was more generous, saying: ‘For a first go, it was very good.’ Scroll down for video . Embarrassing: Neville, who has won 59 caps for England, was forced to admit he did not know how to make instant coffee after he phoned his wife for 'urgent' instructions for how to make the drink during an interview . Long relationship: The Neville couple, pictured left in 2000 and right in 2003, have been together for 18 years . As for Mr Neville, he has insisted he would ‘never drink the stuff’ anyway but confirmed that he has made tea. Mrs Neville, who owns online natural, sport performance and gluten-free products firm WinNaturally.com, is a former girlfriend of David Beckham. In June, more than 400 viewers complained about Mr Neville’s ‘robotic’ and ‘monotonous’ BBC commentary debut during England’s first World Cup game against Italy. Afterwards, he joked: ‘I helped everyone get to sleep.’ Manchester United players’ inability to cope with everyday tasks was revealed by ex-coach Brian McClair in 2004 when he said ‘none of the players can change a tyre on their cars’. FATHER . Neville Neville, 65, who was known for being the agent for his sons, is a former league cricketer and commercial director of Bury FC. His unusual name is featured in the classic terrace chant 'Neville Neville is the name of your dad', set to the tune of David Bowie's song Rebel Rebel. MOTHER . Jill Neville, 63, has been company secretary of Bury FC for more than 20 years and also general manager for the last five years. She was awarded for the freedom of the borough of Bury in 2012. At the time she was said to still be playing rounders and netball, and promoting sport in the area. THREE SIBLINGS . Gary Neville - England’s most-capped right-back in history - spent his whole career at Manchester United. He won eight Premier League titles, three FA Cups, one League Cup and two Champions Leagues. The 39-year-old is now a coach for England as well as a pundit for Sky Sports. Phil Neville hung up his boots at the end of the 2012/13 season after racking up 505 Premier League appearances for Manchester United and Everton. He won six Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League. The 37-year-old father-of-two is now a pundit for the BBC. Tracey Neville, 37, who went to school in Bury with her two brothers, is a twin of Phil - and a retired England netball player. She won a bronze at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, before retiring due to injury in 2004. She is now director of netball for the Manchester Thunder team.

"Three fans blagged their way into England's hotel in Rio and met all of Roy Hodgson's players after telling security they needed the TOILET. Andy Richardson, 22, Alex Hill, 20, and Josh Pearce, 19, gained entry to England's Royal Tulip Hotel after making their way past 20 armed guards and had selfies taken with all of the players. The trio drank beer just feet away from Steven Gerrard and Co before asking the England stars to pose for photos with them. VIDEO Scroll down for: Take a look at England's 5-star World Cup Royal Tulip Hotel in Rio . How've we managed this? England fans pose with Frank Lampard after blagging their way into the team hotel . All smiles: England captain Steven Gerrard and frontman Daniel Sturridge posed for photos with the fans . The boss: England managed Roy Hodgson was more than happy to oblige for a picture . Can we have a photo please? England goalkeeper Joe Hart and midfielder Jack Wilshere pose for the camera . Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Daniel Sturridge, Joe Hart and Leighton Baines all duly obliged as the pals got some brilliant World Cup momentos. After chatting with the players, the three friends celebrated their coup by drinking six pints of beer between them and polishing off a club sandwich before calmly walking out the front door. On Tuesday, Andy, from Worcester, told how they blagged their way past security at the luxury Golden Tulip hotel on Sunday by saying they needed the loo. They then jinked their way through dozens of FA officials, hotel staff and more security guards before coming face to face with their heroes in the lobby. The Birmingham City fan added: 'I found out the England squad had just arrived in Rio so got out of bed and tried finding where they were. 'We found out it was called Royal Tulip. The taxi driver first took us to the Royal Rio Hotel and that was not it. 'Then another hotel called Golden Tulip and again they said no and then suddenly he took us on a 25-minute drive to where they were staying. Sneaky: The fans, pictured with Everton left-back Leighton Baines, told security they needed the toilet . 'We got out and there was armed police everywhere so we sun bathed on the beach for three hours. Then we thought ‘f**k it’ we are going in. 'There were 20 armed police and I hopped towards them saying I needed the toilet. 'They fell for the trick and suddenly we were in. Roy Hodgson was there so we started off getting a photo with him. 'Within the next three or four hours we got pictures with most the squad. We ended up having six beers and a club sandwich as we did it. 'We walked out the hotel and the Brazilian kids started shouting and running. Posers: The three supporters asked Liverpool and England midfielder Jordan Henderson for a quick snap . Thirsty work: The pals revealed they ended up having six beers and a club sandwich in the England hotel . 'They must have thought I was famous. Suddenly I had them wanting me to sign and have photos with them. What a day.” Andy, who works at Muller Wiseman Dairies, flew out to Rio on June 5 with his two mates after they bought tickets for all England’s opening matches. Student Alex said: 'It was pretty mad to come out to Brazil and actually meet the England team. We couldn’t quite believe it when we got past the guards. 'It was all a bit of fun but makes you think about how seriously the authorities are taking security when three lads on a jolly from England can meet the players by blagging the guards.' Saint: Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana was happy to take time out to pose with the trio of England fans . Speaking from the family home in Worcester, Josh’s mum Tracey Pearce, 46, added: 'I was shocked when I saw the lads put the photos up on Facebook. 'But it is just like them to be cheeky and go for it. 'They wouldn’t have caused any harm and I am so glad they have got all those photos with the players to remember the trip.' The England team landed in Rio at 8.30am on Sunday morning after flying into a private military base from their pre-World Cup training camp in Miami. Roy Hodgson and his squad’s official tour bus was then accompanied by a host of police outriders and vehicles as they made their way through the city to the Royal Tulip hotel on Sao Conrado beach. Young guns: Defenders Luke Shaw and Chris Smalling have their picture taken with supporters . A fearsome-looking team of 24 Brazilian military police also lined up at the hotel’s main reception, all carrying semi-automatic weapons and riot shields, to meet the stars as they got off the bus. They will be on duty 24-hours a day for the month-long tournament as the team enjoy the hotel’s indoor and outdoor pools, five-star restaurants and bars. In contrast to previous tournaments, England have just two floors of the 17-floor, 418-room hotel, with the public and fellow guests allowed to mingle freely with them. In May, the FA insisted it wasn’t worried about England’s World Cup hotel even though out-of-date food was seized from the Royal Tulip. Health inspectors took 2.362kg of unusable butter as well as salmon and Parma ham. Bizarrely, the luxury venue was also fined for not providing condoms to guests. Safe pair of hands: Goalkeepers Fraser Forster and Ben Foster were one of many England players approached .","Three England fans sneaked into team hotel after telling security they needed the toilet .

"The blood clot that sent Hillary Clinton to the hospital on Sunday is located between her brain and her skull behind her right ear, it was revealed this afternoon. The Secretary of State's doctors say they found the clot in a large vein in her head - though it is in a blood vessel that runs across the surface of her brain and is not in the brain itself. Doctors said Clinton has suffered no brain damage or stroke and that she is expected to make a full recovery. Scroll down to see the media vigil outside of Clinton's Hospital in NYC . Health scare: Hillary Clinton's doctors discovered the clot during a follow-up exam on Sunday . Distraught: Chelsea Clinton, seen here in a 2007 file photo, was seen looking upset as she left her mother's hospital on Monday . 'In all other aspects of her recovery, the Secretary is making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her staff,' Drs Lisa Bardack and Gigi El-Bayoumi said in a statement. A clot occurs when a blockage builds up, either from partial thrombus (coagulated blood) or an outside compression. When the vein becomes blocked, the coagulated blood may extend to veins draining the area, which could lead to a lack of oxygen and tissue death. For Clinton, 'the particular vein they're talking about, there are enough other areas for the blood to travel through so it doesn't build up in the brain,' Dr Sanjay Gupta told CNN. The condition can be treated with blood thinners administered over several months until the clot breaks down. A distraught-looking Chelsea Clinton . visited her mother in the hospital this afternoon as she recovered from the clot, which stems from a concussion . earlier this months. The former First Daughter was seen walking out of New York-Presbyterian Hospital looking troubled. Her mother is likely to ring in the New Year from her hospital suite so her doctors can keep a close eye on her condition. Clinton, 65, was admitted to the hospital on Sunday and CBS New York reports that doctors want to monitor her for at least another 48 hours. Doctors are keeping her under their watchful eye as they adjust the dose of her anti-clotting medication. Chelsea, who was spotted by the New York Daily News, was to first member of Clinton's family to be seen publicly at the hospital. There is no word on the whereabouts of her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Chelsea, 32, a special correspondent for NBC News, looked upset as she left the hospital - cell phone in hand. She ignored questions from a reporter and went back inside. Aides and doctors say Clinton contracted a stomach virus in early December and became dehydrated, then fainted, fell and hit her head on December 9. She was diagnosed with a concussion on December 13 and hasn't been seen in public since. The seriousness of a blood clot 'depends . on where it is,' said Dr Gholam Motamedi, a neurologist at Georgetown . University Medical Center who was not involved in Clinton's care. Political force: Clinton is known as President Obama's most popular cabinet members - and among the names mentioned for a possible 2016 presidential run . Medical care: Clinton was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital so doctors could monitor her medication . 'In the course of a routine follow-up MRI on Sunday, the scan revealed that a right transverse sinus venous thrombosis had formed. This is a clot in the vein that is situated in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear. It did not result in a stroke, or neurological damage. To help dissolve this clot, her medical team began treating the Secretary with blood thinners. She will be released once the medication dose has been established. In all other aspects of her recovery, the Secretary is making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her staff.'From Dr Lisa Bardack, Mt. Kisco Medical Group, and Dr Gigi El-Bayoumi, George Washington University . The new health scare may bring back . some painful memories for the former first lady, who suffered a large . blood clot in her leg back in 1998. In a 2007 interview with the New York Daily News, Clinton called the 1998 clot 'the most significant health scare I've ever had.' Most clots in the legs are . treated with six months of blood thinners to allow them to dissolve on . their own and to prevent further clots from forming, he said. A clot in a lung or the brain is more . serious. Lung clots, called pulmonary embolisms, can be deadly, and a . clot in the brain can cause a stroke. Clinton's illness led her to cancel an . overseas trip and scheduled testimony before Congress about the attack . on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. When her absence was reported, several pundits and newspapers accused Clinton of making her illness seem worse than it was to dodge questions from lawmakers over the consulate attack, which claimed the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. The New York Post called her concussion a 'head fake.' Florida Rep Allan West said Clinton had a case of the 'Benghazi flu,' while Fox News contributer Charles Krauthammer dubbed it an 'acute Benghazi allergy.' First family: Mrs Clinton is pictured with daughter Chelsea Clinton and husband Bill during the closing Plenary session of the seventh Annual Meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2011 . Reines said doctors will continue to assess Clinton's condition, 'including other issues associated with her concussion.' Earlier this week, The National Enquirer . reported that brain cancer was behind Mrs Clinton's health problems and . that she was facing a barrage of medical tests to confirm the . diagnosis. But a spokesman for the Democrat labelled the claims 'absolute nonsense' and insisted Clinton was recovering well from the fall and subsequent concussion. Only days before her concussion Clinton had said she was in excellent health during an interview with Barbara Walters. Hillary Clinton has a blood clot located in the vein in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear, a condition called transverse sinus venous thrombosis. The transverse sinus is located beneath the brain and allows blood to drain from the back of the head. It is the most common sites for clots inside the head, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A clot occurs when a blockage builds up, either from partial thrombus (coagulated blood) or an outside compression. When the vein becomes blocked, the coagulated blood may extend to veins draining the area, which could lead to a lack of oxygen and tissue death. For Clinton, 'the particular vein they're talking about, there are enough other areas for the blood to travel through so it doesn't build up in the brain,' Dr Sanjay Gupta told CNN. Symptoms and signs can include headache, nausea, vomiting and seizures, although the condition was detected in Clinton with a routine MRI scan following her treatment for concussion. Doctors questioned whether this concussion, paired with the fact Hillary had a similar clot in her leg in 1988, led to the condition. 'You don't typically see blood clots forming in veins after this sort of concussion,' Dr Gupta said. 'She is somebody who has formed these blood clots before. There are some people who more likely develop blood clots. Does she clot more vigorously than normal? That with the brain injury - the concussion - could have led to it.' The condition can be treated with blood thinners administered over several months until the clot breaks down. Other treatments include using a shunt to drain pressure on the brain or surgery - yet doctors said neither are necessary for Clinton. 'The most concerning thing was... the fact that this could be a blood clot pushing on her brain,' Dr Gupta said. 'That's not what this is. You wouldn't treat something like that with blood thinners. It's not a mass or a collection of blood pushing on the brain but it is something you'd want to address fairly quickly.' Detractors have claimed Clinton's advancing age and health make her too old to realistically serve as a two-term president were she elected in 2016. 'I am, thankfully, knock on wood, not only healthy, but have incredible stamina and energy,' Clinton told Barbara Walters. Clinton has a history of fainting, having experienced a brief spell in in 2005 during an appearance before a women's group in Buffalo. The former first lady is expected to step down from her role as Secretary of State in the beginning of 2013 when President Obama begins his second term. At a State Department press conference in January 2012, she announced that she would be stepping down from the 'high wire of American politics' after 20 years as first lady, a senator from New York, and finally U.S. Secretary of State. She told reporters at the press conference that 'it would be a good idea to find out how tired I really am.'

"An unconscious woman raped by four Vanderbilt football players was 'thrown out like a piece of trash' once they were done with her, prosecutors said today as they wrapped up their case. A jury in Nashville, Tennessee heard attorneys' closing arguments on Tuesday afternoon and must now decide whether to find Brandon Vandenburg, 21, and Cory Batey, who turned 21 today, guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery. Last week, the alleged victim testified that Vandenburg, whom she was dating, plied her with alcohol one night in June 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room. The jury saw surveillance footage showing her being dragged to Vandenburg's dorm room. Deliberations: A jury will decide whether to find Brandon Vandenburg, pictured left on Tuesday, and Cory Batey, pictured right on Monday, of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery . Waiting game: The defense gatherers after the jury was read the charges against Vandenburg and Batey . Support: Batey gets a hug from a friend after the jury leaves the room to begin deliberations on Tuesday . Inside the room, Vandenburg switched on porn and encouraged Batey and two others to assault the woman with a water bottle and rape her, prosecutors said. The jury was shown graphic cell phone footage of part of the alleged sexual attack, which the men had recorded. Vandenburg then sent some footage to friends. One of the men, Brandon Banks, allegedly anally raped the woman with the water bottle as Vandenburg said, 'squeeze that s***', the video showed. Batey then allegedly urinated on her. 'It wasn't just about sexual gratification and fun, it was about degrading her, humiliating her,' Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman said in his closing arguments on Tuesday. The woman was then 'thrown in the hall like a piece of trash by the man she trusted, Brandon Vandenburg,' Thurman said. 'She's not a piece of trash,' he continued. 'She's a victim. Not an alleged victim. A victim. A victim that had the courage to take that stand and face her attackers. A victim that had the courage to come in here and fight for justice.' The woman testified last week that she could not remember any of the attack. Throughout the trial, the defense had argued that the men had become swept up in a promiscuous college culture, where people walked around naked and binged on alcohol. Questions: On Monday, Batey, pictured as he testified on the stand, said he blacked out from drinking so much on the night of the attack and could not remember what had happened . But Thurman said that was not the culture that was revealed during the trial. 'The culture you really saw was entitled athletes thinking rules don't apply to them, that's the real culture you saw here,' he told the court on Tuesday. 'Their mindset that they could get away with anything. ""The rules don't apply to us"".' Defense attorneys for the men had also argued that due to the copious amounts of alcohol they had consumed - one estimate put Batey's consumption at as many as 22 drinks - they were not aware of their surroundings. Batey took the stand on Monday and claimed he had 'blacked out' and didn't remember what happened that night in Vandenburg's dorm room until he later saw cellphone images. 'I was just drunk out of my mind,' Batey testified. 'This is something I would never do in my right state of mind. I'm just sorry.' But Thurman dismissed the claim, pointing out that Batey had lucidly texted a friend to say he wanted a quesadilla - with the word correctly spelled - just 30 minutes before the alleged attack. He then went for a shower and made phone calls to friends before hanging out with his girlfriend. 'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case . Regrets? McKenzie also took the stand during his teammates' trial and insisted he had not touched the girl . 'Is that a blackout?' Thurman asked. 'Is that a person who doesn't know what he's doing? Is that a person who's not acting knowingly?' Similarly, he said that Vandenburg had been drinking, yet nobody during the trial testified that he was not aware of his surroundings. In the aftermath of the attack, Vandenburg pressured his friends to delete the graphic videos and attempted to destroy evidence on cellphones and computers, prosecutors said. He also emailed the victim and pressured her not to say anything negative about him, they said. 'Are those the actions of a person who is not criminally responsible?' Thurman asked. 'There's an inference of guilt when you attempt to destroy evidence... Innocent people don't destroy evidence.' But Vandenburg's attorney interpreted his client's attempts to destroy the photos a different way. 'He at least had the sense afterwards to be upset about it,' Fletcher Long told the jury. Injuries: Katherine Parnell, a nurse at Metro General who carried out a rape kit on the victim, said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, and scratches on her feet . He also insisted that Vandenburg had not penetrated the woman so could not be found guilty of rape. Vandenburg had consumed too much alcohol to be able to rape her, according to earlier testimony. Long added that there was not enough evidence that Vandenburg had encouraged the other men to rape the woman. The jury will now have to decide whether Vandenburg should be convicted of rape even though he didn't penetrate the victim, and whether Batey was so drunk that he could not have formed the intent to commit the crime. 'I care what the law is, and they haven't met it,' Long said in his closing arguments. All four men are charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with tampering with evidence and unlawful photography. All four have pleaded not guilty, including the two men not on trial: Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks. McKenzie also testified at the trial, saying he didn't touch the woman but took pictures. A trial date for the two men has not yet been set.","WARNING: GRAPHIC DETAILS .

"Hundreds of gypsy mourners took to the streets of Wales today to pay tribute to a man who died after being in a coma for the last 22 years. Andrew Colwyn - known as 'the boy' - was 24 when he was hit by a drunk driver in 1992, leaving him bedridden and unable to communicate with family or friends. In true big fat gypsy style, his funeral procession today was lead by a horse and carriage, and followed by five trucks full of flower displays including pints of beer, security vans, and a pack of cigarettes. Other displays gracing the streets of Splott, Cardiff, were boxers and Ford pick-up vans, celebrating his love of cars and amateur boxing. Scroll down for video . Dozens of gypsies took to the streets of Wales today to mourn the death of Andrew Colwyn, known as 'The Boy', who spent the last 22 years in a coma after being hit by a drunk driver in 1992 . Mr Colwyn (pictured right) was 24 when the crash happened in 1992. Today his funeral procession was followed by truck containing flowers shaped into a boxer and a pint of beer (left) Among the more bizarre tributes was this design, made to look like a pack of cigarettes, with the word 'brother' pinned across the bottom . He died on November 20, and was watching over for the night by family and friends ahead of the formal service today. Mr Colwyn, a former scrap metal worker, was described as 'popular and well-respected' and was known by everyone in the Welsh gypsy and traveller community. His body was taken through the streets in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by five pick-up trucks full of flowers, including displays made into pints of beer, a security van, and the word 'brother'. His cousin, also named Andrew Colwyn, 20, said: 'He was a very nice guy and everyone had a nice word to say about him. 'People have come over from all across the country to pay tribute to The Boy today, West Wales and all over the place. 'The Boy was very popular and well respected back in the day. But he got knocked over by a drink driver, 22 years ago now, and he just never recovered. 'We wanted to give him a proper send-off and that's why all the flowers represent what he loved. He loved boxing, The Boy did, he was an amateur boxer, and he loves his trucks and his dogs too.' Mr Colwyn's family said he was an amateur boxer and loved cars, which explains this tribute shaped like a yellow Ford pick-up truck . A picture of Mr Colwyn is seen underneath the inscription 'Uncle Boy', a nod to his nickname 'The Boy'. To either side are boxing gloves, as Mr Colwyn was an amateur boxer before he was hit by a drunk driver . Among the flower displays was this blue Securicor van, presumably a reference to his love of vans . A pair of greyhounds (pictured front left and right) were also among the tributes to Mr Colwyn, which were paraded through the streets of Cardiff on the back of five trucks . Cousin John Price, 23, said: 'He was The Boy to everyone who knew him - and everyone did. 'Go and knock on any door here in Splott, ask them if they know The Boy, and they'll tell you everything about the terrible accident that happened. 'He was in hospital for seven years after the accident and then his mum and dad looked after him full-time. They idolised him - he was their world. 'But he's with them now and he isn't suffering anymore and that's what matters. 'We've done this send-off for him to pay our respects and say our goodbyes at last because this is it really. Once you're gone you're gone but there's nothing we can do about that. 'But we can show our respect and how important he was to us all and how much we'll miss him.' Police in Wales were forced to close roads along the procession route today after dozens of mourners showed up, saying there was the potential for disruption . Mr Colwyn's body was watched over by close family and friends during the 24 hours after he died, according to gypsy tradition, before being drawn through the streets of Cardiff by horse and carriage . Mr Colwyn, a scrap metal worker, was described as a 'popular and well-respected' man who was known throughout the Welsh traveller community . A traditional gypsy vigil was held all night for Mr Colwyn on Monday with the body left with family members at the Rover Way traveller site overnight. His cousin Mr Colwyn added: 'It's a very old tradition. We don't eat any meat from the moment The Boy died to the moment he's buried. 'And there's no telly in the room where he is either, not until he's laid to rest. We left it quiet and respectful for him as well as a big fire to keep the body warm.' Cardiff officials closed roads for the procession earlier today, saying there was a potential for disruption and a high amount of traffic. Around six police officers were in attendance near St Alban's church, where the service was held.","Andrew Colwyn was 24 when he was hit by a drunk driver in Wales in 1992 .

"David Cameron dramatically played the patriotic card yesterday by accusing Ed Miliband of trampling on the rights of the English by blocking ‘home rule’ measures for England. In a move designed to upstage the Labour conference, which started on Friday, the Prime Minister raised the stakes in the bitter war of words that has raged since the Scottish referendum. Mr Cameron called on Mr Miliband to drop his opposition to Tory plans for ‘English votes for English laws’ to match devolved powers for Scotland, which have been promised now the Scots have voted to reject independence. He accused Labour of ‘overriding’ the rights of the English and Welsh – and warned it could lead to a fierce backlash. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron called on Ed Miliband to drop his refusal to back Tory plans for ‘English votes for English laws’ to match devolved powers for Scotland, which have been promised after Scots voted 'No' The provocative move came as a Mail on Sunday poll showed big support in England for Mr Cameron’s home rule measures. English voters say the three party leaders were ‘panicked’ into a last-minute pledge of more cash for Scotland because they feared Alex Salmond and the Scottish Nationalists were heading for victory. Labour reacted furiously to Mr Cameron’s new attack on Mr Miliband. They believe his ‘English votes for English laws’ plan is a Tory trap – because it would mean scrapping the voting rights of 41 Scots Labour MPs at Westminster, potentially wrecking Mr Miliband’s hopes of forming a government. In effect, Mr Cameron is turning the row into a personal battle with Mr Miliband to prove which of them stands up for England. In a hard-hitting article for today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Cameron says: ‘The challenge to Labour and Ed Miliband is clear: either resolve this issue with us, or explain to the people of the rest of the UK why they shouldn’t have the same powers as we are devolving to the people of Scotland – why, for instance, Scottish MPs should be able to vote to vary income tax rates in England, when the Scottish Parliament is going to be setting Scottish income tax rates in Scotland.’ A Labour aide accused Mr Cameron of ‘cynicism’ – and said his package of measures had been ‘drawn up on the back of a fag packet’. But Tory chiefs are convinced they have forced Mr Miliband on to the back foot with the surprise move to tie extra money and home rule for Scotland to similar measures for England and Wales. Labour MPs have waded in, claiming Mr Miliband must do more to show he is ‘pro-English’. In a message aimed directly at Mr Miliband, Mr Cameron writes in The Mail on Sunday: ‘Millions of people in the rest of the UK have been asking: “Why can’t we have the same powers and rights as Scotland?” ‘Why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on English schools, English hospitals, English or Welsh income taxes, when English or Welsh MPs would have no say in such matters in Scotland? It is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of England and Wales overridden in this way. Labour reacted furiously to Mr Cameron’s new attack on Mr Miliband, who is in Manchester for the party's conference this weekend . Mr Cameron will host an ‘English votes for English laws’ summit at his official country residence Chequers on Monday. He has invited senior Tory MPs including John Redwood (pictured) and Michael Gove . There was a ‘crying need’ for England and Wales not to be discriminated against, he argued, adding that if the rights of the English and Welsh were trampled on it could lead to serious trouble. The ‘English question’ was ‘a basic unfairness at the heart of our democracy’ – and must be put right. Mr Cameron will host an ‘English votes for English laws’ summit at his official country residence Chequers tomorrow. He has invited senior Tory MPs including John Redwood, who has led the campaign for a new English Parliament, and Conservative grandees Peter Lilley and Bernard Jenkin to discuss the issue with Cabinet Ministers Michael Gove and William Hague. Mr Salmond yesterday claimed Mr Cameron had already started to go back on his vow to give Scotland a better deal, saying people had been ‘tricked by Westminster into believing there would be an immediate offer of extra powers… and within 24 hours of the polls closing they start to tear up the commitments.’ The Tory-Labour feud came as it emerged Alistair Darling is poised to quit politics after being upstaged by his old boss Gordon Brown in the ‘No’ campaign. The former Labour Chancellor says he will decide soon whether to resign from his Edinburgh seat at the next Election. Alistair Darling led the No camp to victory in Thursday’s referendum, but was eclipsed in the last days of the campaign by Mr Brow . Mr Darling led the No camp to victory in Thursday’s referendum, but was eclipsed by Mr Brown, whose passionate oratory was credited with winning over wavering Yes supporters. It was particularly galling for Mr Darling, 60, who until a few weeks ago had barely been on speaking terms with Mr Brown since falling out over how to handle the economic crisis when they were in power. Asked if he would stand again, Mr Darling – who has been tipped for a possible return to the front bench in a reshuffle later this month – said: ‘I am making my mind up.’ The news came as Mr Brown gave another barnstorming speech in which he promised to force Westminster to stick to its promise of extra devolution for the Scots – and dispelled any speculation about his own future by saying that he was ‘too old to be the comeback kid and too young to be an elder statesman’. Mr Brown, 63, said ‘the eyes of the world’ were on the party leaders in Westminster over the pledge to give the Scots greater devolution. ‘These are men who have been promise makers and they will not be promise breakers,’ the former Prime Minister said. Mr Brown said a draft Scots Home Rule Bill would be ready by ‘in time for Burns Day’ – January 25 – but it cannot become law until after next year’s General Election.","Cameron called on Miliband to back Tory plans to block Scottish MPs .

"The Islamic State group stoned two men to death in Syria Tuesday after claiming they were gay, a monitor said, in the jihadist organisation's first executions for alleged homosexuality. 'The IS today stoned to death a man that it said was gay,' the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, adding that the victim was around 20 years old. He was killed in Mayadeen in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, near the border with Iraq. Scroll down for video . The Islamic State group stoned two men to death in Syria Tuesday after claiming they were gay, a monitor said. Pictured are Isis fighters in the Syrian city of Raqqa . The Britain-based Observatory said Isis claimed it found videos on his mobile phone showing him 'practising indecent acts with males'. In a separate incident on Tuesday, an 18-year-old was also stoned to death in Deir Ezzor city after the group said he was gay, the Observatory said. Activists on social media said that the dead men were opponents of IS and that the group had used the allegation as a pretext to kill them. The United Nations said this month the IS had carried out several executions by stoning of women in Syria it accused of adultery. The jihadists proclaimed a 'caliphate' in June after seizing swathes of Iraq and Syria. Activists say IS carries out regular public executions - often beheadings - in areas it controls. The jihadists proclaimed a 'caliphate' in June after seizing swathes of Iraq and Syria . Meanwhile, it emerged today that a former U.S. Marine has joined a growing foreign legion of Western fighters battling ISIS on the frontline just weeks after he starred in a survival reality TV show. Photos have emerged on social media that apparently show Joshua Bell, 28, who appeared in the third season of Naked and Afraid, a reality survival show produced by the Discovery Channel. In 'Nicaragua Nightmare', Bell alongside his fellow contestant, Amanda Leigh, had to survive 21 days in the Central American jungle. The episode was aired in early September 2014 and saw Bell suffering with fever and sickness while helping a female fellow contestant make a bikini out of small strips of duct-tape. Just two months later, on November 10, Bell arrived on the frontline in the besieged city of Kobane . Bell is among the latest foreign volunteers - many of them ex-US, British and Canadian military - to join a group called The Lions Of Rojava, who have been mounting a brave counter attack against Islamic State terrorists in northern Syria over the past few months. The Lions Of Rojava act as a foreign legion for the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) - a group that has been mounting a brave resistance against ISIS in Kobane for more that two months. Bell was a contestant on Naked and Afraid on September 7. In the show, both contestants are strangers and have to work together to survive unassisted in a hostile environment.

The two survivalists have to find clean water, food and build a weather proof shelter. Bell is  28-years-old and was born in Florida. At the age of three, he and his family moved to South Carolina before switching to Roxboro, North Carolina, when he was just six years old. He is understood to have served for four years in the US marines, reaching the rank of Corporal and being deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq.","Isis have stoned two men, 18 and 20, to death in Syria for being gay .

"Colonel Gaddafi's eldest son Saif has hired a group of South African mercenaries to smuggle him out of Libya and into a friendly African country, according to information received by the International Criminal Court. The Court, based in the Hague, said Saif, 39, whose current whereabouts are the source of much speculation, had been in contact with them through intermediaries to discuss the possibility of surrendering for trial. Saif escaped even though his motorcade . was hit by a Nato air strike as it left Bani Walid on Oct. 19, the day . before his father died in Sirte. Praying for salvation: Saif Gaddafi has allegedly hired a team of South African mercenaries to smuggle him to safety . Three of his brothers were killed in the war. Sources this week reported he had taken refuge with Tuareg nomads, who his family had helped financially in the past, in the borderlands between Libya and Niger. The Gaddafis befriended desert tribes in Niger, Mali and other poor former French colonies in West Africa. Other African countries received Libyan largesse during the 42-year rule of Gaddafi, a self-styled African 'king of kings'. U.S. military and government representatives held security talks in neighbouring Niger with local officials in Agadez, which has been a way station for other Libyan fugitives, including another son of Muammar Gaddafi, Saadi. Justice: The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is keen to bring Colonel Gaddafi's eldest son to the Netherlands for trial . A U.S. military plane has been spotted at Agadez airport. A top regional official declined to say what the talks with the Americans were about, but spoke of escape plans by Saif al-Islam and former Libyan intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi, both wanted by the ICC for crimes against humanity. 'Senussi is being extricated from Mali toward a country that is a non-signatory to the (ICC) convention. I am certain that they will both (Senussi and Saif al-Islam) be extricated by plane, one from Mali the other from Niger,' said the official, who asked not to be named. He said there were at least 10 airstrips in the north of Niger near the Libyan border that could be used to whisk Saif al-Islam out of the country. However, a member of parliament from northern Mali, Ibrahim Assaleh Ag Mohamed, denied Senussi or Saif al-Islam were in his country and said they would not be accepted if they tried to enter. The arrival of the U.S. delegation followed remarks by Mohamed Anako, president of Agadez region, who said he would give Saif al-Islam refuge. 'Libya and Niger are brother countries and cousins ... so we will welcome him in,' he said. The ICC has warned Saif al-Islam, who is understandably anxious not to be captured by Libyan interim government forces in whose hands his father  was brutally killed last week, that it could order a mid-air interception if he tried to flee by plane from his Sahara desert hideout for a safe haven. ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said: 'There are some people connected with him that are in touch with people connected with us ... it's through intermediaries,' 'We have some information that there is a mercenary group trying to help him to move to a different country, so we are trying to prevent this activity,' said Moreno-Ocampo. 'We are also working with some states to see if we can disrupt this attempt. Some of them are South Africans allegedly.' On the run: Saif al-Islam gestures to reporters in Tripoli on August 23. The ICC said he was in 'informal contact' with them about the possibility of surrenering to stand trial . Moreno-Ocampo said the ICC was not making any deal with Saif al-Islam but was explaining through the contacts that he had to face trial because he had been indicted for war crimes. 'He says he is innocent,' said the prosecutor. France, a backer of February's revolt against Gaddafi, reminded African states of their obligations to hand Saif al-Islam over to the international court. 'We don't care whether he goes on foot, by plane, by boat, by car or on a camel, the only thing that matters is that he belongs in the ICC,' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero. Niger, Mali, Chad and Burkina Faso, a swathe of arid states to the south of Libya, are all signatories to the treaty that set up the ICC. Algeria, which took in Saif al-Islam's mother, sister, brother Hannibal and half-brother Mohammed, is not a signatory. Nor is Sudan or Zimbabwe. Leaders of Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC) would like to run their own trials, but acknowledge that their writ barely runs in the deep south. Nato countries, now winding up a mission that backed the revolt, have expressed little enthusiasm for hunting a few individuals across a vast tract of empty continent. Saif al-Islam was once seen as a liberal reformer, architect of a rapprochement with Western states on whom his father waged proxy guerrilla wars for decades. But he responded with belligerent rhetoric after the revolt erupted in Libya. The ICC accuses him of hiring mercenaries to carry out a plan, worked out with his father and Senussi, to kill unarmed protesters inspired by 'Arab Spring' uprisings elsewhere. Niger's government in the capital Niamey has vowed to meet its ICC commitments. But 750 km (400 miles) north in a region where cross-border allegiances among Tuareg nomads often outweigh national ties, the picture looks different. Some of the tens of thousands of people who eke out a living in the Sahara, roamed by smugglers and nomadic herders, say there would be a welcome for the younger Gaddafi. 'We are ready to hide him wherever needed,' said Mouddour Barka, a resident of Agadez. 'We are telling the international community to stay out of this business and our own authorities not to hand him over - otherwise we are ready to go out on to the streets and they will have us to deal with.' A U.S. military aircraft flew 25 wounded NTC fighters out of Tripoli on Saturday for medical treatment in the United States. Britain has also taken in wounded fighters.",Colonel Gaddafi's eldest son reportedly hiding with Tuareg desert nomads close to the Niger border .

"New York City may be known for its luxury skyscrapers and bustling streets, but just a few miles south of Manhattan, there is an altogether different sight to behold. Languishing in the water just off Staten Island, scores of boats are left to rust in a little-known ship graveyard - just a stone's throw from the city's lights. Images captured by US photographer Gordon Donovan reveal the haunting scenes at the Arthur Kill Ship Graveyard in Rossville, Staten Island, which is only accessible by meandering through a cemetery and knocking on private homes to ask for permission to pass. The photographs show great hunks of metal languishing in the water on the south side of Staten Island, which is fewer than 20 miles from Manhattan and 18 miles from Brooklyn. Haunting: Photographs have revealed the eerie scenes at Arthur Kill Ship Graveyard in Rossville, Staten Island - just an hour south of Manhattan . Left to rust: The shipyard harbors disused and decommissioned ferries, tugboats, warships and barges that are left at the site until they are dismantled or salvaged . Final resting place: Another image by Gordon Donovan shows the rusting and peeling paint of a retired service vessel in shallow waters of the Arthur Kill . The dumping ground, which is one of the largest marine scrap yards on the East Coast, harbors disused and decommissioned ferries, tugboats, warships and barges that are ravaged by the elements until they are dismantled or salvaged. Before the boats were dumped at the graveyard, the site was used as the slip for The Blazing Star Ferry, which transported passengers and cargo across the Arthur Kill to Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. The graveyard has been at the site since the 1930s, when Witt's Marine Equipment company worked to collect, salvage and re-sell materials from wrecked ships and the proud owner, John J. Witte, amassed hundreds of warships at the site. It is now overseen by New Jersey's Donjon Marine Company, which has put 12-ft metal walls around the perimeter in a bid to block it from prying eyes. But while the graveyard remains a little-known secret even among New Yorkers, Donovan - the photographer - has been visiting the site for seven years. Eerie: The shipyard can only been seen if visitors walk through a cemetery and ask for permission from private property owners to enter and reach the water . Ghostly: An image shows the Bayou Plaquemine, which was built in 1921 for the U.S. Army. The vessel and crew were assigned to the Fourth Service Command during World War II and based at Fort Barrancas, Florida before the vessel was eventually retired in 1972 . Ancient: The colorful pipes and control panel of an oil barge can be seen at the graveyard, while in the background is a jail cell on board a New York Central barge . Rotting: The rusty vessels are hidden behind a 12ft fence near the water's edge but can be accessed by asking for permission from private homeowners nearby . Still: Donovan, a photograph from the UK, has taken photographs of the ship graveyard over the past seven years during his visits to New York City . He explained that the docks are only accessible by properties owned by families nearby, but that the homeowners allowed him to get a closer look once he asked for permission. 'The area is filled with exposed spikes aged by the elements, most of these boats have just rotted in the water,' he explained. 'The boats photographed were made out of materials taken from Mother Earth and used to serve a purpose. When they became obsolete, they were discarded and have slowly rotted and sank in the muck off Rossville as Mother Earth takes them back.' The graveyard has been a final resting place for a ship that took part in D-Day and a World War II submarine destroyer that was the first ship manned by an all-black crew. Donovan's images also reveal a barge that contains a jail cell to ship prisoners. Left behind: The collapsing bridge of a retired vessel at the graveyard, which opened in the 1930s and now . Forgotten: The graveyard has been a final resting place for a ship that took part in D-Day and a submarine destroyer that was the first ship manned by an all-black crew . Out of order: Waters seep over a rusting barge as the tide rises at the ghostly ship graveyard, which is about 20 miles south of Manhattan and 18 miles from Brooklyn . Tipping point: In this image, the graveyard, which is located on Arthur Kill Road in Rossville, can be seen from an open train box car sitting on the deck of a barge . Resting place: Before the ships were dumped at the graveyard, the site was used as the slip for The Blazing Star Ferry, which transported passengers and cargo across the Arthur Kill to Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. It now harbors vessels until they are dismantled and parts are re-used . Among other vessels that have been left there to rust is a New York City Fire Department fireboat named in the honor of Abram S. Hewitt, who was elected mayor of the city in 1886. The ship served from 1903 - the year he died - until 1958, when it was scrapped. During its lifetime, it helped rescue survivors when the General Slocum passenger boat sank in the East River in 1904. 'Most of the names have been taken off - spray painted over - but the New York City Fire Department fireboat Abram S. Hewitt is there,' Donovan explained. 'It has sunk in mud over the years and only the smoke stack is still visible.'","Vessels are dumped at the Arthur Kill Ship Graveyard in Rossville, Staten Island - just an hour from Manhattan .

"Martha Stewart is set to expand her home goods empire by opening a cafe in New York City. According to Bloomberg, the eatery will be located in the Starret-Lehigh Building in Chelsea, where  Martha Stewart Living is headquartered. The opening date has not yet been revealed, nor is it clear whether the cafe will serve recipes created by the 73-year-old homemaking maven herself. Scroll down for video . The Martha empire: Martha Stewart is set to expand her home goods empire by opening a cafe in New York City . Location, location: The eatery will be located in the Starret-Lehigh Building in Chelsea, where the Martha Stewart Living is already headquartered . Claudia Shaum, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc, told AdAge that cafe managers are now hiring baristas for the soon-to-be-open cafe. The news comes in the wake of major financial losses for Martha's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia - to be precise, a $1.8million loss last year. According to AdAge, in October it agreed to farm out most of its magazine operations to Better Homes and Gardens publisher Meredith Corp. to reduce costs. Some speculate that competitors like Gwyneth Paltrow - who recently opened her second Goop pop-up store - and Blake Lively are to blame for the loss. In early November, Gwyneth announced the opening of a pop-up shop  in Dallas, Texas, where shoppers could buy the products featured on her lifestyle website. This was the second pop-up shop for Goop. In May, she opened her first in Los Angeles' Brentwood Country Mart, where the pricey goods on the shelves included $650 vintage spoons and a $2,350 vintage Christian Dior backgammon set. Head to head: Some speculate that competitors like Gwyneth Paltrow - who recently a Goop pop-up store in Dallas - and Blake Lively are to blame for the financial loss recently suffered by Martha's company . Martha recently courted controversy after sharing a photo of herself celebrating Thanksgiving with fashion photographer Terry Richardson. Within minutes, Ms Stewart's account was flooded with comments from her followers, many of whom were horrified to see her associating with the photographer, who is facing more than a dozen accusations that he sexually abused young models while working with them on various photoshoots. Despite the outcry, however, Martha continues to have a group of very devoted fans. 'Martha Stewart Cafe in NYC? I'm in,' wrote one person on Twitter. 'No opening date yet - but anxious to go,' said another.","Martha Stewart Living, which sells lifestyle magazines and cooking products, reported a $1.8 million loss last year ."
"A vast new hostel for cross-Channel migrants hoping to sneak into Britain is to be opened in Calais as temperatures are expected to plummet. The 'cold weather emergency centre' in a 40,000sq ft warehouse fitted with beds and hot showers will be opened when temperatures fall below -5 centigrade. It will be able to house 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 refugees currently living rough in the northern French port. Scroll down for video . A vast new hostel for cross-Channel migrants hoping to sneak into Britain is to be opened in Calais; the hostel will be opened  as a 'cold weather emergency centre' and will feature beds and showers . Migrants line up for food in the northern French port; the centre will be able to house 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 refugees currently living rough in the northern French port . The centre will become the first large-scale shelter for Calais migrants since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002. That centre was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees during its six years of operation. Calais prefect Denis Robin said the centre, two miles from the town's ferry port, would be available for use within the 'coming days'. He said: 'The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall. 'We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.' A separate day centre offering hot food and showers to only the most vulnerable women, children and elderly migrants will also be opened. The British government has argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage more to come to Calais hoping to stow away aboard lorries and ferries to Dover.

The British government has argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage more to come to Calais hoping to stow away aboard lorries and ferries to Dover . But Mr Robin insisted the shelters were 'humanitarian gestures', adding: 'Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.' Tensions have been mounting in the town in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood across Europe. Mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured during July and August. In October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12million to tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel. The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the terminal. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK's 'generous' state benefits for their influx of refugees. She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. The migrants come here to get to Britain. 'The situation here is barely manageable. The UK border should be moved from Calais to the English side of the Channel because we're not here to do their jobs.'","The hotel is 40,000sq ft and will feature beds and hot showers .

"Jose Mourinho lauded Oscar's contribution as Chelsea beat Crystal Palace on Saturday to consolidate their place at the top of the Premier League. The Brazil forward struck a sublime free-kick after six minutes to put Chelsea on their way to a seventh win from eight games this season in a feisty 2-1 London derby victory at Selhurst Park. Oscar's fine form last season and his selfless displays convinced Mourinho to play him ahead of Juan Mata, who left for Manchester United in January. Oscar has impressed for Chelsea this season, particularly against Arsenal and Crystal Palace . The 23-year-old's form tailed off as Chelsea's title challenge faltered, while it was suggested he was preserving himself for the summer's World Cup finals in Brazil. Mourinho does not regard Oscar as simply a playmaker, as the Brazilian continues to flourish. 'Oscar, in this moment, is not a number 10,' the Blues boss said. 'He had an evolution, a mental, tactical evolution that allows him to be a fantastic player. 'Can he physically improve? Of course. People forget that he is still so young.' Jose Mourinho was full of praise for the Brazilian, saying he has evolved into a fantastic player . When Cesc Fabregas, who scored Chelsea's second, was the subject of close attention against Palace, it was Oscar who dropped deep to fill the Spaniard's role. Mourinho added: 'He's not a number 10 that plays with the ball at his feet, he's a number 10 that looks back, looks to the side, analyses the game and sees where the team needs him to move to get the ball and also to create balance. 'In the first half when they had (James) McArthur playing man to man with Fabregas, I was so happy with that. 'Fabregas was taking McArthur from the central area and Oscar was dropping back to play. Julian Speroni dives in vain as Oscar puts Chelsea ahead against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park . 'And Oscar and (Nemanja) Matic controlled the game completely for us.' Palace responded with a late Fraizer Campbell goal, which proved merely a consolation, but was set up by Wilfried Zaha, who helped the Eagles to promotion in 2013 after signing for Manchester United. Zaha has had limited opportunities to impress back on loan at Selhurst Park, with Palace boss Neil Warnock determined for the winger to improve his decision making. Warnock said: 'Wilfried has been working very hard with me for the past 10 days. 'He knows what I think about him and what I am going to do with him. He's clear about that. Neil Warnock said Wilfried Zaha has been working hard to improves his discipline since rejoining the club . 'His discipline is a lot better. He's learning when to do his tricks and when not to do his tricks. 'If he gets the ball in the right area, he's as good as anybody. 'He has gone to a massive club early on in his career where you don't get a lot of coaching. I think that's what he needs. 'His attitude has been super for me.'","Oscar has impressed for Chelsea this season .

"A footballer was left with a horrific injury after his chin was ripped apart by a 'bladed' stud on an opponent's boot. Gary Fawcett, 30, was attempting to stand up after a tackle when another player 'ran over' his face. He suffered a 6cm-long gash which cut down to his jaw bone and needed 13 internal and 17 external stitches. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Gary Fawcett was left needing 13 internal and 17 external stitches after his face was ripped open by a bladed football boot during a match . The 30-year-old was playing for Garstang FC, against Eagley in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in the amateur West Lancashire Football League when the incident happened . Mr Fawcett, an agricultural fitter, said: 'The blade caught me on the chin and just sliced down. 'It wasn't too painful at the time. When you're playing football, your blood is pumping and the adrenaline is going. 'I ran into the changing room straight away though - I knew something was up. My friend drove me back to Preston so I could be closer to home. 'In the car it really started hurting. Blood was pouring out. We had a gauze from the medical kit which I was using to hold it together.' The incident happened last Saturday as Mr Fawcett captained his team, Garstang FC, against Eagley in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in the amateur West Lancashire Football League. Mr Fawcett, of Preston, Lancashire, had scored a goal and assisted another when he was struck down 40 minutes into the match. The player did not realise the seriousness of the injury at first and held the gash together with an instrument from a first aid kit, but he was later taken to hospital . Mr Fawcett (back row, third from right) says the incident wasn't malicious and he does not blame his opponent . Mr Fawcett (pictured before the injury) now faces an 18-month wait to find out if he will he scarred for life . He says he does not blame the opponent as insists the injury was accidental and not caused maliciously. After being taken off the pitch he was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital, where he needed three injections in both the top and bottom of the cut before the stitches. 'The stitches took a good two hours,' he said. 'I wanted him [the surgeon] to take his time. He's done a really good job but it was taking so long that the anaesthesia was starting to wear off. 'My girlfriend had joined me at the hospital but she couldn't watch the stitches. It was quite horrible.' Mr Fawcett now faces an 18-month wait to find out if he will be permanently scarred. His team went on to draw 3-3. Bladed studs were the brainchild of ex-Liverpool player Craig Johnston, who called then 'Traxion' soles and said they allowed players to run faster. He convinced sports firm Adidas to take up the idea, which they incorporated into their iconic 'Predator' boots, which sold by the thousands after their launch in 1994. The boots were promoted by footballers David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane and rugby player Jonny Wilkinson, making them hugely popular amongst youngsters. Alex Ferguson (left) called for the boots to be banned before they caused two injuries to Wayne Rooney (right), one of which required him to wear a headband to protect a gash in his forehead . Rooney was left with a huge gash in his leg after Fulham's Hugo Rodallega tackled him in 2013 . But Johnston later warned football boot firms that the blades were becoming 'lethal weapons' due to their development using different materials. His fears have since been proved right with a series of injuries. In 2001, Sunderland youth team goalkeeper Craig Turns needed 33 stitches after a bladed boot sliced open his face and, the following year, Burnley striker Andy Payton was forced to retired after needing 38 stitches in his leg. After then-Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane broke his foot in 2005, the team's then-manager Alex Ferguson called for blades to be banned. The most famous injury said to have been caused by the studs came in 2012, when Wayne Rooney needed 10 stitches after being caught by Fulham's Hugo Rodallega. The same player then needed stitches in his head last year after receiving a cut to the forehead in training. Bladed boots were championed by, among others, David Beckham but following a spate of injuries have since faced claims they are dangerous .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The family of a Massachusetts firefighter escaped a massive house fire early Wednesday morning. The five-member family's safety isn't thanks to the experienced fireman, though, but to his six-year-old daughter. Six-year-old Victoria Pierro was woken up just after 4.30am, police say, when a fan in her room lost power. The kindergartner smelled smoke, saw fire, then rushed to alert her parents, CBS Boston reports. 'She was outstanding,' Kevin Breen, Swampscott fire chief, told the Boston Herald about the kindergartner. 'She did everything we talk about. She kept her head. She didn’t go hide.'

Kindergartner: Six-year-old Victoria was woken up just after 4.30am  when a fan in her room lost power. The kindergartner smelled smoke, saw fire, then rushed to alert her parents . FOX reports that Victoria's mother was in the living room of their Swampscott home when the little girl came to alert her. Lori Pierro grabbed her daughter and yelled 'Fire! Fire! Fire!' before running up the stairs to wake her husband Anthony and sons Nicholas, 15, and Christian, 12. The flames quickly tore through the roof of the two-story home, but thanks to the little girl, the family managed to escape through a rear door with just seconds to spare, according to CBS. Lori: Once alerted of the fire, Lori Pierro grabbed her daughter and yelled 'Fire! Fire! Fire!' before running up the stairs to wake her husband Anthony and sons Nicholas, 15, and Christian, 12 . The family reportedly had an evacuation plan in place that helped them to escape the fire, but that would have been useless had the six-year-old not jumped to action. Anthony's fellow firefighters arrived just moments later and CBS reports that it took the responders nearly an hour to bring the flames under control. The fire destroyed the family's home, car, newly-bought Christmas presents, and other possessions. The family and fire chief credit the family's safety to little Victoria, and Lori said she doesn't know what the fate of her family would have been if her daughter didn't know what to do.

"The reason Education Minister Christopher Pyne called Clive Palmer’s senator-elect in Western Australia Zhenya ‘Dio’ Wang by the name 'Wong' has been explained after ABC journalist Leigh Sales asked Mr Wang the proper pronunciation of his name. In Australia the WA Senator is known as Wang so when Mr Pyne appeared on the ABC 7.30 Report and called him Wong Ms Sales quickly picked him up on it. But after speaking with Mr Wang she has admitted it was in fact her that was wrong. Scroll down for video . Christopher Pyne appeared on the ABC's 7:30 Report on Tuesday night after his education reforms were rejected . Clive Palmer’s senator-elect in Western Australia Zhenya ‘Dio’ Wang . Mr Wang told her his name was pronounced ‘Wong’ in spite of the Romanised spelling of his name using the 'a' vowel. ‘So Christopher Pyne was right and I was wrong,’ Ms Sales clarified. On Tuesday night, Mr Pyne explained: 'Well some people pronounce it Wang, some people pronounce it Wong; it depends where you are on the spectrum. But if you wish to pick me up on that Leigh, that's a very small thing and I'm surprised you'd bother with it.’ ‘Never the less, Dio and I are good friends and I will continue to try and get their support,' he replied to the quip. Mr Pyne appeared on the 7.30 Report after his higher educations were rejected by senators on Tuesday. Palmer United senators Dio Wang and Glenn Lazarus joined independents Jacqui Lambie and Nick Xenophon, as well as Labor and the Greens to defeat the Education Minister’s bill. ABC journalist John Barron reported on Twitter that 'Senator Wang's office says in China is would be ""Wong"" but they use ""Wang"" to avoid confusion with Senator Penny Wong.' Mr Pyne scolded Ms Sales, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers and the quality of the relationships they shared. ABC journalist Leigh Sales, pointed Mr Pyne's slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang who he insisted he had an 'excellent relationship' with him . The higher education reforms were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night with a vote of 33-31 . 'I have met with some of the crossbenchers many, many times – in fact I've met with some of them six or seven or eight times, but I'm not going to go through the day-to-day machinations of how government works, Leigh,' he said. 'You can go and study that at university if you wish to, in a bachelor of political science. The reality is that I'm working closely with the cross bench, I secured four of their votes today and I'll be back at it again tomorrow with a new reform bill.' The higher education reforms, which include a reduction in government funding and permit universities to set their own fees, were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night with a vote of 33-31. Pyne was also forced to deny 'harassing' senators in order to get them to support his higher education reforms. Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus accused the Education Minister of pestering him and others in a statement on Tuesday, saying he'd been 'inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne' despite having never given him his mobile number. Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus accused the Education Minister of pestering him . But Mr Pyne dismissed the accusations, suggesting that the 'seven or eight' messages he'd sent Senator Lazarus were entirely acceptable and telling ABC's 7.30 Report that he would be 'happy to send him more'. 'Senator Lazarus is the only crossbench senator who has refused to meet with me to discuss these reforms, so the only avenue he's left to me to be able to communicate with him, besides letters, is SMS,' Mr Pyne told Ms Sales. He then added: 'I hope you didn't mind the fact that I sent him a Christmas card today, Leigh, I'm sure he won't.' 'I would have sent him seven or eight texts and I'm happy to send him more texts.' Mr Pyne claimed that Mr Lazarus told a reporter he was happy for the Education Minister to send him 'as many texts as he wanted' after the post had been published, saying: 'I'm as confused as the next person about Senator Lazarus wanting me to send him texts or not'.","The Education Minister said it was a 'very small thing' to  call Senator Wang by the name 'Wong'

"Early evening but the sky is already ink black over New Bolsover in Derbyshire, and the thick November fog is slowly lifting. Even so, the Skinner household is incredibly easy to spot. As you drive through the streets lined with brick terraces, past the social club and allotments, it leaps out at you. Parts can even be seen from a mile away. Let’s face it, there are probably astronauts in the International Space Station who can pinpoint this address. Because this little two-bedroom, mid-terrace house doesn’t so much shout ‘Christmas!’ as scream ‘Christmas!!!’ like an over-excited elf who’s had one too many sherries. Scroll down for video . Wayne Skinner, pictured, from Bolsover, Derbyshire covered his home in Christmas lights to raise money for the local Air Ambulance service . Covering the entire front of the home are thousands of twinkling lights, while a 6ft plastic Santa stands sentry outside the front door. Dotted around him are geographically challenged penguins, glowing snowmen, and flashing stars and snowflakes. There’s even a blue-and-white reindeer — not from Lapland, but a warehouse in Wigan — whose flashing red nose was once a fire alarm. A 20ft Christmas tree bedecked in even more lights looms from the front garden, and icicles dangle from three metal arches propped against the front wall. Subtle, it ain’t. But for 26-year-old Wayne Skinner, whose labour of love this is, it’s a source of much pride and hundreds of hours of hard work. ‘To those people who’ve said it looks tacky or cheap, I say: “You try putting up something like this,” ’ he tells me. ‘The children and families who come to look at it absolutely love it. And we’re doing it for a good cause, so I don’t see what the problem is.’ The good cause this year is the local Air Ambulance Service, which will receive the money that the visitors who come to gawp at the spectacle are encouraged to donate in a box outside the house. Of course, the display — lit from 4pm to 9.30pm each evening — is not to everyone’s taste. Wayne’s father John, who is outside greeting onlookers while wearing a red elf’s hat and Christmas tree jumper, confides that some of the neighbours have been a ‘little bit bah humbug’ about the whole thing. ‘I don’t understand it because all we’re doing is giving something back to the community,’ he says. But the neighbours I speak to are more diplomatic. ‘It can be a little distracting with the lights sometimes, because they’re so bright, and what with us having little ones to put to bed,’ says Lynsey Greveson, who lives a few doors down. ‘But they’ve been doing it for as long as we’ve been here, and they’re doing it for charity.’ Another neighbour, Philip Ratcliffe, adds: ‘When they turn it on, it makes our lights flicker. But I don’t think anyone round here is going to be bothered about something for charity.’ Someone who is bothered, however, is the street’s postwoman. She refuses to walk down the Skinners’ 8ft long path for ’elf and safety reasons — fearing she may trip over a penguin’s flipper or reindeer antler. The extravagant display, with at least 20,000 bulbs,  is lit between 4pm to 9.30pm every night and adds £500 to the quarterly electricity bill . Instead, the family have had to fix an American-style postbox on their front wall for her to use. But for the endless stream of people who pull up in their cars to take photos or just gawp, the display brings some welcome winter cheer and ‘a little bit of Blackpool’ to the area. In fact, some of the lights — including the large Santa, teddy and mouse — have come from the Blackpool Illuminations. They were bought by Wayne for £100 each when the Golden Mile had a sale in 2008. One onlooker says wistfully: ‘I’d love my house to look like this.’ Another adds: ‘I want one of those flashing reindeers.’ Wayne says his lightbulb moment came in 2002 after he put up a few Christmas lights at the front of his family’s house and they started attracting attention. Each year he has added more and more lights — and the display is now so big it even has its own switching on ceremony a month before Christmas, complete with shire horses pulling a sleigh containing his mum Susan dressed as Mrs Santa. Wayne — a trainee electrician who works full-time at a local DIY store — starts putting his light show together in October. He spends several hours a day on it for seven weeks until it’s complete. He has no idea how many bulbs he uses, but ‘there must be at least 20,000’. The most expensive piece, costing more than £200, is his all new, all sparkly matrix board with 322 lights. ‘They’re like the ones you see on The X Factor,’ he enthuses proudly. ‘You can programme them to make lots of different pictures, such as sleighs and Space Invaders.’ The white star at the top of the house was sold off by the council because it was damaged and couldn’t be used on a public street. Other pieces have been donated or picked up from auctions, end-of-year sales and the internet. The Christmas theme carries on inside the house, and will remain in place until January 5 - and will take to mid February to fully dismantle . Though Wayne is on the minimum wage, he has spent hundreds of pounds — perhaps even thousands — on making his display as magical as possible for passers by. What’s less magical is the electricity bill, which is footed by his dad. ‘It costs him £500 for the quarter — but that’s for everything in the house, too, including the heating,’ says Wayne. ‘It was worse before we went on to LED lights, which are more energy efficient. We’d eat up a lot of energy then, even though we didn’t use the kettle, cooker or shower while the lights were on in case we blew a fuse.’ Last year, a kindly electrician installed a new fuse box for free so the charity display wouldn’t have such a big impact on the household’s day-to-day living. But it hasn’t quite solved the problem. ‘There’s only one main cable that comes into the house, so we still don’t use the cooker while the lights are on — it could be a bit dicey,’ says Wayne. ‘We boil the kettle and use a Thermos flask so we can have cups of tea throughout the evening.’ Amazingly, the festive overload continues inside. A wall-mounted plastic fish sings Paul McCartney’s Wonderful Christmastime at full blast to anyone who steps through the front door. After squeezing through the narrowest of hallways, you arrive in a living room festooned with decorations. There’s also a split-screen monitor showing CCTV footage from a camera hidden behind the ear of the snowman outside. An onlooker quips: ‘You have to around here — if you left your shoes on the floor, someone would nick ’em.’ In the front room, Wayne has set up an 8ft long Victorian village snow scene, complete with moving figures dancing away to Greensleeves. ‘I wanted something just for me that wasn’t anything to do with the lights outside,’ he says. Hanging from the ceilings are hundreds of baubles. ‘We kept some of them up all year because we never got round to taking them down,’ says Wayne. The house might not be appearing in House Beautiful magazine any time soon but, as Wayne proudly shows me the spaghetti of circuitry and wiring needed to make the entire operation run like clockwork, there’s no denying the level of skill involved. And it’s not only the vibrant visual display that he has to think about. Every year he arranges a jingly soundtrack to co-ordinate with the lights. This year, Frozen’s Let It Go seems to be the people pleaser. ‘The music is on very low — so we don’t have to have the speakers at a million decibels, we have a low-range transmitter set at 93FM so people parked outside can listen to it on their car radios.’ Wayne, a self-confessed electronics geek, starts telling me about transformers, trip switches and breakers. It all sounds awfully technical. But he’s also super-safety-conscious. ‘As it’s a fire hazard, we never turn on the lights without someone being in the house,’ he says. ‘And I keep all the wiring cool with a fan so it doesn’t overheat. I know what I’m doing.’ So far, his displays have raised £2,000 for charities — including the Motor Neurone Disease Association and SANDS stillbirth charity, after a family friend lost her baby. This year’s display will remain until Twelfth Night (January 5), when Wayne will start the laborious task of taking it all down. He should finish in the middle of February, depending on the weather. Then every single light and fitting is crammed inside the tiny house — meaning the Skinners have to squeeze past a 6ft Santa on the landing even in the middle of July. But by then, Wayne’s already planning the next extravaganza.","Wayne Skinner has spent thousands building up his Christmas themed display since buying his first lights in 2002 .

In a second image, he is pictured with a missing tooth and other facial injuries. Scroll down for video . The actor, who died earlier this year at the age of 93, is shown in one picture having a large wound on his head treated by medics . In a second image taken in January 2012, Mickey Rooney is pictured with a missing tooth and other facial injuries . The shocking photos were revealed for the first time amid claims the star may have suffered abuse in the years before he died in April this year . The shocking photos were revealed for the first time amid claims the star may have suffered abuse in the years before he died in April this year. The National Enquirer reports that Rooney, of Westlake, California, was treated for the cut to his head in December 2011. A month later, in January 2012 - two years before his death - he was pictured with a missing tooth and apparent facial contusions. According to the National Enquirer, some members of the star's family are preparing to hand a file over to law enforcement chiefs which they believe may explain his death. In the Enquirer's article, Rooney's eighth wife Jan Chamberlin vehemently denies any suggestion that she may have abused the star. During his career Rooney made 361 films. But his estate was reported to have been worth just $18,000 when he died . She is quoted in a statement as saying: 'I deny each and every allegation that I mistreated Mickey. We were married for almost 40 years and I would never harm him.' During his 80-year movie career Rooney made 361 films. But his estate was reported to have been worth just $18,000 when he died. The actor rests next to Hollywood legends including Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, Jayne Mansfield, and Charlie Chaplin, in Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The Enquirer reports that the two sides of Rooney's family held separate funerals on April 19. At the time of his death, the actor had been living with his stepson Mark and Mark's wife Charlene. Mickey Rooney (left) is pictured in 2006 with his eighth wife Jan (centre) and stepson Christopher (right) In September 2011, it was reported that Rooney had filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court that accused his stepson Christopher Aber and Mr Aber's wife Christina and others of charges including elder abuse and fraud over the previous decade. A court judgment was later reached which appeared to have brought the three-year legal row to a conclusion and in which, according to the Hollywood Reporter, the abuse allegations were dropped. The judgment said that Rooney's conservator and Aber 'have agreed to resolve all the matters of controversy between them and have consented to the terms of this judgment'. Aber was asked to pay $2.865m, it has been reported - but the ruling was not enforced. The Hollywood Reporter said that Christopher Aber and his wife admitted no wrongdoing in the court documents.","Images show actor Mickey Rooney having treatment for a gash to his head .

"Police are solving less than a third of all crimes reported, with conviction rates varying depending on where people live. Figures released by the Ministry of Justice reveal that criminals are more likely to escape prosecution in London, where fewer than a quarter are caught. On public transport conviction rates are even worse, with just 13 per cent of all crimes solved by British Transport Police. New figures released by the Ministry of Justice show that police are solving fewer than one in three crimes . Despite overall crime falling since 2004, conviction rates have remained at just 30 per cent, the Daily Mirror reported. In total, there were 3.5 million crimes committed in England and Wales during 2013/14, but only a million ended in a criminal being convicted. Around 704,000 crimes were reported in London over the past year, but the Metropolitan Police managed to solve 169,000 of these cases - 24 per cent. In Wales the situation is more positive. In the last 12 months the force convicted 10,800 criminals for 18,600 - a success rate of 58 per cent. Police forces in Northumbria, Cumbria, Norfolk and Hertfordshire all have success rates of more than 40 per cent and appear in the top five in a list of conviction rates. The Metropolitan Police, appears in the lowest five forces for conviction rates. Warwickshire, West Midlands and Bedfordshire also appear in this group with low conviction rates - less than the average 29 per cent for England and Wales. British Transport Police, which covers crimes on railways and roads is at the bottom of the conviction rate league table - with a success rate of just 13 per cent. The figures include crimes where an offender has accepted a caution, or where a crime has been 'taken into consideration' as part of other proceedings. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the force had 'introduced measures to bring more offenders to justice as part of our total war on crime.' However, despite the low conviction rates, it is feared that the prison population could swell by 15 per cent by 2020 to almost 100,000 - leaving jails struggling to cope with a surge in violent and sexual offenders. The Ministry of Justice predicted the number of prisoners in England and Wales will rise every year until the end of the decade. It means thousands more prison places will be needed, because the current capacity is only 88,015. Sex offenders are also being jailed for longer, with average sentences increasing by 2.4 months to almost six years when compared to 2013.","Police in England and Wales are solving less than a third of all crimes .

"The battle to get the Budget through has taken on school-yard proportions, with Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus telling Education Minister Christopher Pyne to 'stop harassing me'. Senator Lazarus, who is the Leader of the Senate for PUP, claims Mr Pyne is virtually begging him to support the higher education reforms and has urged him to stop his 'desperation'. 'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me and other cross benchers,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus. War of words. 'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus of the Palmer United Party . 'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number,' said Senator Lazarus as the battle to get Budget measures through the Senate before the last sitting day becomes more desperate . 'I am being inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne virtually begging me to support the Abbott Government’s higher education reforms. 'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number.' The Senator claims that Christopher Pyne’s office and other Abbott Government ministers have been in constant contact with his office and those of other cross-benchers 'offering all sorts of deals and incentives to get our support for the higher education reforms'. But Senator Lazarus insists that 'I won’t be bought and I am not prepared to horse trade'. 'It is clear that the Abbott Government is so desperate they will stoop to any level to win support. 'The majority of Australians do not want increased education costs. 'The higher education reforms are nothing more than a sinister Abbott Government budget cutting measure. Education Minister Christopher Pyne insists that 'let’s be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms' Senator Glenn Lazarus says he doubts that Christopher Pyne, pictured here talking with the Prime Minister, will retain the education portfolio in the new year . 'The Abbott Government’s higher education reforms are bad to the core and will only significantly reduce funding to universities which in turn will significantly increase the cost of higher education in Australia.' Senator Lazarus went on to doubt whether Christopher Pyne will retain the education portfolio in the next year and insisted that 'Palmer United will be voting down the higher education reforms'. Any vote held this week on education reforms seem likely to fail. With Labor and the Greens opposing the changes, the government would need support from 6 of the 8 cross-bench senators. Mr Pyne will only say that he's still negotiating with them. He stated that: 'In the final week of Parliament for 2014 the Government is urging the Senate to pass the vital higher education reforms to secure the future of our universities and spread opportunity to more Australians.' 'Without these changes our universities will be condemned to a slow decline – losing their competitive edge in our region and internationally. 'Let’s be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms.' Independent senator John Madigan and Family First's Bob Day won concessions on student debt interest rates from the minister on Monday. Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm could likely support the changes but even he is critical of the government's negotiating process. 'They're hopeless at convincing me to vote for their legislation,' he said. Victorian Andrew Broad expects Mr Pyne to stump up some kind of support package for regional universities. That could sway a few votes. Independent senator Nick Xenophon is still sceptical about what he believes to be a 'radical shift'. If it goes to a vote this week, he's expected to say no. The third independent, Jacqui Lambie, has been steadfast in her opposition.","Glenn Lazarus says the Education Minister should 'stop harassing me'

"Everyone loves a brand new pair of jeans but wearing them in can be a pain - literally. Now a Welsh denim brand has come up with an innovative solution. 'Artisanal' denim brand Hiut, which is based in Cardigan in west Wales, employs 50 'denim breakers' who wear each pair of jeans for six months before they are sold. The first batch of pre-worn jeans, all of which have been thoroughly washed, are to be auctioned off today but more will follow should the venture prove a success. Scroll down for video . Denim breakers: Five of the 50 'denim breakers' employed at the Hiut factory in Cardigan . Hiut, which specialises in raw and selvage denim, says the wearing-in process will give the jeans a fashionably vintage look as well as making them soft and comfortable. The environmentally-friendly distressing method is the brainchild of David Hieatt, who, with his wife Clare, founded the company in 2011. 'The idea is that they [the breakers] wear them in for us and then we sell them on,' explained Mr Hieatt, in an interview with the Guardian newspaper. 'We’ve just about got them all back. We’re washing them – well, a guy who has been washing jeans for 30 years is – and we’ll auction them off. 'The idea is that you break the denim in for the customer. It’s an experiment but so far, so good.' Looking good: The six-month wearing-in process results in soft, fashionably distressed denim . Eco-friendly: Hiut's denim is all raw which means it isn't washed during the manufacturing process . Fashionable: Distressed denim is currently in vogue but making it can be disastrous for the environment . Hiut is one of a growing number of companies specialising in 'raw' denim which, unlike the regular version, is not washed during the manufacturing process. This reduces the amount of potentially poisonous dye running off into local rivers - something that has proved an environmental disaster in India and Bangladesh where the majority of high street jeans are made. Making the problem worse is the vogue for fashionably 'distressed' denim which is usually created via a combination of chemicals and machinery. Mr Hieatt's method, as well as providing jobs for 50 locals, dispenses with all that. 'Good raw jeans, when you get them, are like wearing cardboard,' says denim breaker Cameron Stewart, 24. 'Luckily, they wash them first [before they are sold]. If you wear something every day, it will smell. By wearing them I’m adding value to them.' Eco-friendly distressed denim does, however, come at a price. Basic men's jeans start at £130 for a plain organic cotton pair, while those made from tough selvage cost £230. Women's jeans, which are currently only available in skinny fit, cost £124.99. Despite the expense, Mr Hieatt, whose factory replaced the old Dewhurst denim workshop which used to be one of the main employers in Cardigan, says that his method of making jeans is much better for everyone. 'In the old factory, they used to wash denim in the river,' he explains. 'The waters ran blue which, of course, wasn’t good, for the wild salmon and seals especially. '80 per cent of the environmental impact of jeans come from washing and ironing. It’s shocking.'","Hiut is a Welsh denim brand based in Cardigan in west Wales .

"Something very strange is happening in our skies. From Aberdeen to Devon, Llandudno all the way to Norwich, thousands of people reported hearing a series of loud bangs in the sky around 10.30pm on Saturday. Many have described the mysterious noises as sounding like explosions or rumbles of thunder. Others thought they were similar to sonic booms — the sound a supersonic aircraft makes when it passes through the sound barrier. Some said the bangs sounded more like a series of loud, crackling pops and so suspected fireworks. However, when they looked outside, none were to be seen. Scroll down for video . Armageddon comes: Britain was shocked by a loud rumbling on Saturday night - is the end, perhaps, nigh? As soon as the noises had ended, social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook, were buzzing with chatter about what the bangs could have been. No one, it appeared, had a clue. But what made matters even more puzzling was that it emerged that a loud bang had been heard in Buffalo, New York — thousands of miles from Britain — around the same time. So, what on earth could it have been? There’s no doubt that as soon as an event like this occurs, it becomes hard to separate fact from fiction. Though social media is brilliant at spreading information quickly, it’s as fast at circulating incorrect stories. Many attention-seekers falsely reported they had heard noises. Others innocently reported similar noises they heard at the same time for which there will be perfectly ordinary explanations — such as military training or, indeed, fireworks. Fireworks were in Croydon (pictured) - but they were hardly loud enough to be heard nationwide . The most persuasive of these reports was the sound recording made by Claudia Angiletta, from Croydon, South London, who said she could not see any fireworks and was therefore baffled by the noises. However, it emerged there was a large and very loud fireworks display for a wedding party on Saturday night at the Walcountians Sports Club, which is just four miles from the centre of Croydon. Saturday was a still night and the sound would have easily carried for miles. But as fireworks in London are most certainly not loud enough to be heard in Aberdeen, Catherine wheels can’t possibly account for the nationwide reports of this seemingly other-worldly phenomenon. Some of the explanations are positively outlandish, but we must consider them all for, as Sherlock Holmes famously observed: ‘When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’ The most bizarre accounts have been propagated by those who suspect the world is coming to an end. According to a blog called The End Time, which seeks to chronicle ‘the end of days’, the noises may signal our doom. ‘I believe the booms are manifestations of spiritual warfare we happen to hear on this side of the veil or the preparations God is making for imminent tribulation judgments,’ says the blog. You don’t need to be the atheist Richard Dawkins to dismiss such an explanation, but the idea that the noises are a manifestation of divine displeasure is widely accepted by many. Thousands melodramatically used the Twitter hashtag — which signals a much- discussed topic — #OMG WeAreAllGoingToDie when they reported the bangs, though often in jest. Other wild explanations involve aliens, as so many conspiracy theories do. A lack of corroborating visual evidence — such as spaceships or little green men — makes this harder to press home. Theories: There was no shortage of ideas when it came to the possible source of the noises . Then there is The Hum theory. This is a widely reported low frequency noise that is said to occur in parts of Britain and North America. There have been different reports of the noise for at least 40 years. For example, in 2011 in the village of Woodland in Co. Durham, residents claimed to be hearing it for days. Often, there are rational explanations for The Hum, such as nearby factories or people suffering from tinnitus, but some occurrences remain genuinely mysterious. However, what was heard on Saturday night was not a humming, but more of a series of explosions. One of the more believable explanations is that the noises were caused by an ultra top secret American aeroplane that uses a ‘pulse detonation engine’ to power it to five times the speed of sound. According to Dr Bhupendra Khandelwal, a scientist at Sheffield University working on the technology behind these engines, the strange sounds could have been made by such a plane. ‘When we run a test engine it’s a real industrial noise you can hear it for miles,’ he says. No aircraft have used such engines to travel at supersonic speeds, though a persistent conspiracy theory maintains that the Americans have a plane called Aurora powered by pulse detonation. As such theories go, Aurora is the oldest of chestnuts — it has been around for at least a quarter of a century. A widespread version is that the Americans have secretly developed a hypersonic spy plane to replace the defunct Blackbird spy plane, and that it flies around the world on clandestine missions. Of course, this conveniently ignores the fact that with increasingly sophisticated satellites, there is little or no need for the Americans to develop fearsomely fast — and expensive — manned aircraft. It seems more plausible that Aurora was simply the name given to the project that developed America’s range of stealth aircraft, such as the B-2 bomber. And even if there was such an aircraft, it is highly unlikely it would have been heard the length and breadth of Britain on Saturday night. Could it be? An artist's image of the so-called Aurora project. Enthusiasts say one possible power source is a 'pulse detonation engine', whose sound is said to resemble that caught on an audio clip on Saturday . Theory: Aurora is rumoured to be a top secret aircraft in development since 1989. Last year Lockheed Martin announced it was developing a similar SR-72 spy plane (illustrated) said to be able to accelerate up to Mach 6 . After all, there seems little point in developing an aeroplane quite so absurdly noisy. Some suggested weather conditions, such as thunder, might be the source, but the Met Office dismissed this. Another suggestion made by people pointing out that Britain has a severe terror warning in place is that the bizarre bangs were controlled explosions carried out by the police. But this is highly unlikely. So, if is not secret planes, fireworks, God, the police or aliens, then what is the only possible explanation left? The most plausible answer is simple and, surprisingly, has barely been considered. The noises heard are likely to have been caused by a massive meteor entering the atmosphere above Britain. Though we think of meteors as visual phenomenon, they do, in fact, make a noise — and the larger the meteor, the bigger the sound. Compare the reports over the weekend to the eyewitness testimonies given in the East Riding of Yorkshire in December 1795 when a 56lb meteorite hit the ground near the village of Wold Newton. A PDE engine works by using force from a series of explosions, caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake, to thrust itself forward. Its contrails appear to look like 'rings on a rope' (pictured), or a spine . ‘I heard noises in the air like the report of cannon at a distance,’ said Mr L. Wilson. An 11-year-old boy called Charles Prestin also heard the sound, which he described as being like ‘the noise as of firing of cannon, heard at the above time a hissing in the air’. Many local inhabitants thought the repeated noises were ‘guns at sea’. Witnesses of other meteorite falls over the centuries have recorded hearing similar sounds. ‘A noise like thunder or the rolling of drums broke overhead, followed by a whizzing noise or the sound of escaping steam,’ said one. All these reports from over the years sound extremely similar to those recounted over the weekend. Dr Caroline Smith, the curator of meteorites at London’s Natural History Museum, agrees that the sound may have been made by a fireball — a meteor burning up as it hits the atmosphere. One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere, which would result in a sonic boom - a claim backed by expert Dr Caroline Smith . ‘From what I’ve seen, it could be the noise effects from a fireball,’ she says. ‘You certainly get a series of explosions and it is possible this occurred over Britain on Saturday.’ What this does not explain is how the noise could be heard in the U.S. The most rational explanation is that what was heard in upstate New York was something else — perhaps the sonic boom from an aircraft — and its timing was coincidental. If the noises were made by a meteor and it landed in the UK, then somewhere there is going to be a very big crater. However, it is more likely that whatever made the noise landed with a big splash and its secrets are at the bottom of the sea. For those who don’t believe it was a meteor — and it does seem strange no airline pilots have reported any bright lights as they flew above the cloud cover — there can only be one explanation left. It was Father Christmas on a practice run.","Noises were heard from Llandudno to Croydon, from Devon to Norwich .

"An Iraqi refugee who made ‘dubious’ claims about having cancer, falling and injuring himself, and his father dying so he could continue to receive disability welfare while overseas finally came unstuck when the Department of Social Services refused to believe he’d received death threats from Iraqi insurgents. Ali Mahmood, who has a degree in chemical engineering but has never worked in Australia, first legitimately claimed Disability Support Pension - which can be $800 a month - for his spinal scoliosis in 2003 when he arrived in the country on a humanitarian visa. However, over the past decade Mr Mahmood left Australia to visit Iraq on four separate occasions –remaining outside of Australia for longer than the 13-weeks allowed in order to still receive DSP. Each time he sought extensions to his ‘portability period’ with excuses such as his father had died (it later turned out to be his divorced wife’s father) and that he had cancer, which there is no medical record of. Ali Mahmood's appeal to keep his disability welfare has been rejected after a tribunal concluded he did not have any evidence to prove his life was threatened in Iraq that stopped him from returning to Australia . It wasn’t until his final trip to Iraq, on 30 November 2012, that the 54-year-old came unstuck for his absences when the Sunni Muslim claimed his life was in danger from Shia Muslims in his home country. Mr Mahmood did not notify Centrelink that he was going overseas this time and after email correspondence - where he asked to be allowed to still claim - Centrelink refused the request and decided that the DSP should be cancelled from 1 March 2013. His Family Tax Benefit (FTB) instalments were also cancelled as of 22 March 2013 after he failed to provide an estimate of his income. After the Social Security Appeals Tribunal agreed to stop his payments on the recommendation of Centrelink, a determined Mr Mahmood took his case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Residence in Australia is a pre-condition for receipt of a DSP. If recipients go overseas they are required to notify Centrelink in advance. There is a 13-week portability period - the period you can still claim while overseas - for DSP. He arrived back in Australia on 1 March 2014 and claimed he was unable to leave Baghdad before because of death and kidnapping threats made by insurgents. Senior Tribunal Member D Letcher QC said in an Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in Adelaide on October 24, that he ‘did not accept the applicant’s account for a number of reasons’. The reasons included the fact Mr Mahmood made no contact with the Australian embassy in Baghdad ‘and resisted all efforts to have him contact it. I infer that this was because he knew that any embassy enquiry would show he was not under any threat’. The judgement went on: ‘The applicant has a history of overstaying his absences and seeking extensions of the portability period for dubious reasons and, having regard to all the evidence before me, I consider that this is what occurred on this occasion.’ Mr Letcher said there was ‘no independent corroboration’ and that ‘the applicant was a very unsatisfactory witness, being evasive, contradictory and inconsistent in his demeanour and responses to questions’. Mr Mahmood refused to attend the hearing in person for cross-examination. ‘I do not accept that he received any threat to his life or well-being in Baghdad,’ Mr Letcher concluded. In the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the full list of outrageous claims Mr Mahmood made to the Department of Social Services over ten years to try and keep his welfare payments while overseas were also revealed. In 2007, he claimed he left Australia because his dad was very ill and died two days after he arrived. ‘At the hearing, the applicant (having given evidence that his father was alive in 2012) said that the deceased in 2007 was his wife’s father. I note that the applicant and his wife separated in 2006, were divorced on 23 January 2007, and the applicant professed to know nothing of his wife’s whereabouts or activities “for the last 8 years”,’ Mr Letcher said. During the 2008 trip, he claimed that he had fallen and hurt himself, and was granted another extension. On 23 February 2010, he advised that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was receiving chemotherapy. Extensions to his portability period were granted until April, and then June and, finally, August 2010. His further application for an extension on 30 August 2010 was refused because he did not provide any current treatment information. He appealed that decision to the SSAT but was unsuccessful. ‘In evidence to this Tribunal, the applicant said that his abdominal cancer had been diagnosed on biopsy in Damascus and chemotherapy commenced. ‘Later, he consulted doctors in Jordan and was told that it had all been a mistake and he had no cancer. He did not bring back to Australia any hospital or medical reports, x-rays or pathology results,’ Mr Letcher revealed.","Ali Mahmood arrived in Australia in 2003 and started receiving Disability Support Pension for his spinal scoliosis .

"Leonardo da Vinci's mother may have been a Chinese slave according to new research by an Italian historian and novelist. Angelo Paratico has spent the last 20 years living and working in Hong Kong, researching the links between his homeland and China over the past half a millenium. Mr Paratico said documentation he has uncovered during two years of research forms the basis of his latest book Leonardo Da Vinci: A Chinese scholar lost in Renaissance Italy. Angelo Paratico claims Da Vinci used his mother as inspiration for Mona Lisa, pictured, and looks Chinese . The book, which is due to be published next year, uncovers evidence, Mr Paratico claims, that links Da Vinci and the Far East. Speaking to the South China Morning Post, Mr Paratico said: 'I am sure up to a point that Leonardo's mother was from the Orient, but to make her an oriental Chinese, we need to use a deductive method.' 'One wealthy client of Leonardo's father had a slave called Caterina. After 1452, Leonardo's date of birth, she disappeared from the documents. She was no longer working there.' Da Vinci's father was legal notary and it is believed his mother was called Caterina, who according to some reports, was a local peasant. But Mr Paratico's new work claims it is most likely Da Vinci's mother was a slave. Supporting his theory, Mr Paratico said: 'During the Renaissance, countries like Italy and Spain were full of oriental slaves.' He claimed that there were certain aspects of Da Vinci's life and work suggest an oriental link. He added: 'For instance, the fact he was writing with his left hand from left to right... and he was also a vegetarian which was not common. Mona Lisa is probably a portrait of his mother, as Sigmund Freud said in 1910. On the back of Mona Lisa, there is a Chinese landscape and even her face looks Chinese.' A new work by historian and novelist Angelo Paratico claims that the mother of Leonardo da Vinci, pictured, may have been a Chinese slave . Mr Paratico said he believes the only way to solve the mystery is to exhume  some of Da Vinci's relations in Florence and extract some DNA. Mr Paratico has written several novels including Ben, which involves a young James Bond being sent off to kill Benito Mussolini to recover compromising letters sent between the dictator and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His latest book is an English translation of a Latin work on Emperor Nero written in the 15th Century. Another book on da Vinci suggests that the artist, who painted the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, was also a weatherman. Geologist and Renaissance art expert Ann Pizzorusso claims the artist, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist and writer was also the first to see the swirling patterns of water and air at the heart of a hurricane. She came to this conclusion after seeing drawings of biblical floods by Leonardo in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle and outlines them in her book Tweeting da Vinci.

"A brave little boy born with his intestines on the outside of his body has  celebrated his fourth birthday by swimming in the pool for the very first time. Jaylen Cornish, from Victoria, was born with gastroschisis, a condition which means his intestine formed outside his bowel, meaning he is unable to eat or drink. The little blue-eyed fighter spent the first two years of his life in hospital, and so for his mum Katie, this moment was a big step for both of them. Scroll down for video . Clad in a $600 'dry' wetsuit specially designed for him, Jaylen had his first taste of the pool when he fearlessly plunged into the water with the aid of his mum . 'The surgeon said to me look it's a lot worse than what we thought it was,' Ms Cornish said. 'They said we're not sure whether he's going to survive the operation.' The condition affects one in 4,000 children, and was picked up very early on in Ms Cornish when she had her 14 week scan, reported The Herald Sun. Jaylen was taken from her soon after he was born and underwent ten operations to remove dead part of his intestines and insert feeding tubes. His body needs to be kept dry so that there is no risk of infection, a mammoth task which Ms Cornish tackles alone as a single single parent . 'He has got an opportunity in life to do things he has never been able to do before. Swimming is a big thing,' Ms Cornish said . In total, Jaylen has had 22 operations and has only spent six months of his life away from hospital. 'We’ve nearly lost him, but he's come out battling, he’s the strongest boy I’ve ever known,' said Ms Cornish.

"Council leaders across England are demanding more control as constitutional turmoil over the proposed new terms for Scotland deepens. The leaders of 119 councils warned that voters in England will not accept greater devolution to Scotland unless there is a similar redistribution of power south of the border. The councils – including 65 controlled by Labour, 40 by the Conservatives and ten by the Liberal Democrats – want powers over tax and spending similar to those being given to Holyrood in the aftermath of Scotland’s No vote in September’s independence referendum. The leaders of 119 councils warned that voters in England will not accept greater devolution to the Scottish Parliament (pictured) unless there is a similar redistribution of power south of the border . Among those who have issued the warning are the leaders of several big councils in the traditional Tory heartlands, including Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Oxfordshire county council, which covers David Cameron’s constituency of Witney. There is also a growing clamour for ‘English votes for English laws’, ensuring legislation that no longer affects Scotland cannot be forced on to the rest of the UK by the votes of Scottish MPs. Yesterday, Labour’s Ed Balls criticised proposals being drawn up by the Coalition, expected to be unveiled before Christmas, to ensure the influence of the predominantly Labour MPs in Scotland is reined in. Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the Shadow Chancellor said the Prime Minister was ‘trying to play party politics with our constitution and the future of our country’. Yesterday, Labour’s Ed Balls criticised proposals being drawn up by the Coalition to ensure the influence of the predominantly Labour MPs in Scotland is reined in. He insisted: ‘The Government’s own McKay Commission said there is an issue of fairness around voting – we need to find a way to solve that... but if you start having different classes of MPs, you will destroy the Union and undermine prosperity in every part of our country. I’m not going to be part of that.’ But former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said: ‘If Labour agree that the Scots Parliament shall fix income tax rates in Scotland it must also accept that Scots MPs in Westminster can no longer vote on income taxation levels for the rest of the United Kingdom. ‘A commitment to devolve income tax levels to Holyrood without simultaneously addressing the perversities of the West Lothian question is frankly outrageous. ‘There is a tipping point when the voters in England will say this far and no further. Labour seem to be blind to this.’ Instead of a system of English votes, which would permanently hobble its powerbase at Westminster, Labour is trying to focus on devolution of power to the regions. It has proposed scrapping the House of Lords and replacing it with an elected second chamber of senators representing different parts of the country. Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said devolution within England is now inevitable: ‘Devolution isn’t just for Scotland. If we want to get the economy moving in all parts of the country, we need to give local communities more power to shape their own future.’ The council leaders, in a letter to the Observer newspaper, called on Chancellor George Osborne to use his autumn statement on Wednesday to set out a ‘new settlement for England’ which devolves power from Westminster and shares out tax and spending across the UK ‘on a fair basis’. They wrote: ‘Earlier this week, the Smith commission [on Scottish devolution] set out a better deal for Scotland, granting more control over funding and recognising the importance of devolving power down beyond Holyrood. It’s England’s turn now. ‘The people we represent, who look north of the border with envy at the greater control Scots are to get... will expect nothing less.’ The leaders also claimed local government could not afford any more austerity cuts. ‘Funding for services provided by councils has borne the brunt of austerity, while demand continues to rise,’ they wrote. ‘Further reductions without radical reform will have a detrimental impact on people’s quality of life.’ However, local government minister Kris Hopkins warned: ‘Local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending and must play its part in paying off the deficit left by the last administration. ‘Since 2010, this Government has delivered a fair settlement to every part of the country while giving them greater financial independence so they can increase revenue and protect frontline services.’","Council leaders want same powers as those promised to Holyrood .
Several big councils in the traditional Tory heartlands are among them .

"Peering intently down the barrels of his 12-bore shotgun, Prince Edward steadies himself and takes aim… then, astonishingly, appears to shoot over the head of his young son. By any standards it is a startling image and evidence, it would seem, that Edward has broken one of the cardinal rules of gun safety. Instead of shooting with his son behind him, which good practice dictates, six-year-old James, Viscount Severn – wearing ear defenders – appears to be 10ft in front, and only a few feet to his father’s side. Prince Edward, right, takes aim while his  son, James, Viscount Severn, left, stands some 10 feet in front and a few feet to his father's side . Six-year-old James, holds onto his black Labrador while his father Prince Edward, right, looks at the dog at the Queen's Sandringham Estate . Former Minister Norman Baker, who was responsible for gun laws during his time at the Home Office, said last night: ‘There are some basic principles that should be observed for safety reasons and they appear not to have been followed. I personally think it is not appropriate to have children that young at shoots anyway.’ Mike Yardley, a leading shooting instructor, said: ‘You should never have children in front of you because the problem with children is they run around. It’s not something I would allow. ‘Sometimes you have a dog forward of the shooter, but not people. They are always behind. But it’s very difficult for me to judge it without seeing the situation. ‘It’s bad practice to have people closely forward of the shooter’s line. But the individual shooter must always have the final decision as to what he considers to be safe.’ The incident happened while Edward, the Earl of Wessex, was aiming at a pheasant during a shoot on the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk yesterday morning. A witness said he swung his gun from left to right as the bird rose from a maize field. A countryside manager, who organises pheasant shoots in the south of England, insisted that bystanders, especially children or dogs, should always stand ‘ten to 15 metres behind the shooter, never in front’. He added: ‘The same applies if the children and dogs are used as pickers-up. They must stand behind until the shooter has shot. And most shoots I’ve come across do not even allow young children.’ Buckingham Palace insisted last night that the ‘perspective [of the pictures] is very misleading. At no time during the shoot was Viscount Severn directly in front of the Earl of Wessex. ‘As always during any sporting event on the estate, the highest safety standards were adhered to. Any suggestion that the Earl would risk his son’s welfare in any way is simply untrue.’ Prince Edward, right, stands alert looking for a target to his right, while his son James stands to his left and slightly ahead of his position . Buckingham Palace described the perspective of the photographs as 'very misleading' claiming at no time was Viscount Severn, right, 'directly in front of the Earl of Wessex' centre. 'Any suggestion the Earl would risk his son's welfare in any way is simply untrue,' claimed the Palace . Despite the criticism, Edward, 50, was supported in some quarters. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation described him as an experienced shot and said he was ‘taking every precaution’. A spokesman said: ‘The child is wearing ear defenders. Everyone who shoots puts safety first. Prince Edward would not have taken an unsafe shot. I believe the camera foreshortened the distance between the two. The child is not in front of the barrels.’ However, the association’s own website clearly states: ‘Always be aware of the direction in which the muzzle of your shotgun is pointing and never point it in an unsafe direction.’ Dressed in a camouflage jacket and matching hat, young James kept control of their black labrador during the shoot. At one stage he seemed to pull the dog back when it appeared to try to jump up at his father. Edward was also joined by his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and his 11-year-old daughter, Lady Louise Windsor. All are believed to be staying with friends at Wood Farm on the 20,000-acre estate. An onlooker said: ‘James is not old enough to shoot himself, but it seems like he was having great fun.’ Six years ago Edward was seen reacting violently when two black labradors appeared to grab a dead pheasant during a shoot on the Queen’s estate. Photographs showed him rushing at the animals with his shotgun tucked under his arm and a 4ft stick raised in the air. He could then be seen bringing it down several times towards them, but it was not clear whether the prince actually hit either of the dogs. The RSPCA investigated the incident, but announced there would be no prosecution as there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to support the allegation that he mistreated the animals. The golden rule of shooting is captured in a poem called A Father’s Advice, in which shooting enthusiast Mark Hanbury Beaufoy writes: ‘If a sportsman true you’d be/Listen carefully to me/Never, never, let your gun/Pointed be at anyone.’","Prince Edward raised his 12-bore shotgun to his shoulder during the shoot on the Queen's Sandringham Estate .

"It is said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at their bookshelf and music collection. And now experts have found that certain songs can even affect how generous a person is likely to be. Japanese scientists discovered that listening to a pleasing song makes individuals more generous, but they become less altruistic if they are played a tune they dislike. Japanese scientists have found that listening to a pleasing song makes individuals more generous, but they become less altruistic if they are played a tune they dislike. This graph shows changes between the allocation of money before and after listening to pleasing music, disliked music and silence . It has previously been proven that music has the ability to strongly affect a person’s emotions and sometimes even control them, with recent studies showing that emotion evoked by listening to a song can affect activity in the limbic and paralimbic brain structures. Researchers from the Nara University of Education, Japan, conducted an experiment to examine whether music has the power to promote altruistic behaviour. They asked 11 male and female students, with an average age of 21 years, to complete a questionnaire in which they described their musical tastes and emotional experiences through music. Individuals then listened to ‘chill inducing’ music that they liked, as well as a track they said they disliked. Both of these tracks were followed by silence, according to the study published in Frontiers in Psychology. The researchers concluded: ‘Preferred music promotes altruistic behaviour, whereas disliked music is associated with selfish behaviour'. So, listening to Justin Bieber (pictured) could make his fans more generous, but people who aren't fans may become more selfish . They were given money and were asked to share it with people who were represented as stylised figures on a computer screen. This money was distributed before and after listening to the music, with both men and women doling out more money after listening to their favourite songs. Both sexes were stingier with their donations after hearing music that they disliked, and silence had no effect at all on their generosity. Consequently, the researchers concluded: ‘preferred music promotes altruistic behaviour, whereas disliked music is associated with selfish behaviour, and what differentiates these behaviours is the emotional response dictated by the listener’s musical preferences. The study also found that that on the whole, men were more generous than women, and whether the music had words or not did not make a difference to an individual’s generosity.

An image of One Direction, whose music could either make people more or less generous, is pictured . Scientists at the University of Cambridge claimed last month that listening to hip hop can help suffering from depression. 'There is often a message of hope in among the lyrics, describing the place where they want to be – the cars they want to own, the models they want to date,' the researchers wrote. In an article in The Lancet Psychiatry, the team claims that lyrics which speak of overcoming hardships and struggles can offer refuge. Researchers recommend The Message by Grandmaster Flash (pictured) & The Furious Five, released in 1982, which includes the lyrics: 'I can't take the smell, can't take the noise Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice' to help beat depression . 'Much of hip-hop comes from areas of great socioeconomic deprivation, so it's inevitable that its lyrics will reflect the issues faced by people brought up in these areas, including poverty, marginalisation, crime and drugs,' said Dr Akeem Sule, of the University of Cambridge. 'In fact, we can see in the lyrics many of the key risk factors for mental illness, from which it can be difficult to escape. 'Hip-hop artists use their skills and talents not only to describe the world they see, but also as a means of breaking free. 'We believe that hip-hop, with its rich, visual narrative style, can be used to make therapies that are more effective for specific populations and can help patients with depression to create more positive images of themselves, their situations and their future.'","Researchers from the Nara University of Education in Japan, discovered that music has the power to promote altruistic behaviour .

"When it comes to hiring a car, men want to be in the driver’s seat more than women do, and they want a luxury sports car that can ferry them to their destination in style. A survey has found that 80 per cent of men prefer to drive when they hire a car while on holiday, compared to just over a fifth of women (22 per cent). And it may come as no surprise that their ideas of the 'perfect' car hire differ greatly. Scroll down for video . Holiday: Men prefer to drive, especially if it's a sport car, while women want a larger sport utility vehicle . In the survey conducted by travel search website Skyscanner, almost a fifth of men said they would prefer to drive a sporty Aston Martin or Jaguar, compared to just 12 per cent of women. The top choice for women (40 per cent) was larger sport utility vehicles – Range Rovers or Jeeps – in contrast to just 28 per cent of men. Luxury Range Rovers proved to be popular as they were voted the top car brand with one in four of those surveyed, while the Mini Cooper was one of the least popular with just two per cent of the vote, said Skyscanner. The survey found out what British holidaymakers are looking for in their 'perfect' car hire. As for the most important features, air conditioning was a clear winner with 39 per cent of the vote, although cost-savvy Brits ranked fuel efficiency highly with almost a quarter of respondents considering it their ‘must have’ option. Four times as many men than women rated a convertible roof as the most important feature, while twice as many women want a coffee maker. Sixteen per cent of respondents said a sat nav is their 'must have' option when hiring a car . But when it comes to ‘dream’ features, laid-back Brits appear to want to take it easy, as 27 per cent say they want the option of a hands-free auto pilot. Three options – in-car wifi, a seat massager and an amphibious car – were in a three-way tie with 13 per cent of the vote. Rounding out the top five was the option of a fridge (12 per cent) to store drinks and snacks. Even though long road trips can be stressful for couples and lead to rows, an ejector seat was the least popular option (one per cent).","Just 22% of women prefer to behind the wheel of a hired car, says study .

"The Islamic State is working to inspire sympathizers inside the U.S. to target and kill American servicemen at home, according to new intelligence. Fearing an attack like the one carried out by an ISIS-supporter on Canada's parliament two months ago, which resulted in the death of a uniformed soldier, U.S. officials are asking servicemen to scrub their social media accounts of anything that might identify them as a member of the military. The FBI and [Department of Homeland Security] recommend that current and former members of the military review their online social media accounts for any information that might serve to attract the attention of ISIL [ISIS] and its supporters,' the joint memo obtained by ABC News said. Scroll down for video .

Above, troops arrive in Fort Campbell, Kentucky on March 21, 2014 after deployment in Afghanistan . The bulletin was issued to law enforcement agencies on Sunday and advised troops to 'routinely exercise operational security in their interactions online' as the recent attack on Canada may 'embolden' and 'motivate' others loyal to ISIS in the U.S. Members of the American special operations forces and other military branches told ABC that they deactivated, scrubbed or locked their Facebook and other social media accounts before the U.S. started leading a coalition to bomb ISIS in Iraq and Syria in August. But according to the latest memo, the strongest warning issued by the FBI to U.S. military yet, fresh intelligence suggests that ISIS is revamping efforts to target the homeland. 'The FBI recently received reporting indicating individuals overseas are spotting and assessing like-minded individuals who are willing and capable of conducting attacks against current and former U.S.-based members of the United States military,' the bulletin added.

'Do not ask for anyone's advice and do not seek anyone's verdict,' ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani said in an audio speech posted online on September 21. 'Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling. Both of them are disbelievers. Both of them are  considered to be waging war.' Social media has been perhaps one of ISIS's biggest tools, aiding in the terrorist's groups expansion in Syria and into Iraq.

"It is one of the world’s most popular ski destinations. But resorts in the Austrian Alps are currently struggling with an almost total lack of snow. Snow-making machines have been placed on the slopes of Gschwandtkopf mountain in the western Austrian village of Seefeld in a bid to try and attract holidaymakers. Rosskopf mountain in the Tirol district of Austria is currently struggling with an almost total lack of snow . Similar problems have affected other Austrian resorts, including Flachau in Salzburg and Rosskopf mountain in Tirol, at a time when the snow is usually plentiful. Tourism bosses have blamed the lack of snow on unusually warm winter weather. The ski season in Austrian runs from the beginning of December to the end of March. But Ski Club Great Britain, which publishes online snow forecasts for ski resorts around the world, reported today that there was barely any snow at many resorts. However, despite the absence of snowfall in recent days, up to four inches is expected to fall over the next week. Temperatures in the Alps were recently revealed to be rising faster than anywhere else in the world, with Alpine resorts attempting to adapt to climate change. A bearer of a T-bar lift is displayed on a snowless slope on Gschwandtkopf mountain in Seefeld . Snow-making machines stand on a snowless slope on Gschwandtkopf mountain in western Austria . Snow cannon stand on the green meadow which is a usually popular skiing piste in Flachau, Salzburg . A recent Austrian climate report found the country’s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880, with the number of sunshine hours in the Alps increasing by 20 per cent. Alpine countries are already shifting their focus to adaptation solutions, acknowledging that climate change will not be stopped or turned around anytime soon. Low-lying resorts have long invested in snow cannon to ensure white slopes during the ski season but some have radically changed their marketing strategies – like Switzerland’s Stockhorn ski region, which dismantled its ski lifts to refocus on winter hiking and snowshoeing. Although France remains the most popular ski destination for British skiers, 400,000 tourists from the UK chose Austria as their ski destination last year. Chairlifts have been taken out of operation on the ski pistes at Flachau in Salzburg . Snow-making machines have been placed on the slopes of Gschwandtkopf mountain in western Austria . Tourism bosses in Seefeld, Austria have blamed the lack of snow on unusually warm winter weather . The news comes after it was revealed that family skiing holidays to Austria could soar in price by up to £140 after a new law was passed guaranteeing foreign workers minimum wage. British tour companies have also threatened to cut back on the number of holidays offered in the European country following the ruling, which will see their operating costs rise. About 500 UK staff - including chalet workers - in Austria will now have to be paid the minimum wage of £790 a month. Ski resorts such as Seefeld in Tirol, Austria, are among the most popular in the world . Temperatures in the Alps were recently revealed to be rising faster than anywhere else in the world . Three years ago, Alpine regions experienced the warmest autumn in 147 years, resulting in little snow. Following an extremely dry November with high temperatures, some ski resorts in the Swiss Alps have postponed their season opening weekends due to the lack of snow. In Hochfilzen, Tirol, organisers of an international race went to the Grossglockner - Austria's highest mountain - to get snow they needed to prepare their slopes for their track in 2011.

"This is the terrifying moment a racist thug waved a samurai sword in the street threatening to 'kill all the Poles' before slashing a man in the back. In photographs handed to police by a bystander, Gareth Devlin is seen with the weapon in his hand while walking in the street in Teesside. The 28-year-old was jailed for five years after a court heard how he frightened children by waving the weapon around one summer afternoon. Gareth Devlin was photographed waving a samurai sword in the street before striking it down on the back of a Polish national he threatened to kill . Polish nationals had been drinking on the afternoon in question, when many of the residents on the quiet street were enjoying the Brazil v Netherlands third-place playoff in the FIFA World Cup. Devlin and his friend, 24-year-old Joseph Smithson, approached the men, shouting: 'Come on!' Teesside Crown Court heard. Threatening: 'I will kill you,' he struck the sword down on one man's back as he tried frantically to flee the scene. 'One of the witnesses, to their great credit, grabbed a camera,' prosecutor Paul Cleasby said. 'He was a keen photographer and he was able to take photographs of the assailants. 'That at the time proved to be the best evidence. 'Your Honour sees Gareth Devlin with a sword in his hand in broad daylight walking down the street.

Sentencing the father-to-be to five years in jail, Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'You, Mr Devlin, took part in a very bad attack upon this Polish gentleman for reasons only you can understand. 'You know, and you’ve set out in your letter, that only a sentence of custody can be considered, and a lengthy sentence at that.' He told Smithson the time he had spent on remand - equal to an eight-month sentence - was enough custody for his crime. Outside court, Detective Constable Alan O’Donoghue, of Cleveland Police, said: 'We very much welcome the sentence given today. 'It sends a clear message that people cannot behave in this way, threatening people in broad daylight in the street.

"Los Angeles Kings star defenseman Slava Voynov pleaded not guilty on Monday to a felony charge of domestic violence against his wife. The 24-year-old two-time Stanley Cup winner, who is currently suspended from playing in the NHL and on $50,000 bail, entered the plea at his arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The Russian international is accused of attacking his new wife, Marta Varlamova, 24, in their home in October and was arrested in a LA hospital after taking her there to be treated for injuries. His wife of four months has already issued a statement denying she is a victim and claims her injuries occurred by accident. Scroll Down for Video . Denial: Slava Voynov at Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday after his arraignment for a domestic assault on his wife, Marta Varlamova . During his appearance, a judge denied the District Attornye's request for a criminal protective order against Voynov after her lawyer told the court the couple were still living together. Voynov, who faces up to nine-years in prison if found guilty, faces a single count of corporal injury to spouse with great bodily injury stemming from an October 19 altercation at their home in the LA suburb of Redondo Beach. Prosecutors said Marta, who has a child with Voynov, sustained injuries to her eyebrow, cheek and neck. When he was charged in October, Voynov's lawyer, Craig Renetzky, said in a statement: 'Mr. Voynov is extremely disappointed that the district attorney's office elected to file charges. 'Mr. Voynov maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name in court. We remain confident.' An attorney for Mr Voynov's wife has also released a statement, denying his client is a victim and that she believes the injuries were an accident. 'Not a criminal': Voynov's wife has spoken through her lawyer to say her husband is not guilty and did not hurt her on purpose. Family man: Russian-born Voynov, 24, is pictured with his wife Marta Varlamova - who he married in August. The couple have a young daughter (pictured) The statement from October reads: 'Marta was stunned by the news today and she is devastated. She did not believe, and does not believe, that her husband intended to injure her and she believes that he is not guilty of any crime. 'She is worried about her family's privacy and concerned that she and her family are going to be subjected to ridicule, embarrassment and hatred because of this decision. Mugshot: Voynov is shown in this Redondo Beach Police Department booking photo following his arrest . 'In fact, she has already seen that beginning to happen. 'It is unfortunate that no one seemed to care what she wants, and that the authorities gave little or no weight to her view of the facts of the case. 'Despite this unwelcome news, she still expects her husband to be cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.' The NHL suspended Voynov indefinitely for the duration of his proceedings and he has not played since October 19. However, he continues to be paid. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said: 'We are aware of actions taken today in California, which we will review and evaluate before making any decisions. 'Until further notice, the current terms of Mr. Voynov's suspension remain in place.' Voynov only married Marta Varlamova in August 2014, two months before the alleged assault. On announcing Voynov suspension, the NHL cited a section of the collective bargaining agreement saying they have power to suspend a player during a criminal investigation if failing to do so 'would create a substantial risk of material harm to the legitimate interests and/or reputation of the league'. The NHL's swift response comes in stark contrast to the NFL, which was criticized for failing to appropriately deal with players facing charges, including Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Happt day: Voynov only married Marta Varlamova in August 2014, two months before the alleged assault . Rice was only suspended for two games from the Baltimore Ravens after he was arrested for hitting his then-fiance in an elevator at a casino in Atlantic City. But after a website shared a video showing him striking her, the NFL banned him indefinitely and the Ravens released him, amid much public uproar. Peterson, a running back for the Minnesota Vikings and a former MVP, was also suspended indefinitely with play by his team after he was charged with child abuse in Texas. He is accused of allegedly whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch in May. Voynov's swift suspension also comes a year after the NHL failed to comment or enact a suspension when Colorado Avalanche goaltender Semyon Varlamov was arrested on assault charges. Charges in the case were later dropped. In June 2013, Voynov and the Kings agreed on a six year, $25 million contract extension. The Russian has two assists in six games this season.","Slava Voynov is accused of assaulting his wife, Marta Varlamova in October .

"It's an annual tradition dating back decades - but this year the White House holiday tour will have a distinctly modern feel, thanks to new, digital décor. As well as the usual gingerbread White House, dozens of trees and many beautiful wreaths, the White House will boast infra-red motion sensors, crowd-sourced lighting patterns and matching robot versions of the first family's two dogs, Bo and Sunny. Keeping with this traditional with a twist theme, the Obamas have also released their first ever interactive White House holiday card. Scroll down for video . A.I.:  The White House Christmas tour will feature robot versions of the first family's two dogs, Bo and Sunny. Pictured, senior advisor for digital media Mark DeLoura begins to prepare the frame for the robot . Bo (pictured left) and Sunny Obama (right) have been immortalised as robot dogs for the White House tour . According to the Washington Post, a group of technology experts based at the White House made a 'robot skeleton' of Bo Obama made of chicken-wire which can swivel its head back and forth. Meanwhile, rather than rotating its head at a set rate Sunny-bot has eyes with infra-red motion sensors that make it turn in the direction of anyone approaching it. Both robot dogs have been made using basic software and hardware - Sunny-bot even has rubber bands as ligaments to give her head flexibility. The two teams worked in their spare time to create the robotic first dogs. The experts even watched videos of Portuguese water dogs barking to decide if they should give the robot dogs a voice - but decided against it as the barking was so loud they worried it may scare small children. Bo and Sunny pictured with First Lady Michelle Obama (left) and daughters Malia and Sasha Obama (right) The National Christmas Tree near the White House (pictured) at a 2006 Christmas peace ceremony . The experts then wrapped roughly a mile of black polyester satin ribbon around the wire frames of the robots to make it look like the Sunny and Bo's fur. And in the festive spirit of sharing and encouraging youngsters into technology, the  teams made the codes used on the robot dogs open-source to encourage students to experiment and 'out-Bo Bo.' According to the Washington Post, next year the experts want to build robots with animated joints that can move their paws and even jump. This year's modern with a twist White House decorations also features an interactive digital snowscape that captures the movements of visitors in front of it.

"Former top prosecutor Sir Keir Starmer says time should be a barrier to justice . Britain's former top prosecutor has controversially defended police who hold suspects in a ‘legal limbo’ for years while alleged crimes are investigated. Keir Starmer, the ex- Director of Public Prosecutions, disagreed with those who have called for time limits on how long a person can languish on bail without being charged. He said time ‘should not be a barrier’ to bringing people to justice for crimes committed decades earlier. A number of high-profile celebrities, including Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall, have been convicted of sex crimes that happened years ago after their victims finally plucked up the courage to complain about the attacks. But there have been mounting concerns about cases where suspects are left on bail for long periods – often with strict curbs to their freedom – without charges being pressed. Veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini spent 12 months on bail after being arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched after Jimmy Savile was unmasked as a prolific paedophile after his death, only to be told last month (OCT) he would not face sexual assault charges. The openly gay DJ, who was investigated over historic allegations of molesting two teenage boys, told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ having his name dragged through the mud. Home Secretary Theresa May has signalled she wants time limits on pre-charge bail amid mounting concern that police forces are misusing their powers by keeping people dangling for months and even years. In an article in this week’s Radio Times, on sale today TUES, Mr Starmer said the passage of time should not provide immunity against bringing charges against historic offenders. He said: ‘I do not underestimate the impact that delay has on those arrested and subsequently released without charge, such as Paul Gambaccini. Equally, there is the impact on those tried and acquitted. ‘But they are features of our system whatever the time limits for bringing a case. ‘I certainly wouldn’t want to replicate the situation in countries such as North Korea where virtually all those arrested are charged and virtually all those charged are convicted. ‘That some individuals are released without charge and some are acquitted demonstrates the strength, not the weakness, of our approach.’ Police are allowed 24 hours to keep a suspect for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge. A number of high-profile celebrities, including Rolf Harris, left, and Stuart Hall, right, have been convicted of sex crimes that happened years ago after their victims finally plucked up the courage to complain . In practice, they often quiz a person then release them on pre-charge bail to return for further interview at a later date, giving officers time to build robust cases. But there are currently no restrictions on the length of time a person can spend on police bail which can force innocent people to put their lives on hold, pay thousands in legal fees and suffer the slow assassination of their character. Conditions can also be placed on police bail, which can include curfews and restrictions on movement and financial transactions while an investigation continues. Comedian Jim Davidson lashed out at the system after being arrested under the Operation Yewtree and kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges. Freddie Starr, another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrest by officers investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women. The case was dropped. Veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini spent 12 months on bail after being arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, but was told last month he would not face sexual assault charges . Some 30 journalists are currently on bail – some for more than a year – while police investigate alleged crimes including phone hacking and paying public officials for stories. The College of Policing, the professional body that sets police standards, have been asked by ministers to consider introducing time limits for pre-charge bail, which human rights groups believe should be 28 days. Mr Starmer said it was right to prosecute people for historic crimes – whether it was a ‘an Auschwitz guard standing trial in Germany… or a host of greying celebrities on suspicion of historic sex crimes.’ He said there had been a ‘profound shift’ from the long-held view that not bringing a prosecution within a certain period of time was ‘not fair on defendents’. There had been a ‘growing understanding that time runs at different speed for victims,’ particularly those who had suffered sexual violence, he said. ‘In a sense they carry an unresolved issue with them, almost an open wound, for many years, maybe even for their entire lives. ‘We are rightly reluctant to say that those now coming forward to report serious allegations, not infrequently against those in the public eye, that they are simply too late.’ Acknowledging that the passage of time caused ‘difficiulties’ for both the prosecution and defence, because of fading memories and lost evidence, he said it was ‘simply not a good enough reason not to bring a case’. Mr Starmer said: ‘Most importantly, we now understand victims’ interests better and recognise that, for many, achieving closure, the knowledge that someone has been held to account, is an end in itself. ‘We have to be bolder, and clearer, in saying that pure delay should not be a barrier to bringing people to justice. The public does not accept any longer that the passage of time immunises anyone. ‘My own view is that for the most serious offences, and in that I include serious sexual offences, time should never run out.’","Britain's former top prosecutor says time 'should not be a barrier' to justice .

"Americans will spend $2.5billion doing their holiday shopping online in what is expected to be the biggest Cyber Monday to date. With this year's Black Friday bringing in lower sales than last year's, according to estimates, research firm comScore predicts Monday's online sales will break past records. Black Friday, which falls the day after Thanksgiving, saw 5 percent fewer shoppers spending 11 percent less, according to the National Retail Federation. Scroll down for video . Rush: Americans will spend $2.5billion doing their holiday shopping online in what is expected to be the biggest Cyber Monday to date, with Amazon accounting for a bulk of the sales (file photo) So called Cyber Monday, which falls after Black Friday, became the biggest day for online shopping by sales volume in 2010. This year, Amazon has had holiday deals on offer since November 21, with coveted Beats by Dre headphones, selling for $275. PayPal said that global mobile payment volume increased 47 percent this Thanksgiving from last year. Wal-Mart reported 500 million more page views. The retail giant said it had doubled its Cyber Week deals from 2013 to 50. Figures from eBay say the online auction and retail site quickly went through 2,000 iPad Air 2 tablets selling at $399, at a rate of one per second. Big deals on toys offered by Toys R Us, which has had online sales since November 26, include a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles electronic fighting game and dolls based on the characters from Disney's Frozen. Delivery: Amazon workers in Phoenix worked hard to sort packages for delivery in this file photo from November 11, 2010, with holiday sales online building each consecutive year . 'Online is nowhere near its maturity, so Cyber Monday should be big, with a lot of strength in the days leading up to it,' said Forester Research analyst Sucharita Mulpuru. In addition to the Thanksgiving weekend, Mulpuru expected another spike in online retail in December, when shipping deadlines occur. The research firm comScore, which tracks sales behavior in the US based on responses from a panel of 2 million users, expects holiday shopping to total $61billion over November and December. While many began lining up after Thanksgiving to take advantage of deals happening in stores, others were less comfortable in the crowds.

"A coral reef in Northern Australia severely damaged by warming seas has managed to completely heal itself in just 12 years, stunned researchers have found. The team found that being left alone to breed on its own was key. The discovery raises hope that other damaged reefs could 'regenerate'. Scott Reef in Northern Australia, where researchers found coral has 'regenerated' itself after almost 12 years following a warming incident . The new research shows that an isolated reef off the northwest coast of Australia that was severely damaged by a period of warming in 1998. It was hit by coral bleaching, caused by higher water temperatures that break down the . coral's symbiotic relationship with algae that provide food for coral . growth. However, the team found Scott reef has regenerated in a very short time to become nearly as healthy as it was before. What surprises scientists, though, is that the reef regenerated by itself, found a study published Thursday in the journal Science. James Gilmour and colleagues studied the Scott system of reefs on the edge of Western Australia’s continental shelf, which lost 70 to 90 percent of its corals to a climate-induced bleaching event back in 1998. Scott Reef is an isolated group of three reefs near the edge of northwestern Australia's continental slope . The researchers found that, although the corals’ reproductive abilities were by the bleaching, coral cover still increased from 9 percent to 44 percent across the entire system in just 12 years. The team say the finding is surprising because researchers have assumed that recovery from such bleaching events depends upon the delivery of larvae from other, nearby reef systems. But, the Scott system of reefs is located 155 miles (250 kilometers) from the mainland or any other reefs. So, Gilmour and his team suggest that herbivorous fish, which remained abundant in the undisturbed Scott system, even after the bleaching, kept microalgae in check and allowed coralline algae to thrive. This set of conditions in turn provided a suitable substratum upon which young corals could establish and grow., they claim. The study suggests that reef systems can recover using local sources of larvae, especially when fish are plentiful and human activities, which have been shown to slow coral recovery in the past, are limited. At first, the reef grew slowly, mostly through the enlargement of existing coral colonies. But to really recover, the coral needs to sexually reproduce, creating sperm and egg that form embryos that then land on the ocean floor and grow into adult corals, if all goes well. These larvae can survive for hundreds of miles, swept along by ocean currents, and colonize new areas under the right circumstances. Larvae floating in from other reefs could have helped the reef, had it not been so isolated. But amazingly, after about six years, the surviving corals matured and began to reproduce, creating even more new colonies than before the bleaching. 'They recovered, and the larvae they produced settled and survived, at much higher rates than is often reported,' Gilmour said. The rate of recovery was attributed to the lack of many local human pressures affecting reefs around . the world, such as degraded water quality and overfishing of herbivores . By 2012, the reef was basically back to its old self. The study suggests that, when it comes to reefs, being isolated from human activity may trump being connected to other reefs. Overfishing, for example, removes fish that keep algae from choking out and outcompeting corals, and sediment and pathogens in runoff water can lead to coral diseases and death. But the results also mean that local decisions about fishing and other issues can help preserve reefs, which are threatened by global warming. 'Managing local conditions is a tangible way to maximize the resilience of coral reefs while the more difficult problem of addressing the causes of climate change are resolved,' Gilmour said.","Scott reef on the northwest coast of Australia was severely damaged by a period of warming in 1998 .

"Sir Cliff Richard: Considering legal action . Top executives at the BBC worked frantically with police behind the scenes to spin their disastrous coverage of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s home, it emerged last night. The Corporation was plunged into a huge row over its cosy deal with police after it was allowed privileged access to a search of the singer’s £3million Berkshire home. It can now be revealed that even as questions were asked over their apparent ‘collusion’, senior figures at the BBC were engaging in behind-the-scenes discussions with police over what should be said publicly about what had happened. Messages between the BBC and South Yorkshire Police lay bare how – once the row had broken – the BBC bargained with police over what they would say about it. The day after raid, the BBC’s head of newsgathering, Jonathan Munro, offered to tweet a statement exonerating the force from claims it had been the source of its story ‘as a gesture of goodwill’, boasting that the message would ‘reach every newsroom in the UK pretty much instantly.’ In turn, emails show South Yorkshire Police’s head of corporate communications, Carrie Goodwin, sending a public statement to the BBC for approval before it was published. Miss Goodwin wrote: ‘We haven’t mentioned the BBC or any suggestion of any wrongdoing. Is this OK for you?’ Emails also show how staff at both organisations stressed that they were ‘keen’ to maintain their relationship, and wanted to let the ‘dust settle’ as the controversy over their treatment of the pop icon raged. Copies of texts, emails and notes passed to a Parliamentary committee show how the BBC was given the inside track before, during and after the raid. The new evidence emerged as it was claimed Sir Cliff, 74, is preparing to sue the broadcaster over its live TV coverage of the search of his home. The singer is expected to seek damages for breach of privacy if, as he expects, he does not face charges over an allegation of historical sex abuse. He is also said to be considering legal action against the force after it tipped off the broadcaster about the timing and location of the raid. The police investigation began when a man claimed Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him during a Christian rally in Sheffield organised by Billy Graham, the American evangelist, in 1985. A shot from the BBC helicopter showing police arriving at Sir Cliff's £3million home in Berkshire . The BBC posted reporters at the gates of Sir Cliff's home before police arrived to search the home . Police struck a deal with the BBC giving it privileged access after it learned, a month before the August raid, that reporter Dan Johnson knew Sir Cliff was under investigation. The BBC faced a wave of criticism from the public, stars and MPs over its handling of the sensitive police operation. It posted reporters at the gates before police arrived and dispatched a helicopter to hover overhead, allowing officers to be filmed through the windows. Sir Cliff, who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested, was in Portugal and learned of the raid via the TV coverage. Former BBC journalist Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, described the police inquiry as a ‘witch-hunt’ and attacked the BBC for an ‘error of judgment’. Sir Cliff, who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested, was in Portugal and learned of the raid on his home, above, via the TV coverage . Sir Cliff’s lawyer, Gideon Benaim, who denounced the ‘premature and disproportionate’ reporting, was not available to comment yesterday. Neither was Sir Cliff’s spokesman. A report by the Commons home affairs select committee found the BBC acted ‘perfectly properly’ in its dealings with police, but said the coverage caused Sir Cliff ‘enormous, irreparable damage’. South Yorkshire Police said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well-intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety caused to Sir Cliff Richard.' July 17 Police press chief Carrie Goodwin notes a deal struck with reporter Dan Johnson after he reveals he knows that police are investigating Sir Cliff. She writes in her notes: ‘Consider... notify of search date + location to prevent broadcast.’ August 13 The day before the raid, a member of the police press team emails Johnson an aerial photo of Sir Cliff’s home. August 14 The day of the raid. Johnson is given a running commentary of police progress. At 5.12pm Miss Goodwin texts Johnson, asking: ‘Good day?’ He replies: ‘Bonkers, but brilliant…’ But things turn sour when the story appears on the BBC website, suggesting police tipped off the broadcaster to maximise coverage. Miss Goodwin then texts Johnson at 7.22pm: ‘Not happy about this at all. This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’ August 15 In an email, Jonathan Munro, BBC head of newsgathering, offers to post a tweet saying that the force ‘was not the original source’ as a ‘gesture of good faith’. Miss Goodwin replies an hour later, asking for his approval for a police statement explaining why the police acted the way they did. In the 3.11pm email, Miss Goodwin says: ‘We haven’t mentioned the BBC or any suggestion of any wrongdoing. Is this OK for you?’ August 17 Chief Constable David Crompton formally complains to the BBC, saying police worked with the corporation to ‘protect the integrity of the investigation’. August 18 Chief Constable Crompton phones BBC company secretary Phil Harrold. Miss Goodwin notes: ‘[He] acknowledged … like to let the dust settle. Keen to continue to work with the BBC.’ She also wrote that Munro wanted to avoid a ‘war of press releases’.","Row after BBC was allowed privileged access to search of Sir Cliff's home .

"He moves slowly but surely and when he wants a rest he simply slinks into the home he carries on his back - it's no wonder Liu Lingchao is known as the 'Snail Man'. Liu, 39, came up with an ingenious way to make a living in the Chinese city of Liuzhou and travel from his rural home a three day's walk away free of expenses. Liu walks to Liuzhou in central China's Guangxi Autonomous Region to collect rubbish to sell for recycling - it's not a lucrative career option but works for him given his overheads are so low. Liu Lingchao, 39, carries his home on his back while he makes his living in the city of Liuzhou . Liu has been dubbed Snail Man by locals as he walks the streets collecting rubbish to sell for recycling . While in the city, he sleeps in his portable home - it's too deluxe to call a tent - and relies only on only his feet for transport. 'My life started to fall apart six-years-ago when I lost my job after my father died, and my marriage broke up and my wife left me,' he said. 'I was struggling to get back on my feet, and then I realised that I really needed to be doing something to get me out of my depression. 'About the only thing that seemed to be possible was getting involved in garbage recycling collecting plastic bottles and stuff, but the best place to do that is in the city and by the time you've paid accommodation and all the rest of it, there isn't much left.' The interior of Liu's deluxe portable home away from home, complete with bedding and decorations . Liu walks about three days from his village to Liuzhou where he doesn't have to pay for accommodation . Liu searches a roadside for garbage he can sell while his portable home sits on the ground . Liu appreciates the nickname given to him by locals accustomed to seeing him wandering the streets with his unique shelter on his shoulders. 'I came up with the idea of making a makeshift home that I could just move around easily,' Liu says. 'And now I put it on my back, and walk to the city where I spend a while collecting garbage and selling it. 'When I've collected enough, I then walk back home again. It means I have to pay nothing on accommodation and nothing on travel either.' The hardy traveller lost his job and his wife, so hit the road with his portable home to make a living . When he needs to make a longer journey, Liu can pack down his home to an easier to manage size .

"The Netherlands is known as the liberal bastion of Europe - with relaxed attitudes to drugs and sex - but when it comes to Christmas, things are a little different. According to tradition, around mid-November St Nicholas, or Sinterklaas, is supposed to arrive in the country from Spain where he spreads Christmas cheer, with most towns holding parades. However, Sinterklaas also has a helper - Zwarte Pieten, or 'Black Pete' - who has attracted criticism in recent years over allegations the character is racist. Scroll down for video . Racist? As part of Dutch Christmas tradition towns hold Sinterklaas parades, where a man playing St Nicholas marches through the streets along with his helper Zwarte Pieten, or 'Black Pete' Tensions: While the majority of Dutch people see Black Pete as harmless, the character has become a flashpoint for tensions in recent years over allegations it is racist . Dispute: Supporters argue Black Pete has nothing to do with race, but critics say an 18th century book called St Nicholas and his Servant, from which Dutch traditions are drawn, show the character is based on a slave . As part of the tradition hundreds of Dutch  paint their faces black, rouge their lips, and don fuzzy wigs, before marching through town centres with Sinterklaas, who is usually played by a white man. While the tradition has been observed in the Netherlands for hundreds of years, recently it has been a flashpoint for tensions with the black community. At one march in Gouda ninety people were arrested after fights broke out between anti-Pete protesters and those taking part in celebrations. Supporters of the 'Black Pete' tradition argue that the character has nothing to do with race like American comics such as Al Jolson, and instead represents the black of winter. However activists say that an 18th century book, called Saint Nicholas and his Servant, from which many Dutch Christmas traditions are drawn, clearly shows the character is based on a slave. Division: Despite the controversy, that has not stopped most Dutch towns hosting parades featuring people dressed as Black Pete this year, including in Voorschoten (pictured) near The Hague . Investigating: Last year the UN were asked to probe the displays. Officials ruled the parades could be stopped if they risked law and order, but refused to say whether Black Pete was racist . Celebration: As part of Dutch Christmas tradition Sinterklaas is supposed to arrive in the country around mid-November from Spain where he spread cheer until December 5 when presents are exchanged . According to the book, Black Pete helps St Nicholas on his travels, before putting naughty children into sacks and taking them back to Spain when the celebrations are over. Last year the UN made a ruling over the parades after a legal case was brought, with judges saying that the displays could go ahead, so long as they didn't present a threat to law and order. However officials refused to say whether or not the character of Black Pete was racist. Recent polls across the Netherlands show strong support for the character, with between 85 and 90 per cent saying they want him to stay. Following the ruling, right-wing party Livable Rotterdam hung hundreds of Black Pete dolls in the city in celebration, while liberal politicians said it showed a lack of support for the tradition. The country's Prime Minister Mark Rutte also weighed into the debate, coming out in support of the tradition, saying: 'We should not disturb a children's party in this way.' Support: Recent polls show that between 85 and 90 per cent of Dutch want to keep the character, but growing resentment has also sparked violence at some parades . Controversy: While the Voorschoten protest passed off without disruption, at another parade in Gouda, ninety people were arrested after activists clashed with those taking part . Harmless? A man dressed as Black Pete walks through the streets in Voorschoten as part of a parade . Despite the controversy, Sinterklaas parades have continued throughout the Netherlands, including in the city of Voorschoten near The Hague. Dutch Christmas celebrations begin around mid-November, when Sinterklaas is supposed to arrive in the country from Spain, and continues until December 5 when presents are handed out on pakjesavond - literally meaning 'packages evening'. Between those dates Sinterklaas supposedly travels around the country, along with Black Pete, taking part in parades and spreading Christmas cheer. The tradition is taken very seriously by the Dutch, with news channels running a nightly report for children updating them on Sinterklaas's activities that day.","As part of Dutch Christmas tradition towns hold St Nicholas parades .

"La Decima is a big number at Real Madrid. Larger still is the amount of money the club have spent pursuing it. Since Zinedine Zidane won Real’s ninth European Cup in 2002, the cash sprayed across the continent chasing No 10 has totalled an astonishing £999million. That, of course, includes two players bought for £80m or more in Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale and three times breaking the world record transfer fee (twice in one summer). VIDEO Scroll down to watch Zidane and Ronaldo doing what they do best . Target: Real Madrid have spent £999m since last winning the Champions League in 2002 . Stunner: Zinedine Zidane scores an amazing goal in front of Michael Ballack of Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 . Winning the big one: Zidane celebrates with the Champions League trophy in Glasgow 12 years ago . Number of players signed: 62 . Most expensive player: Gareth Bale £86m . Players signed from Premier League clubs: 20 . Most spent in one season: £226.51m in 2009/10 . It also includes Thomas Gravesen, signed from Everton for £2.5m, and Lassana Diarra, signed from Portsmouth for a quite remarkable £20m. Cheques were written for the best and the rest at an average of £83.5m per year. In for £13.4m came Jonathan Woodgate, who scored an own goal and received a red card on his debut; in for £22.8m came Mahamadou Diarra, last seen getting relegated with Fulham; in for £11.5m came Royston Drenthe, who scored twice in 24 appearances for Reading this season. Big money: Madrid spent £80m on their star man Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 . Brilliant orange: Real topped the Ronaldo transfer with the £86m signing of Gareth Bale in the summer . Flashing the cash: Madrid spent big in 2009, signing Kaka (left) for £56m and Karim Benzema for £25m . Yet there was also Kaka at £56m, once world footballer of the year; there was Karim Benzema at £25m, one of the most sought-after young strikers in Europe; and, at £39.6m, there was Brazilian Ronaldo, the first player bought after Real’ s last European triumph. The most outlandish splurge came in 2009/10 when more than £220m was spent as Ronaldo joined from Manchester United, Kaka from AC Milan, and Benzema from Lyon. Despite all this the furthest the club had progressed in the Champions League in 11 seasons prior to this season was the semi-finals. For six straight years they failed to get beyond the last-16. That is an astonishing feat when you count the number of European Cup winners’ medals amassed by players either before or after their stay at the Bernabeu. Icon: David Beckham moved from Manchester United to Madrid for a fee of £25.5m . Saving not spending: Javier Saviola was a rare free transfer for the La Liga side in 2007 . David Beckham won with United before he joined in 2003. Xabi Alonso did it with Liverpool in 2005 before moving to Madrid four years later. Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben were both shifted on in the summer of 2009 after the arrivals of Ronaldo and Kaka as Real searched for that elusive breakthrough. They could have looked closer to home. Sneijder went on to lift the Champions League that season with Inter, while Robben scored the winning goal in the final for Bayern Munich last May. In total Madrid have had nine Champions League winners on their playing staff in the last 12 barren years, almost a full starting XI – including wobbly-legs himself Jerzy Dudek. Fabio Cannavaro had won the World Cup with Italy the summer before he signed but was unable to bring the biggest piece of club silverware to Real. Were they to beat city rivals Atletico and claim their 10th European Cup, the exorbitant cost would still be questioned – but it would then become an afterthought as celebrations began.

"There are 177,147 ways to fasten a necktie, it has emerged - 1,000 times more than previously thought. But the study was not prompted by higher theories of mathematics, but a flamboyant knot worn by a super-villain in Hollywood blockbuster The Matrix Reloaded. The Merovingian, named after a French . royal dynasty, wore his tie in the little-known Ediety knot, which . features two loops around the top of the knot and leaves the skinny part . of the tie hanging on top. Unorthodox: Fans were flummoxed at trying to copy the tie knot worn by The Merovingian (pictured) in The Matrix Reloaded - as the style was hidden much of the time by it being a black tie on a black shirt . Tradition: For years men have opted for the Windsor (right) or the Half Windsor (left) - there are 177,145 others . His . was perhaps the most unusual in a series of unorthodox tie knots in the . film trilogy, which prompted viral tutorial videos on Youtube from fans . trying to copy their style. Mathematician . Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson, of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in . Stockholm, Sweden, watched the videos and realised the 'Merovingian . knot' was missing from a major 2000 study by researchers at Cambridge . University. Along with three other mathematicians, he created a formula for devising tie knots using just three symbols, W, T and U. He said: 'T is a clockwise (turnwise) move of the . knot-tying blade, W is a counter-clockwise move, and U tucks the blade . under a previous bow. 'Whether to start with an inwards or outwards . crossing can be deduced by counting the total number of W and T in the . knot description string, and all possible strings in W and T produce . possible tie knots.' And now for something completely different: The random knot generator lists some of the combinations . Fancy something different today? The website features complicated letter-based sequences . It'll tie you up in knots: One of the 177,000 tie knots which can be achieved according to new research . From the tool, known in logic as formal language theory, he has created a random tie generator which uses the mathematics to teach internet users how to tie random knots. According to the New Scientist, the Cambridge researchers had wrongly assumed people would only make a tuck – folding one end of the tie under the rest to finish the knot – at the end, and that all knots would be covered by a flat stretch of fabric. But their theory did not account for the elaborate knots found in The Matrix, with several tucks and ruffled fabric. The researchers also changed one crucial rule - the limit to how many winding moves people could make before their tie became ludicrously short. The team put that number at 11 - meaning there are 177,147 possible knots in the world. But who could find enough time to tie them all?

"Commercial pilots have one of the most stressful jobs on the planet, but it appears they are being handsomely rewarded for their work. A government study has found that aircraft pilots and flight engineers are the highest paid group of workers in the UK with an average annual salary of £90,420 in 2014. They beat chief executives and senior officials, who are being paid an average of £81,521 this year, and air traffic controllers, who are raking in £79,874. Scroll down for video . Aircraft pilots and flight engineers are the highest paid workers in the UK, a study has found . Air traffic controllers rank third on the list with annual average salaries of £79,874, according to the study . Based on Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records, the findings are included in the Office of National Statistics’ annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, which was released this month. However, the survey does not include those who are self-employed or celebrities who are not listed on company payrolls, and the listed amounts do not include bonuses or overtime. Rounding out the top five were medical practitioners (£71,141) and marketing and sales directors (£70,742). Aircraft pilots beat chief executives and senior officials, and air traffic controllers for top spot . Lowest paid: Waiters and waitresses had annual salaries of just £12,507, followed by bar staff at £12,948 . Source: Office for National Statistics . Places six through ten were held by information technology and telecommunications directors (£64,511), financial managers and directors (£61,108), senior police officers (£57,896), financial institution managers and directors (£53,621), and senior professionals of educational establishments (£50,367). At the bottom end of the scale, waiters and waitresses had annual salaries of just £12,507, followed by bar staff at £12,948. Hairdressers and barbers were paid £13,373 this year, while kitchen and catering assistants earned £13,396. Other low-paid staff include launderers, dry cleaners and pressers (£13,767), retail cashiers and check-out operators (£13,911), and playworkers (£14,023). As of April, the median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees were £518, an increase of one pound from 2013. According to the study, that is the smallest annual growth since 1997, when record-keeping began. In addition to lifting the veil on Britain’s highest paid workers, the study uncovered unsurprising facts about gender pay disparity. Hairdressers and barbers were paid £13,373 this year - putting them near the bottom of the list . A male chief executive, for example, can earn up to £100,000, while a woman with the same job title is paid an annual salary of just £63,174. In the field of health care, male nurses earn an average of £33,460 a year while their female counterparts take home £31,140. But it’s not the same story for every profession, as female opticians are paid £36,350 – a little over £1,500 than male opticians.

"Water filling the Earth's oceans is older than the formation of the sun, increasing the chances of life emerging among the stars, scientists have revealed. The discovery suggests that water may be a common ingredient in the clouds of dust and gas from which solar systems are born, and not 'special' to our own. This has major implications for the likelihood of life being found on exoplanets orbiting stars beyond the sun, according to researchers. Scroll down for video . This image shows water through time in the formation of the solar system, as scientists have revealed that water filling the Earth's oceans pre-date the formation of the sun . The sun is thought to be 4.5 billion years old, but water on Earth may have formed before then as tiny crystals of ice floating around deep space. Professor Tim Harries, from the University of Exeter, said: 'We know that water is vital for the evolution of life on Earth, but it was possible that the Earth's water originated in the specific conditions of the early solar system, and that those circumstances might occur infrequently elsewhere. 'By identifying the ancient heritage of Earth's water, we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique, and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water. 'It raises the possibility that some exoplanets could house the right conditions, and water resources, for life to evolve.' The international team of scientists studied ancient ices preserved in comets and asteroids since the early days of the solar system. Using computer simulations, they were able to show that water in the oceans, meteorite samples and comets bore the chemical fingerprint of formation before the solar system took shape. Pictured is the Pacific Ocean . Water vapour has been detected in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years - or 729 trillion miles - from Earth. The planet is about the size of the gas giant Neptune, and is the smallest and coldest outside the solar system known to contain H2O molecules - the building blocks of life. Scientists claim the discovery is a leap forward in the study of distant exoplanets that may in future uncover evidence of alien life. Researchers used a technique called transmission spectroscopy, which measures dips in light as the planet passes in front of its host star to identify the signs of water vapour. Previously it has only been possible to measure the atmospheric compositions of larger Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets. Using computer simulations, they were able to show that water in the oceans, meteorite samples and comets bore the chemical fingerprint of formation before the solar system took shape. The water contained levels of deuterium - a 'heavy' strain of hydrogen with extra neutrons in its nucleus - that could only be explained by interstellar origins. It meant that at least some of the water in the solar system and on Earth pre-dated the birth of the sun. Lead author Ilsedore Cleeves, from the University of Michigen, said: 'The implication of these findings is that some of the solar system's water must have been inherited from the sun's birth environment, and thus pre-date the sun itself. 'If our solar system's formation was typical, this implies that water is a common ingredient during the formation of all planetary systems. To date, the Kepler satellite  has detected nearly 1,000 confirmed extrasolar planets. 'The widespread availability of water during the planet-formation process puts a promising outlook on the prevalence of life throughout the galaxy.","Earth's water may have begun life in the early solar system, says study .

"Watching a chef at a San Francisco restaurant slam frozen meat into the sidewalk is enough to make your stomach turn, not to mention the customers who may have had the misfortune of eating it. Captured on video outside Lucky River, a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco's Sunnyside neighborhood, the chef appears to lift and slam two slabs of beef up and down onto the ground. When a concerned inspector from the city's health department arrived to question the apparently bemused staff, they simply said the man was attempting to tenderize the meat and 'defrost' it by beating it off the concrete. Food prep: The staff member at Lucky River restaurant in San Francisco prepares to slam the meat to the ground . Crash: The man was simply trying to tenderize the frozen meat before cooking it he and the restaurant later explained . However, when local news made the trip down to examine the exact section of sidewalk they discovered it was covered in gum, cigarette butts and general filth. The owner of the restaurant said that the defrosting incident was an isolated one and that the meat was never used in any meals. KPIX showed the gross footage to neighbors, Steve Vender and London Lacey. 'It's highly unsanitary, I don't know how they're gonna clean the meat off after that. They're gonna wash it but it certainly doesn't look very appealing,' said Vender.

'I won't eat there again,' said Lacey. 'I will not eat there at all.'

"Former minister David Mellor was taped calling a taxi driver a 'sweaty, stupid little s***' but his rant at two foreign security guards was deemed not to be racist. The millionaire Tory was alleged to have  launched into an expletive-laden tirade at a Polish guard protecting his home at St Katherine Docks in Wapping, East London. He was accused of having wagged his finger in the face of the security worker and suggested 'people like him' should not be working there, according to The Sun on Sunday. The newspaper later accepted that Mr Mellor was not racist towards guards. Former minister David Mellor was quizzed by police . The story emerged hours after he issued a grovelling apology for his foul-mouthed rant at a taxi driver, saying he would stick to water at 'celebratory lunches' from now on. The former Secretary of State for National Heritage was questioned under caution on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence on March 26 last year. He was not arrested and after Crown Prosecution Service advice, no charges were brought. Mellor issued a grovelling apology for his foul-mouthed rant at a taxi driver after he left Buckingham Palace following his partner Lady Cobham being awarded a CBE (together above) The millionaire Tory allegedly launched into an expletive-laden tirade at a Polish guard protecting his luxury home at St Katherine docks in Wapping, East London. A spokesman for the Met said: 'A 64-year-old man from Tower Hamlets was interviewed under caution by police under  suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence on 26 March 2013. 'He attended an East London police station by appointment on May 23. He was not arrested and after Crown Prosecution Service advice, no charges were brought.' Last week, Mr Mellor was secretly recorded berating a cab driver after a visit to Buckingham Palace with his partner Lady Cobham, who had just been awarded a CBE. The 65-year-old barrister and radio presenter could be heard asking the taxi driver: 'Who are you to question me?' before yelling: 'I don't want to hear from you, shut the f*** up. Smart-a**** little b******.' He said: 'I've been in the Cabinet, I'm an award-winning broadcaster, I'm a Queen's Counsel — you think that your experiences are anything compared to mine?' Mr Mellor's career as a minister was ended by scandal including an affair, reported in the Mail in 1992 . But  Mr Mellor, who was forced to abandon his ministerial career after an affair in 1992, made an on-air apology. 'I can't think what possessed me to lose it with that cabbie the way I did,' he said. 'OK, I had a case but I threw it away by the way I spoke and I'm really, really sorry about that and I especially want to apologise to you, our listeners for trying your patience and risking my own credibility with you by speaking the way I did. 'Anyway, it's water for me at the next celebratory lunch, I've definitely made that decision. 'Ironically, I'm one of London taxis' best customers and I thank a lot of them for speaking up for me, like Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association who said and I quote 'I've picked him up myself. He's actually a very nice guy. 'Despite everything he's said, he's not a bad guy. Unfortunately for him he got recorded.' 'Well there's a career in broadcasting awaiting you, Steve, because I couldn't have put it in a more succinct way myself, so I thank you for that. 'I would like to show my appreciation for the London cabbies that I have used for 40 years by making a substantial donation to their Christmas appeal for underprivileged kids.' The former politician has previously flown  into rages at chefs and a border guard. On one occasion he told a terrified chef he should 'do his £10-an-hour job somewhere else' during a foul-mouthed outburst at staff of a restaurant near his home, it is claimed. He is said to have launched the rant - during which he called the chef a 'fat b******' - at workers in the establishment just a stone's throw from his plush riverside home. Mr Mellor, who was known as the Minister for Fun, was famously caught cavorting with mistress Antonia de Sancha in 1992. He now lives in a 19th century listed building in exclusive St Katharine's Dock, London, with his partner Penelope, Viscountess Cobham. Servoca, the firm which looked after security at the flats at the time of the incident was not available for a comment. David Mellor has not commented on the incident.","It was claimed he swore at a Polish and Nepalese guard for 10 minutes .

"British jihadis fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have pledged to send militants to fight police in the riot-hit American city of Ferguson, Missouri - providing the protesters embrace Islam. The city has seen widespread disorder after a police officer escaped punishment for shooting dead an unarmed black teenager, and now the Islamic extremists are attempting to take advantage of the anti-authoritarian feeling to convince those involved to adopt ISIS' radical ideology. Using the slogan 'From #IS 2 Ferguson', Birmingham-born jihadi Junaid Hussain, 20 - who has adopted the nom de guerre Abu Hussain al-Britani - this morning tweeted a photograph of a hand-written letter urging the Ferguson rioters to 'reject corrupt man-made laws like democracy' and declare their allegiance to ISIS' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Scroll down for video . Pledge: The note Birmingham-born jihadi Junaid Hussain, 20 posted on Twitter today is titled 'From #IS 2 Ferguson' and contains a promise to send militants to the Missouri city if protesters pledge allegiance to ISIS . Miliants: The note was accompanied by a photograph of a number of masked young men posing with assault rifles and mobile phone cases bearing the black and white logo of the Islamic State . The note Hussain posted on Twitter today is titled 'From #IS 2 Ferguson' and contains a promise to send militants to the Missouri city if protesters pledge allegiance to ISIS. It reads: 'We hear you and we will help you if you accept Islam and reject corrupt man-made laws like democracy and pledge your allegiance to Caliph Abu Bakr and then we will shed our blood for you and send our soldiers that don't sleep, whose drink is blood, and their play is carnage.' A militant calling himself Abu Dujana urged the Ferguson protests to carry out acts of violence . Underneath the picture Hussain tweeted: 'Accept Islam & give bayah [allegiance] to Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi & then we will send u soldiers that don't sleep! - #IS #Ferguson'. The note was accompanied by a photograph of a number of masked young men posing with assault rifles and mobile phone cases bearing the black and white logo of the Islamic State. It is understood the men in the photograph are militants based in ISIS-held areas of Syria and Iraq, and that one of the men is 20-year-old Hussain. Another militant, who uses the Twitter handle @Abu 3antar Britani and is also thought to be British, tweeted: 'From #IS to #Ferguson we heard your call and we are ready to respond! #FergusonDecision #BeLikeMalcolmX #FightBack'. A third jihadi using the nom de guerre Abu Dujana subsequently posted a photograph of a large knife being brandished by somebody wearing a glove made by the American sports brand Nike. 'For how long will you let these govts oppress u. Draw ur knives and show them a response!! #FergusonDecision #IS,' he wrote. Westernized: A jihadi using the nom de guerre Abu Dujana subsequently posted a photograph of a large knife being brandished by somebody wearing a glove made by the American sports brand Nike . Terror: British jihadi Junaid Hussain, 20 - who has adopted the nom de guerre Abu Hussain al-Britani -used the slogan 'From #IS 2 Ferguson' to share the note pledging support for Ferguson protesters . Abu Dujana later urged people to learn about Bilal Ibn Rabah, a freed slave who was one of the Prophet Mohammed's closest companions. He posted: 'Read the story of Bilal Ibn Rabah oh people #Ferguson and see how an oppressed slave became a hero & warrior through Islam.' Today's developments are far from the first time ISIS militants have spoken about Ferguson. In fact the opportunistic terrorists have repeatedly looked to take advantage of the anti-establishment feeling in the city by calling for the demonstrators to embrace extremist Islam. 'Chilling': The links between Ferguson and ISIS go right back to the first protests in August, when a CNN news report appeared to show a man holding a placard reading 'ISIS is here' Salena Zito - a political columnist for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper - described as 'chilling' the footage of a Ferguson demonstrator purportedly holding an ISIS banner behind a CNN reporter . The militants' attempts to hijack the protests in Ferguson appear to have two intentions. Firstly the militants seem to believe that Ferguson allows them to portray the US as promising black people fair treatment and equality, but treating them with violence and oppression. Secondly ISIS is evoking the names of a number of black civil rights leaders - many of whom, including Malcolm X, were Muslims and members of the Nation of Islam. In drawing comparisons with the civil rights movement, the militants appear to trying to attract new converts from among the many protesters. The links between Ferguson and ISIS go right back to the first protests in August, when a CNN news report appeared to show a man holding a placard reading 'ISIS is here'. The images inspired ISIS sympathisers around the world to use the hashtag #FergusonUnderISIS to urge the protesters to embrace radical Islam.","ISIS fighters in Syria post tweets declaring support for Ferguson rioters .

"The first police investigation into the death of an elderly hospital patient under the discredited Liverpool Care Pathway has begun, a police force revealed yesterday. The inquiry follows the death of 85-year-old Alice Johnson on a hospital ward in June – less than a month before the deadline set by ministers for the NHS to cease using the pathway. Mrs Johnson was sent to hospital for assessment after staff at her care home suspected the onset of dementia. Probe: Alice Johnson, 85, died at Warrington General Hospital (pictured) in June this year . The Liverpool Care Pathway was supposed to ensure dignified and pain-free dying but it was scrapped after a scathing independent inquiry last year found it had meant ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ treatment of the most vulnerable patients. The inquiry headed by Baroness Neuberger unearthed ‘desperate stories of desperate people’ who had been denied water on hospital wards after they had been assumed to be dying. Ministers branded the system ‘a national disgrace’ and ordered it to be stopped by July 14, 2014. However, medical records released to Mrs Johnson’s daughter Angela show her mother was placed on the pathway in Warrington General Hospital on June 26 this year, the same day that health minister Norman Lamb announced new rules on care for the dying and promised patients that in future ‘their voices, and those of their families, will be heard at all times’. Mrs Johnson died on June 29. Miss Johnson said yesterday she had not been told her mother had been placed on the pathway and only found out when she asked for the records after her death. An inquiry headed by Baroness Neuberger (above) unearthed 'desperate stories of desperate people' Mrs Johnson is officially said to have died from urinary tract infection and dementia. Her daughter said: ‘When I saw her dead in bed, she looked like a mummy, she was all dried up. ‘I had an awful feeling she had been killed. I said to the hospital staff, “You have killed her because you haven’t given her any water”. I kept saying don’t over-sedate her, and don’t take her drip off, but nobody listened.’ Mrs Johnson, who had been in a care home in Wigan, was admitted to Hollins Park Hospital in Warrington for a mental health assessment in April. While there she was put under sedation. On June 12, she was transferred to Warrington General. Miss Johnson said that staff there said her mother had ‘end-stage dementia’. When Miss Johnson complained about her mother’s hydration she said a doctor told her hydration was ‘only delaying the inevitable’. Key features of the pathway – said to have been used at its peak for more than 130,000 hospital deaths a year – were sedation followed by removal of artificial hydration. Critics said that on average death occurred 33 hours later. As reported in the Mail, experts were calling for the LCP to be banned back in 2009. Miss Johnson has complained to Cheshire police. A spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary said: ‘Two officers visited Angela Johnson to discuss her concerns, and were provided with medical and care records. Those records will now be examined to determine whether there are any grounds for a criminal investigation.’ Warrington General is part of Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The trust has made no comment on Mrs Johnson’s death or her daughter’s complaint. Hollins Park is part of the 5 Boroughs Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The trust said there was no evidence Mrs Johnson was placed on the pathway during her stay at Hollins Park.","Alice Johnson died on discredited plan at Warrington General Hospital .

"A 22-year-old man was found guilty on Monday for suffocating his teen girlfriend to death after she told him she was pregnant and wouldn't have an abortion. The body of 14-year-old Shaniesha Forbes was found charred and stuffed in a suitcase that washed up on Brooklyn, New York beach in January 2013 and an autopsy revealed she wasn't actually carrying a baby. Christian Ferdinand, the older boyfriend she met through Facebook,  was arrested four months later in Maine and confessed to the crime. 'He intentionally smothered a 14-year-old girl to death and burned her body to get rid of the evidence,' prosecutor Robert Walsh said during the trial. 'He had a problem that needed solving, he didn’t want to pay child support, and Shaniesha got in the way.' Guilty: Christian Ferdinand, 22 (left), was found guilty on Monday for the January 2013 murder of his 14-year-old girlfriend Shaniesha Forbes (right). He faces 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced next month . It took a jury just an hour on Monday to convict Ferdinand with murder, and he now faces between 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced next month. 'I hope he won’t see the light of day again,' the victim’s mother, Sandra Price, told the New York Daily News after the verdict was read on Monday. 'I will never see my baby again.' Forbes, who was a freshman at the Academy for Young Writers in Williamsburg, allegedly first infuriated her boyfriend when she told him she was pregnant via text message in January 2013. Ferdinand responded to the announcement by texting back: 'My n****, are you serious? Kill that s***' Admission: Ferdinand confessed to killing Forbes four months after her body washed up on a Brooklyn, New York beach (pictured above). He told investigators he killed her because she told him he was pregnant . Gruesome: Forbes was suffocated to death with a leather pillow. Ferdinand dumped her body in the ocean. Above, a picture of the scene where Forbes' body was found . But Forbes made it clear that she would not get an abortion, saying it would hurt her religious mother. The couple later met at Ferdinand's cousin's house where Forbes continued to talk about the pregnancy while they were both sitting on the couch. That's when Ferdinand snapped and grabbed a leather pillow to suffocate his girlfriend to death. Investigators asked Ferdinand if Forbes fought back as he was killing her, and he replied: 'She tried, wasn't much of a struggle, she was little.' After she died, Ferdinand proceeded to douse her body in Axe body spray which he used to set the corpse on fire with a Bic lighter. He later stuffed her body in a suitcase which he tossed into Gerriston Bay, believing the saltwater would destroy any evidence left on Forbes' body after the burning.  The body was later found when the suitcase washed up on Gerriston Beach. It was also revealed in the course of the trial, that Ferdinand spoke casually about Forbes' killing to a friend. Promising future: Forbes was a freshman at the Academy of Young Writers in Williamsburg at the time of her death . 'I hope he won’t see the light of day again,' the victim’s mother, Sandra Price, told the New York Daily News after the verdict was read on Monday. 'I will never see my baby again.' 'It didn't deserve to live' Ferdinand told a friend, according to testimony. He also booked into a hotel with an ex-girlfriend the day after the murder. The unnamed ex allegedly wanted to have sex with Ferdinand but he told her he was too tired. And when he confessed to the crime in May 2013, Ferdinand was bold enough to ask for a light sentence. 'So you think I can get some kind of community service?' Ferdinand asked investigators, according to court documents obtained by the New York Post. When he heard the jury's guilty verdict on Monday, Ferdinand lowered his head onto the defense table and appeared to tear up. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson ensured that his office would seek the maximum sentence of life in prison for the crime. 'He deserves much worse,' Forbes' 22-year-old sister Shaquana told the Daily News.","The charred body of 14-year-old Shaniesha Forbes was found stuffed in a suitcase which washed up on a Brooklyn, New York beach in January 2013 .

"The political truce that helped save the Union collapsed last night as David Cameron promised ‘English votes for English laws’ once Scotland is handed new powers. The Prime Minister sought to seize the initiative after winning the biggest gamble of his premiership, the Scottish independence referendum. His promise to ban Scots MPs from voting on English-only issues at Westminster is also an attempt to head off a Tory revolt over extravagant promises of more powers for the Scottish Parliament in the event of a No vote. Scroll down for video . Risk: The Prime Minister sought to seize the initiative after winning the biggest gamble of his premiership . In a 7am declaration in Downing Street yesterday, he said: ‘We have heard the voice of Scotland and now the millions of voices of England must also be heard.’ But his plan, requiring draft laws to be put before Parliament by January, was opposed by Labour, which condemned it as ‘a back of a fag packet solution’. There was also a growing revolt in Tory circles over a separate, last-ditch funding ‘bribe’ to the Scots made by the Prime Minister. Boris Johnson, tipped as Mr Cameron’s successor, accused him of a ‘slightly reckless promise’ to keep the generous public spending formula for Scotland that dates back to 1979. Rattled by a nationalist surge in the opinion polls, the pro-Union parties have put forward a timetable for change: . Yesterday Ed Miliband called for a ‘constitutional convention’ at the end of 2015 involving MPs, councillors and voters in each region, as former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott attempted to revive his vision of regional assemblies. Mr Cameron’s move, including a pledge to consider devolving powers to major English cities, leaves Labour opposing the same rights for England that it promised to Scotland. The party will be permanently weakened if its 40 Scottish MPs are stripped of the right to vote on issues controlled by the Scottish Parliament, which will include tax, welfare, health and education. Scottish MPs would be excluded from voting in the rest of the country’s key decisions and Scotland and England could end up with different income tax rates. There are doubts over whether an MP representing a Scottish seat could be prime minister or chancellor, as they would have no say over laws their government proposed. A Labour government with anything other than a landslide majority would also struggle to get measures such as Mr Miliband’s proposed new 50p top rate of tax through Parliament. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to have warned colleagues Labour’s ability to pass a Budget is at risk if plans for fast-track devolution of more powers are implemented. Mr Cameron’s move to seize the mantle of English nationalism was also designed to spike Ukip’s guns. Leader Nigel Farage had been preparing to make the cause of English nationalism his latest battle cry. The Prime Minister insisted: ‘The question of English votes for English laws, the so-called West Lothian question, requires a decisive answer so just as Scotland will vote separately on their issues of tax, spending and welfare, so too England as well as Wales and Northern Ireland should be able to vote on these issues. Home rule: The Prime Minister said Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on English-only issues . ‘All this must take place in tandem with and at the same pace as the settlement for Scotland.’ The Prime Minister will, however, reject calls from some Tories for a new English Parliament and Labour’s suggestion for new swathes of regional government. Instead, the voting rights of Scottish MPs will be curtailed – though exactly how is to be hammered out by a Cabinet committee headed by Commons leader William Hague. Clauses are expected to be added to a draft Bill on devolution to Scotland to be unveiled in November and introduced in January. Liberal Democrats suggested they will support some form of ‘English votes for English MPs’ at Westminster, as long as power is also devolved to the UK’s big cities. Sir Menzies Campbell, former Lib Dem leader, said that although he was a Scottish MP it would be unfair if he was able to continue voting on matters ceded to the Scottish Parliament which no longer affect his constituents. However, there are doubts over the proposed breakneck pace of reform, given that the future of Scottish MPs at Westminster once power is devolved – the West Lothian question – has been posed but unanswered for decades. In the closing days of the referendum campaign, Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Nick Clegg signed up to a ‘vow’ drawn up by former prime minister Gordon Brown, including the ‘continuation’ of the Barnett formula. Downing Street sources said the funding agreement – devised by Labour peer Lord Barnett in 1979 to adjust block grants to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – would become increasingly redundant as more responsibility for tax is given to the Scottish Parliament. On Tuesday, in their desperation to secure a No vote, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg made a ‘vow’ of greater powers for Scotland in a letter to the Daily Record newspaper (right). They wrote: ‘The Scottish Parliament is permanent and extensive new powers for the Parliament will be delivered by the process and to the timetable agreed and announced by our three parties, starting on 19th September.’ A timetable has been agreed – but not which powers will be handed over. The three parties have each put forward ideas. Labour would put Scotland in control of 40 per cent of cash it raises. MSPs could vary income tax rates by up to 15p. The Conservatives want to devolve all control of income tax. Scotland’s Parliament would be responsible for more than 50 per cent of its budget. The Liberal Democrats would hand over inheritance tax, income tax and capital gains tax. Scotland would control 60 per cent of its total revenue. The vow goes on to say that, whatever the new powers: ‘We can state categorically that the final say on how much is spent on the NHS will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.’ It says the Barnett formula will still be used to divide tax revenue between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under this formula, Scotland gets more money per head than English regions. Boris leads the Tory rebellion against Scots 'bribe' Boris Johnson last night put himself at the head of a growing Tory mutiny over David Cameron’s funding ‘bribe’ to Scotland. The London Mayor, a contender to succeed Mr Cameron, said the Prime Minister had made a ‘slightly reckless promise’ to maintain the Barnett formula – the arrangement drawn up by a Labour peer in 1979 that ensures generous funding for Scotland. The London Mayor said the Prime Minister had made a ‘reckless promise’ to maintain the Barnett formula . In the closing days of the referendum campaign, Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed up to a vow drawn up by former prime minister Gordon Brown that included the continuation of the deal. Anger on the Conservative benches has been increased by the role of Mr Brown, who appeared to be dictating the terms of eleventh-hour commitments to Scotland from the three Westminster parties. Mr Johnson was backed by other senior Tories as he called for ‘fairness all round’ in terms of public spending. The mayor, who will seek to return to Parliament in next year’s general election, insisted: ‘You can’t have a situation where subsidies are given without some measure of fairness all round. What’s sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander. ‘We can’t just go on with a system that even Joel Barnett himself thinks is outdated.’ He suggested that Lord Barnett, 91, be asked to redesign the system so that the ‘slightly reckless promise’ to keep it could be honoured by maintaining its name. Former environment secretary Owen Paterson demanded a recall of Parliament to discuss the implications of the promises to Scotland, a proposal rejected by Commons leader William Hague. Mr Paterson welcomed the referendum result but said the ‘chaotic manner’ in which the No vote had been won had ‘undermined the strong and resilient United Kingdom on which we all depend’. He added: ‘It is unacceptable that an ex-Labour leader was allowed to make rash promises ... to the Scottish people with the endorsement of all three UK party leaders, but with no mandate from Parliament.’ He said the Barnett formula led to a ‘lopsided’ constitutional settlement and if it was not resolved fairly for all parts of the UK, it ‘will fall apart’. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the public administration select committee, said that what was ‘right for Scotland is also right for England’. He expected further disputes with Scottish nationalists ‘because we’ve really no idea what these promises of extra powers actually are or what is meant by honouring the Barnett formula’. A Downing Street source said: ‘At no point have we said we intended to axe the formula. ‘We have talked this week about its continuation but that is in the context of devolving responsibility to the Scottish Parliament to raise much more of the tax they spend. ‘The block grant will shrink from two-thirds of Scottish spending to less than a half. So the Barnett formula will be less and less significant in terms of funding.’","David Cameron made the promise hours after resounding No vote .

"Even if you’re full to bursting point this Christmas, expect angry glares from your host if you leave so much as a Brussels sprout uneaten on your plate. That’s because the cost of the average Christmas lunch for six has soared by more than 10 per cent above the rate of inflation since last year to reach £93. Prices for 25 festive items, along with the cost of the cheapest turkey from Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco, were analysed for a survey. Finish your dinner: Due to the soaring costs of Christmas dinners at more than 10 per cent over inflation, there may be an increase in arguments as well . Supermarkets have blamed wet weather and higher demands from suppliers for the rising cost of a traditional turkey dinner. The price of an average 9lb turkey has risen from £51.40 last year to £55, while the average price for a pack of six mince pies has risen from £1.17 to £1.43. The difference was even more pronounced at Sainsbury’s where a pack was £1 in 2011 but £1.65 this year. The survey also found that the price of vegetables has shot up this year due to the wet summer. A poor Brussels sprout harvest means prices are expected to rise 42 per cent, while the cost of potatoes has increased by just under a quarter, according to the Sunday Times survey. Expensive bird: The average cost of a turkey has risen with over £3.50 as supermarkets blame wet weather and higher demands for the hefty price tags . Paul Kelly, of the British Poultry Council, said he thought turkey prices would rise by 7 per cent on average. He added: ‘If you really want value, buy a whole turkey. You’ll get nicer meat, nicer stock and a better eating experience, and the butcher won’t have to throw all that meat away.’ Inevitably, the price of presents and cards is also set to rise. Last year, the top Christmas gift on Amazon was the Kindle ebook reader, for £89. However, this year’s updated version, the Kindle Fire, will set shoppers back £129. The average pack of 12 Christmas cards will cost £3 this year, up 25p from last year. But the price of posting them has risen dramatically, with first-class stamps for 80 cards costing £48 – up £11.20 on last year. But it’s not all bad news – the price of a Christmas tree will stay the same, with a 6ft Nordmann fir for about £50. And the Toy Retailers Association’s ‘Dream List’ of the most popular toys has seen an average price drop of 3p on the price of last year’s. This year Furby, the furry electronic owl, and InnoTab 2, a tablet computer for children, are expected to top the list. Since publication of this article, we have been informed that this offer did not in fact begin until November 30.","The average price for a 9lb turkey has risen with over £3.50 since last Christmas .

"Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries . Authorities considered Chloe Valentine to be 'at risk' before she was even born, an inquest into the four-year-old's death has heard. By the time she was six-weeks-old, Families SA had received multiple calls about Chloe, including one saying her mother had almost set fire to a mattress on the lounge room floor where the baby was sleeping. Tragically Chloe, from Adelaide, died in January 2012 from injuries sustained over a three-day period in the backyard of a home at Ingle Farm, in the city's northeast. Her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, 22, and her then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in jail after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Chloe through criminal neglect. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Salvation Army employee Katie Lawson said she was Polkinghorne's case worker in 2007 when mother and baby lived in Salvation Army supported accommodation. Ms Lawson said she was contacted by a worried friend of Polkinghorne's who said the then 16-year-old's first comments after Chloe's birth were that she was 'glad it was all over so she could get pissed again'. Ms Lawson also learned from Families SA it had received a notification relating to concerns about the then-pregnant Polkinghorne, leading it to consider the unborn child as being 'at risk'. The Salvation Army worker said she began to have concerns about Polkinghorne, particularly when she asked for food vouchers after having received $1300 in benefits a few days before. 'Ashlee was very good at telling us what we wanted to hear,' she said. Scroll down for video . Chloe died at the hands of her parents in Adelaide in January 2012 . She was repeatedly forced to crash the motorbike over a three-day period . The four-year-old suffered massive head injuries and her mum and partner were later jailed for neglect . The godmother of four-year-old girl, who was surrounded by drugs and squalor and forced to ride a 50kg motorbike despite repeatedly crashing it, gave up on reporting her chronic neglect to authorities in the months prior to the girl's death, the inquest heard. Chloe's godmother, Krystal Lee Benyk, said she contacted Family SA's child abuse report line on multiple occasions with complaints about Chloe's living arrangements, but it seemed to make no difference as the young girl was never removed from her mother. Eventually Ms Benyk gave up reporting Chloe's neglect, despite believing she was being abused by Polkinghorne's partner in the months leading up to her death. 'Four-and-a-half years of reporting did nothing,' Ms Benyk said. 'You lose all faith in the system.' Ms Benyk,wept as she told the inquest on Tuesday that her god-daughter was adamant that she hated her mother and would become highly distressed when she had to return home from visits. Ms Benyk who cared for Chloe for periods of up to five weeks, believed her drug-using mother, Polkinghorne, was incapable of looking after her. Polkinghorne and McPartland waited more than eight hours before calling an ambulance after Chloe eventually became unconscious. Ms Benyk said Chloe stayed with her overnight from an early age but some visits lasted for weeks because Polkinghorne would disappear and ignore phone calls. Polkinghorne invited visitors to do 'whatever they wanted' at her house because there was no parental supervision. 'Ashlee didn't care about herself,' Ms Benyk said. 'She didn't care about putting herself in danger and she wouldn't care about putting Chloe in danger.' On one occasion when Polkinghorne handed 15-month-old Chloe over for a visit, Ms Benyk noticed the girl was lethargic and that her milk had curdled in the heat. She later took Chloe to hospital after she vomited repeatedly but Polkinghorne did not respond to phone calls until the early hours of the morning. Polkinghorne said she could not come to the hospital because she was 'off her face' on drugs. Chloe's grandmother, Belinda Valentine, has pleaded for changes within Families SA, calling for specialised staff training to prevent such deaths. Drug user Ashley Polkinghorne was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter for the criminal neglect after the death of her daughter . Polkinghorne said Chloe had not cried 'as she had got used to violent incidents' Polkinghorne's partner Benjamin McPartland was also jailed for criminal neglect . Families SA received 20 notifications of Chloe's dreadful circumstances during her short life, with reports of rats in one squalid residence; old nappies, rotting food and bugs in another; drug use and violence in Chloe's presence; and human faeces smeared on a bathroom wall. But despite Chloe's dreadful circumstances, she was never removed from her drug-using mother. The inquest was told, Chloe's short life was marred by chronic neglect. On Monday, counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, gave an overview of the case at the start of the inquest into the death of Chloe in January 2012. 'The pain she must have endured in the last few hours of her short life is difficult to comprehend,' said Ms Kereru. She outlined the extensive involvement of Families SA, dating back to when Polkinghorne became pregnant at 15, and its responses to numerous neglect notifications from family, friends and other agencies. 'Miss Polkinghorne claimed she was a better mother when she took amphetamines, as she would pick up Chloe and feed her and change her nappy ... as opposed to when she was drunk, when she would prop Chloe's bottle up to her mouth and leave it there,' Ms Kereru said. Polkinghorne was reported as having told her crying daughter: 'shut up you bitch', and having her child in her arms when a partner punched Polkinghorne twice. When questioned about this, Polkinghorne said Chloe had not cried 'as she had got used to violent incidents'. Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . She was often visited by Families SA workers, but usually on scheduled dates when they found Chloe's living conditions acceptable. One friend who contacted Families SA about her concerns, said: 'This is one that will slip through the cracks, Ms Polkinghorne can be a very convincing liar'. A conversation was also recorded with Polkinghorne which was passed on to Families SA. Police advised they found Chloe in the care of a 15-year-old who was drinking in a park on a cold night and on another occasion at a shopping centre, while Polkinghorne was in a nearby liquor shop. Belinda Valentine told The Advertiser the inquest which started today should not turn into a 'witch hunt'. She said: 'We can't change what happened to Chloe but, as a society, we have to learn from the tragedy of her death to prevent more children being damaged.' The coroner will hear evidence from numerous witnesses, including those who notified Families SA and the organisation's workers.","Godmother of Chloe Valentine from Adelaide gave up reporting neglect by her parents .

"Ordinary homeowners will be end up being ‘clobbered’ by Labour’s mansion tax, George Osborne claimed yesterday. The Chancellor dismissed Opposition claims that the annual levy would apply only to homes worth £2million or more, insisting it would end up being charged at far lower property valuations. Ed Balls gave further details about who will be hit by the charge yesterday, saying it would be staggered so that the owners of the most valuable properties are hardest hit. Scroll down for video . Clash: Ed Balls and George Osborne fought it out over Labour's mansion tax on the Andrew Marr show . The Shadow Chancellor put forward bands of £2million, £3million, £10million and £50million with charges increasing progressively the higher the band. This suggests that those in the most expensive houses will be hit with bills for tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. Earlier this month Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, was forced to defend the tax from a savage attack from the singer Myleene Klass. She confronted him on a TV show, complaining that the levy would hit ‘grannies’ who had little income and pointing out that £2million would not pay for much in some parts of London. War of words: Mr Osborne was faced with claims the money was needed to save the NHS . Mr Balls insisted that safeguards would be put in place to exempt asset rich, cash poor homeowners, such as low-income pensioners who bought homes that have increased dramatically in value. The proposed £2million threshold will be raised in line with high end property prices. The Liberal Democrats have long been in favour of a similar form of mansion tax, and the policy is expected to be introduced quickly if there is a Lib-Lab coalition after May’s general election. Mr Balls told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme yesterday: ‘People with houses of £50million or £10million can afford to pay a bit more, and they are going to under the next Labour government. ‘The vast majority of properties in London and across the country will not pay. But don’t you think it is fair, especially when so many foreign investors are investing in our housing market, and when you have much lower tax rates on highest value properties than other houses? ‘We need some money to save the National Health Service – that’s what we are going to deliver. Most people think it is fair, whatever Myleene Klass thinks. ‘We are going to graduate it, it is going to be a progressive tax ... over £3million, over £10million, over £50million it will more than proportionally increase. ‘It will be progressive so it is going to be steered, staged and tiered but it will be fair. ‘Nobody watching your programme with a house worth less than £2million will pay. ‘Most people think a tax on properties above £2million is fair to save the National Health Service.’ The Chancellor said: ‘It’s not a mansion tax. It’s a tax on people’s homes. And of course they come on this show and tell you it’s for people with houses worth £10million or £50million. ‘Once Labour introduce a homes tax, it will be people with homes worth a fraction of that who will be clobbered with it.’","Ed Balls insists proposed tax would only hit homes worth £2m or more .
Labour say it will be strictly banded for £2m, £3m, £10m and £50m homes .
But Osborne claims it would end up on homes 'worth a fraction of that'"

"Prince Harry has been spotted smoking from a shisha pipe onboard a yacht in Abu Dhabi. The photograph shows the 30-year-old royal trying the flavoured tobacco on the boat, which was docked in the United Arab Emirates city’s marina for the Mahiki F1 Yacht Party. Harry was pictured dressed casually with seven others as he smoked the hookah - which is legal - after watching Lewis Hamilton win his second Formula One World Championship. World Health Organisation research into hookah pipes shows that the average  session lasts around an hour - and in that time the smoker can inhale the same amount of smoke as from 100 cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Boat party: Prince Harry, 30, was spotted smoking from a shisha pipe onboard a yacht in Abu Dhabi after he watched Lewis Hamilton win the Formula One World Championship . The image - released by London agency Clickstarpics and first published by Los Angeles website TMZ - comes after Harry became the first to congratulate Hamilton on his win over the in-car radio. He told him: ‘Lewis, thank you very much for not making the British public sweat. You are a legend.’ Last week a study found how fumes from the water pipes of hookahs - used to smoke flavoured tobacco - contain the toxin benzene, which has been linked to an increased risk for leukaemia. Researchers have warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookahs. The British Heart Foundation says: 'Some people mistakenly think that shisha smoking is not addictive because the water used in the pipe can absorb nicotine. In reality, because only some of the nicotine is absorbed by the water, shisha smokers are still exposed to enough nicotine to cause an addiction'. The fourth in line to the throne, who last week enjoyed a successful three-day mini tour of Arabia - including raising almost £1 million at a charity polo match - spent last weekend enjoying himself. United Arab Emirates city: The boat was docked in Abu Dhabi Marina (pictured) for the Mahiki F1 Yacht Party . With the great, the good and the fabulously wealthy flocking into the UAE, Harry was in his element, drinking and dancing into the early hours as well as posing for pictures with scores of admirers. Social media such as Twitter and Instagram were awash with pictures of the partying prince earlier this week. One showed him cuddled up to a group of exotic young women, comically grimacing. Another video showed the royal, his white shirt unbuttoned a straw hat perched on his head, launching into a wild dance on the deck of a super yacht. One user posted a picture saying: 'Can't believe I just seen Prince Harry twerking and I didn't record it. Oh my god, can't believe it. What a guy!' If the scenes reminded onlookers of his infamous jaunt to Las Vegas in 2012,  then there was even more reason. Royal: Harry was pictured last weekend at the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit . For both then and now, he was accompanied by one of his 'partying partners in crime', Adam Bidwell, an ex-London Welsh rugby playing stockbroker and former boyfriend of singer Katherine Jenkins. Hookahs are water pipes used to smoke tobacco flavours such as apple, mint and cherry - and smoking is often done in groups, with the same mouthpiece passed between people. While their use began centuries ago in ancient Persia and India, hookahs are gaining popularity in cafés around the world - including in Britain, the Middle East and the US. In one hookah session - lasting from 20 to 80 minutes - you can inhale the same amount of smoke as a cigarette smoker using more than 100 cigarettes, according to a World Health Organization study. He was also accompanied by the same Scotland Yard police protection officer who was pictured next to Harry in a jacuzzi at a pool party in the City of Sin. Also in the official group staying in Abu Dhabi over the weekend was Harry's private secretary, Edward Lane-Fox, and a member of the Kensington Palace press office - although there is no suggestion either of them were on the yacht. Other pictures to emerge from the weekend show Harry posing with a rapper and socialising at what is described in the Abu Dhabi social pages as the most 'star-studded destination' of the Grand Prix, Amber Lounge. Harry stayed on to watch the Grand Prix privately after his official duties had concluded. His cousin, Princess Beatrice, and uncle, Prince Andrew, also showed up in Abu Dhabi over the weekend. The release of the image comes two years after Prince Harry's infamous wild night in Las Vegas in August 2012, when he was pictured naked in a hotel room during a game of 'strip billiards'. A palace spokesman for Harry declined to immediately comment when contacted by MailOnline.","Photograph shows Prince Harry, 30, trying flavoured tobacco on boat .

"Sleeping pills taken by celebrities including Lindsay Lohan and Tiger Woods – and prescribed widely in Britain – could be to blame for numerous cases of dangerous and even criminal behaviour. Zolpidem, which is handed out to 750,000 NHS patients seeking treatment for insomnia each year, has been found to be a factor in dozens of instances of people breaking the law while sleeping. They include 43 instances of driving, nine rapes, eight assaults, ten murders or manslaughters, and burglaries – all of which were claimed to have been carried out while the perpetrator was apparently asleep. In most cases they also had no memory of the event. Scroll down for video . Sleeping pills taken by celebrities including Lindsay Lohan (left) and Tiger Woods could be to blame for numerous cases of dangerous and even criminal behaviour . Neurologist Professor Mark Mahowald, of Sleep Forensic Associates, a US-based organisation of doctors who help those who break the law while still asleep, says: ‘It appears that one part of the brain responsible for complex activities, like driving or cooking, is awake, while another, involved in memory, is not. ‘In sleep-driving for example, people take the drug, go to bed, and then wake up in the car with their pyjamas on. When the police pull them over, they do not know how they got there.’ Prof Mahowald, of the University of Minnesota Medical School, adds: ‘One of the difficulties in advising people about taking the drug is that it is effective and there does not seem to be any way of identifying people at risk of these uncommon side effects.’ Some 82 medication-related cases worked on since 2006 involved ‘toxicity’ due to Zolpidem. In 79 of the cases the defence was successful. Zolpidem – also known by its American brand name Ambien – works by dampening the electrical activity of the brain. Troubled actress Lohan has admitted to problems while taking Ambien. Initially marketed two decades ago as a safer alternative to older, more addictive benzodiazepine drugs, including Valium, in recent years Zolpidem, along with similar so-called Z-drugs such as zopiclone, have been linked to a raised risk of dementia and heart problems. Numerous studies have reported rare instances of patients driving, eating, making telephone calls and even having sex while under the influence of the medication. Some experts even recommend that patients secure their bedroom windows and get into bed before taking the drug, to reduce any possibility of harm. Police have found at least 43 people driving while asleep after taking sleeping pill Zolpidem (file picture) One report, by doctors at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, claimed that up to one per cent of patients had a sleep-eating problem after taking the sedative. The only clues to their nocturnal feasting were morning leftovers and crumbs in the bed. Patients being prescribed Zolpidem are already warned that changes in sleep behaviour, including sleepwalking, are a possible side effect, but this is the first time data on criminal behaviour linked to the drug has been comprehensively collected. New US research shows that the drug is implicated in one in ten emergency department cases due to psychiatric drugs. In over-65s, it accounted for 21 per cent of cases. One theory is that the events actually occur while people are waking from deep sleep. Although prescribing guidelines state Zolpidem should be used only in the short term, with an initial two-week course recommended, a recent study by herbal sleep aid company Sleepio found that up to 42 per cent of patients on sleeping pills had been taking them for more than a decade, and a quarter for between three and five years. And, according to the Economic and Social Research Council, one in ten of us now regularly takes some form of sleeping tablet. Zolpidem – also known by its American brand name Ambien – works by dampening the electrical activity of the brain . Dr Guy Leschziner, consultant neurologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in London, says: ‘These drugs tend to be habit-forming and can have unintended consequences such as these unwanted behaviours.’ Mild and fleeting, so-called confusional arousals, such as waking up in a hotel room with no idea where you are, are common, especially in people who are over-tired. Some researchers say the events seen in users of the drug occur during these arousals, and point out that no drug has ever been shown in laboratory studies to cause sleepwalking, a phenomenon that happens when the cortex is asleep but areas of the brain concerned with movement are active. Dr Leschziner adds: ‘This sedative may, at least in some people, uncover an underlying predisposition to these sleep disorders, like sleepwalking. ‘During these events, parts of the brain appear to remain asleep while other parts responsible for complex behaviours are awake.’","Sleeping pills could be to blame for dangerous and criminal behaviour .

"Cinema goers are guaranteed an eyeful after censors passed the film version of raunchy best-seller Fifty Shades of Grey without any cuts. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) have unsurprisingly made Sam Taylor-Johnson's take on E L James's 'mummy porn' an 18 certificate, but said the work 'passed uncut'. The film, which is described as showing 'strong sex and nudity,' as well as 'the portrayal of erotic role play', stars Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his lover Anastasia Steele. Scroll down for video . Fifty Shades Of Grey is expected to be one of the biggest films of 2015. It is set to be released in just two weeks and The British Board of Film Classification has just passed the movie without any cuts to the sex scenes. Dakota Johnson (pictured) plays Christian Grey's lover Anastasia Steele in the film, which is based on the trilogy by E L James . The movie has been widely anticipated - EL James has reportedly sold over 100 million copies of her Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy worldwide and it has been translated into more than 50 languages . In order to stay loyal to the story, Sam Taylor-Johnson did extensive research into the world of BDSM before filming started. She recently revealed that she consulted a professional dominatrix for the film, which is more than two hours long, and said she 'learned a lot' from her. She told The Independent: 'The sex scenes are pretty intense, so I'm sure people are going to feel aroused - but I've seen them so many times that I tend to forget.' It was recently revealed that Fifty Shades is set to be the raunchiest blockbuster film in over a decade, with 20 minutes of sex in it's 100 minutes running time. The film - which features Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey - is said to be the raunchiest movie in a decade with 20 minutes of sex scenes . Jamie has spoken out about his awkwardness in making some parts of the film, saying he was doing things he would not want to do to a woman . The film, which opens on Valentine's Day, has a dozen sex scenes although Taylor-Johson said she determined not to make the whole thing about it. She said: 'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said. 'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different.' Sam Taylor-Wood has revealed that she did not want the film to be sexually explicit and says she knows that may be disappointing to some people . But even though there is a large amount of sex in the movie, she shied away from covering some of the more graphic parts of the book. Sam told The Guardian: 'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people.' 'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' Jamie Dornan recently revealed to Glamour magazine that he had found some of the scenes difficult to shoot. He said: 'There were times when Dakota was not wearing much, and I had to do stuff to her that I'd never choose to do to a woman.' And Dakota admitted that Jamie would be the first person to cover her up, telling the magazine: 'It's stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene. 'But then they call cut, and you're still tied to the bed, naked. Jamie would be the first one to throw a blanket over me.' The movie is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, with the trailer having already been watched a massive 45million times on Youtube.","Fifty Shades Of Grey was made '18' by British Board of Film Classification .

"A dozen of the United States Air Force’s most feared attack aircraft are to be deployed in the battle against ISIS. Twelve A-10 ‘Warthogs’ are being moved from Afghanistan to Kuwait to carry out patrols against the Islamic State militants who have taken swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory. The new deployment will boost the USAF’s ability to patrol the skies and take out ISIS targets. Deadly force: A line up of A-10s at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. Planes of this type will arrive in Kuwait for combat operations next week . Slow and steady: An unarmed A-10 shows the maneuverability which makes it a deadly foe to ground forces. It can fly steadily at slow speed at just 50 feet above enemy positions and is heavily armored against gunfire . In action: An A-10 above Afghanistan, where it has been used with deadly effect against the Taliban. As well as its 30mm cannon which can be seen on the nose, it is carrying missiles under the inner wing . Close support: A-10s work closely with ground troops including, here, US Special Forces units in Afghanistan . They will be joined within weeks by around six Reaper drones armed with missiles, the New York Times reported. The new weaponry marks an increase in the options open to military planners who have struggled to strike ISIS. A-10s, originally designed to destroy Soviet tank squadrons if the USSR had invaded the West, have proved a deadly weapon against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Slow-moving and equipped with a devastating 30mm cannon capable of firing almost 4,000 rounds a minute - as well as missiles and 500lb bombs -  they can fly as low as 50ft and engage targets far more slowly than the bombers and fighter-bombers which have so far been deployed in Iraq and Syria. The decision to deploy A-10s and Reapers comes after a major battle-planning conference involving more than 200 commanders from 33 countries involved in the fight against ISIS. America remains by far the largest single country involved, but has now received backing from more Muslim countries. Morocco is to send F-16s to attack the militants under the US-led operation. However the main concern over the campaign has been the lack of targets to strike because of the nature of ISIS, which combines large groups acting like a conventional army, with insurgency tactics. Unmanned: A Reaper preparing for take-off. Some of its missile load can be seen under the left wing . Remote control: Pilots at Hollman Air Force Base in New Mexico at the controls of a Reaper during a training mission. The Iraq and Syria missions against ISIS will be flown from Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina . Target: ISIS fighters will be firmly in the sights of A-10 pilots. The light weaponry they carry is unable to damage an A-10, while it can hit them with 4,000 30mm rounds in just a minute. Takeover: The ISIS threat to Iraq and Syria was demonstrated when the militant group took control of the Syrian town of Raqqa. It has mounted shows of strength in the town and beyond . Frontline: These ISIS fighters near Aleppo are typical of the targets for the A-10. Lightly armed and on the move, they are difficult for bombers and strike fighters to target but can be stalked from the air by the A-10s, which loiter over targets for hours . It is the ugliest aircraft in the Air Force's arsenal. The A-10 was designed to destroy Soviet tanks and troops on the ground. Officially the Thunderbolt II, it was quickly nicknamed the Warthog for its unusual looks, . It was specifically designed around its main weapon, a 30mm cannon which fires 4,000 rounds a minute. The plane can fly low and slow, coming down to 50ft to shoot at or drop bombs on enemy positions. Its top speed is just above 400mph but it can go as slow as 150mph and 'loiter' for hours above targets making it an effective deterrent as well as an attack plane. The Warthog is covered in 1,200lbs of titanium armor, making it invulnerable to attack from anything but heavy weapons. Even when hit it is designed to fly home on one engine, with no tailfin and half a wing missing. On board the single-seater the pilot has at his controls the cannon, which is accurate to 4,000ft, and fires depleted-uranium shells, as well as Maverick air-to-surface missiles, 500lb free fall bombs, and Hydra air-launched rockets. Despite USAF attempts to retire the fleet, it is expected to remain in service into the 2020s. At one stage when the Air Force suggested retiring its more than 300 A-10s the Army indicated it would take them over as soldiers are so keen on its close support capabilities. Figures published in the New York Times show that just one in four missions over the last three months actually involves dropping bombs or firing missiles. Three-quarters of planes return to base without having deployed their armament. Planners are concentrating on what they have called ‘pop-up targets’ - convoys of ISIS fighters, or individual leaders – which are targeted as soon as they are identified by analysts. The deployment of A-10s and Reapers will increase the ability to take on such targets. Both can circle slowly above target areas for hours at a time. In the case of A-10s they can swoop as low as 50ft and maintain a presence above enemy positions at low speed. They are also heavily armoured against small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades and designed to keep flying while under fire. In Afghanistan they have successfully targeted Taliban positions just yards from American patrols and are admired by the Army as a psychological weapon which keeps the Taliban at bay. But much of the success – or failure – of the mission against ISIS depends on the instructions pilots at the controls of the A-10s will receive. Such is the concern that the operation avoid civilian casualties which would hand ISIS a propaganda victory that the list of targets is approved by the head of Central Command, General Lloyd Austin. It is based on information from spy satellites, U-2 spy aircraft flying at 70,000 feet above the Middle East, and intelligence from the ground, where special forces are believed to be working, as well as the CIA. One of his officers admitted in the New York Times that the operation was fraught with difficulties. Major Sonny Alberdeston told the newspaper’s Eric Schmitt: ‘When we target a nation-state, we’ve typically been looking at their capability for decades and have extensive target sets. ‘But these guys are moving around. They can be in place, and then a week later, they’re gone.’ ISIS has now been under attack from the air for almost three months but continues to pump out propaganda and have control of territory in Iraq and Syria. President Obama has been facing calls for more radical action against them, with Republican Senator Rand Paul earlier this month arguing in favour of limited ‘boots on the ground’ to go after its leadership.","A dozen A-10s are being moved from Afghanistan to Kuwait by next week to start patrols over Iraq and Syria .

"The biological family of US aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded by ISIS militants have claimed they were let down by the FBI who did not tell them he was missing or support them. Last week Kassig's parents revealed on Twitter he has been adopted as a newborn and thanked  his birthmother, Rhonda Schwindt, that she chose them to be his parents. But now Rhonda says the FBI has not supported her and her two children because they do not meet the agency's legal definition of next of kin. Scroll down for videos .

She says the FBI kept his captivity a secret from them for nearly six months, but provided support to his parents, reports the Indianapolis Star. Rhonda also says they were denied federal assistance in finding grief counseling and told by the FBI to keep quiet even after his parents and friends were encouraged to speak up in an unsuccessful attempt to save him. Rhonda, who is now married and lives in Indianapolis, was 25 when she gave Kassig up for adoption because she did not feel equipped to become a single mother. She picked Ed and Paula to his parents - they met all her criteria, although she had wanted Kassig to have siblings. Jana Schwindt with her brother who wrote to her when he was in captivity. But Jana does not have an exact copy of the letter - they were told by the FBI, the original was processed as evidence and destroyed . In 2006, when was 17, Kassig went to visit Schwindt and meet his siblings, 12-year-old Jana and hugged 10-year-old Sam and their relationship continued from there . The couple kept her updated with his life and when he was six, he wrote a letter to her thanking her for letting him be adopted. In 2006, when was 17, Kassig went to visit Rhonda and meet his siblings, 12-year-old Jana and hugged 10-year-old Sam and their relationship continued from there. Even though they only got to spend eight short years together, the three siblings reportedly developed a very close bond. In 2007, when Kassig returned from Iraq following a four-month deployment, the Schwindt's said that they noticed he has changed and he seemed  angry and they were forced to pull back from him several times. Although Jana always got back in contact with him, 18-year-old Sam,who is currently a freshman at DePaul University in Chicago, only built a relationship with him when Kassig returned to the Middle East in 2012. 'I added him on Facebook and I was like, 'what the hell is going on Peter? We're brothers. We need to fix this.'' Sam said. Just days before Kassig was captured, he was supposed to have a video chat with Sam, his 'Little Bro,' but the teenager had to cancel because he had made plans with friends - a decision he regrets to this day.

Grateful: Ed and Paula Kassig, pictured  during a press conference, thanked Peter's birth mother for choosing them to raise her son as their own . But then Kassig's Facebook went and the family did not hear from him. The 26-year-old former US Army Ranger was taken captive while on a humanitarian mission to Syria in October 2013. 'Sam spent five and a half months desperately seeking his brother when Peter went dark -desperately seeking,' said Rhonda. She does not blame the Kassigs for keeping the secret at the government's insistence, but says the FBI is at fault. Eventually Sam wrote to the Kassigs and they found out. Mother's anguish: Rhonda Schwindt posted this message on Facebook less than a week before her son's execution . Touching moment: After Kassig's murder, his younger brother, Sam Schwindt, shared online this old photo of himself as a boy with Peter dressed in his US Army Rangers uniform . Kassig sent Jana a letter while being held hostage by ISIS - only one of two  he was able to write. But Jana does not  have an exact copy of the letter - they were told by the FBI, the original was processed as evidence and destroyed. In the letter he wrote: 'You are the best thing that has ever happened to me; you and your brother.' On November 16, ISIS released a graphic video showing that Kassig, who had converted to Islam while in captivity, had been beheaded. On November 11, less than a week before the release of the gruesome ISIS video, showing that Kassig, who had converted to Islam while in captivity, had been beheaded. Rhonda wrote on her Facebook wall: 'I want my son Peter home safely.' She says the FBI did tell them family of his death. Correspondence: Jana, pictured with her mother on Graduation Day, was closet to Kassig . Sam Schwindt, 18, is a freshman at DePaul University. His 20-year-old sister, Jana, works as a kennel attendant at the Indianapolis Humane Society . Rhonda says she had several meetings with the FBI, in which she asked for help finding a therapist who specialized in traumatic grief, but she said the government refused. 'I was like, 'Peter has three blood relatives, and they're sitting right in front of you,'' she said. 'And the people in his darkest moments, who did he think about? His father. And his mother. And he thought about his brother and sister. The siblings are both now in therapy. Last week Sam posted an old photo of himself as a young boy standing next to his big brother in his US Army Rangers uniform in front a monument engraved with 'Ranger Creed.' A day after the ISIS video recording was made public online, Sam shared a moving tribute to Kassig on his Facebook page. Believer: Peter Kassig, shown here working in Syria, converted to Islam while in captivity and took the given name Abdul-Rahman . 'It's incredibly strange to lose someone you love,' he wrote. 'It just does not seem real. It always seems like in life that there will be more time, but you really can never know. 'Just please, for me, if you're not talking to someone you love, send them a message and reconnect. You never know when you may lose someone. I will always love you, Peter.' Much like her big brother, Jana Schwindt, 20, has dedicated her life to humanitarian work. Since August of this year, she has been working as a kennel attendant at the Indianapolis Humane Society. The FBI issued a brief statement to the Indianapolis Star: 'The law and the Attorney General Guidelines permit and/or encourage inclusion with regard to providing victim services, but due to privacy considerations, the FBI is not in a position to comment on any specific services offered or provided to victim or victim families.'","Peter Kassig's parents revealed on Twitter he was adopted as a newborn .

"‘I’d always ask people to repeat themselves. I felt like a stuck record,' said Jackie Hunt . Jackie Hunt had struggled with her hearing for 15 years before she realised she had a genuine problem. ‘Everything sounded muddy, as if through a door — but I assumed it was hay fever blocking my ears,’ says the 44-year-old administrator from Sutton Coldfield. However, over the years it gradually got worse. Jackie had to turn up the TV volume louder and louder, and could understand people only if she could see their mouths. ‘I’d always ask people to repeat themselves. I felt like a stuck record,’ she says. But it was only when, in 2012, she saw an advert about hearing tests that she decided to take action. The results floored her. She had lost 60 per cent of her hearing and needed two hearing aids. The difference they made, is, she says, ‘amazing’. ‘As I walked into our kitchen I asked what the ticking noise was — it was a huge clock that I’d never realised made a sound,’ says Jackie, who is married to Dave, 52, the director of a building company, and has two daughters, aged 23 and 20. ‘I’d stopped working in a big office — now I have the confidence to do it again. 'And I use the train — previously, talking through a ticket office window was a no-no.’ More than ten million Britons — one in six — are thought to have some hearing loss, yet many wait years before seeking help. There are two main types. Conductive hearing loss occurs when sounds cannot pass from the outer ear to the inner ear. Causes include a blockage, fluid build-up, or a problem with the small bones inside the ear that help you hear. Jackie has conductive loss, diagnosed by a specialist after she’d had a standard test at a branch of Hidden Hearing, a hearing aid chain. Hers is caused by otosclerosis — an abnormal, often genetic, growth of bone in  the middle ear, affecting 1 to 2 per cent of people. The second type is sensorineural hearing loss caused by damage to tiny hair cells inside the cochlea, the spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear, or to the auditory nerve. Hearing relies on sound waves entering the ear and causing the eardrum to vibrate. Jackie needed two hearing aids. The difference they made, is, she says, ‘amazing’ The vibrations are passed to the inner ear, where the hair cells move in response and send a signal through the auditory nerve to the brain. These hair cells can be damaged by injury or noise exposure, but it also happens naturally with age. More than half of people over 60 have some hearing loss, and campaigners are pushing for everyone over 65 to have their hearing screened on the NHS. But some experts say we should be having hearing tests even earlier. David McAlpine, professor of auditory neuroscience and director of the University College London Ear Institute, says: ‘We start losing our hearing as babies, but don’t notice it. 'But by their mid-40s most people will have some hearing loss that affects their day-to-day life.’ Generally, we lose our ability to hear higher frequencies first. This can make deciphering speech difficult because consonants that help make words distinct are in the high frequencies, around 3-5kHz. Standard hearing tests, or audiograms — which measure your hearing by playing sounds at different volumes and pitches and ask you to respond by pressing a button — test up to 8kHz. Professor McAlpine would advise anyone over 45 to get their hearing checked — for example, at a High Street optician that offers a free hearing test — even if they don’t think they have a problem, as people don’t always realise what they should be able to hear. This is because not seeking help when you need it can make things worse: hearing loss cannot only cause social isolation and depression, but there are concerns that it could lead to cognitive problems. In 2011, U.S. researchers found older people with hearing loss are more likely to develop dementia, perhaps because a common brain pathway underlies both conditions. Another theory is the strain of trying to decode sounds can overwhelm the brain, leaving people more vulnerable to dementia. Research is continuing about whether hearing aids can reduce the risk. Studies suggest that for every 25 decibels of hearing loss (decibels relate to volume of sound — normal speech is around 60) a person experiences, they age cognitively by seven years — so a 59-year-old who has lost 25 decibels will perform like a 66-year-old in mental tasks. Professor McAlpine says: ‘Not hearing properly can add to what’s known as your cognitive load. ‘I’d stopped working in a big office — now I have the confidence to do it again. And I use the train — previously, talking through a ticket office window was a no-no,' said Jackie . 'The more cost you put to your brain while straining to hear someone speak, the fewer resources you have to do something else at the same time.’ And parts of the brain involved with hearing can start to shut down without enough input — so your hearing may get worse if you delay treatment. ‘It can take three months for your brain to tune in to a hearing aid, especially if you’ve had the problem for a long time.’ He also warns that even top-ofthe- range versions have limitations. ‘Hearing aids will help, rather than cor rect , your hear ing, ’ he says. ‘So you should be given proper expectations of what they can do — they amplify sounds but won’t necessarily discriminate between them.’ But there’s another complicating factor to be aware of. According to Professor McAlpine, younger people’s hearing loss may occur for a different reason from older people’s — and it’s one that’s hard for specialists to detect. ‘We’ve identified a problem called “hidden hearing loss” — so called because it’s not picked up by traditional hearing tests,’ he says. More than ten million Britons — one in six — are thought to have some hearing loss . While extremely loud noises — such as a chainsaw — can permanently kill off hair cells, it is thought that in hidden hearing loss, the damage affects the nerve cells in the cochlea. Rather than dying off, they lose their connections with the hair cells, so cannot send information to the brain. It’s possible the culprit need only be moderate noise, such as that of a busy street, although more research is needed into how much exposure would cause this. One type of nerve cell particularly affected is the kind that only responds to sounds above a certain volume. This means as this nerve cell is damaged, so is our ability to distinguish particular sounds against loud noises. Professor McAlpine adds: ‘An audiogram only measures your ability to hear distinct tones against a backdrop of silence. 'So you may get a clean bill of health but still have hearing deficit.’ There are currently no accurate ways to diagnose this problem, and researchers are looking at whether hearing aids can even help. Ralph Home, head of biomedical research at the charity Action on Hearing Loss, says: ‘We know there are lots of people with good hearing who struggle to follow conversation in background noise, but it’s not yet clear if they all have hidden hearing loss or something else, such as problems with cognitive processing.’ What does seem clear is that many people with hearing loss delay seeking help — by an average of ten years, reckons the charity Ear Foundation. Reasons include not realising they have a problem to the social stigma surrounding hearing aids. It’s a stigma that Daniela Levy, 30, has grappled with. The health and fitness journalist, from Essex, shrugged off her poor hearing at first — but it became harder to ignore when it started affecting her work. ‘In my 20s I started TV presenting, but couldn’t cope with the producers talking into my earpiece. 'I stopped doing that type of presenting because I relied on lip-reading a lot.’ Daniela admits the only hearing test she’s had as an adult was when she was 24, at a High Street optician’s offering hearing tests. ‘They confirmed my hearing was well below what it should be and that I’d need a hearing aid. But I never went back.’ She adds: ‘When I meet someone new I joke about being deaf. But it’s embarrassing. 'It’s deteriorated recently and I’m worried that when I’m 40 I won’t be able to hear at all.’ earfoundation.org.uk, hearinglink.org, actiononhearingloss.org.uk .","Jackie Hunt, 44, lost 60 per cent of her hearing .

"The average earnings of many immigrants from outside Europe have  overtaken those of people born in Britain. Research shows that among couples or adults without children, those from beyond Europe’s borders are enjoying the higher standard of living. Among families with children, migrant incomes still lag behind those of the British-born – although only slightly. Romanians outside the British Embassy in Bucharest seeking a visa which will give them entry to the UK . The findings come in the wake of the calculation by advisers to Home Secretary Theresa May that migration has had a serious impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The Migration Advisory Committee said that 160,000 jobs of British-born workers were ‘displaced’ because of immigration between 1995 and 2010. The figures showing the economic success of immigrants were gathered by the Office for National Statistics in its large-scale Labour Force Survey. However, the ONS has chosen not to analyse the information or to publish it. Instead, the material was made available to the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat, which used it to prepare an analysis of the economic  performance of immigrants across the EU. Many of the migrants who come into Britain and live without children are highly qualified and command high salaries, for example American bankers recruited to work in the City. But the majority of the 300,000 people a year from outside Europe who come here are from countries which are poorer. The largest provider of migrants to Britain from outside Europe remains India. The EU breakdown of incomes is calculated not in pounds sterling but in ‘purchasing power parities’, units used to even out the effects of the different costs of living in different countries. It said that in 2008, a British-born person in the UK living in a house with two or more adults but no children could expect a median disposable income of 25,647ppp, while someone born abroad in a country outside the EU living in a similar home could expect to earn 26,267ppp. Warning: Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch UK . For a couple with children, income for each British-born adult in a home would be 19,530ppp, against 18,296 for those born abroad. In the case of families with children, those born in the EU were wealthier than those born in the rest of the world. Britain has accepted more than half a million immigrants a year – people from abroad who come to live in this country for more than 12 months – over recent years. Around 300,000 a year come from outside the EU and they fall into the category where Coalition ministers are most anxious to curb immigration. They include large numbers of highly-qualified individuals from Western countries, such as the U.S. and Australia. However, the largest single country outside Europe providing migrants to Britain is India, from which just under 12 per cent of all migrants came in 2010. Sir Andrew Green of the think tank Migrationwatch said the Eurostat findings underlined the conclusions of the Migration Advisory Committee – ‘that most of the benefits of highly-skilled migration go to the migrants themselves’. Economist Ruth Lea of the Arbuthnot Banking Group said: ‘This should end the perception that immigrant labour consists of downtrodden people coming to do jobs for low wages that British people do not want to do. ‘We have people coming from the four corners of the world and there is a lot of variation among them.’ While there is increasing evidence of the prosperity of migrants, and in particular well-qualified migrants, a high proportion of people born in Britain remain mired in worklessness and benefit dependency. ONS figures say that nearly one in five of the country’s households has no adult with a job.",Childless couples from beyond Europe enjoy better standard of living than British .
