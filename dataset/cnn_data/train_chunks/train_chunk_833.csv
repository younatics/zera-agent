"By . Kit Holden . Thomas Muller is an old fashioned footballer. When Muller celebrates, he celebrates like a player from an old black and white VHS. There is no badge kissing, no sliding, no cupping of the ear. He simply throws two arms in the air. When the goal is a special one, he sinks to his knees. On every occasion, there is nothing readable in his face besides joy. No self-adulation, no arrogance, simply the pure joy of having found the back of the net. Invaluable: Muller is happy to play in any attacking position so long as he is scoring goals . Back of the net: Muller celebrates after scoring for Germany against Argentina during the 2010 World Cup . As a footballer, his game is not about speed, it is not about power, and it is not even about rigourously trained technical ability. It is immensely difficult to characterise his strongest attributes, because he is not a modern athlete. He is a bundle of limbs, masquerading as a professional footballer of the 21st century. But Thomas Muller masquerades very well indeed. For Germany and for Bayern Munich, Muller’s versatility is invaluable. He is happy in any position, so long as he is attacking, and believes that 'everything depends on whether you have the right ambition for the position you are in'. It is that which makes him so unpredictable for opponents. He is an efficient creator of space, an efficient passer of the ball, and an efficient goalscorer. Roar talent: Muller lets his emotions show every time he finds the net for his country and Bayern Munich . At the last World Cup in South Africa, he was a ruthlessly efficient goalscorer. Only 20 years old and only one year of regular Bundesliga football to his name, Muller scored five World Cup goals – two of them against England – and claimed the Golden Boot. It is a prize which he intends to defend in Brazil. Not that the trophy itself is particularly important to him. In a recent interview with the Tagesspiegel, he declared that 'if you gave me half a candle for scoring the most goals at a World Cup, I would treasure that as much as the Golden Boot'. That is Muller in a nutshell. Not for him, the personal museum or the statue in his image. He wishes to win everything, but it is the winning that counts, not the medals. In Germany, he is seen as a classic Bavarian farmer boy. Married at the age of 19, and entirely at home in a pair of Lederhosen. So Bavarian is he indeed, that a columnist for the Munich paper TZ described him as a 'cultural export'. On the back of Manchester United’s interest in Muller, the same columnist wrote: 'you can have him, England, but only if we get Prince William and Kate'. 'You can keep the nutters from UKIP', he added. Achievement: Muller was awarded the Golden Boot after scoring five goals at the 2010 World Cup finals . How loyal to Bavaria Muller he really is, is yet to be seen. In recent months, he has voiced his love and commitment to Bayern, but also his displeasure at his less central role under Pep Guardiola. For as much as Muller is grounded and almost old fashioned, it is ambition which drives him on more than anything. You may not find him modelling underwear (though he does do adverts for milk in Germany), but he is always after the next bit of success. 'When I was a kid, I tried a lot of sports', he says, 'but when I wasn’t very good at something, I let it go. I need something where I can set myself goals'. Muller, the Bavarian farm boy, knows his own limits. He will always love his home, he will always love Bayern. But as a footballer, he always needs the next challenge. For now, it is to defend his Golden Boot in Brazil.","Muller claimed the Golden Boot at the 2010 World Cup .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . They may be the most feared group of investigators in the world, but FBI agents still need a hand understanding internet slang like LOL and BRB, it has been revealed. Agents who find themselves baffled by abbreviations on message boards or social media have an extensive guide to turn to, which has been released to the public under Freedom of Information laws. The document - which is 83 pages long - includes 2,800 translations, from everyday terms such as LOL ('laughing out loud') and BRB ('be right back'). Slang: The lengthy guide can teach agents abbreviations such as L8R and BRB . Any crack investigators left scratching their heads at 2DAY or L8R also have them helpfully parsed to 'today' and 'later', according to the document published by Muckrock. But as well as the commonplace and the obvious, it also features lengthier and more exotic examples like PMYMHMMFSWGAD ('Pardon me, you must have mistaken me for someone who gives a damn') or EOTWAWKI ('end of the world as we know it'). Some seem particular appropriate to agents working in counter-intelligences, who may not be surprised to find their targets writing phrases like SIW ('someone is watching') and IKWYL ('I know where you live'). One particularly relevant - and worrying - entry is IITYWIMIWHTKY ('If I tell you what it means I will have to kill you'). A few British-themed acronyms also made the cut, with an entry explaining GSTQ ('God save the Queen') and another making sense of NFN ('normal for Norfolk'). The FBI defines the latter phrase as: 'A derogatory term used by medical doctors in Norfolk and Norwich hospital in UK for intellectually challenged patients. Now may also mean something more endearing – like quaint.' Although it is an official Government document, produced by researchers from within the FBI, the authors remembered to keep a light tone. The foreword to the piece reads: 'The list has about 2,800 entries you should find useful in your work - or for keeping up with your children and/or grandchildren.' BFFLTDDUP – Best friends for life till death do us part . BMGWL – Busting my gut with laughter . ICBINB – I can’t believe it’s not butter . IGP – I gotta pee . IITYWIMIWHTKY – If I tell you what it means I will have to kill you . IOKIYAR – It’s OK if you’re a Republican . KTBSPA – Keep the backstreet pride alive . NIFOC – Naked in front of computer .

"By . Simon Jones . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger's job as a World Cup pundit gives him plenty of opportunity to check out his top transfer targets. Working for French television as a commentator, the Gunners boss is also in the enviable position of being able to scout for reinforcements for the next Premier League season. Here are five players he could be keeping an eye on during the tournament. Scouting mission: Arsene Wenger is able to keep an eye on his top club targets . Outstanding: Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina . Top stopper: David Ospina currently plays for French side Nice . DAVID OSPINA . Colombia goalkeeper plays for Nice in France and would represent a relative bargain compared to other targets David Marshall of Cardiff, John Ruddy of Norwich and Pepe Reina at Liverpool but lack of Premier League experience may count against him. Chance of signing: 2/5 . Wing wizard: Antoine Griezmann in action in France's opening World Cup fixture . Real Sociedad star: Antoine Griezmann battles for the ball in La Liga match . ANTOINE GRIEZMANN . Excellent winger was recommended by Damien Comolli and well liked at Liverpool but more ominously Real Madrid. Arsenal are talking to Real Sociedad about Carlos Vela and right-back Joseba Zaldua but may not be able to compete with Madrid's finances. Chance of signing: 2/5 . Top of Wenger's shopping list: Croatian and Bayern Munich forward Mario Mandzukic, left . Star striker: Mario Mandzukic has scored plenty of goals for Bayern Munich . MARIO MANDZUKIC . Croatia striker is leaving Bayern and they will sell, Arsenal have made a lot of enquiries about him but again there is competition from Manchester United, Chelsea and clubs in Italy and Spain. Mandzukic is keen on Arsenal but would want to play ahead of Giroud. Chance of signing: 3/5 . Top striker: Karim Benzema has been a target of Wenger's for a while and has been in great form for France so far . In action for Real Madrid: French forward Karim Benzema . KARIM BENZEMA . Real Madrid were ready to sell Benzema before the Champions League final but Carlo Ancelotti wants him to stay. The France striker wants a pay rise and that could lead to a stand-off with Madrid hierarchy keen on Luis Suarez. Arsenal see too many complications. Chance of signing: 1/5 . Keen to join Arsenal: Serge Aurier, left, has already spoken of his desire to join the Gunners . On the move?: Serge Aurier fancies a move away from French side Toulouse . SERGE AURIER . Ivory Coast right-back was excellent against Japan, setting up two goals. However, defensive frailties may prevent Arsenal from paying the asking price of £7m.

And after watching her national side thump Portugal in their opening match at the World Cup in Brazil, the German Chancellor looks as chuffed as a 10-year-old fan as she posed with the team in the dressing room. The team's star striker Lukas Podolski even posted a happy selfie with the Germany's leader following the 4-0 drubbing.

"By . Lydia Warren . The three-year-old son of a missing teacher told investigators that he hasn't seen her since her live-in boyfriend 'kicked mommy's butt and made her cry', it has emerged. The boy was interviewed by investigators looking for his mother, 31-year-old Bianca Tanner, who vanished on June 7 after moving in with her boyfriend, Angelo Smith, in Charlotte, North Carolina. 'Mommy got a spanking with the belt,' the little boy told police during an interview after she vanished, according to warrants shared with WSOCTV. 'Angelo kicked mommy’s butt and made her cry.' He added: 'Angelo is mean to mommy and hurt mommy in the face,' the warrant states. Missing: Bianca Turner, 31, vanished on June 7 after a row with her boyfriend, he told authorities . Smith reported her missing on June 8 - just days before she was about to start a new job with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools - and said they had got into an argument over a text message. He said that, following the row, she left the apartment drunk and carrying a bag with her. On Thursday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe said they were now treating the case as a homicide investigation because some witnesses had not been truthful, WSOCTV reported. In addition, Tanner's ex-husband told police they share a joint bank account and said there has been no activity on the debit card linked to the account. Witness: Her three-year-old son told authorities that the boyfriend hit her with a belt and hurt her face . The search warrant added that police are looking for a belt or paddle, cellphones, clothes worn by Tanner during an assault, evidence of blood, hairs and other bodily fluids, the channel reported. During a search, police did find a Dell laptop, a white Apple iPhone, two notebooks, a black zipper pouch with an empty magazine, a Captain Morgan bottle, two torn photographs from the trash inside and a gold-post earring and the back in the trash, the warrant revealed. Detectives added that Smith had began deleting information from his phone before an interview with police, during which they were going to check the device, the warrant said. Smith also had an outstanding warrant for domestic battery out of Arkansas after his then-girlfriend reported that he 'threw her onto the bed and covered her face, both mouth and nose, with his hand, smothering her', investigators said. Apartment: Tanner moved in with her boyfriend to this Charlotte apartment just 2 weeks before she vanished . Search: Investigators say they are treating it as a homicide case but have not yet named any suspects . But Smith has not been named a suspect in the case. Despite police saying they believed she was killed, friends and family are not giving up - and posted fliers around the town and knocked on doors in the search for information. 'It’s just tearing us apart,' her sister, Cerise Richardson, told reporters, the Charlotte Observer reported. 'Every night, her son is crying for her. He wants his mommy.' Tanner had moved to Charlotte in late May from Greensboro, where she taught second grade at Reedy Fork Elementary School. She was also working on a doctoral degree in education administration.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two Canadian joggers are lucky to be alive - and in one piece - after a scary run-in with a black bear on a trail in northeastern Alberta last week. And just in case their friends don't believe them, they have video proof showing the curious bear following the two men and in some cases getting within just a few feet of the terrified joggers. Bruce Allan and Greg Armour were jogging in on a wooded trail in Fort McMurray on June 5, when they bumped into a young black bear. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Up close and personal: Bruce Allan and Greg Armour bumped into this guy on a job in northern Canada earlier this month . Scary: The bear would frequently dart in and out of the woods and charge at the two men . Lucky: Bruce Allan videotaped much of the encounter as he and his friend tried to fend off a black bear . Terrified: Greg Armour says that at no point was he certain he and Allan were going to make it out alive . The spot where the men crossed paths with the bear is just a couple of miles from where a a person was killed in a bear attack just last month. The two men say they did what wilderness experts tell people to do when they are confronted by a bear -- but the animal refused to stop following them. 'The moment that I met the bear it was an instant ""turn around, don’t . make eye contact, walk away,"" and that didn’t seem to work,' Allan, who . filmed the video, told CTV Edmonton. In the video, the bear is seen following the two men four about four minutes before they finally make a break for it. Allan and Armour say that it actually started following them several minutes earlier. 'I was ready for him to pretty much pounce on me at any time,' Allan continues. 'For about three or four minutes I figured, what part of me is going to get gouged or ripped open?' He's a climber: The bear would frequently climb up tress, climb down and then charge at the two men . Pursuit: The bear followed the two men for several minutes until they saw an opportunity to sprint to their Jeep and took it . The men yell at the bear and huddle close together to appear larger and hopefully scare the animal away. However, nothing seemed to work, and the bear continued to follow the men while occasionally climbing - and breaking - tree limbs and charging at them. 'He was showing all he could do right there, as far as I’m concerned,' said Armour. The men grabbed large rocks in case they needed to defend themselves if the bear attacked - as if the rocks would do much. Too close for comfort: The bear would get within a few feet of the two men . Safety: The two men started tried to joke about the frightening encounter after sprinting back to the safety of their Jeep . When Allan and Armour saw a chance to run, they took it, and made it over a bridge and into their Jeep unscathed - and with a wild story. 'There were definitely some moments where our escape was not guaranteed in any way,' Armour added. The men have since brought bear spray, which they now take with them whenever they job in the woods. However, they both say it will be a long time before they head back to that particular trail.","The two men were jogging on a path through the woods in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada .

The popularity of the Brooklyn name parallels the renaissance of the borough of 2.6 million, with the gentrification of its leafy brownstone neighborhoods, a thriving arts scene and the return of big-league sports with the Brooklyn Nets. Mayor Bill de Blasio, seeking to capitalize on that spirit of cool, last week pitched Brooklyn — not Manhattan — as potential host for the 2016 Democratic National Convention. ""There's no greater way to show admiration for a borough than to name your child after it,"" says Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. 'You don't see too many people calling their children Manhattan or the Bronx.' Kimberly and Brock Tite of Marion, Illinois, are that rare exception.

"By . Damien Gayle . 'Britain's Schindler': Sir Nicholas Winton, who is to awarded the Czech Republic's Order of the White Lion for saving children from the Nazi occupation . A Briton who saved Jews in occupied Prague from almost certain death in Nazi concentration camps is to be awarded the Czech Republic's highest honour. Sir Nicholas Winton, who saved more than 650 mostly Jewish children from the Holocaust by organising the 'Kindertransports' to the UK, will receive the Order of the White Lion. His exploits just before the outbreak of total war in Europe made him a hero to the Czechs and have earned him the nickname 'Britain's Schindler'. The award, confirmed this week, will be given to the 105-year-old at an official ceremony on October 28, the anniversary of the founding of Czechoslovakia. Sir Nicholas recently celebrated his 105th birthday at the Czech embassy in London where most of the guests were the offspring of the children rescued by him. Taking into the account the children of those he saved, there are estimated to be around 6,000 people in the world today who owe him their lives. To this day they call themselves 'Nicky's children'. It was late in December 1938 when Sir Nicholas from Hampstead, then a stockbroker, cancelled a holiday and instead went to Prague to see what was happening to refugees. Horrified by the treatment of the Jews under the Nazi occupation, he set about  organising eight evacuations of the threatened children on the Czech Kindertransport train. He advertised in newspapers for foster homes, organised residency permits from the immigration office in the UK, and persuaded the Germans to let the children go. Vera Egermayer, a Holocaust survivor who was interned at the Theresienstadt transit camp, said: 'Nicky is a national hero in the Czech Republic. 'In England, you don’t know about him but everywhere else we do. He did a kind act and never told anybody.'

Rescued: Child refugees taken from Nazi-occupied arrive in Southampton on the US liner Manhattan in 1939 . Sir Nicholas still lives in his own home in Berkshire, with only a day carer. At his birthday party, he said: 'I am always surprised every time I come here to see all kinds of people who have come really very great distances to say hello. 'As far as I am concerned, it is only Anno Domini that I am fighting - I am not ill, I am just old and doddery.'","Sir Nicholas Winton saved more than 650 children from the Nazi occupation .

Rose was banned from Major League Baseball in 1989 after it was discovered that he was betting on the Cincinnati Reds while he was the team's manager . Rose can take this one-game job because the Bluefish are not affiliated with any major league team. He has occasionally appeared at official events since his ban, with MLB's permission. For years, Rose denied that he had ever bet on baseball, despite a lengthy investigation concluding that he had. In 2004, Rose finally admitted that he had bet on baseball, and that he had even bet on the Cincinnati Reds while he was the team's manager. He claims, however, that he never bet against his team. The admission - which included an apology - came in the form of a book Rose had written, so its sincerity has always been questioned. 'Charlie Hustle': Rose was known for his intense play and holds the MLB record for most hits in his career . Because of the ban, Rose is prohibited from managing in MLB and from being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, which given his incredible statistics, is a very likely scenario if not for his having bet on his own team. He now lives in Las Vegas and makes money selling his autograph and memorabilia at nearby casinos and sports stores. Rose, however, is still holding out hope that his ban will be lifted and that he'll be allowed to manage a team and be inducted into the Hall of Fame. 'I've waited 25 years, but I've done so because I was the one who screwed up,' Rose told ESPN.com. 'And if I were given a second chance, I would be the happiest guy in the world.' In 1997, Rose applied for reinstatement with MLB Comissioner Bud Selig. Selig, who is set to retire in January of 2015, has never ruled on Rose's application. Reinstatement: Rose has been trying to get MLB Commissioner Bud Selig to lift the ban so he can manage a team and be inducted into the Hall of Fame . Work: Rose currently lives in Las Vegas where he sells his autograph and memorabilia at casinos and sports stores . 'I haven't given up on Bud,' Rose said. 'I'm not glad he's leaving. He has a love for the game and has been good for it. If the next guy is his best friend, I don't expect he'll just turn me loose, but if he isn't, I hope he has an open mind.' Rose - who went to prison in 1990 for tax evasion - is also despised by many baseball fans for a play that happened in the 1970 All Star Game, in which Rose tackled catcher Ray Fosse at the plate. The game was an exhibition game, and critics say Rose should have just slid into home rather than take out Fosse, who suffered a broken and separated shoulder from the hit, which never completely healed properly. The Bluefish will host the Lancaster Barnstormers in Rose's game. The team says the Atlantic League is all about giving people second chances.","Pete Rose was banned from baseball after it was determined that he bet on his own team while managing the Cincinnati Reds .

"By . Lydia Warren . A couple has welcomed a set of healthy quintuplets just in time for Father's Day. Roxanna Hoffman gave birth to four girls and one boy on Friday the 13th as her husband, Michael Hoffman, stood by her side at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona. The couple, who were living at Luke Air Force Base, New Jersey where Michael was a staff sergeant, until they relocated to be close to the Phoenix hospital, let their son Conner name his new siblings. The six-year-old chose Aurora, Brielle, Delilah, Elias and Felicity - so the children's names, including Conner's, now match up with the first six letters of the alphabet. Scroll down for video . Joy: Roxanna and Michael Hoffman, pictured at a press conference, welcomed four girls and a boy on Friday . 'It became an early Father's Day present and it'll definitely make Father's Day a little bit more memorable now for the rest of my life,' Michael Hoffman said at a press conference. The babies were born between 8.15am and 8.17am and ranged from 3 pounds, one ounce to three pounds, 11 ounces in weight. 'The boy was such a gentleman - he opened the door and let all the girls come first,' perinatologist Dr. Diana Danilenko told AZ Family. The newborns are now receiving care at the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, where they are using respiratory support but otherwise healthy. They will stay at the hospital until they are big enough to go home, doctors said without giving a date. Welcome! The babies' big brother named them based on the alphabet, starting with Aurora, pictured . Sleeping beauty: Next came Brielle, who, like her siblings, still remains in hospital using breathing equipment . Tiny: Baby Delilah is pictured. The couple already have a 'C' in the family - their six-year-old son Conner . 'Little gentleman': Baby Elias allowed his four sisters to come out before he was born, doctors said . New addition: Baby Felicity, pictured, was born just in time to wish her dad a happy Father's Day . At a press conference, the couple said their six-year-old son had been shocked by the number of new arrivals. Bump: Mrs Hoffman grins as she shows off her massive bump ahead of the quintuplets' birth . 'He's like, ""Oh no, I've got four sisters now I have to watch after. They're going to drive me crazy"",' Mr Hoffman said.'But he's a good little boy and if he wants to or not, he's going to be a great help.' Mrs Hoffman gave birth to the babies after 31 weeks and one day; the national average gestation for quintuplets is 28 weeks. She had undergone fertility treatment after the couple struggled to conceive following Conner's birth and suffering a miscarriage. They visited a fertility specialist in New Jersey between May and September 2013 and were diagnosed with unexplained infertility. In November, Mrs Hoffman started receiving medications and underwent Intrauterine Insemination - and they were stunned to discover they were expecting five babies, she wrote on her blog. 'My husband was pale white, mouth open, and was in complete shock,' she said. 'When we . walked out of the ultrasound room and sat in the waiting area to talk . with the doctor, other patients kept looking at him and asking if he was . okay. His only response was, ""There's five""! 'I . just kept explaining to the other patient's who were waiting what he . meant. Needless to say, I think he gave the entire waiting room a . scare!' Hi mom! Mrs Hoffman smiles as she meets one of her babies for the first time during the delivery on Friday . Excitement: Mr Hoffman gives a 'thumbs up' after his five new babies were successfully delivered on Friday . Happy: The couple pictured after the press conference. The babies will return home when they are big enough . She added: 'The fertility doctors kept apologizing to us, said they did not know how this happened. They urged us to strongly consider selective reduction with this very high-risk pregnancy.' But the couple, who met in the military, decided to keep the five babies and chose the Phoenix hospital after hearing about Dr John Elliott, a perinatologist and multiple-birth specialist. 'Without this team here, they wouldn't have made it this far and they definitely wouldn't have been this healthy,' Michael Hoffman said.

"By . Associated Press . Domino's is introducing its own version of Siri. The pizza delivery chain announced on Monday that it is introducing a function on its mobile app that lets customers place orders by speaking with a computer-generated voice named Dom. The rollout is part of an ongoing push by Domino's to take business away from rivals and smaller pizza shops by offering more convenient ways to order. The company, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says the updated app for iPhones and Android devices will deliver a 'human-like, conversational' experience, but notes that it will take some time to work out the kinks in the technology. Ordering just got easier: Domino's is introducing a 'Siri' app so customers can order on mobiles . 'It is not perfect,' Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said in an interview. 'This is the sort of thing, like any other really new technology launch, you're going to learn, you're going to get better.' Already, mobile and online ordering accounts for 40 percent of Domino's U.S. sales. Growing that portion of its business has become a priority for the chain, with customers increasingly saying they prefer to place orders that way. People who order digitally also tend to spend more and return with greater frequency because they like the convenience, Doyle said. Meanwhile, he noted that smaller pizza shops don't have the money to invest in such technologies. 'It is clearly an area where we'll be able to leverage our scale,' he said. Customers who order pizza with their smart phones spend more . Although other factors have played a role, Domino's credits its digital platforms for helping drive sales. Last year, the company's domestic sales rose 5.4 percent at established locations.Still, compared with many other cuisines, the pizza industry remains fairly fragmented. Four of the national biggest chains — Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Little Caesars — together have a little more than 40 percent of the market, according to Doyle. Darren Tristano, an analyst with the industry tracker Technomic, said the major chains have the potential to grow their market share by leveraging national marketing campaign and the ability to offer steeper discounts. And while sophisticated digital ordering platforms give the big chains an edge, Tristano said those technologies will eventually become cheap enough for smaller players to adopt. 'That gap is shrinking,' Tristano said. For now, the voice ordering function on the Domino's app is fairly simple. After pulling up the app, customers type in their address and are taken to the ordering page where they can push a button to order by voice. A voice that identifies itself as Dom walks customers through the process by asking if they want additional toppings or other items. To pay, customers still have to type in their credit card information. Domino's Pizza Inc., which has 5,000 U.S. locations, is partnering with Nuance Communications to offer the technology.","Mobile and online ordering accounts for 40 percent of Domino's U.S. sales .

"By . Bryan Keogh . The leftover beef trimmings derisively known as 'pink slime' is making a comeback two years after a series of graphic news broadcasts devastated sales. Two of the largest makers of the ground beef product are reporting a rebound in customers thanks in part to rising prices of its higher-quality counterparts. Average ground beef prices have jumped 10 per cent this year to an all-time high . of $3.808 per pound in April, according to the Bureau of Labor. The ground beef product derisively known as pink slime is seeing a turnaround in sales at two of its biggest producers . Cargill Inc's sales of finely textured beef have tripled since March 2012, and the agriculture company now has about 400 customers for the product, which is made from trimmings that have been separated from fat and treated with ammonia or citric acid to kill pathogens, the Lincoln Journal Star reported on Saturday. That's more customers than Minneapolis-based Cargill had before the controversy erupted after ABC News aired a series of reports on the meat, prompting a consumer backlash, according to Cargill director of communications Mike Martin. Sales, however, are still 40 per cent below their peak, he said. Jeremy Jacobsen, a spokesman for Beef Products Inc, which dubs its meat 'lean finely textured beef', also confirmed a sales boost. Both companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr Jacobsen said his lawyers advised him not to comment further pending the outcome of the Dakota Dunes, South Dakota-based company's $1.2billion defamation lawsuit against ABC, which accused the network of misleading consumers into thinking the product is unsafe. ABC News, owned by The Walt Disney Co, denied BPI's claims and vowed to fight the lawsuit. Last month the South Dakota Supreme Court ruled that the lawsuit could proceed to the discovery phase. Plant workers at a Beef Products plant in Nebraska produce 'lean, finely textured beef in 2012 . The . meat industry's use of ammonium-treated beef trimmings in school . lunches and fast food restaurants was little known until 2009, when The . New York Times reported on the product and publicized use of the term . 'pink slime'. The product, trimmed from leftover fatty parts . and treated to kill bacteria, was fast becoming a staple of grocery . stores, fast food joints such as McDonald's and Burger King and the US' school lunch program, which purchased 7 million pounds worth in 2012. The USDA gave it a clean bill of health, considering it almost safer than regular ground beef. Critics of the product object to the use of ammonia to treat the meat, a food safety practice . used for decades and that meets federal food safety standards. The term 'pink slime' gained traction after it was used in a New York Times story in 2009. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver also joined the anti-pink slime cause, railing against it on his cooking show. McDonald's and . other fast food companies stopped using it, and major supermarket chains . including Kroger and Stop & Shop vowed to stop selling beef with . the low-cost product. An online petition calling for the banning of the product from school menus drew hundreds of thousands of supporters. Schools slashed their use of the meat . product by 94 per cent during the 12 months ended September 2013 to 392,000 from . at least 7 million pounds in the previous fiscal year, according to . Bloomberg News, which cited US Department of Agriculture data. Only Iowa, . Nebraska and South Dakota were still ordering ground beef with the . product in 2012. As a result of the sudden drop in sales, Beef Products fired about 750 employees and closed three of its four plants. At least one company, AFA Foods, declared bankruptcy. 'The result of that has been catastrophic for this company,' Craig Letch, BPI's . director of food-quality assurance, said in December 2012. The company lost 80 per cent of . its business in 28 days.","Cargill's sales of finely textured beef have tripled since March 2012, while the number of customers has surged to 400 .

"By . Associated Press . Jim Rogers, a philanthropist and education advocate who served as chancellor of Nevada's higher education system from 2005 to 2009 without pay, died Saturday evening at his Las Vegas home after a bout with cancer. He was 75. Rogers also was the owner of KSNV-TV, the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, and oversaw the growth of Sunbelt Communications into 14 TV stations in five Western states. Sunbelt now is known as Intermountain West Communications Co. In 2007, Rogers said he was worth about $300million and had donated some $275million to universities, including $60million to schools in Nevada. In 2000, he was named among the nation's top 12 philanthropists by Time magazine. Jim Rogers, pictured in 2008 at an investor forum in China, passed away on Monday at his home in Las Vegas . He graduated from the University of Arizona law school in 1962. The school was named for him after the gift he pledged in 1997 became the largest ever given to a law school at the time. His donations also helped establish the law school at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 'Jim and I were contemporaries while practicing law, and what a terrific lawyer he was,' U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who represents Nevada, said in a statement. 'And his talents were not limited to law. What he has done in education is superb. His philanthropic endeavors are unsurpassed in the state of Nevada.' As chancellor of the University of Nevada system, Rogers fought for increased education funding and sought to shake up the system to improve it. He criticized Nevada's tax policy and called for personal and corporate income taxes to help pay for education. His clashes with UNLV President Carol Harter and University of Nevada, Reno, President John Lilley forced them to quit. He supported a proposal to have university regents appointed instead of elected. He also donated his salary back to the university system. Governor Brian Sandoval said Nevada 'lost one of its most outspoken and fearless advocates,' citing Rogers' national recognition as a philanthropist and business leader. 'Jim dedicated his time and resources to advancing our education system and as chancellor of higher education, was fierce in his commitment to make sure our students had the resources they needed to succeed,' Sandoval said in a statement. 'Jim's legacy will live on in the many lives he touched throughout his truly remarkable career.' Critics branded Rogers as abrasive and opinionated, but he said he simply sought to get the best from himself and others around him. 'I'm very demanding of other people and myself,' Rogers told the Las Vegas Sun upon retiring as chancellor. 'I do have a very short temper, and I wish I didn't. But that's the way I am... At the same time, I'm consistent and I expect the people I work with to meet high expectations. 'I've got one shot going through this life. I want to make sure I do as much as I can,' the Las Vegas High School graduate added. In 2010, Rogers was honored by the Nevada Board of Regents with the title of chancellor emeritus and awarded its highest honor, Distinguished Nevadan. Last year, he received the President's Medal from UNLV. 'Jim was an outstanding advocate for higher education and a great friend,' said Kevin J. Page, chairman of the Board of Regents. 'He made it his personal mission to fight for higher education funding when he was chancellor and continued that work after he returned to the private sector. Improving Nevada's education system was Jim's way of giving back to the community.' University Chancellor Dan Klaich said that while some may have found Rogers challenging to work with, he enjoyed their collaboration. 'Jim abhorred mediocrity and loved this state with every fiber of his being. That is a legacy each of us should try and live up to,' Klaich said in a statement. Rogers' survivors include his wife, Beverly, and three children from a previous marriage. Funeral arrangements were pending.","Jim Rogers said he donated about $275million to universities, including $60 million to schools in Nevada .

"By . Joshua Gardner . An ultra-fit California couple intends to soon take their hardcore fitness lifestyle to the next level by rowing a boat 2,400 miles from Monterey to Hawaii. Tech entrepreneur Sami Inkinen, 38, and his former competitive gymnast wife Meredith Loring, 34, if they complete the grueling feat, will become the first couple to ever successfully make the trip across the mighty Pacific. But short of being scared to undertake a task only ever completed by a handful of adventure seekers, Inkinen and Loring are more afraid of what it may do to their relationship. Ultimate challenge: Sami Inkinen his wife Meredith Loring are pictured training for their Monterrey to Oahu trek across the Pacific in just a row boat . 'It's going to be uncomfortable. We'll be sleep-deprived and hungry and sore, so it will be easier to cross boundaries that we don't want to cross,' Loring told SFGate.com. Her husband agreed: 'The mental side is going to be the most challenging. How we deal with ourselves and with each. But these are two people accustomed to pushing boundaries and coming out on top. Finland native Inkinen started the real estate website Trulia in 2005 while pursuing his MBA at Stanford. He also became a competitive triathlete during that time. Loring grew up competing in gymnastics in New Hampshire and after receiving a master's, she had a successful run with a company that sells software to investment banks. Their decision may not be so surprising when you learn they met on Match.com before making a kayaking date in Sausalito their first meeting. The excursion will mark their fourth wedding anniversary. Inkinen and Loring want to become the first couple to row from Monterey to Hawaii . Fit: Inkinen is one of the world's greatest amateur triathletes in his age group and Loring recently won the women's division of a marathon in Nepal dubbed 'the world's highest trail running event.' The sporty couple had never rowed before they decided to cross the Pacific, but were very much in shape going into their new training . Inkinen is one of the world's greatest amateur triathletes in his age group and Loring recently won the women's division of a marathon in Nepal dubbed 'the world's highest trail running event.' Currently, their focus is on rowing, though neither had any experience with the sport before the decided to make the trip. 'Both of us were looking for a new and difficult adventure that would push our mental and physical capabilities,' said Inkinen. 'The longest I've spent rowing was six hours, and that was in a 35-pound shell, not a heavy boat like Sami and Meredith are going out in,' said Shirwin Smith of the Sausalito rowing center. 'But they have gone about their training and preparation in a really disciplined way. They were super fit to begin with, but they came here to get the right form. They learned and practiced in the heaviest boats we have,' she said. Death to sugar: Their website Fatchancerow.org will track their progress and serves as a place where donors can give money to help with the couple's pet cause - ending the epidemic of world sugar consumption . Their water-tight boat and cabin will come stocked with a desalinator that will allow them to safely drink seawater. They'll also have all the food they'll need, a GPS system, emergency beacons, and a radar system to warn them of oncoming boasts. Several others have made the trip from West Coast of America to Hawaii in a row boat. A man made the trip from Washington state in 1976 and another did the same in the 1980s. Roz Savage was the first woman to row from San Francisco to Oahu, and did it in 99 days. For their chosen route, the record is 64 days, set by Mick Bird in 1997. 'I don't think it's crazy, but it is an aggressive challenge,' Ray Dean of the San Francisco Dolphin Club told the SFGate.com. 'The mental strain is hard to imagine. It's like living locked in your car and you can't get out.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . An ex-con has been arrested in connection after one priest was murdered and another badly beaten last week at a Roman Catholic church in Phoenix, authorities said. Gary Michael Moran, 54, was charged Monday with shooting to death Reverend Kenneth Walker, 28, and savagely beating Rev. Joseph Terra, 56, last Wednesday evening. Phoenix Police Chief Daniel Garcia called the crimes 'vicious, tragic and horrifying' during a Monday press conference, adding that the city as a whole was 'appalled two priests were attacked.' Horrifying: Gary Michael Moran (left) is accused of shooting dead Rev. Kenneth Walker last week inside the rectory of his Phoenix church . Moran barged into the Mother of Mercy Mission rectory Wednesday and attacked both men just before 9.00 p.m., Garcia said. He shot Walker and beat Terra with a metal rod. Terra first tried to use the rod in self defense. Walker was not originally in the rectory, but came down where he heard the commotion, according to Garcia. That's when he was shot. Moran then fled the scene, but investigators were able to match forensic evidence to him. No motive has been established, but investigators believe it was a robbery gone wrong. He didn’t go into why he did it, but he did talk to us about being there, the struggle that ensued, and then he invoked his rights [to an attorney],' Garcia explained. Moran was released from prison April 24 . after serving about eight years on charges that included aggravated . assault with a deadly weapon and burglary, court records show. His criminal history also includes car theft and multiple drug charges, according to Garcia. ‘He is a career criminal, a violent felony offender,' the police chief said. Tragic death: Walker (center) died after coming to the aid of Terra when he was awoken by the fracas . A devastated archdiocese: Walker, left, and Rev. Joseph Terra, right, are pictured with Bishop Thomas Olmsted, center, at a recent gathering . In the 2005 case, Moran . entered the apartment of someone he didn't know, picked up a steak . knife, went into a bedroom and stabbed a man in the abdomen without . provocation before being subdued, police said. He was sentenced to 10 years in state . prison but released early. During his time in prison, Moran was . found guilty of more than a dozen infractions, including four for drug . manufacturing and possession, the Department of Corrections records . show. He spent his nearly two months of freedom homeless, according to police, and quickly fell back into his old habits. 'Since that time he’s been living primarily in the streets… he immediately went back to his business, that of criminal activity,' Garcia said. Terra gave Walker last rites after the assault just before he died, sources said. He was moved out of a hospital . intensive care unit Saturday and is expected to make a full recovery. Rev. Carl Gismondi, a pastor visiting from San Diego, conducted Mass . at the priests' church Sunday and said he had visited his fellow . clergyman at the hospital. 'He was in good spirits,' Gismondi said after the service. Where it happened: The church where both Walker and Terra were attacked . Memorial service: A requiem mass was held Monday for Walker just as police announced Moran's arrest . News of the arrest came just as a Mass was to be held for Walker at another church in Phoenix. The cops found their man living in a halfway house in a gritty downtown section of the desert city. Both the forensic evidence and people he bragged to about the terrifying attacks that came forward to police led to his arrest. 'All the evidence pointed to one man, and that was Gary Michael Moran,' Garcia said. Mayor Greg Stanton profusely thanked his officers for the quick arrest and said 'Phoenix is safer today because of the men and women of our police department.' 'We're relieved that he's not out . there doing it again and we hope some good comes out of it for him,' Walker's stepsister, Sasha Keys, said of the arrest. She said nearly . $42,000 in donations had poured in from around the country. 'It was incredible,' she added. 'I'm still getting letters in the mail with checks.' Big announcement: Police Chief Daniel Garcia announces Moran's arrest while he is surrounded by city officials including Mayor Greg Stanton (left) and Councilman Michael Nowakowski (at right wearing a suit with no tie) Police . previously said Terra gave them a limited description of the suspect. Detectives said they were running forensic tests on evidence collected . at the scene of the assault and from Walker's vehicle, which was found . abandoned several blocks from the church near the state Capitol. Police . said last week they were unsure if there was only one suspect or . whether robbery was the motive in the attack. Martos declined to say . whether there was forced entry. Walker . was born in upstate New York, had 10 siblings and was drawn to the . priesthood after attending traditional Latin Mass with his family in . high school. He later joined the seminary, made good grades and enjoyed . playing soccer, said the Rev. Joseph Lee, academic dean at the Our Lady . of Guadalupe Seminary in Nebraska.

While Obama lacks the authority to extend that protection to all Americans, the order being drafted by the White House would impact about 14million workers whose employers or states currently do not ban workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals. The scope of the measure was tabulated by the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School, which studies sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy. The president has resisted signing the order in hopes Congress would pass a broader non-discrimination measure that would apply to nearly all employers. While the Senate passed the legislation last year, the measure has languished in the Republican-led House and there is little sign that lawmakers will take it up in an election year. The announcement: President Barack Obama, speaking Monday on the South Lawn of the White House, announced his intentions to sign the bill . 'We've been waiting for quite a few months now for the House to take action and unfortunately there are no particularly strong indications that Congress is prepared to act on this,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The White House's announcement was a significant victory for gay rights advocates, who widely praised Obama's decision. 'By issuing an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT people, the president will not only create fairer workplaces across the country, he will demonstrate to Congress that adopting federal employment protections for LGBT people is good policy and good for business,' said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. Officials would not say when Obama would sign the order or why the administration was taking the unusual step of previewing his plans for issuing such a measure. The announcement comes a day before Obama attends the Democratic National Committee's annual gay and lesbian fundraiser in New York. While the president has widespread political support among the LGBT community, advocates have become increasingly irritated with the president's reluctance to move forward with the order. Quick turnaround: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama waving Monday morning as they board Air Force One to fly back to Washington, D.C. from Palm Springs, California . Their frustration mounted earlier this year when Obama responded to gridlock on Capitol Hill by touting plans to take executive actions on issues that Congress would not act on. That included signing executive orders that raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and expanding the number of contractors who would be eligible for overtime pay. White House officials never explained why Obama moved quickly on the wage-related executive orders but delayed taking action on the anti-discrimination provision. Obama's decision could energize progressive voters in a midterm election year where Republicans are seeking to retake control of the Senate. The DNC and several Democratic lawmakers highlighted the president's announcement Monday and used it to try to draw a distinction with Republicans. Republicans were largely silent on the decision, though Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch called on the White House to include the same religious exemptions in the order that are included in the legislation the Senate passed last year. The bill includes exemptions for churches and other houses or worship, as well as religiously affiliated organizations. While the White House did not release the specific language of the order Obama will sign, advocates expect it to be in line with measures signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson that banned federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race, religion, and national origin. It's unclear whether Obama's order will include religious exemptions. The American public has increasingly grown supportive of extending gay rights.  Courts have also increasingly come down in favor of same-sex marriage, with more than a dozen federal and state judges striking down part of all of state-level bans over the past seven months. No rulings have gone the other way. Still, advocates say there remains gaping inequality on the issue of workplace discrimination. According to the Human Rights Campaign, it is legal in 29 states to fire or refuse employment to a person based on sexual orientation. Thirty-two states also lack explicit laws banning discrimination based on gender identity.","President Obama said Monday he will sign a law barring federal contractors from discrimination .

"By . Associated Press . Tony Gwynn, the Hall of Famer with a sweet left-handed swing who spent his entire 20-year career with the Padres and was one of San Diego's most beloved athletes, died of cancer Monday. He was 54. Gwynn, nicknamed 'Mr. Padre,' had been on a medical leave since late March from his job as baseball coach at San Diego State, his alma mater. He died at a hospital in suburban Poway, agent John Boggs said. San Diego Padres' Tony Gwynn pictured here in the final game of his career, died of cancer on Monday at the age of 54 . In a rarity in pro sports, Gwynn played his whole career with the Padres retiring in 2001 . 'For more than 30 years, Tony Gwynn . was a source of universal goodwill in the national pastime, and he will . be deeply missed by the many people he touched,' Commissioner Bud Selig . said. Gwynn had two operations for cancer in his right cheek between August 2010 and February 2012. The second surgery was complicated, with surgeons removing a facial nerve because it was intertwined with a tumor inside his right cheek. They grafted a nerve from Gwynn's neck to help him eventually regain facial movement. Gwynn had said he believed the cancer was from chewing tobacco. San Francisco Giants third base coach Tim Flannery played a long time with Gwynn and then coached him. Flannery says he'll 'remember the cackle to his laugh. He was always laughing, always talking, always happy.' 'The baseball world is going to miss one of the greats, and the world itself is going to miss one of the great men of mankind,' Flannery said. 'He cared so much for other people. He had a work ethic unlike anybody else, and had a childlike demeanor of playing the game just because he loved it so much.' In a rarity in pro sports, Gwynn played his whole career with the Padres, choosing to stay rather than leaving for bigger paychecks elsewhere. His terrific hand-eye coordination made him one of the game's greatest contact hitters. Gwynn had said he believed the cancer that took his life was from chewing tobacco . He had 3,141 hits, a career .338 average and won eight NL batting titles. He excelled at hitting singles the other way, through the '5.5 hole' between third base and shortstop. Gwynn played in the Padres' only two World Series and was a 15-time All-Star. He homered off the facade at Yankee Stadium off San Diego native David Wells in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series and scored the winning run in the 1994 All-Star Game. He was hitting .394 when a players' strike ended the 1994 season, denying him a shot at becoming the first player to hit .400 since San Diego native Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941. Gwynn befriended Williams and the two loved to talk about hitting. Gwynn steadied Williams when he threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the 1999 All-Star Game at Boston's Fenway Park. Gwynn retired after the 2001 season. He and Cal Ripken Jr. — who spent his entire career with the Baltimore Orioles — were inducted into the Hall of Fame in the class of 2007. Gwynn was a two-sport star at San Diego State in the late 1970s-early 1980s, playing point guard for the basketball team — he still holds the game, season and career record for assists — and outfielder for the baseball team. Gwynn always wanted to play in the NBA, until realizing during his final year at San Diego State that baseball would be the ticket to the pros. He had 3,141 hits, a career .338 average and won eight NL batting titles over his career . 'I had no idea that all the things in my . career were going to happen,' he said shortly before being inducted into . the Hall of Fame along with Ripken in 2007. 'I sure didn't see it. I . just know the good Lord blessed me with ability, blessed me with good . eyesight and a good pair of hands, and then I worked at the rest.' He was a third-round draft pick of the Padres in 1981. After spending parts of just two seasons in the minor leagues, he made his big league debut on July 19, 1982. Gwynn had two hits that night, including a double, against the Philadelphia Phillies. After doubling, Pete Rose, who had been trailing the play, said to Gwynn: ""Hey, kid, what are you trying to do, catch me in one night?"" Survivors include his wife, Alicia, daughter Anisha and son Tony Jr., who plays with the Philadelphia Phillies.","Died of cancer Monday at the age of 54 .

"By . Sam Webb . Secret millionaire: Agnes Brotherston, who lay dead in her flat for up to six months before being discovered, has left a £1m fortune . A pensioner who lay dead in her flat for up to six months before being discovered left a fortune of almost £1million, it has emerged. Agnes Brotherston, 75, was found in her home in Strathaven, Lanarkshire, Scotland, in November after police were called to the property. Neighbours of Mrs Brotherston, who lived alone, raised the alarm after noticing an odour and flies coming from the flat. It was thought she may have been dead since the summer but was only discovered when police officers entered the property. It has now emerged that she had a fortune of £936,309 at the time of her death. In her recently published will, Mrs Brotherston instructed that the money should go to her two daughters. A neighbour said she had not been in touch with her daughters for several years. Tonight, one of her daughters, Mrs Dyer,  described it as ‘a non-story’. Her wealth included her £125,000 flat in Strathaven and another £80,000 property in the town. She also had £350,000 held in several bank accounts, a savings portfolio worth £265,000 and three life insurance portfolios valued at £112,000. The will, which was drawn up in August, 2011, also shows her furniture and household effects were valued at just £500. Mrs Brotherston said she wanted her estate to be split between her daughters Helen McInnes, of Glasgow, and Jane Dyer, from Cheshire. Mrs Dyer, 51, said today: ‘It is a non-story. I don’t want to talk about it.’ A former neighbour of the OAP said: 'It’s a shock that Agnes had so much money, you would never have thought it. 'She lived very quietly and modestly and certainly didn’t give the impression that she was a wealthy lady. 'It was very sad what happened to her.' Neighbours of Mrs Brotherston, who lived alone, raised the alarm after noticing an odour and flies coming from the flat (pictured). Her furniture and personal possessions were only valued at £500 . Following Mrs Brotherston’s death, neighbours said they had not seen her since the early summer. Her death was not treated as suspicious and she is thought to have died through natural causes. At the time, one resident, who didn’t wish to be named, said: 'I can’t believe this has happened here. 'She only moved in earlier in the year and to think of her lying there dead for so long is terrible. 'She used to stay here but then moved away to another part of the village. However she liked Weirs Gate so much that she bought the house which was up for rent at the time.' In her recently published will, Mrs Brotherston instructed that the money should go to her two daughters. Her neighbours said she lived a quiet and modest life (file picture) They added: 'She kept herself quiet most of the time but when you got talking to her she was very pleasant and always enjoyed a laugh with people she met. 'The flat must have been full of flies if she’d lay there that long, especially after the hot weather in the summer.' Another neighbour said: 'She was a bit of a recluse - a solitary woman. No one knew much about her and she didn’t mix with folk. 'It’s sad to think that old lady was lying there all that time and no one missed her. It makes you feel a bit guilty.' NHS Lanarkshire launched an investigation into Mrs Brotherston’s death as she was thought to be using their care services at the time. Police Scotland said they had sent a report on her death to the procurator fiscal.","Agnes Brotherton found dead in her home in Scottish town of Strathaven .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A supermarket price war has eased the pressure on family finances, with food prices by their fastest rate for a decade. As the big name chains including Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda slashed the price of bread and cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks, the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation fell to just 1.5 per cent, the lowest level since September 2009. But with wages still rising by just 0.7 per cent, incomes are still being outstripped by rising living costs, as a poll shows voters are not feeling the benefit of the economic recovery. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation has fallen to 1.5 per cent, the lowest level since September 2009 . Falling transport costs and price cuts on food and clothing were the biggest drivers of the fall in inflation . The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics mark the sixth month in a row when the inflation rate has been at or below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target. Inflation was last lower, at 1.1 per cent, in September 2009. Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ‘Good news that inflation is at its lowest for 5 years - it means more stability and financial security for everyone.’ Continued low inflation could make an interest rate rise less likely, although Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned growth is much stronger and unemployment falling much more quickly than had been expected. The battle between Britain’s leading supermarkets appears to be leading to real price cuts for shoppers. Food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 0.6 per cent year on year, the sharpest fall since October 2004. Prices have been rising constantly since March 2006. David Cameron hailed the fall . Supermarket staples such as bread and cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks led the drop. The big four supermarkets have been forced to offer bigger discounts I the face of the growing popularity of smaller rivals Aldi and Lidl. Meanwhile, lower womenswear prices saw clothing and footwear record negative inflation for the first time since April last year. Air fares, which were lower due to the timing of Easter, had a significant downward effect on inflation but motorists were hit by petrol price rises. Catherine McKinnell,  Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister, said: 'The fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, yet most people are still feeling the squeeze. 'Wages after inflation have now fallen by over £1,600 a year under David Cameron and the link between the wealth of the nation and family finances is broken. A huge turnaround would be needed to ensure working people aren’t worse off than when this Tory-led government came to office. 'While the Tories try to deny it even exists, Labour has a clear plan to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top.'","Consumer Prices Index drops to 1.5%, down from 1.8% in April .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un led a drill and taught the captain of a submarine how to navigate as he visited a navy unit, it has been reported. The dictator visited the North Korean Navy Unit 167, where he reportedly spoke of the importance of the country's submarine units. Pictures released by the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers Party, show the leader riding on top of the submarine as it remained above water and being shown around the inside of the vessel. Scroll down for videos . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been pictured on board a submarine as he inspected a navy unit stationed on the east coast of the country . Kim reportedly guided a navy drill while on board the submarine, and even taught the captain how to navigate . The dictator spoke of the importance of the country's submarine units as he visited the North Korean Navy Unit 167 . The paper said Kim called for the crew on the submarine to 'devote their wisdom and enthusiasm to rounding off the combat preparations'. The dictator also reportedly led a navy drill and even taught 'navigation methods' to the submarine's captain, according to the Korean Central News Agency, as cited by the South's Yonhap News Agency. He said: 'The Party Central Committee is attaching great importance to the combined units of submarines.' Patches of rust can be seen in the pictures of the green vessel, which Yonhap said is believed to be part of the South Hamgyong Province-based East Sea fleet command. That the pictures would reveal the submarine to be in such a condition has surprised North Korea expert Aidan Foster-Carter. He told The Telegraph: 'To see rust in a North Korean picture is quite surprising. Normally they tart stuff up.' North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un inspects the submarine No. 748 of the Korean People's Army (KPA) naval unit 167 led 7th regiment . Kim reportedly called for the crew on the submarine to 'devote their wisdom and enthusiasm to rounding off the combat preparations' Kim Jong-Un poses with seamen as he inspects the naval unit at an undisclosed location . According to the KCNA, during the visit to the submarine the dictator . said: 'The commanding officers and seamen should clearly see through the . motives of the hateful enemies watching for a chance to invade our land . and put spurs to combat preparations, thinking about battles only.' It was reported last week the dictator inspected the Ryo Islet Defense Detachment - a vast military base responsible for protecting the island of Ryodo and the coastal city of Wonsan. Wonson is an area of particular strategic importance to Kim because on its outskirts lies his favourite luxury holiday home. Patches of rust can be seen in the pictures of the green vessel, which Yonhap said is believed to be part of the South Hamgyong Province-based East Sea fleet command . Kim was quoted as saying: 'The Party Central Committee is attaching great importance to the combined units of submarines' '[The outpost] is an important combat . mission of the detachment to definitely turn the islet into an . impregnable fortress and unsinkable battleship and thus not to allow . enemies to invade the socialist homeland,' state-run news agancy KCNA . said. The young leader and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, have frequently visited the vacation home and last year ordered the creation of the nation's first beach resort in the city. Kim praised the military detachment for successfully doing 'everything the Party Central Committee considered as good,' while also saying that it is 'a model unit where the party's military policy is being most correctly implemented and a typical one for the whole army to learn from,' according to the report.","Kim Jong-un spoke of importance of submarine units during navy visit .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . More than 65 business a day are being set up by single parents and the unemployed, under a government scheme to help families off benefits. So far 46,000 businesses have been set up through the New Enterprise Allowance - including 2,000 a month  over the past year. The government programme offers business mentoring and financial support for people on Jobseeker’s Allowance. Single parents and those on sickness benefits  also qualify for the Thatcherite scheme. Employment Minister Esther McVey said the scheme was helping people become their own bosses after losing their jobs. She said Britain was built on small business success . Special 'Apprentice' mentors help people  by providing advice on how to develop a business plan and get their new firm off the ground. If the business plan is approved, people on the scheme are eligible for financial support payable through a weekly allowance for up to 26 weeks worth a total of £1,274. Participants can also get a businesses loan through a separate government start-up scheme. Ministers released figures today to show that the scheme was being used by people of all ages. More than 10,000 businesses have been started by people aged over 50, according to the Government. A further 3,370 firms have been set up by youngsters, while some 8,590 companies were started by people with disabilities. Some of the businesses that have been set up include a college for children with learning difficulties, a vintage clothes shop and a gas engineering firm. Mike Covell, 35, from Hull, used the scheme to launch a tour company in his home town. The 'Amazing Hull Tours' started last year and recounts the gruesome and darker side of the city's history, including Jack The Ripper. He’s now secured film and reviewer roles and as a result of building his reputation, will be starring alongside Hollywood stars Mischa Barton and Jack O'Halloran in an historical film. Hayley Thomas, 29, from Haverfordwest, West Wales, set up a children’s play centre after being made redundant. The Government hopes TV shows like the Apprentice will inspire people who have lost their jobs to set up their own business rather than rely on benefits . The business gives parents the chance for a few hours to themselves on their Pembrokeshire holidays. She now employs 17 members of staff. Employment Minister Esther McVey today hailed the scheme's success. She said: 'The continuing success of Great Britain is built on the hard work and ingenuity of small businesses up and down the country. 'It’s great that as part of the Government’s long-term economic plan we’ve been able to mentor tens of thousands of budding entrepreneurs to help make their dreams of becoming their own boss a reality. 'As the economy continues to grow this new generation of entrepreneurs may well go on to create the jobs of tomorrow, helping even more people to get off benefits and build a career.'","Ministers claim a new mentoring scheme has helped families off benefits .

"By . Paul Bentley . Gabby Logan, 41, prepared for England's opening World Cup match with yoga and a blow dry . As the hapless men around her face a torrent of abuse, Gabby Logan has emerged as the BBC’s star World Cup performer. And yesterday the sports presenter revealed the key to her cool head – two hours of yoga and a match day wash and blow dry. While juggling punditry, pitch-side interviews and epic journeys across Brazil to follow the games, married mother of two Mrs Logan has been updating her fans on her personal website. Yesterday, the 41-year-old described how she prepared for England’s opening game against Italy on Saturday night with yoga and some time to herself. ‘I’ll come clean, you should know that as well as coffee I am a little addicted to yoga,’ she wrote. ‘I think it’s changed me in the last seven months. ‘On match day I was aiming to sleep as late as possible knowing we’d have a late night and I made it to 8.15am. ‘So I indulged myself in around two hours of yoga. At home, it’s not easy doing it with kids around so I tend to do it before they get up, which is a beautiful hour of the day.’ Mrs Logan, who is married with twins, said yoga had transformed her life and her relationships with her family. She described how her son will try to distract her as she does headstands but has now learned to leave her in peace. ‘I don’t feel like snapping at my lovely husband as much, which has got to be a good thing,’ she wrote. ‘A few weeks ago I was practising yoga when my eight-year-old son came in to the room to ask me something. At this point I was holding a head-stand for 30 breaths. He was lying on the floor with his nose almost touching mine, trying to distract me, asking if he could go for a play date, but the Yoga was more powerful. ‘So I ignored him and as I was in a head stand he seemed to accept that. If anyone has been nagged by an eight-year-old boy you will understand it’s almost worth learning to do a head stand if they give up on their demands that easily.’ The presenter and former gymnast explained how she also treated herself to some proper grooming time before the game on Saturday – although the oppressive conditions in Brazil somewhat ruined the effect. ‘After the match day yoga on Saturday I washed and blow dried my hair all the while knowing that the second I stepped out of my hotel room in Manaus it would take on a new life of its own in the heat (think Diana Ross circa 1975),’ she wrote. ‘Then I applied my make-up which wouldn’t actually be seen on screen until seven hours later by which point it would probably have slid off into the ether. Or wherever it is make-up which disappears off your face actually goes. The whole grooming process felt a bit futile in Manaus.’ Gabby Logan said she felt 'bedraggled' and 'grotty' after England's defeat to Italy on Saturday night. Pictured: Interviewing former England player Danny Murphy pitchside before the match . Mrs Logan described how she felt ‘bedraggled’ and ‘grotty’ after England’s defeat to Italy on Saturday night. The following morning, she had to be up at 4am for a flight to Rio, but said having children was good training for working when exhausted. ‘I can survive a night without sleep (I have twins),’ she added. Mrs Logan has been widely praised for her coverage in Brazil. She has previously accused rival broadcaster Sky of using female sports presenters in figure-hugging outfits as ‘window dressing’. 'After the match day yoga on Saturday I . washed and blow dried my hair all the while knowing that the second I . stepped out of my hotel room in Manaus it would take on a new life of . its own' - Gabby Logan . As Phil Neville and foreign pundits have faced criticism for being boring and incomprehensible, she has been lauded for her intelligent and considered observations and insights. Mrs Logan, who lives in Buckinghamshire with husband Kenny and their twin children, said she kept down to earth by remembering what a ‘privileged’ position she is in. ‘So there I was waiting in the tunnel for the England team bus to arrive, it was only 20 minutes later than we had been told but long enough for me to think what a crazy and privileged job I have,’ she wrote. ‘I get to see really incredible people and the things they do from a different angle. None of us permanently show the world exactly who we are, there is a tendency to demand that all talented sports people should be ebullient, loquacious and full of wisdom. ‘Some will be but others will just be very talented sports people, shy people, people who have no desire to be in the limelight except for the sporting success they achieve. ‘Witnessing the moments when they are “off” is as fascinating as seeing them “on”, remembering that they are people, not Gods, and most of them realise that too. They are people not Gods and they too have feet of clay. Uniquely this weekend we all seemed to agree that they tried their very best and that is all you can ask of anyone.’","Mother-of-two Gabby Logan, 41, is presenting World Cup in Brazil for BBC .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Crumbs, DM ... the much-loved animated TV hero Danger Mouse is to make a comeback. The cartoon series, which ran for more than ten years until 1992, will make his return next year when it is screened by CBBC. The white-clad rodent who wore a patch over one eye was voiced by Sir David Jason, while his sidekick Penfold was played by the late Terry Scott, although there has been no confirmation of stars who will be in the new run. Scroll down for video . They're back - Penfold and Danger Mouse but no one yet knows who will provide the voices . The show, created by the Cosgrove Hall animation studios, originally ran on ITV and many viewers will recall Penfold’s catchphrase 'Crumbs DM' as well as the title music which featured the lines: ‘He’s the Greatest, He’s Fantastic, wherever there is danger he’ll be there.’ Despite the rise of other postal services in the years since the show ended, Danger Mouse and Penfold’s HQ will continue to be in a red post box, although it will now be packed with cutting-edge technology as befitting any modern action mouse. And programme-makers say the eye patch will be replaced by an ‘i-patch’, with multiple state-of-the art functions. The new look for the character has yet to be unveiled. Vocals: No word on who will provide the voices in the news series. Terry Scott (left) was Penfold while Sir David Jason (right) was Danger Mouse . FremantleMedia Kids & Family Entertainment owns the global TV and licensing rights to Danger Mouse and is joining the BBC to produce the new series which forms part of the division’s five year-partnership with BBC Children’s. Co-creator Brian Cosgrove of the original show is a consultant on the 52-episode series, being made by Boulder Media and FremantleMedia Kids & Family Entertainment. Cheryl Taylor, the controller of CBBC said: ‘Danger Mouse is the last word in debonair and delightfully eccentric heroics and with Penfold at his side the much-loved duo will win over a whole new generation of fans.’ Cosgrove said: ‘When I helped to create Danger Mouse I had no idea the show would be such a huge success both in the UK and overseas. I am delighted that a whole new generation will be introduced to his daring deeds and thrilled to be part of this new 21st century series.

"By . Martin Robinson . Jailed: Louise Pollard stole £15,000 from two couples who were desperate for children before claiming she had miscarriages . A couple have spoken of their agony after conwoman surrogate Louise Pollard took advantage of their longing for a baby to scam them out of thousands. Tony and Debbie Kaba were one of two couples taken in by Pollard, who faked a doctor's letter after telling them she was pregnant with their child. Mr and Mrs Kaba told of their ordeal after Pollard was jailed for three years and four months for three counts of fraud yesterday. Bristol Crown Court had heard how Pollard contacted the couple after hearing of their difficulty having a second child in 2012. She convinced them to pay her £1,000 to be inseminated and another £4,000 after showing them a doctor's letter. Mr and Mrs Kaba told The Sun that Pollard even sent them a photo of herself holding a positive pregnancy test as she bombarded them with demands for extra cash. Mrs Kaba, 46, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, told the paper: 'She would phone us up at all hours asking for money. 'She was playing us in the most cold and calculated way. We're emotionally scarred for life. She's a she-devil.' The couple initially agreed to keep paying Pollard, saying they desperately wanted to believe she was carrying their baby. But after they handed over £5,000 to the fraudster, she broke off contact and they heard nothing from her. They later contacted the doctor's surgery on Pollard's letter - who told them the document was a fake - and then went to the police. Mrs Kaba said: 'We thought she was carrying our child and she knew how desperate we were. She destroyed that dream in the cruellest possible way.' Pollard also lied to Josephine and Keith Barnett, who had been trying for a child for 12 years, taking more than £10,000 from them before claiming she had been involved in a serious car accident and had lost the baby. In 2010 Pollard, of Plymouth, Devon, also alleged she was pregnant with the grandchild of Osama bin Laden, following an arrangement with his son Omar bin Laden - and again claimed she miscarried - which police also believe may have been a scam. Detectives fear the two couples who helped bring the case to court may not be her only victims. Judge Graham Cottle yesterday jailed Pollard, who sobbed in the dock of Bristol Crown Court, for her 'brutal and heartless' actions. Criminal: Pollard, pictured with one of two babies she has given up, was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court to more than three years in jail . The judge said: 'In about 2010, you achieved notoriety when agreeing to act as a surrogate mother for the son of Osama bin Laden. 'Be . those facts as they may, what this case is about is how you agreed . firstly to be a surrogate mother for Mr and Mrs Barnett, a childless . couple who had been trying unsuccessfully for many years to have a . child. 'It . is no doubt because they were desperate and as a consequence of your . skills as a fraudster that you quickly earned their trust then proceeded . to practise one breathtaking deception after another and persuaded them . to believe that you were going to provide them with what they . desperately wanted. Cruel: Louise Pollard, 28, from Plymouth, admitted defrauding childless couples by telling them she was pregnant and then saying she had miscarried . 'It was no . more than a tissue of lies that you told as you continued to take sums . of money from them. For you, that was all that this was about. After . they had parted with over £10,000 in your deception, they contacted the . police. 'By . that time, you had found further victims. Mr and Mrs Kaba, desperate . for a child to be a brother or sister for their son. They too were . completely taken into your web of deception, parting with money, being . fobbed off with one lie after another until they ended up heartbroken . and deprived of over £5,000.' Judge Cottle said Pollard's actions were 'deliberate, sustained, callous acts' that had left both families devastated. 'This . is not a case about financial loss, it is a case of two desperate . couples being completely taken in by you and your lies,' he said. 'Of course they lost money but they have lost a great deal more than that, they have ended up heartbroken.' In . 2010, Pollard appeared in national newspapers following her arrangement . to carry a child for Omar bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, and . his wife. She had already completed two successful surrogacies but miscarried the Bin Laden pregnancy, the court heard. Describing Pollard's other victims, prosecutor Rosaleen Collins said Josephine and Keith Barnett contacted Pollard, who was registered as a potential surrogate mother, online in 2011. On January 26 2012, Mr and Mrs Barnett met Pollard and agreed to pay her £20,000 to carry their child. 'There followed an agonising and fairly lengthy series of events designed to milk the couple, taking advantage of their desperate wish to have a child and preying on their good nature and their emotional ties to the event itself,' Ms Collins said. Pollard insisted she would carry out the artificial insemination herself as she did not want to undergo the procedure at a clinic. 'She did say that it was her ambition to be the most prolific surrogate mother in the country,' Ms Collins added. Pollard said she was carrying twins for Zaina . Bin Laden, pictured with her, left, and her then husband, Osama Bin . Laden's son, Omar, but lost them after she was reportedly attacked while . walking in a street in Syria . On February . 22, the Barnetts travelled to Pollard's home in Bristol and she . disappeared into a bedroom to carry out the artificial insemination . before being paid £1,000. She . announced she was pregnant on March 10 and the Barnetts paid a further . £2,600. But weeks later, on March 31, Pollard claimed she had suffered a . miscarriage. Mr and Mrs Barnett continued to support her financially, paying £750 for rent and £250 for car maintenance. 'They . were already so emotionally and financially attached to this . arrangement that they were easily manipulated,' Ms Collins said. According to UK law, the woman who gives birth to a child is always regarded as the legal mother at the moment of birth. Her husband, if she has one, is regarded as the legal father, but if the surrogate mother is unmarried, the genetic father can be named on the birth certificate. A parental order can then be applied for through the courts, which confers full parental status and responsibilities on both the intended parents. The order is only made if at least one of the intended parents is biologically related to the child, the intended parents are in a long-term relationship and the surrogate mother and her husband agree to it. A surrogate mother cannot be paid for her pregnancy, although the law allows her to be given 'reasonable expenses', which can reach around £10,000-£15,000. Intended parents do not have the same rights of maternity and paternity leave as those who have children naturally, although many companies now have 'adoption leave' procedures which sometimes include rules for leave related for surrogacy. In . May, she pretended to artificially inseminate herself at their home and . announced she was pregnant on May 27, extracting a further £2,700. 'All of this was a sham,' Ms Collins said. Pollard . continued with the faked pregnancy, demanding £150 for further car . maintenance, £795 for rent and £2,000 for new accommodation in June. 'As . far as they were concerned, she was pregnant with their child and they . had to look after her and take care of her,' Ms Collins added. On . July 2, Mrs Barnett asked to see a photograph of Pollard's 11-week . scan. Two days later, Pollard claimed she had been in a car crash and . had lost the baby. The . Barnetts lost contact with Pollard, who ignored their requests for . refunds, until February 2013, when she offered them another baby. Representing Pollard, Jason Taylor said his client was 'remorseful' for her actions. 'She is clearly an intelligent woman,' Mr Taylor said. 'She is somebody who has done something she is thoroughly ashamed of. She will have to live with the consequences for the rest of her life.' Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Mark Gilbert of Avon and Somerset Police appealed for other potential victims to come forward. 'We would like to hear from anyone who feels they have been directly affected by Louise Pollard, as we are still not sure how many couples have put their faith in her, only to be duped in similar circumstances,' he said. The officer said Pollard acted as a surrogate to one family, providing them with two children, but the truth of her arrangement with Omar bin Laden was not known. 'We have had no lines of communication with the Bin Ladens,' Det Con Gilbert said. 'Without knowing the full circumstances, it is difficult to say but I suspect there may have been a similar situation involving them.' He said the two couples involved in the prosecution were still suffering the impact of Pollard's deception. 'It has been an emotional rollercoaster for them,' he said. 'They are still deeply affected by the situation.'","Louise Pollard took cash for cars and homes before saying she miscarried .

"By . Sam Webb . A dog that was almost starved to death by its cruel owner has had to go on a diet - after doubling in weight at an RSPCA rescue centre. Molly the Victorian bulldog was virtually skeletal when she was found at a home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and was so thin rescuers did not realise she was pregnant with three puppies. She weighed just 20kg and underwent an emergency caesarean and lost one of her puppies, but gave birth to youngsters Berkeley and Winston. But after being taken in by the RSPCA last November, four-year-old Molly's weight went up to 38kg. From death's door to diet: Molly the Victorian bulldog was severely malnourished when she was rescued. Now she is thriving so much RSPCA staff are being forced to cut her calories to help her drop the pounds . Horrific: Molly was just 20kg when she was rescued. She was so severely malnourished that RSPCA staff did not even realise she was pregnant with three pups and feared she would not survive . Until the conviction of her previous, . owner Molly was classed as a 'case dog', and was therefore largely . confined to her RSPCA kennel and couldn't get much exercise. She would also eat anything she could get her hands on because of the neglect she suffered. Molly has now gone on a diet - but still have some way to go to reach her ideal weight of 25-30kg. Terry Singh, manager of the Bradford and District RSPCA Centre in West Yorkshire, said: 'When Molly came to us, we didn’t even know she was pregnant because she was so thin. Molly with RSPCA supervisor Robert Jacques. Her previous owner, Caroline Marshall, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was banned from keeping animals for five years . 'You could fit your finger and thumb around her bones. It was shocking to see. But we’ve actually had to put her on a diet because she’s put on nearly 20kg in six months, getting to 38kg at her heaviest. 'She just loves her food. I suppose it was down to lack of nourishment, and she probably didn’t think she would get another meal after what she’d been through. 'But we’re now being very strict with her to get her back to where she should be.' Molly’s previous owner, Caroline Marshall, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was banned from keeping animals for five years by Bradford Magistrates Court on June 4. The mother-of-ten pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and was also given a curfew and was electronically tagged. Terry added: 'When we found her we had to be put her on a drip and we didn’t think she was going to pull through. 'When we realised she was pregnant, we performed an emergency caesarean and she gave birth to two puppies, but a third sadly died. 'It was one of the worst cases we’ve come across. 'We really didn’t think she would make it. She was looked after by the staff here, who cared for her day and night to build her strength. 'She is an absolutely lovely dog now, and Berkeley and Winston are a credit to her.' Terry said the centre wanted to give Molly and her puppies ‘the perfect home’. He said: 'They need to go to people who have the time to care for them and introduce them to their homes.' 'We have had some enquiries already but it will be really sad to see them leave. We’ve all grown really close to Molly and her pups. 'They are all very friendly and have their own unique characters.'

The late Harrison asked all his former bandmates to perform and it would have been the first time the group would have appeared on stage together in the U.S. since 1966. Drummer Ringo Starr and Lennon agreed but McCartney refused due to a rift over the legal problems the Beatles split had caused. But just days before the Concert for .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg today risked derailing a major visit from the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang by accusing Beijing of 'systematic human rights abuses' and claiming he would happily meet the Dalai Lama again. The Deputy Prime Minister said he was 'honoured' to have talks the Tibetan spiritual leader in 2012, despite the meeting plunging relations with China into the deep freeze. Ahead of his visit, Mr Li struck a diffident tone, insisting he wants to show the ‘real China’ and tackle ‘misperceptions and ease misgivings’ about his country. Relations between China and Britain were plunged into the deep freeze in 2012 after Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg met the Dalai Lama . Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said he wanted to use the visit to Britain to change perceptions of his country . His three-day visit, including a rare meeting with the Queen, is expected to focus on trade, investment, commercial opportunities, energy and cultural ties . Relations between China and Britain were strained two years ago after Mr Clegg and Prime Minister David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London. China has always warned foreign governments from holding talks with the Tibetan spiritual leader, who wants his homeland to enjoy self-rule free from Chinese control. Mr Li's visit is seen as an attempt to repair relations, and secure major Chinese investment in the UK. However, speaking at a press conference today, Mr Clegg insisted he had no regrets about meeting the Dalai Lama. 'I have no regrets at all about when David Cameron and I met the Dalai Lama,' he said. 'There are no plans for the Dalai Lama to be met by either David Cameron or myself again but I would be more than honoured to meet him again. 'I would hope that I can meet someone of his distinction some time in the future.' 'Of course we can’t agree on large scale and systematic human rights abuses which still continue in China to this day' While Mr Clegg acknowledged the importance of developing commercial ties with China, he said that did not mean human rights would be ignored during Mr Li's visit, despite Beijing's notorious sensitivity on the issue. 'That doesn't mean that we cannot in a respectful but firm way - as we do, as the Prime Minister did when he was in China recently - point out that we remain deeply, deeply concerned about the very large-scale abuse of human rights that still continues,' he said. 'Of course we can’t agree on large scale and systematic human rights abuses which still continue in China to this day. 'The many journalists who are persecuted. The very widespread use of the death penalty. 'This is a country which is going on an extraordinary journey. We’ve seen economic transformation on a scale possibly unheard of in the modern world, with millions of people have become economically emancipated, although they are still politically shackled to a doctrine which is a one party state, a communist state, which is the antithesis of the kind of open, democratic society I believe in.' Downing Street would only say that 'all issues are on the table in these discussions and there will be no exceptions to that'. David Cameron, who met Mr Li in Beijing last year, has sought to rebuild relations after meeting the Dalai Lama in 2012 . Mr Li has played down China’s global power and says he wants to change the way his country is viewed around the world. Stressing the UK as an ‘important partner of China’, he added in an article in The Times: ‘My visit has a threefold purpose: first, to discuss ways to deepen co-operation in various fields and thus spur the growth of our respective economies; second, to present the real China so as to change misperceptions and ease misgivings; and third, to draw on British perspectives and experience.’ Mr Li stressed that ‘China is a beneficiary and a contributor to peace’ and ‘as a major country on the world stage, China would dedicate itself to securing peace and co-operation’. ‘China is eager to learn from other nations, will keep abreast of the trend of the times, will actively engage in global dialogue, and will promote the 21st century as an era of peace and co-operation.’ He is also unusually frank about China’s process in modernisation, compared to other countries. ‘A latecomer to modernisation and weighed down by weak economic foundations, China lags far behind the United Kingdom and other western countries in many areas’, he added. ‘Its quest for modernisation remains a long and arduous one. As premier, my highest priority is to pursue modernisation through urbanisation and industrialisation.’ In the latest sign of UK attempts to win back the support of Beijing, ministers announced a relaxation of visa restrictions to attract lucrative trade links. Beijing has made clear that difficulties for business leaders and students getting into the UK are contributing to Chinese firms increasingly switching their attention to rival European economies. Ambassador to London Liu Xiaoming recently complained that progress on making it easier for his countrymen to visit Britain had been 'far from enough'. Home Secretary Theresa May will unveil reforms designed to help the UK compete better with France and Germany for deals with firms from what has now become the world's second largest economy.","Chinese Premier says he wants to show Britain the 'real China'

"By . Richard Spillett . The centuries-old divide between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church is a 'scandal', Pope Francis said as he met the Archbishop of Canterbury in Rome. The leader of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide said a goal of full unity between the two churches 'may seem distant' but it remained an aim that should direct their 'every step'. He said progress towards full unity would not be the result of human actions alone, but would be a 'free gift of God'. Pope Francis held a private audience with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at the Vatican today . 'Beneath his merciful gaze, we cannot claim that our division is anything less than a scandal and an obstacle to our proclaiming the Gospel of salvation to the world,' the Pope told Archbishop Justin Welby. 'Our vision is often blurred by the cumulative burden of our divisions and our will is not always free of that human ambition which can accompany even our desire to preach the Gospel as the Lord commanded.' The Pope was speaking as the two men met at the Vatican for the second time since they were installed as leaders of their churches last year. The Archbishop’s visit to Rome, which began on Saturday, focused on work by the churches to eliminate human trafficking and modern-day slavery. Mr Welby described human trafficking and slavery as 'a grave crime' against humanity. He . also praised the Pope’s 'remarkable' care for the poor and suffering, . and his 'passion' for reconciliation, witnessed recently in his visit to . the Middle East. The church leaders met as part of a campaign to tackle human trafficking and modern-day slavery . The Archbishop said he hoped that the collaboration with Pope Francis would lead to an 'effective challenge' to the 'unspeakable disasters of war and conflict' throughout the world. Mr Welby - who gave a gift to the Pope of a cutting from a fig tree in Lambeth Palace planted by the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Pole - added that the Church of England remained 'deeply committed' to ecumenical talks. But he added: 'I realise that there are matters of deep significance that separate us.' The meeting comes as the General Synod is widely expected to give final approval next month to legislation introducing the first woman bishops in the Church of England, making the prospect of unity between the two churches appear more distant. The Roman Catholic Church does not allow women to become priests. The Pope used the talks to call for greater unity between Christian churches and called divisions 'a scandal'","Pope Francis meets Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Rome .

"By . Darren Boyle . and Leon Watson . This breathtaking footage of two wingsuit divers leaping from the top of a 4,600ft high mountain will blow you away. Eager for the ultimate adrenalin rush, the daring duo decided to jump from the top of the Tianmen mountain in China, despite the extreme sport being banned at the risky location. Captured using a GoPro camera, the footage shows the pair soaring alongside a four mile long cable line - the longest in the world. Scroll down for video . Russian daredevils Gelb Vorevodin, purple suit, and Ratmir Nagimianov, blue suit, dive from the top of a 1,400 metre high Chinese mountain for the ultimate thrill . The pair plunge from the mountain into the valley below despite the fact Chinese authorities have outlawed the use of wingsuits from that location as it is so dangerous . As they continued their journey to the valley floor, the pair passed over the most amazing corkscrew roadway that edged along the side of the mountain . Incredibly, Russian divers, Ratmir Nagimianov, 29, and Gleb Vorevodin, 35, managed to get a mere 32ft away from the cable carts, giving Chinese tourists an unlikely surprise. Reaching speeds of over 160mph, the wing-suiters were forced to make split second life or death decisions. Mr Nagimianov said: 'The view was just amazing, it was great to see the tourist buses driving around the curves of the road. He said: 'There is an aerial lift which you can take to get the top of the Tianmen mountain, we were aiming to fly as close the cable carts as possible. 'Because of the high and speed of the initial jump, it was incredibly difficult to line up with the cable carts. 'But on the second jump we got really close, I'd say we were about five metres away. 'We found out that jumps from this area are banned two days before our trip but it was too late to cancel so we knew we just had to go and try, we were constantly worried that someone would stop us from jumping. 'It was an incredible experience and even though it looks amazing on camera, it really doesn't do it justice.' The special wingsuits allow daredevils to 'fly' further than they would if they were using a parachute, but once they approach the ground they pull the cord to land . On the way down the pair flew past the world's longest cable car which travels for an astonishing four miles from the mountain top to the valley floor . At one stage, the pair were just 10 metres away from the cable car, giving stunned Chinese tourists an unexpected photo opportunity . The wingsuit divers also buzzed cars and coaches driving on the mountain road while hurtling along the valley at speeds of up to 160 miles per hour . On the way down, the pair had to dodge high peaks jutting up from the valley floor which could have caused disaster . The pair performed two jumps even though they discovered two days beforehand that such activities had been banned . Mr Nagimianov said 'It was an incredible experience and even though it looks amazing on camera, it really doesn't do it justice'","Russian daredevils reached 160 miles-per-hour after they jumped off the mountain and 'flew' through the valley .

"By . Sam Webb . Serial offender: Teenager Natalie Harvey (pictured with ex-boyfriend Wayne Kinvig) will give birth to her second child in jail . A heavily pregnant teenager once branded 'Britain's worst mother' will give birth to her second child in prison after a judge said it would be the most 'stable' place for her newborn baby. Natalie Harvey, 19, who had her first child at 16, brought misery to her hometown with a campaign of abuse and intimidation against shoppers and council staff. She already has 26 convictions - several for violence - and has been issued an ASBO banning her from several locations in Burnley, Lancashire, including a shopping centre and a library. Harvey was hauled back to court after she launched a ‘shocking’ attack on a woman in a busy McDonald’s restaurant in April. Harvey is currently 31 weeks pregnant by her serial conman ex-boyfriend Wayne Kinvig, 20, who has already served jail terms for charity scams targeting unsuspecting elderly victims with claims he was collecting money for a sick little brother. The couple split last April after she claimed he attacked her - but it is thought she already had a new boyfriend. She was desperate to have the child at liberty but had not been attending all her ante-natal appointments or co-operating with social services. At Burnley Crown Court Judge Simon Newell jailed Harvey for 12 months saying she needed 'stability' and that custody would provide the best chance of the infant being born healthy and give her an opportunity to bond with it. She is expected to give birth in Styal women’s prison in Cheshire in August. Judge Newell told her: 'You have an awfully sad life and background behind you and what’s vitally important, it seems to me, in the next two or three months, in your interests, in your child’s interests, but more particularly in society’s interests, is that there is some stability, some proper medical help and some assistance.' A judge said prison would be the most 'stable' place for Harvey's newborn baby, and that she could access the medical help she and her baby need . Fractured relationship: The couple split last April after she claimed he attacked her - but it is thought she already had a new boyfriend . He added: 'Prison provides punishment and it provides a deterrent and these are the main reasons people go to prison. But, prison also has benefits. 'It can work towards rehabilitation, it can work towards improving somebody’s health and it can work towards stabilisation and it seems to me in these circumstances, despite your best endeavours, that stabilisation, at least for a short period of time, ought to be put in place.' Harvey had been given her interim ASBO in November last year after police said she was 'out of control' and regularly causing trouble across Burnley. She was due to face a full ASBO hearing which would have heard the full extent of her offending. But four days later she was given a supervision order for assaulting a woman called Ann-Marie Gornall and resisting a police officer. Harvey is currently 31 weeks pregnant by her serial conman ex-boyfriend Wayne Kinvig, 20, who has already served jail terms for charity scams targeting unsuspecting elderly victims . Secure: Styal Prison, near Wimslow in Cheshire, where Harvey will give birth to her child . She was also arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and a sexual offence. Her latest court appearance came after she attacked Miss Gornall in McDonalds. She told her: 'You're going to get stabbed up - why have you got me done? You are going to get me sent down for this.' When Miss Gornall tried to leave, Harvey grabbed her, pulled her to the floor and kicked her repeatedly. One horrified diner shouted out to Harvey: 'This is a public place.' They later told police the assault was completely unprovoked, malicious and shocking. Staff and customers went to assist Miss Gornall, who did not suffer any visible injuries. Harvey made no comment when questioned by police but admitted witness intimidation. Prolific: Harvey was also arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and a sexual offence. She was given an interim ASBO in November last year after police said she was 'out of control' At an earlier hearing her barrister Tim Brennand said his client was a 'product of the care system'. She was fostered and placed into care at the age of three, had been moved from institution to institution and became a mother at the age of 16. She has also recently discovered her biological father had been murdered. He added: 'There had been issues in relation to substance abuse, no stability, no job, no parental figure and no control. 'When I first met her, she had poor eye contact, was rebellious, had clear disregard for her social worker and seemed to resent and resist efforts being made to help and assist her. Violent: Harvey's latest court appearance came after she attacked a woman in McDonalds, throwing her to the floor and kicking her . 'She behaved almost like a caged animal. 'Although she didn’t know it, she was crying out for help and attention. 'She has exasperated just about everyone who has offered her help. The citizens of Burnley are heartily weary of her but she is equally heartily weary of Burnley. 'She doesn’t want to give birth in Styal. She shows the first glimmerings of maturing. 'This year, she is offence-free. That is a small landmark, given her record. 'She is really trying to put her life in some semblance of order.' During last Thursday’s hearing Mr Brennand said his client had recently been approached by a celebrity magazine to give an interview about her life of crime. He said: 'It may be its a reflection of the Kardashian culture that we perhaps live in that a sad story of a girl from Burnley should make its way to the national press as it did. 'She should by rights go to prison but giving birth in custody might have a profound effect on her psychologically. 'All she’s got are the people that she can pass off as friends and no structured support whatsoever.' He said Harvey had gone to ground after she was 'assaulted' by her former partner and left him and her level and degree of co-operation with social services and the maternity unit was causing grave concern. Mr Brennand added: 'She is terrified that, having split from the child’s father, that it’s inevitably going to be that the child will be taken from her at birth. 'She is a victim, once again, of her circumstances. She is a victim of the choices she has made. 'She must bear some responsibility for the choices she makes in life. She’s kept out of trouble. 'There’s no need for this next child to be born at HMP Styal.' Police said locals have not made any complaints about Harvey since she was issued with her ASBO, which bans her from using abusive or threatening behaviour, or hand gestures. Burnley Council are also seeking a 'closure order' on her flat to stop anyone entering or living there.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . William Hague today dismissed 'ridiculous' criticism of his decision to spend four days with Hollywood star Angelina Jolie while war raged in Iraq. The Foreign Secretary appeared to accuse Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys of not asking intelligent questions about his appearances with Miss Jolie and her husband Brad Pitt. Mr Hague insisted the star-studded summit to end sexual violence against women in war did not divert his attention away from the crisis of the day, stressing the UK government was 'entirely capable of doing both'. Scroll down for video . Foreign Secretary William Hague poses for photographs with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie on Thursday, the third day of the summit to end sexual violence in conflict . Mr Hague faced criticism for spending four days at the summit, while remaining almost silent on the ongoing conflict in Iraq . Miss Jolie and Mr Hague launched a joint campaign in 2012 to fight sexual violence in war. It came after she wrote and directed a film, called In the Land of Blood and Honey, in 2011 set during the Bosnian war. Up to 50,000 women were raped during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. Last week the pair hosted a four-day summit in London, which culminated in a new international protocol which they hope will 'shatter the culture of impunity' around sexual violence in war. However, it meant that as Islamist jihadists swept through large areas of Iraq, Mr Hague was posing for photographs with two of the world's biggest film stars. Miss Jolie also made a trip to Downing Street, where she was pictured smiling in the sunshine with David Cameron. Today Mr Hague insisted the government was capable of focussing on immediate problems while also addressing long-term issues, like sexual violence in war at the summit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Anybody who thinks that should have been there, should have come along to it... This is about conflict prevention. 'It brought together most of the world. We’re not going to solve conflicts of the many sorts we debate on this programme unless we address these appalling crimes. 'The idea that you can never deal with long-term issues because there’s always something short-term, I always find rather ridiculous.' Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall also met Miss Jolie and Mr Hague during a private meeting at Clarence House . He stressed that he had been able to hold talks about Iraq with US Secretary of State John Kerry, who had been in London for the summit. And in apparent swipe at Mr Humphrys for even asking the question, he added: 'With respect, I think the basis of your question has less basis than most of the highly intelligent questions.' The summit attracted delegations from 123 countries. Organisers, hope it will pave the way for more support for survivors of rape of warzones, and a commitment to bring perpetrators to justice as well as ‘raising awareness dramatically’ of the crimes across the world. Mr Hague added: 'We’re trying to change global attitudes all over the world, which governments alone cannot do. And foreign policy today involves working with different people outside government – NGOs, civil society, people who can reach people who never listen to governments. 'We’re trying to effect a change in attitudes of the entire world so that the terrible violence meted out to vulnerable people, particularly women all over the world, can be brought to an end or can be greatly diminished. 'And I think we should make those alliances to do that. We don’t stop doing that work because we’re dealing also with the crisis of the day. We’re entirely capable in the British government of doing both.' Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Miss Jolie to Downing Street on Tuesday . At the closing ceremony of the summit on Friday, Miss Jolie said she will work with Mr Hague and others for 'as long as it takes' to prevail in the struggle of sexual violence in conflict. She said the work begun at the summit is 'very, very much linked' with violence against women in other contexts, such as the kidnap of the schoolgirls in Nigeria or the recent rape cases in India and Pakistan. She added: 'One of the most heartening aspects of this summit has been to see so many male leaders prepared to confront the taboo surrounding sexual violence in conflict. Indeed I believe one of the outcomes of this summit is that this subject is now firmly on the top table of international diplomacy and we will work to ensure that it stays there…it goes to the heart of international peace and security.’ On Saturday it was announced Jolie had been made a dame by Mr Hague.","Foreign Secretary defends four-day summit on sexual violence in conflict .

"By . Oliver Todd . Former England midfielder Gareth Barry has hit out at criticism of Wayne Rooney, saying that every England player would want Roy Hodgson to stick with the Manchester United man against Uruguay. Barry, who played alongside Rooney for the Three Lions at the South Africa 2010 World Cup, also claims England need the 28-year-old if they are 'going to do something' in this summer's tournament. Rooney came under fire for a below par performance against Italy in England's World Cup opener, despite laying on an assist for Daniel Sturridge in the first-half. Point to prove: Rooney weaves around a plastic defender in training as he aims to prove his doubters wrong . Old friends: Rooney and Barry played alongside each other for England, pictured here in 2009 . And Barry says Rooney's telling contribution in Manaus showed just why England would be lost without him. 'How many forwards playing out of position on the left wing could produce a cross like that with their weaker foot?' said Barry on social media app Fanzai. 'I can’t believe there’s a debate on whether Wayne Rooney should be starting for England. He has to be one of the first names on the sheet. Valuable asset: Barry says Rooney's team-mates will still see him as the first player they want on the field . 'I assure you every player in that changing room would want him in the team. If we are going to do something at this tournament which I still think we definitely can we need Wayne Rooney in the side.' Rooney is without a goal in nine World Cup appearances but was not helped by being placed out on the left wing against Italy, rather than in his favoured number 10 role. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, touted as a potential replacement for Rooney, took another step towards full fitness on Monday, taking part in his first training session since picking up a knee injury. South Africa: Barry was part of Fabio Capello's squad, with Rooney, that crashed out against Germany . Big character: Barry says Rooney is a big favourite with the squad, as he shares a joke with Raheem Sterling . Rooney admitted his placed was under-threat on Monday and said: ‘Why would I feel my place in the team is guaranteed?' 'I work hard to try and get into that team. I’ve never said my place is guaranteed. I don’t expect to play. ‘We have got a lot of good, young players. We all give the manager different options and whoever he picks then I’m sure we will all respect that.’ Stand-out player: Rooney needs to finally net a World Cup goal if he is going to prove the doubters wrong .","Rooney's former team-mate still ranks him as England's best option .

"With a wing span of up to 2.74 metres, it's safe to say that most small prey don't stand a chance against Australia's wedge-tail eagle. But one tiny joey learnt that lesson the hard way, when it was snatched up by Australia's largest bird of prey for a meal. Keen outback photographer, Wendy Kerr, described the emotional moment she managed to capture the snaps in regional Queensland. Keen photographer Wendy Kerr, captured the moment a mighty Wedged-tailed eagle captured a joey in its talons . 'Came across this Wedgie at Mitchell, QLD, on the side of the road, then he flew off with what I first thought was a rabbit,' Ms Kerr wrote in her picture captions. 'I zoomed in on him as I was at least 100 metres away, and realised he had a joey. 'I know I just captured what happens in nature, but it dented my soul and hurt my heart and I was very sad for days, yeh I know I should harden up... but what can I say, he is just feeding himself as he knows....April 2014.' Snapped in regional Queensland, Ms Kerr described the moment as an emotional one, but concluded 'he is just feeding himself as he knows' Wedge-tailed eagles' main diets often consist of rabbits, wallabies and small kangaroos, however sometimes large groups of the fearsome bird will work together to take down larger sized prey, according to Australia Zoo. While rabbits make up almost 70 per cent of their prey, the eagles are also known to eat carrion, or already dead animals, including road-kill. Far from choosy, they are found across a variety of habitats throughout Australia, including over forests and open country on plains and mountains.

"By . Sam Webb . A man whose pregnant partner was killed by his two pit bull-type dogs had threatened social workers with one of the animals months before the death, a court has heard. Mother-of-four Emma Bennett, 27, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, died after she was attacked by the dogs called Bella and Dollar at her home last December. A previous court hearing was told how epilepsy sufferer Emma may have suffered a fit which could have led the two dogs to see her as prey. Pregnant Emma Bennett was killed by her two dogs at her home in Leeds. Lee Horner threatened to set one of the dogs on two social workers who visited the house in July last year a court heard . Lee Horner, 34, admitted owning dogs prohibited by the the Dangerous Dogs Act at Leeds Magistrates' Court. A district judge heard how two women social workers visited the house in July last year and Horner told one of them: 'Shut it or I'll set the dog on you.' Prosecutor Vincent O'Malley told the court that Horner told the other social worker, who was eight months pregnant at the time: 'What you looking at? Wait until I get the dog and see if you continue looking at me like that.' Mr Malley described how Horner was out when police arrived at the house he shared with Miss Bennett in December after being alerted by neighbours who heard a noise they first thought was an argument. He said Miss Bennett was heard to shout: 'No, no, no.' The two officers went inside after getting no response. Neighbours heard Miss Bennett shout: 'No, no, no' when officers went inside after getting no response at the home in Leeds. The found her hanging off the sofa and the dogs had blood around their mouths . Mr O'Malley said: 'They were met by the two dogs - Bella and Dollar. Both had blood on their snouts and appeared excited. 'They noticed drops of blood in the doorway and on the carpet and went into the living room. There, they saw Emma Bennett lying motionless on the floor. Her legs were on the sofa. The dogs were examined by experts and found to have sufficient characteristics to be a banned breed of pit bull type dogs. File picture . 'She had extensive injuries, particularly around her facial area and her head.' The prosecutor said the officers performed first aid on Ms Bennett and they found both dogs 'excitable but not aggressive' as they did this. Miss Bennett was taken to hospital but did not survive, Mr O'Malley said. Emma was pregnant with her fifth child. The dogs were examined by experts and found to have sufficient characteristics to be a banned breed of pit bull-type dogs. When Horner was interviewed by police he confirmed joint ownership of the dogs and said he bought Dollar 12 to 14 months previously, believing he was a 'Staffy'. Bella was given to Horner by his brother approximately four months prior to the incident after her original owner found her to be too excitable. Horner told police that Bella would sleep with him and Emma. Deputy District Judge Tim Spruce said he will decide this afternoon whether to sentence Horner today or whether to order a pre-sentence report. After hearing from Narinder Rathour, defending, how the death of his partner has affected the defendant, Mr Spruce has already ruled out a prison sentence. Horner, who has 39 previous offences but none relating to dangerous dogs, has suffered from anxiety since the death of his partner and  has difficulty sleeping. Mr Spruce decided to adjourn the case for a pre-sentence report to be prepared. He told Horner he will be sentenced at the same court in early July.","Emma Bennett, 27, was pregnant with her fifth child when she waskilled .

"By . John Hall . The BBC and ITV face a fresh wave of anger over their World Cup coverage, after viewers attacked pundits for struggling to speak and understand English during broadcasts. Former Brazil midfielder Juninho and Italian defender Fabio Cannavaro were singled out for presenting styles which bordered on the incomprehensible, and for a failure to understand their co-presenters' analysis. The fury comes after the BBC received 445 complaints over Phil Neville's 'boring' commentary style during Saturday night's match between England and Italy, which averaged 14.4 million viewers.

Both the BBC and ITV have come under attack for employing presenters with an apparently limited grasp of the English language, with Juninho, 41, and Cannavaro, 40, taking much of the blame. During the BBC's coverage of last night's match between Argentina and Bosnia, one Twitter user wrote: 'I'm sorry but why is Juninho on the panel? His English just isn't up to scratch.' During an earlier appearance by Cannavaro, another user said: 'They should provide English speaking courses and tests for the pundits before allowing them on ITV or even BBC. Cannavaro is struggling.' 'Incredible defender, but Cannavaro sounds like he's put 'conversational English' on his CV and ITV took him at his word,' another added.

"By . Leon Osman . Leon Osman returns for his latest Footballers' Football Column, all about the World Cup. Osman was not selected by Roy Hodgson for a place in Brazil this summer but was involved in the England squad during the qualifying campaign. He runs the rule over England's first game of the campaign against Italy, the unfortunate nature of their defeat and how they can improve going forward. Well, where do I start? After all of the hype and excitement over the last few weeks, our opening game of the World Cup ended in defeat. However, losing to the 2006 World Champions was certainly no disgrace and I felt that there were plenty of positives to take from the performance. I thought the selection was bold in the first place and that the lads gave a good account of themselves but football is a results business, especially in a World Cup competition when you only have three games to get it right, and we are now in a perilous position with only one game played. Frustration: England were a bit unfortunate to lose to Italy, according to Leon Osman . That isn’t to say it’s not possible. The flair, speed and dynamism which we showed in Manaus was far more entertaining than any of the England games I have watched in our last few tournaments, and it leaves me very optimistic that we can get the necessary results against Uruguay and Costa Rica to make it to the knockout stage. Despite the defeat against Italy I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and felt right up until the referee blew the final whistle that we were capable of getting an equalising goal, and that hasn’t always been the case in the past. I expected Andrea Pirlo to be a class act and I wasn’t disappointed. He pulled the strings for an Italian side that was terrific in possession. He is such an intelligent player he never seems to get caught in possession. In fact, each of their midfield players looked comfortable when receiving the ball in tight spaces and that’s the mark of quality. Plenty of short passes and a very patient approach, which worked in really humid conditions. Pass master: Andrea Pirlo recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent against England . Italy only pressed forward when they were ready so they were able to conserve energy and retain control of the ball. It’s true that they didn’t hurt us too much when they did attack us but I thought they wore us down over the course of the 90 minutes. England looked sharp and exciting and, as I stated, that’s really not the norm from us in these tournaments. Ironically, we posed more of an attacking threat than Italy but they always looked more in control. When our attacks broke down we always seemed to be expending more energy trying to re-shape to cope with any counter moves. And let me tell you, it’s mentally harder to run about when you haven’t got the ball. If I was disappointed in any aspect of the England display it was that we didn’t capitalise on our goal. We didn’t force ourselves on the Italians after drawing level. With the pace in our midfield and attack I would have liked us to have been a bit braver after Sturridge’s goal. Celebration: England players celebrate after Daniel Sturridge nets the equaliser . We certainly have a goal threat in us and if we keep clean sheets against our next two opponents then I have no doubt that we can win the games. The matches against Uruguay and Costa Rice will present different challenges to those we faced against Italy. I think both those teams will allow us to attack them more and try to frustrate us. It will be even more crucial not to concede the first goal. As for my team-mates against Italy, I thought Phil Jagielka was outstanding. His goal-line clearance was typical of him. He read the situation early enough to get himself into a position to be able to head the ball away and save a certain goal. It was a testing night for Leighton Baines defensively. I felt sorry for him. He was left 2 v 1 on numerous occasions, and at this level the top players will make you pay for that. It also meant he couldn’t bomb forward like he does at Everton which is a big part of his game. Clearance: Phil Jagielka heading the ball off the line following Mario Balotelli's shot on goal . When he does that for Everton he knows he’ll be well covered if the forward move breaks down. I’m not sure he has that confidence with England. People have stated that he didn’t get enough help from Wayne Rooney and that could be right but then I don’t think wide left is Wayne’s best position. Having trained and played with Wayne many times I believe he should be right behind the front one or two. It gives him more freedom and as a truly world class player he has the ability to unlock any defence that this World Cup can offer. Bainesy and Wayne will make a big impact on the World Cup, of that I have no doubt. Struggle: Wayne Rooney had a tricky night on the left for England on Saturday . And so can Ross Barkley. I was made up when he came on and I thought he gave a really mature display. His passing was accurate and that’s essential in the conditions and he gave Roy Hodgson something to think about. I personally would start Ross against Uruguay. The kid looks so ready to take his opportunity and he looks like the World Cup stage is perfect for him. Finally, our next game will bring together Jags and Luis Suarez. There’s no doubt that Suarez is also a world class talent and he deservedly won our Footballer of the Year award but he’s not 100percent fit, that much seems clear. His country looked ordinary without him against Costa Rica and I am confident that Jags and Gary Cahill can look after him on Thursday. It’s not a case of ‘stop Suarez and you stop Uruguay’ because they have other good players but he’s their king-pin. He’s the one they need firing on all cylinders and stopping him will be crucial for our World Cup dreams. He will be desperate to put one over on England, you can be sure of that! Not as much as he seems to like putting one over Everton! Waiting: Luis Suarez should be fit to face England after sitting out Uruguay's defeat to Costa Rica . But he’ll be keen to do well when he knows our whole country is watching him and willing him to fail on the night. I’m really looking forward to watching our next game now. The exciting manner in which we played shows we can watch England and be very entertained at the same time. However, It’s win or bust against Uruguay for us now. We simply have to make sure that we get the three points. If we win and Italy and Costa Rica draw it throws the group wide open. If we win and Italy win it puts them clear and us level with our final opponents but if we win and Costa Rica win then it means ...oh let’s just look after ourselves hey! Let’s leave the permutations and consequences until Friday morning. I just hope you’re all enjoying it because I am.","Osman thinks England gave a good account of themselves against Italy .

"By . David Kent . The animal oracle predictions for the World Cup have begun, with host nation Brazil getting a vote of confidence from its chosen turtle tipster. By making a patriotic choice of food, loggerhead turtle Big Head predicted Tuesday that the host nation will beat Croatia in the opening game of the World Cup on Thursday. Big Head is Brazil’s answer to Germany’s Paul the Octopus, who started the psychic animal craze during the 2010 World Cup and spawned a slew of imitations around the world. Turtle tipster: Big Head the loggerhead turtle is backing Brazil to beat Croatia in the World Cup opener . Humble beginnings: The craze for animal oracles began with Paul the Octopus in 2010 . At the Praia do Forte turtle sanctuary north of Salvador, the 25-year-old male sea turtle was given the choice between eating a fish hung from a Brazilian flag or a Croatian flag. After attempting to eat the fish hung from a football indicating a draw, Big Head chose the one representing Brazil. The small crowd of onlookers cheered in appreciation of Big Head’s choice. P.S. Brazil's new sensation is not the first Big Head in football. Brian Clough was famously known as Old Big 'Ead for his self-confidence and acerbic opinions. Pretenders: China will use a squad of Panda cubs to conduct their predictions this time round . Caught out: Paul eventually came unstuck when Germany lost to Spain in the World Cup semi-finals .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Queen rolled out the red carpet for China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang today as part of his three-day official visit to Britain designed to ease diplomatic tensions - and win billions of pounds in business contracts. Her Majesty welcomed Mr Li and his wife at Windsor Castle alongside Prince Andrew before crunch talks in Number 10 this afternoon. At the Downing Street meeting, China's 30 year ban on British beef is expected to be lifted. A raft of other business deals will be announced to coincide with the visit, but Mr Cameron is also under pressure to raise concerns about China’s human rights record. Scroll down for video . The Queen received Chinese premier Li Keqiang at Windsor Castle today during his first official visit to the UK . The Chinese PM (left) and his wife Cheng Hong (right) arrived at Windsor Castle in a fleet of limousines on the first full day of a three day visit . Her Majesty received the Chinese delegation in Windsor Castle's White Drawing Room with the Duke of York, Prince Andrew . Relations between China and Britain were strained two years ago after Mr Clegg and Prime Minister David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London. China has always warned foreign governments from holding talks with the Tibetan spiritual leader, who wants his homeland to enjoy self-rule free from Chinese control. Mr Li's visit is seen as a breakthrough in Sino-British affairs and key to securing major Chinese investment in the UK. Mr Cameron wants to secure agreement on the ending the Chinese ban on imports of British beef and lamb. Restrictions were imposed by the Chinese in response to the BSE outbreak in the 1980s. It is expected that formal official-level talks will begin on opening up a market which could be worth up to £120 million to the British economy. Mr Cameron and Mr Li will tuck into lunch in Downing Street which will be prepared by Manchester-based catering firm Sweet Mandarin. In addition to the official functions, Mr Li and his wife Cheng Hong are expected to have what Chinese officials described as 'tete-a-tete interactions' with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha to 'build up trust and consolidate close working and personal relations'. The Chinese premier is also due to meet Labour leader Ed Miliband during his visit, although he is not expected to be holding any talks with Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg. But the highlight of Mr Li's visit was this morning's meeting with the Queen. The Chinese leader was greeted with a smile and a handshake by the Queen, who was joined by the Duke of York in the White Drawing Room this morning. Prince Andrew had been waiting outside to meet Mr Li and his party when they swept into the castle’s quadrangle in a fleet of limousines. Other deals due to be announced to coincide with the premier's visit include Chinese financial services group Nord Engine making up to £150 million available to invest in UK and European small and medium enterprises. China Minsheng Investment Corporation will open its European headquarters in London, with around 1.5 billion US dollars (£883 million) of investments in a range of sectors. Oil giant BP is expected to sign a £5billion deal to supply liquid gas to China while Royal Dutch Shell will form an alliance with Cnooc.

David Cameron, flanked by the Foreign Secretary William Hague to his right and the Chancellor  George Osborne to his left held talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and his delegation in Downing Street after a photoshoot outside Number 10 . British beef has been banned from China for 30 years after the outbreak of BSE, but ministers hope to secure a deal on allowing imports today . Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said he wanted to use the visit to Britain to change perceptions of his country . However, the trade deals could be overshadowed by a row over China’s human rights record and Britain’s contact with the Dalai Lama. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg risked causing upset yesterday by accusing Beijing of 'systematic human rights abuses' and claiming he would happily meet the Dalai Lama again. The Deputy Prime Minister said he was 'honoured' to have talks the Tibetan spiritual leader in 2012, despite the meeting plunging relations with China into the deep freeze. While Mr Clegg acknowledged the importance of developing commercial ties with China, he said that did not mean human rights would be ignored during Mr Li's visit, despite Beijing's notorious sensitivity on the issue. 'That doesn't mean that we cannot in a respectful but firm way - as we do, as the Prime Minister did when he was in China recently - point out that we remain deeply, deeply concerned about the very large-scale abuse of human rights that still continues,' he said. 'Of course we can’t agree on large scale and systematic human rights abuses which still continue in China to this day. 'The many journalists who are persecuted. The very widespread use of the death penalty. 'This is a country which is going on an extraordinary journey. We’ve seen economic transformation on a scale possibly unheard of in the modern world, with millions of people have become economically emancipated, although they are still politically shackled to a doctrine which is a one party state, a communist state, which is the antithesis of the kind of open, democratic society I believe in.' Relations between China and Britain were plunged into the deep freeze in 2012 after David Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg met the Dalai Lama . Campaigners have called on Mr Cameron to directing Mr Li over the country's human rights record. A coalition of human rights organisations urged Mr Cameron to discuss the situation in Tibet and make a public statement calling for the Chinese government to commit to reforms. Tibet Society chief executive Philippa Carrick said: 'The visit of Premier Li to the UK is being purported to herald a new era of Chinese investment in the UK, however, it could also herald a worrying level of influence by China in the UK. 'David Cameron must be clear that universal values of human and civil rights are integral to any engagement we have with China and Britain's relationship with China cannot be just about trade and economics.' Shao Jiang, a survivor of the Tiananmen Square massacre and member of Cuts UK said: 'The UK must not be bullied by China. The Chinese government seeks to deflect criticism from its human rights record by threatening withdrawal of trade.'","Chinese Premier Li Keqiang continues visit with meeting with the Queen .

Michael Owen professed it would be a ‘perfect day’ if his horse Brown Panther was to triumph in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot on Thursday afternoon and England’s young stallions followed up by beating Uruguay in Brazil. But Owen has more faith in Brown Panther doing the business than England reaching the latter stages of the tournament. ‘I think Brown Panther is more likely to win than England are to reach the semi-finals,’ said Owen, ‘England’s group is very hard, it’s toss of a coin to get out of the group. If they do then maybe the quarters but then it’s a potential meeting with Spain or Brazil - and they’ll have too much.’ Gold contender: Owen's pride and joy Brown Panther is gunning for Gold Cup glory at Ascot on Thursday . Top team: Owen with Tom Dascombe, his trainer at Manor House Stables . Owen is sending the strongest team yet from Manor House Stables to Royal Ascot this week and his beloved six-year-old Brown Panther, trained by Tom Dascombe, is the headline act. ‘We always saw him as a long term project, we didn’t over race him as a baby and now he’s doing exactly what should be in many ways. His two races this season have been exceptional. He’s in as good a form as ever and has a good chance but I keep telling myself to have a horse running in a race like this is staggering. Even if he tailed off last, he’s still the best horse I’m ever likely to own, he’s the apple of my eye.’ Owen began to plan for Manor House Stables in his mid-20’s, knowing he would require something to occupy his time after his football career had finished. It has now grown to 95 horses. England will need a big performance from the likes of Daniel Sturridge on Thursday night . Must win: Roy Hodgson knows Thursday's game is now huge after Saturday's defeat against Italy . ‘I see too many people finishing football then considering what next and it’s a bit too late by then,’ he said, ‘I’ve got a few businesses. Horse racing is only 10% of my life. The main focus of my life is still football, commentating and running a management company for young footballers. ‘In many ways nurturing horses is the same as nurturing footballers. I’m interested in the mechanics of what makes someone fast, or able to run for longer or further. If I got injured it was always “Why? How? What happened to my body? How do we piece it back together and make sure it’s stronger so can’t happen again.” Horses are mammals, their muscles work identically to humans. The only thing that’s different is they cant speak.’ Owen sat on a horse for the first time last year under the instruction of his wife, Louise. He compared the pressure on jockeys at Royal Ascot to the England football team in Brazil. ‘I think . the pressure is all relative,’ said Owen, ‘Royal Ascot is their world . cup so it’s about how they handle it. The pressure in their mind will be . as great as ever the same as for a footballer at the World Cup. “But . they can handle it because they know they can do it. Put me on a first . tee of a golf course with 100 people watching and I’m petrified.

Royal winner: Owen (centre) and the Bown Panther team after their colt won the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2011 . Owen pleaded for Hodgson to be bold and play the youngsters in his squad so one of them might experience the same life changing tournament as he did in France in 1998. ‘I hope the likes of Barkley, Sterling and Lallana get a big say in it because I think they can do well,’ he said, ‘I think our strength lies in some of these young unproven players that are quick, had good seasons, are not scarred from past failures and have self belief. I can only look back to how I felt going into a World Cup. Instead of fearing who you play against as you do later on, it’s totally the opposite as a kid.

"By . Freya Noble . The former superior of a NSW Marist Brothers community and deputy principal of a school for 600 students has told an inquiry he did not associate child sexual abuse with crime in the 1980s. Brother Anthony Hunt was head of the Lismore Marist community to which Gregory Sutton - who was later jailed for sexually assaulting 15 children - was attached from 1985 to 1987. Brother Hunt was also deputy principal of the Marist Trinity College in Lismore which had 600 students at the time. Brother Anthony Hunt has told a royal commission that during the 1980s he was not aware that child sex abuse was a crime . On Tuesday he gave evidence at the royal commission into child sexual abuse that although concerns were raised with him about the behaviour of Sutton at St Carthage's primary school, he left it to the school to deal with it. Towards the end of two-and-a-half hours of evidence he said he considered complaints of inappropriate behaviour by Sutton as 'excessive expressions of affection' and had not heard the word pedophile at the time. Brother Hunt said he left complaints about Gregory Sutton, now a convicted paedophile, for the school to deal with . 'When you give that answer, that as the deputy principal of that Catholic college in the mid-to-late 80s in this nation, you did not understand that the sexual assault of children was a crime?' Presiding Commissioner Justice Jennifer Coate asked. Brother Hunt responded 'I would have to say that's correct at the time.' Justice Coate asked him if he accepted that part of his role was to protect children. 'What is the difficulty that you have with accepting that it was a crime,' Justice Coate asked. Justice Coate asked him if he had seen media reports at the time about people charged with sexual offences against children. 'I don't specifically remember, but I can't rule it out,' Brother Hunt said. Justice Coate asked 'Is that a serious answer to the Royal Commission, Brother?', To which Brother Hunt replied it was the best he could do with his understanding at the time. He said at the time he saw it as his duty to pass on concerns about brothers to the provincial and deputy provincial of the order who headed the community in Australia. Brother Hunt said his awareness grew in time and in retrospect he was sorry for the 'great harm that was done to children'. Meantime, Swimming Australia's response to child sexual abuse allegations made against two high profile coaches is to come under the spotlight at a royal commission next month. Former Australian swimming coaches Scott Volkers (pictured) and Terry Buck both had child sexual abuse claims made against them . The commission will examine Swimming Australia's reaction to claims made against Olympic coaches Scott Volkers and Terry Buck. Mr Volkers, the former coach of Samantha Riley and Susie O'Neill, was charged in early 2002 with the indecent dealing of three teenage girls he coached in the mid-1980s. Those charges were dropped six months later. Sexual abuse allegations surfaced against Mr Buck in 2009, four years after his death. Former Olympian Greg Rogers claimed he and his brother were abused by Mr Buck as swimmers in the 1960s. His widow denied all the allegations. Samantha Riley (left) and Susie O’Neill (right) were both coached by Mr Volkers, who was charged in 2002 with indecent dealings with three teenage girls in the 1980s . Mr Buck represented Australia at the Olympics as a swimmer at the 1964 Tokyo Games, head swimming coach at the 1984 Games and as swimming team manager in Barcelona and Atlanta. The commission will also look at the response of the Scone Swimming Club to the convictions of Stephen John Roser for indecent assault and for committing acts of indecency against a child. A public hearing is set to start on July 7 in Sydney as part of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse.","Brother Anthony Hunt told royal commission he didn't understand sexual assault on children was a crime .

"By . Marcus Townend . Toronado is primed to give trainer Richard Hannon a Royal Ascot winner with his first ever runner when lining up in Tuesday's curtain-raising Queen Anne Stakes. It is a massive day for the man who took over running the family stable from five-time champion trainer father, Richard snr, at the start of the year. He also saddles his 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder against Kingman, the colt which chased him home at Newmarket, in the feature St James's Palace Stakes. Primed: Toronado has attracted the most confident update from Richard Hannon . That promises to be a re-match to settle the arguments still hanging in the air. But it is Toronado, the mount of Richard Hughes, who has attracted the most confident update from Hannon. The colt, owned by Sheik Joaan Al Thani, has not run since trailing in last of six in York's 10-furlong Juddmonte International Stakes in August. The son of High Chaparral had previously proved himself one of the best milers of his generation with victory in the Sussex Stakes, a success which followed an agonising short-head defeat by Dawn Approach in last year's St James's Palace Stakes. Back at that trip, he is a hot favourite for the first of three group one races on the strongest day's programme at this glittering five-day Festival. Hannon said: 'Toronado is in great nick. He is the most awesome horse we have ever trained. Yes, he will improve for the race but I would be disappointed if he didn't win. 'He is awesome when he works and that has not changed from last year. 'He had a break and was not right after the Juddmonte but he is back right now. He is near unbeatable at a mile when he is right and the guys who ride him out each day tell me he is in fantastic form.' Big day: Richard Hannon is looking for his first Royal Ascot winner after taking over the family stable . Eighty winner on board by Royal  Ascot is a start Hannon would have settled for. The big one  was Night Of Thunder's Guineas win, a Classic victory which sent out a message that it was business as usual at the biggest stable in the land despite a change of chief executive. The 2,000 Guineas , which also featured Derby winner and runner-up, Australia and Kingston Hill, in third and eighth respectively, is looking a quality renewal but its tactical nature â€“ the field split into two separate groups â€“ left some feeling Kingman was an unlucky loser. That view did not diminish when Kingman dashed home five lengths clear in the Irish 2,000 Guineas under jockey James Doyle. Added spice to the re-match is provided by the fact that Hannon and Gosden are battling it out for the trainer's title race, with Hannon only Â£70,000 ahead. But Hannon, who also saddles Guineas seventh Toormore in the race, is unfazed by those who think Night Of Thunder got lucky on the Rowley Mile. He said: 'I see no reason for a reversal (in the form). We finished from behind Kingman at Newmarket and our horse also swerved. They should be  6-4 joint favourites. 'Kingman was impressive in the Irish Guineas but we are very happy with our fella.' If the battles on the track promise to be as intense, there is a more than a fascinating sideshow off it concerning broadcaster Channel 4 and its viewing figures. Having taken a big plunge on Derby day, there is nervousness around the industry that there will be a similar trend at the sport's showcase Flat meeting. C4 have called up the celebrity cavalry to add some pizzazz to their output in the form of fashion guru Gok Wan and the weighing room's best known face Frankie Dettori, who will be a pundit between riding commitments, something his boss Sheik Joaan surprisingly appears happy to happen. But halting the fall is a challenge you would not back International Rescue to pull off. Moving away from the BBC to saddle up with a minority channel has inevitably meant a lower profile for the sport. It will probably need another win for the Queen's Estimate in Thursday's Gold Cup to place racing at the centre of the sporting agenda in such a packed wider schedule dominated by the World Cup. No one should be holding their breath waiting for a upturn in viewers although, sources insist, talk of imminent crisis talks with the broadcaster a year and a half into a four-year rights deal is premature.","Hannon targeting Ascot glory after taking over running of family stable .

"By . Associated Press . Pedophile Marist brother Gregory Sutton attended and probably organised the funeral of a young man he had molested as a boy, an inquiry has been told . A pedophile Marist brother attended and probably organised the funeral of a young man he had molested as a boy, an inquiry has been told. The man's family later learned of the link between their son's suicide and the fact he had been molested by Gregory Sutton when he was just eight or nine while attending a Marist Brothers primary school in North Queensland in the 1970s. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was told on Monday that Sutton, who has since served 12 years in jail for sexually assaulting boys, offered to arrange the funeral of the boy - referred to as ADO - who committed suicide in 1989. The former brother was later confronted by the father of ADO and confessed he had molested him. Sutton who had been moved from Queensland to schools in NSW was living at the brothers' house on the grounds of St Joseph's College at Hunters Hill in Sydney in 1989. He was visited there by ADO's father, accompanied by John Holdsworth, superior of the Marist community which ran the primary and secondary schools in North Queensland. ADO's father went to Br Holdsworth after ADO's brother told the family he had been abused by Sutton. 'I was quite shocked because Sutton had offered to arrange the funeral,' Br Holdsworth told the commission. He knew Sutton was friendly with the family and had been at their home and he understood he had attended the funeral and 'probably organised it'. After the meeting at St Joseph's, ADO's father told Br Holdsworth that Sutton admitted he had 'interfered with ADO'. Sutton was moved from the Queensland school to live at the brothers' house on the grounds of St Joseph's College at Hunters Hill (pictured) in Sydney in 1989. It was here that he was visited by ADO's father, accompanied by John Holdsworth, superior of the Marist community . Br Howard reportedly moved Sutton 'to Sydney for counselling' He was pressed by counsel assisting the commission, Simeon Beckett, if he knew that what Sutton had confessed to was a criminal offence. 'I can't give a specific answer as to why at the time I did not take that view,' Br Holdsworth said. He later said it did not occur to him to go to police because it was not in his realm and he had the impression ADO's father did not want him to. Earlier on Monday, the former principal of the primary school Denis Doherty told of his anger when Sutton was arrested two decades after he had first reported him to the then provincial of the Marist Order, Charles Howard. He said he raised his concerns with Br Howard who paid an annual visit to the school and reassured him: 'It sounds serious. We will move him to Sydney for counselling.' Counsel assisting the commission, Simeon Beckett (pictured), asked Br Holdsworth if he knew that what Sutton had confessed to was a criminal offence . Sutton was moved to another school in the Sydney suburb of Mosman and also worked at of schools in NSW and the ACT. Mr Doherty said he heard on the radio in 1996 that Sutton had been arrested. 'I was extremely angry. I told the brothers in the 70s and they did nothing and Greg went on to do the most dreadful things,' he said. Mr Doherty said he had suspicions about Sutton from the start because he had teacher's 'pets' and would mow the playing field on a tractor mower with a boy sitting between his knees. Br Holdsworth said he could not recall Mr Doherty raising concerns with him and just thought the two did not get along.

"By . Aap . Rebels motorcycle club leader Alex Vella has suffered a double blow with the cancellation of his Australian visa and loss of a close mate and fellow senior club member. The Rebels national president had planned to return from a visit to his native Malta when he discovered the federal government had cancelled his visa. It was cancelled under character provisions in the Migration Act last Friday, the Immigration Department said. Scroll down for video . National President of the Rebels Motorcycle Club, Alex Vella, had his Australian visa cancelled by the federal government on Friday . Mr Vella, 60, is understood to be in Malta figuring out his next move. With the high profile leader gone, the Rebels club have taken another hit with the death of the club's Sergeant at Arms, Simon Rasic. Mr Rasic, son of former Socceroos coach Rale Rasic who guided the national team to the 1974 World Cup, died on Sunday night. Friend and Rebels member 'Little Mick' Kosenko said Mr Rasic, who had been a club member for more than 20 years, died suddenly. 'It was very unexpected,' the United Motorcycle Council Queensland spokesman said on Tuesday. 'He was a very fit and healthy person. It's a great loss.' Mr Kosenko said Mr Rasic, a father of four, died following complications from a recent operation. The Rebels club also lost their Sergeant at Arms, Simon Rasic, on Sunday when he died suddenly following complications from a recent operation . Mr Vella (front centre) and a number of senior members of the club while attending a bikie rally outside Parliment House in Adelaide in 2009 . He said Mr Vella had already planned to cut his trip short to attend his sister-in-law's funeral on Tuesday prior to Mr Rasic's death. Mr Vella has struggled with his Australian visa since he was convicted in 1995 of possessing a trafficable quantity of cannabis. His property was later raided by police who seized and froze $3 million worth of his assets.Mr Vella clawed his assets back after paying a $650,000 settlement to the NSW Crime Commission. Supporters have leapt to Mr Vella's defence, painting the bikie boss as a churchgoing, motorcycle enthusiast. 'This man actually goes to church every week and is always willing to lend a helping hand, unlike the hypocrites that sit in government,' Motorcycle Clubs Australia posted on Facebook. 'What has he done to deserve what they have been doing to him for so many years? 'Everyone has a hobby in life and his is riding motorcycles.' Immigration Minister Scott Morrison defended the decision to cancel Mr Vella's visa, saying he had received briefings about activities of the Rebels club . Speaking about the visa cancellation, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said it was his duty to respond to the work of state and federal law enforcement agencies. 'When something is asked of me in this area, it is my duty to respond,' he told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday. Mr Morrison said he had received briefings about activities of the Rebels club. It is not the first time an Australian government has tried to keep Mr Vella, who does not have citizenship, from coming into the country. In 2007, when he went to Japan to watch his boxer son Adam Vella in a fight, Mr Vella struggled to return after his visa expired. He returned to Australia three weeks later after police failed to provide evidence for revoking his visa on character grounds. Mr Vella told Fairfax Media on Tuesday he was a innocent man. 'We are not a criminal organisation despite what the police continue to say about us,' he said. 'We are simply easy targets.'","Alex Vella, 60, Rebels motorcycle club leader, had his visa canceled .

"By . Sam Webb . The English are known throughout the world for their eccentricity and behaviour that leaves many foreigners scratching their heads. It was with this in mind that Tony Ray-Jones created a body of photographs documenting English customs and identity between 1966 and 1969. Humorous yet melancholy, these stills were a departure from anything else being produced at the time. They quickly attracted the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London where they were exhibited in 1969. Tragically, in 1972, Ray-Jones died from leukaemia aged just 30. However, his short but prolific career had a lasting influence on the development of British photography from the 1970s through to the present day. In 1970, Martin Parr, an 18-year-old photography student at Manchester Polytechnic, was introduced to Ray-Jones and was immediately inspired by his work. Parr moved to Hebden Bridge in 1974 and produced The Non-Conformists, a series of images shot in black and white in and around the Calder Valley. This project started within two years of Ray-Jones’ death and demonstrates his legacy and influence. Now the work of the two photographers is the subject of an exhibition at the National Media Museum in Bradford called 'Only In England'.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Friday the 13th is a date that elicits superstitions in many people, while a full moon has often mistakenly been said to cause insanity. So on the rare occasion these two events combine, are we set to be in store for a mythical phenomenon, or will it be a day like any other? We’ll find out today, as a full moon coincides with the date in the Eastern U.S., South America, Europe, Africa and Asia for the last time until 2049. Today marks the last time a full moon (pictured) will fall on a Friday the 13th date for 35 years until 13 August 2049. The event is extremely rare, occurring only once every 20 years on average. The full moon is visible across most of the world including the UK and Eastern US on the 13th . If you’ve ever spotted the moon near the horizon, it may have appeared much larger - a phenomenon called the moon illusion. A moon near the horizon, particularly a full moon, can appear bigger. This often leads people to incorrectly claim the moon is closer, or is a ‘supermoon’. In reality, the effect is an optical illusion, although scientists aren't sure why it occurs. It’s most likely due to the Ponzo illusion, below. The two yellow lines are the same length, although they don’t seem so at first glance. The same is true with the moon illusion; at the horizon, our brain thinks it is closer than when it is up above us. The moon actually reached its ‘fullest’ point at 6:11am BST time this morning, although it will still be visible tonight. The last time Friday the 13th occurred at the same time as a full moon was back on 13 October 2000. And the event won’t occur again until 13 August 2049. The reason the event is so rare is because there chances of three different scenarios occurring at the same time is very slim, reports Vox. To calculate the chances of the event occurring, the probabilities of those events need to be calculated. First, for Friday the 13th and a full moon to coincide, the moon must be in its fullest phase. There are on average about 12 full moons a year, making the odds of one day being a full moon about 3.39 per cent. The odds of any day being a Friday, meanwhile, are one in seven - and the chances that a particular day is the 13th is 3.29 per cent. Multiplying these together, and by the number of days in the year, shows that this rare event occurs on average about once every 20 years, although, of course, this varies somewhat. For example, while we have to wait 35 years for this event to happen again, our descendents in 2049 will have to wait just 14 years for the next one on 13 April 2063. It takes the moon about 28 days to orbit Earth, during which time it goes through several phases as the sun lights up different parts of its surface. When the face we can see isn't lit, it is known as a new moon, followed by (clockwise from bottom left) a waxing crescent, waxing gibbous and full moon (100 per cent lit) In other moon news, scientists recently discovered why the face of the lunar surface we can see has a 'man on the moon', but the far side of the moon does not. Scientists at Penn State University revealed how the near . side's proximity to the scorching young earth weakened it, and made it . more susceptible to asteroid impacts that caused features like this to . form. The general consensus on the moon's . origin is that it probably formed shortly after Earth and was the result . of a Mars-sized object hitting Earth with a glancing but devastating . impact.","Today marks the last time a full moon falls on Friday the 13th until 2049 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . As Apple fans obsess over what the iPhone 6 is expected to look like, the rumour mill about the firm's next range of tablets is slowly gaining traction. According to reports from Korea, suppliers are gearing up to begin production of the next-generation iPad Air - dubbed iPad Air 2 - later this month. It is expected to feature the 8MP camera seen on the iPhone 5S, a faster processor and, most notably, it could sport Apple's fingerprint scanner to unlock the device. Along with the improved security features promised on iOS 8, this could make the iPad Air 2 the most secure tablet ever. The original iPad Air was launched on Friday 1 November 2013 (stock image shown). Given Apple's preference for launching products on a Friday, a release date for the upgraded iPad Air 2 of 31 October 2014 seems possible, with the company apparently gearing up for a release in Q3 or Q4 this year . In addition to the rumoured fingerprint scanner, Apple's iOS 8 could also help boost the security of its next-generation devices. For example, when connecting to a Wi-Fi network, the software won't reveal your device's MAC address. This is used to identify the device, and can be used to determine who owns it. Apple is also increasing privacy and payment controls in the app store. The tech giant is additionally paying closer attention to the types of apps it approves on its store to avoid developers spamming customers, or showing excessive advertising. According to MacRumors, production of the displays for the next-generation tablet has begun. This will gear it up for release in the autumn, expected to be a Friday towards the end of October, bringing it in line with previous releases. The original iPad Air, for example, launched on Friday 1 November 2013 - perhaps suggest 31 October 2014 could be a favoured date for the latest release, given Apple’s preference of launching products on a Friday. The iPad Air 2 is rumoured to have the same screen size as its predecessor, which sported a 9.7-inch (24.6 centimetres) retina LCD display that had a resolution of 2048 x 1536. It could also have a similar thickness, of 0.3 inches (7.5mm) and a similar weight of around 16.6 oz (470g). It’s thought the camera will be upgraded from the 5MP version seen on the current iPad Air to the same 8MP camera used on the iPhone 5S. This could also include the iSight technology that makes low-light shots easier to take, and allows for slow-motion video to be filmed. California-based Apple Inc (stock image shown) is gearing up to release the latest version of its iPad Air later this year. Rumours suggest the Air 2 will have an faster processor and a better camera than its predecessor. The overall size of the tablet, however, is likely to remain nearly the same . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version that will make it the slimmest phone in the world. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.3 inches (7.6 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.35 millimetres). Inside the device, the tablet is expected to sport a new and improved processor in the form of the A8, with Among Tech reporting this will have 50 per cent more performance than the previous A7. And finally, it is almost certain the Air 2 will use the same Touch ID fingerprint sensor to unlock the device. This was introduced on the iPhone 5S and is expected to also be used on the iPhone 6. A new iPad Mini is also expected to be released at the same time as Apple's other flagship models. 'Apple . sees its Touch ID fingerprint scanner as the future of digital security, and . with iOS 8 on the horizon, Apple is opening up that technology to app developers,' Stephen Ashby from iCreate Magazine tells MailOnline. 'The iPad Air 2 will not only be more secure, but it will also make it easier . for users to sign into online accounts or buy things safely and quickly. 'It’s . unlikely that Apple will change its winning formula too much, though. Apple's iPhone 5S (pictured) was the first phone from the tech giant to use the new Touch ID fingerprint technology. This is able to recognise the fingerprint of the user and, when a digit is pressed against the home button at the bottom, it allows the phone to be unlocked without entering a code . 'Aside . from the rumoured Touch ID scanner, improvements to the camera and faster . processor, Apple is unlikely to make other changes to the hardware. 'Expect a . very similar design to the first iPad Air, with a few upgrades and perhaps . another colour option.' In other Apple news, yet more pictures of Apple's iPhone 6 were revealed yesterday showing the handset side-by-side with the current iPhone. The leak came from former Taiwanese pop star Jimmy Lin who also leaked the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini ahead of their releases.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . and Press Association . Sony is going head to head with Microsoft after it announced that its $99 (£60) Playstation TV will be released in the U.S., Canada and Europe this autumn . Sony is going head-to-head with Microsoft after it announced its $99 PlayStation TV. The tiny streaming box, launched last year as PS Vita TV in Japan, will let users play games on a TV that is not connected to a console. It will be released in the U.S., Canada and Europe this autumn, but local prices have not been announced. It follows the release of Microsoft's next-generation console, the £400 ($500) Xbox One - described as an 'all-in-one entertainment system for a new generation.' At Sony's press conference, on the opening day of the E3 video game convention in Los Angeles, the chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment for North America, Shawn Layden, unveiled the new hardware. Called PlayStation TV, the device will also rival systems including Apple TV, Roku, and Google Chromecast - all of which let users stream content from other devices to their home TV. Sony's device will let users play games on a different TV as long as they have a controller to use with the box. It will also stream TV shows and films. Sony is looking to build on a successful start for its latest console, which had sold two million more units than the Xbox One as of May. Sony's first original TV series for PlayStation is introduced at the Sony PlayStation press conference prior to the start of the E3 in Los Angeles, California, USA . PlayStation 4 remote play: As with PS Vita, PS TV supports PS4 remote play and Wireless Controller. This will allow PS4 owners in the living room to continue playing a game on a PS TV system in their bedroom. PlayStation Now: Once PlayStation Now is rolled out across the PAL region, PS TV users will be able to enjoy PlayStation 3 games via streaming. Line-up of software titles: PS TV offers a library of PS Vita, PSP and classic PS One titles. Owners will be able to use all of these titles using a Dualshock 3 or Dualshock 4 controller. While Microsoft chose to focus their own press conference earlier in the day solely on games, Sony dedicated plenty of time to their hardware, including devices like the Vita handheld console. Andrew House, the CEO of the Sony Computer Group said: ‘We want you to share our vision for the future of gaming. PlayStation is the best place to play above all else. You are a member of an extensive community of rivals and friends.’ In what looks like a direct challenge to services like Netflix, Sony also announced plans to create a host of their own produced TV shows that will be exclusive to the PlayStation TV. The first of these shows, a sci-fi crime drama called Powers, will appear at the end of the year. Microsoft is also working on a series of original shows. The six projects include a . Halo series produced by Steven Spielberg and a Halo digital feature . produced by Ridley Scott. Two other series are also in development, including a six-part documentary about modern technology, called Signal . to Noise, and Humans, an English version of a Swedish . series about robotic servants. During Sony's event, Layden . also spoke about the platform's ‘commitment’ to free-to-play games, . promising ‘more than 25 over the next 12 months’ for users to download . for free. In terms of games, Sony managed to draw several big cheers from the crowd with the titles they previewed, including Uncharted and Sack Boy. While Microsoft chose to focus their own press conference earlier in the day solely on games, Sony dedicated plenty of time to their hardware, including devices like the Vita handheld console . Xbox had set an impressive tone earlier in the day with a conference that included a string of new titles for their own next-generation console. Among the games to receive the best reaction from the crowd included an extended look at the futuristic Destiny, which is seen by some as a challenger to the popular Halo franchise on Xbox. A new gothic horror game called The Order - 1886 was shown off, set in Victorian-era London. There was also confirmation of a fourth instalment of the popular Uncharted series. Although both conferences drew plenty of cheers and enthusiasm from the crowd, experts leaving the hall following the Sony briefing felt that PlayStation had had the better first day. Both companies will now set up booths for three days of the convention, where players can try out the new games for the first time. Microsoft . focused exclusively on hyping titles coming to its Xbox One and Xbox . 360 consoles during its presentation Monday ahead of the Electronic .

"By . Sam Webb . TV presenter Clare Balding has revealed she was spooked after spotting a mysterious panther-like beast in the English countryside as she conducted a radio interview. The journalist and sports pundit was at The Doward, a beauty spot near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire when she spotted what appeared to be a large black cat sitting in a country lane. She saw the 'enormous' creature while being shown around by locals as she recorded her BBC Radio 4 show Ramblings. There have been numerous sightings of big cat-like creatures across the country since the 90s - but there has been little concrete evidence to prove their existence. Scroll down for video . Sighting: TV presenter Clare Balding was shocked to see what appeared to be a panther-like animal (file picture) in the Herefordshire countryside while she was recording a radio interview . Scenic: Former jockey Ms Balding was talking to two locals in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, for her countryside-themed Radio 4 show Ramblings when she saw the 'cat' on a path . The former jockey said on the programme: . 'Gosh. We've walked out on to the road and turned left and sitting in . the middle of the road ahead of us, honestly, I thought it was a . panther. 'It was the most enormous black cat. I mean really big, like a dog size.' Roger Smith, who was giving her guided tour of the picturesque locale, told her he too had seen it twice in the same location over the past few years. Ms Balding asked him if it was indeed a big cat and Mr Smith replied: 'Who knows? Nobody has ever actually got a photograph of it. 'I've seen black cats the size of our Rottweiler and our friends have seen big black cats feeding on deer carcass. 'There's always been stories of a big black cat on the Doward ever since we moved here 20 years ago, and a number of our friends have seen it.' Mystery: One photographer's snap of the beast of Trowbridge. The creature has been spotted throughout Wiltshire and Northamptonshire over the years but there's no conclusive evidence to prove it exists . Ms Balding . continued: 'I saw it, I saw it really clearly. It's just gone off slowly . to the left. It just sloped, it didn't scuttle, it just very . confidently walked across the road and disappeared into the woods. 'I should point out, I never knew the stories of a big black cat. I'm all excited now, adrenaline's flowing.' Over the years there have been a number of sightings of big cats in the British countryside. Although the animals are sometimes pictured, and carcasses with wounds similar to those inflicted in an attack by such a predator have been found, their existence has never been conclusively proved. In November, scientists announced they may have found evidence to show that big cats really are roaming the British countryside, by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their 'victims'. Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets . Expert Dr Andrew Hemmings believes he found proof that big cats have been stalking Gloucestershire and neighbouring counties by analysing the remains of wild animals, which appear to have been eaten by beasts larger than any known British carnivores. Dr Hemmings, a senior lecturer in animal science at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, has spent the last year examining 20 animal skeletons which all bore unusual teethmarks. Some of the livestock and deer remains, found by farmers, landowners and volunteers, had been found in unusual circumstances which suggested that they may have been killed by a big cat. 'Panther' sighting: This picture taken in February 2012 shows a furry black figure sprinting through woodland near Nailsworth, Gloucestershire . From the Beast of Trowbridge, to the Wildcat of Woodchester, big cat sightings have sparked the imaginations of many people over the years, although bar a few fuzzy photographs there has been little to prove their existence. Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the Dangerous Wild Animals act. The Beast of Trowbridge, which has been seen around the Wiltshire town, is described as a puma or panther. The animal has also been seen in nearby Staverton and Westbury Leigh. In 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to Bodmin Moor . And last month a couple claim they spotted a black panther on the loose in an Essex field, describing it as a ‘big scary cat’. Lynn Lacy and husband Michael were at home when they allegedly spotted the beast, which they claim was ‘jet black’ and ‘too big’ to be a dog or cat. Mrs Lacy, 56, took this photo of the unknown animal on her iPhone after she spotted it on the edge of Hatfield Forest. In August 2012 a blurry picture of what resembles a big cat prowling around a patch of countryside near Nailsworth in Gloucestershire emerged. The furry black figure was caught on a trip camera sprinting through woodland after apparently being spooked by a walker. One of the more famous big cats is . the Beast of Bodmin Moor - over 60 sightings of a large black cat have . occurred in the area over the years. In 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor. The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain. In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. The . Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  conducted an official . investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be . roaming Britain in 1995. It concluded there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain,. But it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were 'not present'.","The presenter was amazed to see 'predator' in Ross-on-Wye countryside .

Mrs Pearce, who died at the age of 86 in 2006, spent her childhood years in the country home, before writing Tom's Midnight Garden in 1958. The children's novel, which was awarded the Carnegie Medal the same year, tells the story of a boy called Tom who is staying in an upstairs flat of an old country house and is not allowed out to play. Walled garden: The Georgian property's adjoining cottage sits among trees in the beautiful landscape garden (pictured), which also features medieval fish ponds .

But every night, when the clock strikes 13, he escapes into the property's garden. There, Tom plays with a girl called Hatty, who drastically begins to age every time he goes to play with her. Eventually, it emerges that the girl is, in fact, an elderly and reclusive landlady who lives above Tom, called Mrs Bartholomew, and he has been visiting events that were real in her past. In Mrs Pearce's novel, the country house, which backs on to the River Cam, appears just as it is in real life. And it was not just the property itself that inspired the book - with Great Shelford becoming the fictional village Great Barley, the river being referred to as the Say and Cambridge appearing as Castleford.

Despite moving out of the house as an adult, Mrs Pearce eventually returned to Great Shelford - and bought a property just across the road from her childhood home. Mrs Pearce's daughter Sally Christie, who now lives in the property with her family, said she felt Kings Mill House was 'beautiful', but that her mother would have 'fallen over backwards' at the price tag. 'My mother had an idyllic childhood, and a deep love for the house and its garden,' she said.

James Barnett, the head of country sales Savills, Cambridge, said: 'It’s a special house and the level of interest we have had has been quite significant. 'Prestigious houses close to Cambridge are rare enough but it is always nice to find they have literary connections. 'The gardens are very beautiful and there’s a lot of formal box hedging and attractive planting as well as modern improvements which really sets the house off well. 'It would be inspiring to anybody wandering around.'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If you've ever played with Scalextric, you'll know the frustration of hitting the 'throttle' too hard and sending the cars veering off the track. In what's been dubbed 'Scalextric for the 21st century', a new game attempts to solve this problem by keeping cars on track using sensors and cameras. And in an even more modern twist, the cars are controlled by an app meaning racers can throw virtual weapons, obstacles and even stop their opponents, as seen in games such as Nintendo's Mario Kart. Scroll down for video . Anki Drive, a game by a San Francisco company of the same name, is now on sale in the UK and US. The game blurs the line between video and toy games, enabling players to race round on a 'roll-able' track that uses smart technology to ensure the cars stay within lines on the surface . Called . Anki Drive, players control physical cars on a ‘smart track’ with an . iPhone or iPad and use virtual power-ups to beat opponents. Up . to four players can race cars around the tracks, or players can go it . alone and battle against the artificial intelligence, built into the . cars. Anki Drive is available now for £179.99 ($199.95) and comes with two cars, while each additional car costs an extra £49.99 ($69.95). Within each car is a small camera that let them ‘see’ where they are going. This camera points straight down and looks through the track into the circuitry underneath. The track itself provides information for the car as to where it can drive. A 50 megahertz computer on each car monitors where it is on the track 500 times every second. This then feeds information to the motors in the two rear wheels so the car knows where to drive. Every two milliseconds they make an adjustment to the rear motors to stay on trajectory. According to chief executive and co-founder Boris Stofman, ‘if you scaled it up to real-world size it would be equivalent to driving down a highway at 250 miles (400 kilometres) per hour with a concrete wall a tenth of an inch from your windows, and staying within that wall.' The track itself, about the size of a tabletop, can be rolled out onto any surface, and the matchbox-sized cars are then placed on the track and controlled by players using their chosen device. This is done via a free app for iOS that syncs devices with the cars - and the company told MailOnline there are also plans to eventually bring the technology to Android. Each car automatically follows the racing lines of the track. Using their chosen device, players can then speed up and slow down their car, turn from side-to-side, or use a variety of virtual power ups. On the screen of the app are various input mechanisms to play the game, ranging from a 'throttle' for speed and power-ups to be used during a race. There are two game modes - Battle, which sees players attempt to ‘destroy’ each other on the track, or a Standard race mode to a set number of laps. Players are also given access to ‘weapons’ such as a virtual rail gun that they can fire at other cars while on the track. Disabling another car will make it stop moving until it recovers, allowing others to drive past. Up to four players can race around the track using one of several uniquely programmed cars (pictured). Each of the cars have different attributes; some are faster and more agile, while others have access to better virtual weapons that could be used to disable the cars of other players . A number of other power-ups, including a boost function and the ability to reverse a car around on track, lets players either avoid attacks or speed to victory. And each car is also programmed uniquely, with some being more accustomed to battles and others better suited to speed. As races and battles are completed, players additionally get access to upgrades that can be applied to their car. And if a gamer upgrades their own car, they can take it to a friend's house and use it on their track with the upgrades intact. Anki Drive bears many similarities to Scalextric tracks of old, but with a new twist that uses modern technologies to provide a new way to play. The game was designed by graduates from Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh. The track can be rolled out onto a flat surface on which the cars can then race. For now this is one of two tracks available, but the company say it is possible much larger tracks could be released in future. For example, they say a large track unfolded in the kitchen at their office was able to host 128 cars at one time . Scalextrix (stock image shown) is a slot-car toy racing game created by Minimodels and now owned by Hornby. It was released back in 1957 and sees players use a controller with a throttle to alter the speed of cars on track as they followed rails around and race each other . ‘We found this technology fascinating and capable of doing amazing things,’ chief executive and co-founder Boris Sofman told MailOnline. ‘We wanted to apply it to commercial products. ‘So we started with a game where we wanted to bridge the worlds of toys and video games.’Sofman explains how the game, while simple at its heart, can be mastered by more experienced players to give entirely new experiences. The mechanics are simple and easy to teach, he says, meaning anyone can pick up and play. ‘5 year-olds love it, 40 year-olds love it, 80 year-olds love it,’ he continued. ‘People love being able to have this level of competition in physical form that’s never existed outside the screen. ‘The family gaming aspect is something that’s very appealing.’ The company also hinted there may be opportunities to apply the same technology used in the cars to future games - such as miniature robots fighting it out in a 'smart arena'.","San Francisco firm has unveiled a game that blurs virtual and real worlds .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The brutal rampage across Iraq by radical Sunni militia has led to an unlikely allegiance between the U.S. and Iran as they prepare for talks on the crisis. The Obama administration has announced plans to open talks with Tehran this week to find a way to stop the the rapid spread of the ISIS - Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria. The announcement came as shocking images emerged on Saturday, that appeared to show members of ISIS summarily executing about 1,400 men. Action: The Obama administration has announced plans to open talks with Iran on how to stop ISIS in Iraq . Talks: The U.S. is keen to engage Iran's President Rouhani in a united response to the violence in Iraq . The images, which were posted on a militant website, allegedly show masked ISIS fighters forcing captives into a shallow ditch, as well as photos of what appeared to be bodies after they were shot. Iraq's top military spokesman, Lieutenant General Qassim al-Moussawi confirmed the photos' authenticity on Sunday, although Western agencies have not yet said if they believe them to be real. The shocking and rapid spread of violence across Iraq has led to the U.S. and Iran publicly announcing they will send military support if it is requested, the Wall Street Journal reported. It is not clear how talks with Iran, which refers to the U.S. as the 'Great Satan', would take place, and other countries have expressed concern that any deal could damage negotiations on Tehran's nuclear program. On Saturday, Iran's President Rouhani confirmed that he was willing to take part in talks and claimed to have had written correspondence with Obama. 'When . the U.S. takes action, then one can think about cooperation. Until today, no specific . request for help has been demanded. But we are ready to help within . international law.' Militia: Members of ISIS with captured Iraqi soldiers who are wearing plain clothes in Tikrit, Iraq . Shocking: Images posted on a militant website appeared to show soldiers being shot dead. Western agencies have not yet confirmed if the images are real . The Obama administration is pushing . for a coordinated response to the violence from Iran and other . governments in the regions, and Secretary of State John Kerry has been . in telephone talks with his Iraqi counterpart. Security . has also been increased at the . U.S. embassy in Baghdad, after reports that about 1,200 ISIS fighters . were marching towards the capital, after taking Mosul last week. Many of the 5.500 staff who work in the embassy . complex have been airlifted to other regions, and the U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf. Obama's plan to open talks with Tehran has been widely supported in Washington by both parties, with many saying ISIS was a threat to the national security. 'Why did we deal with Stalin? Because he was not as bad as Hitler. The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall,' Republican senator Lindsay Graham said. A map of northern Iraq shows the towns and cities taken over by Sunni insurgents and Kurdish Peshmerga . An Iranian politician told the Wall . Street Journal that the talks offered the chance for Tehran to improve . relations with the West. 'Some of us realize that is the best . opportunity for Iran to improve its diplomatic relations with the U.S.,' the politician, who requested anonymity, said. Concerns have been raised that if the U.S. and Iran were drawn into a joint military strategy, their differing views on the future for Iraq could be problematic. 'This is a case where the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy. Any shared interests in Iraq are limited,' an American defense official said.","Obama administration announces plans to discuss Iraq crisis with Tehran .

'It’s a real shame for . Carrick that one side-effect was losing his place on the greatest . stage. He was downbeat about the news — and I know because I was with . him when he got the call to say he wasn’t going. Nemanja Vidic and I . took him to the pub for a consolation drink,' said Ferdinand.

'The sad thing is English football did . produce a Pirlo. His name is Michael Carrick and after being left out of .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Meet the real life Puss In Boots. Famous for his adorably cute face, the cartoon character won legions of fans when he first appeared on the big screen in the movie Shrek 2. But while the animated version may be based on the fairy tale of the same name - Drogon the kitten, born with the same trademark giant eyes, is in no way made-up. The black-footed cat was born in April at Philadelphia Zoo, Pennsylvania, and at eight weeks old weighs just 27 ounces. Real life Puss In Boots: With his huge eyes, Drogon the black-footed cat bears more than a passing resemblance to the Shrek favourite . He has doubled in weight in the last month and is being raised by his mother Aza, along with brother Viscerion and sister Rhaegal. Unlike the wannabe Zorro from the films who joins Shrek and his band of friends, black-footed cats like Drogon prefer a solitary life.

Casey Kasem’s second wife Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ after his daughter Kerri agreed to her request to hand over his remains. The pair had been at loggerheads in recent months as they battled in the courts over the broadcasting legend’s medical treatment. Kerri Kasem had been granted custody last month over her father’s medical care, but that role expired when her father died Father's Day morning. Scroll down for video . Casey Kasem's second wife Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ after his daughter Kerri agreed to her request to hand over his remains . Battle: Wife Jean Kasem, left, and daughter Kerri Kasem, right, had fought over Casey Kasem's medical treatment in recent moths . Broadcast legend Kasey Casem died on Sunday aged 82 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease and dementia. An attorney for Kerri told TMZ that Jean's attorney had reached out to request the body be released to her. Kerri obliged immediately, and notified the hospice where Casey died that his wife would be taking care of funeral arrangements. The pair didn’t speak directly. According to a recent filing of Casey's health directive he wanted a burial. Jean Casem will act as the executor of Casey's will. Broadcast legend Kasey Casem died on Sunday aged 82 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease and dementia, his wife Jean will now bury him as he had requested . Hiss death was announced on social media by his children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem. The message didn't include the name of . his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly . court battle over his medical treatment. 'Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,' the message read. 'Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken. 'Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad. With love, Kerri, Mike and Julie.' Kasem died in a Washington hospital at 3.23am, spokesman Danny Deraney said in a statement. In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia. Star: Kasem, pictured next to wife Jean Kasem, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1981 . Smooth talker: Kasem was known for his gentle, smooth voice on the radio . A judge in May temporarily stripped his wife of her caretaker role after she moved him from a medical facility in Los Angeles to a friend's home in Washington state. Jean Kasem said she moved her husband to protect his privacy and to consult with doctors. Casey Kasem developed a severe bedsore while in Washington and was in critical condition by the time he was hospitalized in early June. Kasem's transportation to Washington posed serious risks. 'She disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration,' Dr. Paul Leitner said in documents obtained by the paper. 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr. Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.' Jean Kasem had objected to a Wednesday ruling in a Los Angeles Superior Court that stopped her husband from being given food and drink over concerns it might be painful for him. 'Right now, Casey Kasem's health is declining and (he) won't be with us much longer,' Danny Deraney said in a June 6 statement. Awareness: Kasem, the son of Lebanese immigrants, spoke out for greater understanding of Arab-Americans . During . temporary conservator Kerri Kasem's visit to see her father on June 1 in . Washington state, Jean Kasem threw meat at her as he was preparing for a . trip to the hospital. 'In . the name of King David, I threw a piece of raw meat into the street in . exchange for my husband to the wild rabid dogs,' she told NBC News. Kasem's 'American Top 40' began on July 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, when the No. 1 song was Three Dog Night's cover of Randy Newman's ""Mama Told Me Not to Come."" The show expanded to hundreds of stations, including Armed Forces Radio, and continued in varying forms - and for varying syndicators - into the 21st century. He stepped down from 'American Top 40' in 2004 and retired altogether in 2009, completing his musical journey with Shinedown's 'Second Chance.' While many DJs convulsed their listeners with stunts and 'morning zoo' snarkiness, Kasem would read 'long distance dedications' of songs sent in by readers and introduce countdown records with sympathetic background anecdotes about the singers. 'The idea from the beginning was to do the type of thing on radio that Ed Sullivan did on television, good, honest stories with human interest,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 1975. Kasem's legacy reached well beyond music. His voice was heard in TV cartoons such as 'Scooby-Doo' as the voice of Shaggy and in numerous commercials.

'And they're going to forget Casey . Kasem - unless they happen to step on his star on the Hollywood Walk of . Fame. I'll be one of those guys people say 'Who's that?' about. And . someone else will say, 'He's just some guy who used to be on the . radio.'' Succeeding Kasem at the main 'American Top 40' show in 2004 was multi-platform star Ryan Seacrest, who has said he had been a fan of Kasem since boyhood and would imitate him in pretend countdown broadcasts at age 9. Seacrest mourned Kasem's death in a statement on Sunday. 'It’s a sad day for the broadcasting community and for radio listeners around the world,' he said. 'When I was a kid, I would listen to Casey Kasem’s AT40 show every weekend, and dream about someday becoming a radio DJ. So when decades later I took over his AT40 countdown show, it was a surreal moment. 'Casey had a distinctive friendly on-air voice, and he was just as affable and nice if you had the privilege to be in his company. He’ll be greatly missed by all of us.' Radio and television personality Carson Daly also offered his condolences. 'Long before MTV and the internet #CaseyKasem made sure you were hearing the best music out there,' Daly wrote on Twitter. 'Peace be to his family and RIP. #Respect.' Early days: Kasem is seen in the DJ booth at WJBK station in Detroit in 1957 . Couple: Casey Kasem is seen in this undated photo with wife Jean Kasem .

Dangerous: Jean Kasem's transport of husband Casey Kasem to Washington state could have proved fatal, documents show. The couple is pictured in this 1986 photo . The son of Lebanese immigrants, Kasem was active in speaking out for greater understanding of Arab-Americans — both on political issues involving the Mideast and on arts and media issues. 'Arab-Americans are coming out of the closet,' Kasem told The Associated Press in 1990. 'They are more outspoken now than ever before. People are beginning to realize who they really are, that they are not the people who yell and scream on their nightly newscast.' Kasem was born Kemal Amin Kasem in 1932 in Detroit. He began his broadcasting career in the radio club at Detroit's Northwestern High School and was soon a disc jockey on WJBK radio in Detroit, initially calling himself Kemal Kasem. In a 1997 visit with high school students in Dearborn, Michigan, home to a large Arab-American community, he was asked why he changed his name to Casey. 'It didn't sound like a deejay; it wasn't hip. So we decided I'd be 'Casey at the Mike' — and I have been since,' Kasem said. In the 1975 Los Angeles Times interview, he said he had been doing 'a regular screaming DJ show' in San Francisco in the early 1960s when his boss suggested he talk about the records instead. He was unconvinced, since his screaming routine had brought him top ratings. But he said he had learned 'after a particularly unpleasant situation in Buffalo never to argue with general managers.' Prolific: Kasem hosted 'American Top 40' for many years, made appearances in both film and television, and was also known as a voice actor .","Casey Kasem’s second wife Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ who died on Sunday .

"By . Heidi Parker . and Emma Glanfield . Harrison Ford won't be getting back into his Han Solo costume anytime soon. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the 71-year-old actor will take as many as eight weeks off from filming Star Wars: Episode VII after he broke his ankle on set in London. Though he has a reported large role in the sci-fi film, shooting will continue in his absence. The action star was airlifted to the trauma unit at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford  on Thursday after the door of the Millennium Falcon fell on him. Scroll down for video . He's out... for a while: Harrison Ford, pictured in London on June 5, will be off the set of Star Wars: Episode VII for up to eight weeks to mend his broken foot, claimed The Hollywood Reporter on Monday . The Reporter's source added that Episode VII is still expected to make its December 18, 2015 release date. Harrison was injured when the door of the Millennium Falcon, the spacecraft that his character flies in the original films, fell on him. The movie began filming in May with shooting taking place in London and Abu Dhabi. In March, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Episode VII will be set 30 years after the events in 1983's Return of the Jedi. Back for more: Ford, pictured with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in the original 1977 Star Wars, had been on set for only for a short time before the accident occurred . The ship that did him in: A model of the Millennium Falcon; the door of the Episode VII version is what reportedly fell on Ford . Two months is a long time to miss out on the shoot that is scheduled to last only about three or four months. But the injury seems to be bigger than previously thought. It was reported by a source last week that Ford clutched his chest in pain as crew members rushed to free him from underneath the prop's hydraulic door after the accident at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. In a statement to Sky News, the spokesman said on Monday the Indiana Jones star was ‘hoping to announce some good news soon.’ Excited to begin work: The veteran movie star with director JJ Abrams in London on June 7 . A spokesman for John Radcliffe Hospital was unable to confirm whether the actor had been discharged from hospital today. It is thought that as well as fracturing his ankle, he may also have suffered further injuries to his chest and pelvis – although he is said to be awaiting results of further tests to confirm the extent of any damage. The latest news comes after his wife Calista Flockhart, best known for her starring role in sitcom Ally McBeal, confirmed she had flown from the US to be at her husband’s bedside. Reprising his buccaneering role from the early films for Star Wars: Episode VII, it is believed Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle when the incident occurred. 'Harris was hit by the door and looked in a bad way and was clutching his chest when he was on the stretcher,' a source told The Mirror. 92973 . 142223 . 27772 . 61139 . 31115 . 56200 . 118771 .

Star Wars: Episode VII, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, began filming in Abu Dhabi in mid-May. The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are also reprising their film roles. Newcomers include Adam Driver, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac. MailOnline has contacted Harrison Ford’s agent for comment.

"By . Joshua Gardner . The ultra rich who want to fly in style while surrounded by dozens of friends and colleagues are turning to manufacturers of commercial planes instead of relatively puny private jets to buy massive, personalized luxury liners. Wired reports that the makers of jumbo jets like the 747 and A380 are happily personalizing their planes to suit the outrageous needs and tastes of Saudi princes, Russian oligarchs and the like. In fact, Airbus is so interested in the business that they conducted a 'billionaires study,' which concluded that Middle Eastern oil magnates and Chinese captains of industry just happen to like to travel in groups of more than a dozen. Scroll down for video . A different world: Billionaires are starting to turn their backs on the luxury Gulfstream jets in order to purchase their own jumbo jets . Starting from scratch: Emptied out Boeing 787s like this are becoming a canvas on which billionaire's can paint their ideal surroundings for air travel . Full service: Saudi princes and Russian oligarchs can take the comforts of home with them in the sky, such as a luxury shower and full-service galley kitchen . That means that Gulfstreams or Bombardiers, luxurious though they may be, just won't cut it. Instead, the very same cramped commercial jets the typical traveler dreads being herded into are gutted and redecorated with fine dining tables, leather chairs, master bedrooms and entertainment centers. For those in the market for these luxury liners, money is no option. And it can't be. Wired estimates that a privatized Boeing 737 goes for $80, the even bigger Boeing 747 goes for $280 million and the massive double-decker Airbus A380 could be yours for a whopping $300 million.

They feature dining tables large enough for even the most ambitious family dinners, lush sofas and one is even rumored to have come with a bowling alley. Which should come as no surprise, considering the average buyer's buying power. 'Our market is to billionaires, not millionaires,' admits Velupillai.

In the closing seconds of last night's match The 6ft 8in 29-year-old buried his face in his hand, prompting speculation that he shed tears of humiliation. Twitter users mocked the power forward.

Martin Pitia Hilary added: 'San antonio Spurs beats Miami heat becoming NBA champions for 2014 mean while James LeBron James is crying like a baby lol.' Another user tweeted: 'Lmaooooooo my highlight of the night was seeing LeBron James crying.' James's appearance in dark glasses at the post-match press conference strengthened suspicions that his eyes were lined red from his snivelling. 'Wearing tinted glasses so we can't see you crying huh, Bron? I see you fam,' wrote Zak on the microblogging site. But fans of the player sprang to his defence. King Shxt wrote: 'Yall stretching it He not Crying he Mad as hell & Frustrated 31pts by himself.' Mourning the loss? James covers his eyes with dark glasses at the post-match press conference . LeBron's (alleged) tears came after the San Antonio Spurs turned their NBA Finals rematch with the Miami Heat into no match at all last night. The Spurs finished off a dominant run to their fifth NBA championship at home Sunday night, ending the Heat's two-year title reign with a 104-87 victory that wrapped up the series in five games. A year after their heartbreaking seven-game defeat, their only loss in six finals appearances, the Spurs won four routs to deny Miami's quest for a third straight championship. Tony Parker (9), Tim Duncan (21), Matt Bonner and Patty Mills (8) of the Spurs celebrate their victory in Game 5 of the NBA Finals and the fifth championship all-time for the franchise . The Spurs hoist the Larry O'Brien trophy after the 104-87 victory Sunday night . 'Hard to believe, isn't it?' asked Spurs shooting guard Manu Ginobili. 'We played at a really high level.' Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs, who added this title to the ones they won in 1999, 2003, '05 and '07. The Spurs nearly had another last year, but couldn't hold off the Heat and lost the final two games of that series. San Antonio rebounded from an early 16-point deficit by outscoring the Heat 37-13 from the start of the second quarter to midway in the third, kicking off the celebration the Heat canceled last season. 'We remember what happened last year and how it felt in that locker room and we used it and built on it and got back here and it's amazing,' Spurs power forward Tim Duncan said. 'It makes last year OK.' Heat forward Michael Beasley (pictured left) shoots as Tim Duncan attempts to block the shot. Tim Duncan has been playing as a forward for the Spurs for all five of their championship victories . Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard (pictured center) recovers the ball while Heat forward LeBron James (pictured left) and Spurs forward Boris Diaw (pictured right) attempts to make a play . LeBron James had 17 first-quarter points to help the Heat get off to a fast start. He finished with 31 points and 10 rebounds for the Heat, who lost their spot atop the NBA with the defeat. 'They played exquisite basketball this series and in particular these last three games and they are the better team. There's no other way to say it,' Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Spurs won four titles in nine years, but hadn't been back on top since 2007, making Foreigner's 'Feels Like the First Time' an appropriate song choice after the final buzzer. The victory gave Tim Duncan and Spurs coach Gregg Popovich their fifth NBA championship. It is the fourth for point guard Tony Parker and Ginobili, who with Duncan are once again the reigning Big Three in the NBA. 'Just a great team and we do it together,' said Parker. Heat power forward Chris Bosh finished with 13 points, while guard Dwyane Wade finished with just 11 points on 4-of-12 shooting, providing James nowhere near the help he needed.

LeBron James (6) makes a face while sitting on the bench in the fourth quarter of the game . The Spurs' painful conclusion to last year served as their fuel for this season, powering them to a 62-win season that topped the NBA and led to a rematch with Miami, the NBA's first in the finals since Chicago beat Utah in 1997-98. Round 2 went to the Spurs, but both teams have challenges to navigate in the off-season. San Antonio will face questions - as it has for years - about the age of its core, and whether Duncan, Ginobili and Popovich want to stick around. The Heat will brace for the potential free agency of James, Wade and Bosh, and will need younger, fresher players around the three All-Stars if they all stay. But this moment belongs to the Spurs. Playing a methodical style for many years that was predicated on throwing the ball into Duncan made San Antonio respected, but never beloved. The Spurs were TV ratings killers, casual viewers finding them not much fun to watch. But Popovich changed up the offense a few years ago, making the Spurs an easy-to-like, tough-to-beat group that thrives on ball movement and 3-point shooting. 'You showed the world how beautiful this game is,' Commissioner Adam Silver told the Spurs during the postgame award ceremony.

The Spurs pose for a team photo in their celebration of the franchise's fifth championship . A decade and a half after winning their first title in 1999, when Duncan was in his second season, the Spurs remain the NBA's model organization, a small-market team that simply wins big and hardly ever does it with a high draft pick. Instead, they found players overseas or in other organizations who would fit the Spurs' way of doing things and mesh with the Duncan, Parker and Ginobili, the winningest trio in postseason history. That includes Leonard, who was acquired in a draft-night trade with Indiana after playing at San Diego State, and point guard Patty Mills, an Australian national who scored 17 points off the bench. No team has overcome a 3-1 deficit in the finals, but the Heat were confident they could keep this season going, Bosh saying earlier Sunday that the Heat were going to win. It appeared they would do it easily the way the game started, with James coming out with force on offense and shutting down Parker on defense as Miami went ahead 22-6. But it didn't last. Tim Duncan answers questions with his children in the post-game press conference . The Spurs eventually made it look stunningly easy again - much to the delight of the home crowd, with fans standing, chanting and dancing much of the second half. The victory was the Spurs' 12th win by 15 or more points, most ever in a postseason. The Spurs outscored opponents by 214 points in the postseason. Before this loss, Miami had won 11 straight postseason series, tied for the fifth-longest streak in NBA history.","Spurs dominate Heat 104-87 to close out their dominant NBA Finals run .

"By . Freya Noble . A South Australian man who admitted to slaughtering six miniature horses has been branded a 'very, very dangerous man' by the distraught owner of the animals. Julie Jackson said Michael Martin John O'Connell slashed the throats of the horses after a dispute about building work at her horse stud at Clayton Bay, about 70km south of Adelaide. 'He really does deserve to go to jail,' she told reporters outside the Adelaide Magistrates court on Tuesday. Michael Martin John O'Connell, who slaughtered six miniature horses in December, pleaded guilty to trespassing on Tuesday . On Tuesday O'Connell, 50, pleaded guilty to trespassing, a charge aggravated by his intention to commit a crime. The crime involved destroying property worth more than $30,000 and his use of an offensive weapon. In March the Middleton man attended court with a security guard, where he admitted to destroying property. The horses' owner Julie Jackson (left) and trainer Terry Hocking (right) have both called for O'Connell to face jail time over the heartless killing . This charge related to his killing the two colts and four fillies, all aged about two-years-old, in December. After he admitted to trespassing on Tuesday, prosecutors dropped six counts of ill-treating an animal as a single damage to property charge carries heavier penalties. Outside court, Ms Jackson said she would love O'Connell to go to jail, describing him as 'a very, very dangerous man'. Six miniature show horses had their throats slashed by O'Connell over a building dispute at the stables . Since the killings, Ms Jackson and her husband have sold the breeding and show stud stables and moved to another property. The stables' horse trainer Terry Hocking also called for the jailing of O'Connell, after previously revealing his shock at seeing the six horses with their throats cut. 'I went straight to the first box, of the horse I love dearly, and his throat was slashed,' he said at the time. Ms Jackson (centre) had family and friends with her at Adelaide Magistrates court, and said she's received worldwide support since the tragic incident . 'And I went down, and I just kept finding one after another. 'There were three in the box that were very traumatised and we got them out a little later, so it's going to take some time for them to come back to reality,' Mr Hocking said. Ms Jackson said they had received incredible world-wide public support after the slaughter. The case was adjourned to the District Court for a sentencing hearing on July 21.","Michael Martin John O'Connell pleaded guilty to trespassing on Tuesday .

Rhys Evans has endured two life-saving operations in his eight years to stem a hole in his heart. Despite doctors' attempts to fit artificial valves when he was just five months old, he has now outgrown them - forcing him back into the operating theatre. Scroll down for video . One and only wish: Eight-year-old Rhys Evans was told he could pick the experience of a lifetime after undergoing his second open-heart operation. He asked to pay for his father, Darryl, to race at Silverstone . Selfless: Rhys was born with leaking heart valves but the hardest thing to deal with was his father's return the the front line in Afghanistan. Darryl (pictured right at Camp Bastion) was amazed by the surprise outing . In a bid to console him after his latest six-hour open-heart surgery, a charity offered to give him the experience of a lifetime. But, incredibly, the little boy shunned options to meet celebrities or take a holiday - instead choosing a day at Silverstone with his father Darryl, 33. Mr Evans, an army sergeant, said he couldn't believe it when Rhys, beaming, revealed the surprise. The father-of-three said: 'I had no idea until the morning and it was just so touching. 'When there have been times in your life when you truly don’t know if you are ever going to see your child smile again, you just cherish the happy moments you have. 'There have been plenty of very hard times, so for Rhys to choose this for me was absolutely brilliant. Ecstatic: Rhys, who had surgery last February to fit artificial heart valves, beamed all day on the tracks . Full of life: Mr and Mrs Evans said Rhys is still recovering but bounded around telling everyone about his dad . Idol: Rhys idolises his father and excitedly helped him prepare for his race last week . Super car: Mr Evans, 33, got behind the wheel of an Aston Martin at the home of the British Grand Prix . 'Just to have five or six hours, as a family, where we didn’t have to worry about anything was just such a weight off our shoulders. It was brilliant.' Rhys was born with congenital heart defect Fallots syndrome which meant his heart valves leaked, reducing the oxygen travelling round his body. It made him weak - and at times blue. Despite undergoing surgery as a baby, and making a good recovery, he grew out of the artificial valves he was fitted with and had to have a valve transplant operation last February at Great Ormond Street hospital. But for Rhys, the hardest thing to cope with was the news that his father had to return to the front line in Afghanistan for six months just a few weeks after his operation - while he was still undergoing regular appointments. Ideal: Rhys could have chosen to meet a celebrity but he seemed ecstatic parading around Silverstone . Family: Rhys shared the experience with his mother, Veronica, and his sisters Jessica (centre) and Niamh . When wish-granting charity Rays of Sunshine told Rhys, from Aldershot, Hampshire, he could have any wish in the world, he did not hesitate to get his dad involved. The family watched Mr Evans’s Aston Martin skid driving experience at Silverstone Circuit, funded by card company Clintons. Rhys's mother, Veronica, 33, watched from the sidelines with Rhys and his sisters Jessica, 10, and Niamh, five. Rhys said: 'The car went really fast round the track lots of times. I used to feel ill but now I feel good. Daddy had a very good time and so did I. It was fun. It was cool watching him.' Reunion: This is the moment Rhys, Jessica and Niamh greeted their father at Brize Norton airport on his return . Returned: Darryl, who came back from Afghanistan in January, hugs Rhys at the end of his race last week . Mrs Evans, a nurse, said: 'Rhys idolises his dad so while it was hard on us all when he had to go to Afghanistan, but really hard on Rhys. His dad is his hero. 'I was so proud of him when he chose to have the treat for his dad. Darryl works so hard and it meant the world to us to have a family day away.' Jane Sharpe, CEO of Rays of Sunshine Children’s Charity, said: 'Every day of the year the charity gives brave and deserving young people the chance to do something they have previously only dreamed of. 'Rhys’ admiration for his dad has helped him get through the challenges of his illness and he wanted to do something extra special for Father’s Day this year, to thank him being such an amazing dad. 'We are so grateful to Clinton’s for their ongoing support and for helping us to celebrate extraordinary fathers across the UK, by granting this ‘reverse wish’ for Darren.'","Rhys Evans, 8, born with leaking heart valves, had two open surgeries .

"By . Ashley Collman . They aren't soul mates, but ex-couple Sabrina Timms and Daniel Burdick are a perfect match in another, life-saving, way. When 35-year-old Timms, of Petaluma, California was diagnosed with double kidney failure in January 2013, Burdick got tested and turned out to be the perfect organ donor. Burdick immediately volunteered to give up one of his kidneys to the mother of his young daughter named Hope - a selfless act that required the singer-songwriter to cancel a national music tour. Perfect match: Singer-songwriter Daniel Burdick (left) is donating one of his kidneys to Sabrina Timms (right), his ex-fiancé . Still close: Burdick and Timms were engaged to be married eight years ago, but broke it off when he decided to focus on his music. Burdick is pictured above with their young daughter Hope. He and Timms remained friends and co-parent their daughter . The co-parents were engaged eight years ago, but decided to call things off when Burdick chose to focus on his music instead. Gift: When Timms was diagnosed with double kidney failure in January 2013, her ex got tested and turned out to be a perfect organ donor. They undergo transplant surgery Tuesday at noon in San Francisco. Timms is pictured above in a photo from her Facebook . 'We had a difference of opinions about what we wanted for the future,' Timms told KGO. 'I wanted to settle down.' 'And I wanted to follow my dreams,' Burdick said. 'He wanted to do his music,' Timms finished. However, the two remained friends as they worked to raise their daughter together. 'The love stills stands,' Burdick said. So when Timms' kidneys failed a year and a half ago, she started dialysis while waiting to find a donor. Burdick joined other friends and family members and underwent a test to see if he was eligible to be a donor. Timms' father and uncle were both tested and neither qualified. Finding the perfect donor is a rarity, and sometimes patients wait decades on lists to get an organ. Currently there are more than 120,00 people on donor lists across the country, and about 18 die a day waiting. Burdick decided to give up his music tour for Timms and their daughter Hope. 'That tour was my biggest dream,' he told KTVU. 'In the end, though, this is more important. She is my child's mother.' Timms hopes her unlikely story will lead others to get tested to be live donors. Music can wait: Burdick, a singer-songwriter, had to give up a national music tour in order to undergo surgery but he says it's worth it .","Sabrina Timms was diagnosed with double kidney failure in January 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The bodies of a South Texas couple who were reported missing in a South Texas lake over the weekend have been recovered. A San Patricio County justice of the peace identified the two as 30-year-old Ronnie Jean Renfro of Corpus Christi and 31-year-old Marshall Shambo of Mathis. Sheriff Leroy Moody says their bodies were found floating in the waters of Lake Corpus Christi on Monday afternoon, one day after they disappeared in the lake while boating with Shambo's two children. Victims: The bodies of Marshall Shambo (left) and his girlfriend Ronnie Jean Renfro (right) were recovered from a Texas lake on Monday . Search: Rescuers searched for house before the bodies were recovered Monday afternoon . Moody says the couple jumped into the water to rescue Shambo's 5-year-old daughter, who had gone into the water. Family members tell KIIITV.com that the the couple's boat broke down about 2 p.m. Sunday just 200 feet from their home. They had let the 4-year-old jump into the water to go to the bathroom. The girl and her 7-year-old brother - who stayed in the boat - were wearing life vests at the time. The girl started drifting away, at which point both Shambo and Renfro - who were not wearing life vests - jumped in after her. The 7-year-old boy also tried to get in the water but the couple told him to get back in the boat. Accident: The couple reportedly jumped in the lake to rescue Shambo's daughter, who had started to float away from their disabled boat . Shortly after the boy returned to the boat, he noticed he could no longer see his father or Renfro, but that his sister was still floating along. He then waved down some passing jet skiers for help. The children were taken to shore as emergency crews began to assemble to search for the missing couple. Search parties scoured the lake until about 7 p.m. before giving up for the night. The next morning, search crews began looking at 8 a.m. The bodies were found floating a few hours later. It's unclear what caused the couple to drown, but officials are describing it as a tragic accident. Shambo's mother, Donna Shambo Voyles, posted a note to friends and family on Facebook. Loss: Shambo's mother wrote a note to friends and family thanking them for their support as her family recovers from this tragic loss . 'I am not sure what to say or do right now. The shock of the last 2 days is consuming me,' Shambo Voyles wrote in her note. 'My heart is breaking, not only for the loss of my dear son and his lovely girlfriend, but for my daughter who has lost so much more than a brother, my grandchildren who just lost their Dad, and my family & friends that will never again share the joy of a beloved nephew, cousin, stepbrother, step son, grandson, and friend. 'My soul is bruised deeply and has a hole that won't ever be repaired. I do want to say thank you for so many lovely thoughts and prayers. They truly help. It is heart warming and comforting. I wish I could answer everyone of you, but please know your love is felt by me and our family.'","The couple was identified as 30-year-old Ronnie Jean Renfro and 31-year-old Marshall Shambo .

"By . Aap . The adorable story of how Tiny the dog was rescued by the New Zealand Navy after being stuck on a floating log has been set straight by his owner. Ben Ngawaka, 20, said his pal had, in fact, only been stranded for a few hours on Smokehouse Bay, and not for two days since a storm had hit the area, as previously reported. Mr Ngawaka said he took his boat out from his home on Rangiahua Island home to do some shopping at the nearest store at Port Fitzroy on Great Barrier Island with his dog on Thursday. The crew of the New Zealand Navy ship Hawea spotted the dog standing helplessly on a drifting log . He stopped to collect a floating log he thought might be useful for building repairs, Mr Ngawaka told The New Zealand Herald on Sunday. ‘I had a little look for (Tiny) when I got to Fitzroy and couldn't find him. I realised, “oh, my dog must have got off on that log"",' he said. ‘He must have thought that when we stopped, we were parking on the shore and jumped off.’ Mr Ngawaka said he wasn't concerned because he knew Tiny would stay put.

HMNZS Hawea's commanding officer, Lieutenant Anthony Norris, said an animal stuck on a log in the water was an unusual and unexpected sight. ‘There was significant debris in the water and on one large log floating in the water was this poor helpless dog,’ he said.","Tiny the dog was not swept out to sea by a storm two days earlier as previously reported .

A knighthood ceremony is expected in Port Moresby in October. PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill is expected to front police in relation to allegations he authorised the illegal payment of about $31 million to a law firm . Proving a particularly colourful weekend, the country’s Prime Minister Peter O'Neill is expected to front the fraud squad on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest by the anti-corruption watchdog. The warrant relates to allegations Mr O'Neill personally authorised the illegal payment of about $31 million to law firm Paul Paraka lawyers. Mr O'Neill has strenuously denied the allegations, and said a letter produced by the opposition, allegedly bearing his signature and ordering the payments, was a fraud. PNG's Opposition first raised the allegations last year, when Opposition Leader Belden Namah produced a letter allegedly bearing Mr O'Neill's signature and authorising the payments. In January, Task Force Sweep announced Mr O'Neill had no case to answer following interviews with staff at the Prime Minister's Office, as well as checks of their outgoing correspondence register. Mr O'Neill has strenuously denied the allegations, and said a letter produced by the opposition, allegedly bearing his signature and ordering the payments, was a fraud . 'We have searched all possible avenues including the PM's Office, Department of Finance, Department of Treasury and banks for the original copy of the subject letter without any success,'Mr Koim said at the time. Also in January, the Opposition produced three National Court warrants for Mr O'Neill's arrest over the affair, however the government successfully had them overturned. The Paul Paraka affair - called Parakagate in Port Moresby - is one of PNG's longest running fraud investigations. Mr Paraka, one of the most powerful lawyers in PNG, was arrested and charged in 2013 for allegedly receiving the state monies which the task force alleges the payments were spread over a seven-year period and ran into the 'hundreds of millions'. In May last year, Mr O'Neill threatened to sack everyone in his finance department over the alleged scam involving top officials and lawyers. Mr O'Neill commands a huge majority in PNG's single house of parliament, with roughly 95 out of 111 ministers supporting his government.","Police Commissioner Tom Kulunga was jailed and released on bail on Friday for failing to follow a court order to reinstate a sacked policeman .

"By . Paul Harris . His father is hailed as the greatest racehorse of all time, unbeaten in 14 spectacular outings. Now meet the family: Son of Frankel, his thoroughbred mother. . . and a new brother or sister on the way. They have nicknamed the little one Frank, for the moment at least – and upon his already impressive haunches may rest the chance of securing not just a fortune for his owners, but another place in history for the Frankel dynasty. Grandstanding: The foal showed off his confident stride and juvenile physique for the cameras at Kensington Palace yesterday . Bidding for the three-month-old foal, sold with his pregnant mother, opened at £1million yesterday. At a landmark auction in the grounds of Kensington Palace, he became the first 'Frankelfoal' the champion has sired since retirement to be offered at a public sale. The three-in-one package sold for £1,150,000 – or £1,462,800 including premium and tax. That works out at more than £11 for every minute of Frank's 90-day life so far. He was bought by Michael Vincent Magnier, who runs one of the most prominent bloodstock operations in Europe. Afterwards he said with some understatement he believed he had bought 'a nice horse'. He added: 'It's a little bit of history.' Smiling, he looked forward to this time in 2016, when Frank will be ready to race. 'It will be quite an interesting week,' he said. Mr Magnier also has a famous pedigree – he is the son of John Magnier, the business partner of former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson until they fell out spectacularly over another horse, Rock of Gibraltar. Frank, the first Frankel foal to be offered for sale to the public. The bay colt is three months old . Michael Vincent Magnier with the three-month-old foal, fathered by racehorse Frankel and mother Crystal Gaze at The Orangery in London . Judging by little Frank's grandstanding performance yesterday, Mr Magnier landed a bargain. With a confident stride, and the juvenile physique that quickly marked his father out as a winner, Frank may already have taken his first steps towards becoming a champion. Was he showing off a teeny bit for the cameras? 'He knows he's special,' stud hand Frankie Price told me as she led him around the lawns of the palace orangery. 'He's got a real cool dude mentality. He's an absolute joy to be with.' Frankel is rated the best horse ever on the Flat and was retired to stud in 2012, his bloodline is now highly sought-after . With Frank for his red-carpet style premiere was mother Crystal Gaze, due to give birth next year to another Frankel offspring. Two of her previous foals have won races. Those who know are confident that Frank is another good 'un, as punters might phrase it. The sale, by auction house Goffs and the Al Thani family of Qatar, was held on the eve of Royal Ascot, as the biggest names in racing gather in London. Bidding for the three-month-old foal, sold with his pregnant mother, opened at £1million yesterday . Frank was meant to come last on a list of . 60 horses, a place he is unlikely to occupy often if he lives up to . expectations. But organisers brought his lot forward to stop him getting . impatient. They probably needn't have bothered. He simply stole the show. David Redvers, owner of Tweenhills stud, which bred Frank and the awaited sibling, said: 'He's such a little superstar. 'He has never been off the farm in his life and here he is, showcasing a sale like this, taking the whole thing incredibly well.' He confessed to 'a huge amount of regret' at selling Frank, adding: 'He has the same physical attributes as Frankel... just look at the hind quarters. 'That's where the engine is, and this is definitely a Formula One engine.' But the best may be yet to come. Frankel took £3million in prize money in three years, retiring in 2012. Well, a sort of retirement – he works six months a year as a stud. So far, his prowess off the course has raked in five times in stud fees what he won on the track. And if you were a betting man, you would probably take the odds that he's produced a clear winner to follow in his hoofsteps.","Frank sold at an auction in the grounds of Kensington Palace .

The teachers attempted to coerce the dog away from the children while herding others back inside the buildings. The three children, a seven and 10-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl, were bitten on the legs. The two boys were instantly taken to Monash hospital by paramedics while the young girl was treated by paramedics at the scene. The dog entered Ferny Creek Primary School in Melbourne's south-east (pictured) at lunchtime, when more than 220 students were playing outside . They are in a stable condition and their injuries are not believed to have been serious. The school's principal Matthew Coyle praised the teacher's actions. 'The teacher got bitten on the hand as he was trying to get the dog away from the kids, so well done to him and well done to his support staff,' Mr Coyle said on the Nine Network. 'They got the dog out onto the road completely away from the school.' The two boys who were attacked were taken to Monash hospital by paramedics while the young girl was treated by paramedics at the scene . A spokeswoman for the Yarra Ranges Council said the dog, believed to be a 12-month-old English bulldog, was seized by council rangers. The school was locked down for the rest of lunchtime while paramedics, police and the council were called. The council is investigating the attack.","Three children and a teacher required treatment after being attacked .

"By . Mark Wilson . Paul Slane refuses to accept that a brush with notoriety will provide a full stop on his football career. After 18 months without a club, the 22-year-old is fighting to return to the game and bring an end to a self-confessed ‘nightmare’. When Slane was just 18, he won what he thought would be a dream move from Motherwell to Celtic. But cruciate ligament damage was followed by ankle and hip problems as a grim toll of injuries left him in despair. Second chances: Paul Slane is hoping to rebuild his career . Restart: He is currently taking part in Revolution Sports Management Pre-Season Camp for out-of-contract players . Slane was released by Celtic in January 2013 with a £10,000 pay-off that would fund a hip  operation. But he admitted he blew around half of that sum on nights out, including an infamous trip to Amsterdam that saw photos of Slane with prostitutes go viral on Twitter. Inevitably, that made him a  feature of the tabloid news pages but the midfielder is now desperate to once again win headlines for his undoubted ability. Slane has enrolled in a summer training camp run by Revolution Sports Management in East Kilbride to boost his fitness and win back employment. His determination is fuelled not just by his own pride and  ambition, but also by a desire to repay parents George and Susan for helping him through such a grim period. ‘When I was at Motherwell and Celtic, there was never any trouble,’ insisted Slane. ‘They know the type of person I am. ‘Obviously, when I left I did a stupid thing. The worst thing about that is not about myself but I was putting my mum and dad through it. My main aim now is just to get fit and show people that I am not really like that.’ What money Slane earned from his contract at Celtic has long gone, forcing him to rely on cash from his parents at the family home in Anderston. ‘It’s not a nice feeling to do that,’ he admitted. ‘I spoke to my mum and dad and said it might be time for me to get a job. ‘But if I got a job, I’d have missed out on my rehab sessions. We came to the decision that I’d keep doing that and live off my mum and dad giving me money here and there. ‘At this stage of my life, I should be giving them money. That’s the hardest thing. From a young age when I made it, I always wanted to be able to help my mum and dad. ‘It’s the other way about just now but, hopefully, I can pay them back in the next few years. ‘I want to repay the faith they have shown in me.’ Slane is now taking forward strides, but even getting to this stage has been an arduous road. Former glory: Slane has played in the past for Celtic, Motherwell and MK Dons . Capped: He also played five times for Scotland's under-17s . ‘I left Celtic and went to Motherwell but my hip was too sore at the time,’ he reflected. ‘I decided to get the operation and it’s been a nightmare ever since. It’s broken my heart. ‘I did the rehab after the  operation myself and it didn’t go too well. There were times when it was sore and I was training when I shouldn’t have been. ‘But there were also times when I should have pushed through it, but took days off instead. ‘I’d gone to Kilmarnock at the start of last season but I wasn’t ready. It took me about nine months to feel strong again. ‘I went to Morton at the end of last season and it felt great to be back training. It’s amazing to be playing football and I’m ready to kick on now.’ Slane has not set his sights on any specific level of the game. Four years on from joining Celtic, he just wants another chance to shine. ‘When you break through, people are talking about you,’ said Slane. ‘All your pals and family say it’s the perfect life. It’s a dream for every boy and you are living it. ‘But then it gets taken away  from you through injuries. It’s soul- destroying at times. But you need to be strong enough to believe you can get it back. ‘If you are going to feel sorry for yourself, you’d be as well giving up. Even when I was feeling down, I kept telling myself to keep  fighting and that I’d get back to a level and enjoy myself again. ‘I think I’ve maybe gone through six operations. I can’t accept that I’m not meant to play football. I will fight until the day it is  impossible. This is the biggest year I have ever faced football-wise, so I’m excited about it.’ THE RSM training camps are held at the K-Park in East Kilbride and are open to players in and out of contract.

"By . David Mccormack . and Snejana Farberov . A mother of two from Massachusetts has received an apology from JetBlue after a flight attendant did nothing to help when her three-year-old had a bathroom emergency on the plane and was forced to urinate in her seat. Jennifer Devereaux, a photographer from West Newton, was returning home from New York on Monday when she says the 30-minute trip aboard JetBlue Flight 518 turned into a nightmare for her and her two daughters. The plane was sitting on the tarmac at John F Kennedy International Airport for about 30 minutes when Devereaux's daughter Summer said she needed to use the restroom. Scroll down for video . Mother of two Jennifer Devereaux, from West Newton, Massachusetts, has received an apology from JetBlue after a flight attendant did nothing to help when her three-year-old daughter Summer had a bathroom emergency on a plane . The mother asked a flight attendant if her toddler could use the bathroom, but in response the woman allegedly 'snapped' at Devereaux, ordering her to 'sit down.' But little Summer could not wait any longer and ended up relieving herself in her seat. ‘It wasn’t about bad customer service at that point, it was about bad human decency. My daughter was sitting in a pool of urine and I couldn’t do anything about it,’ Deveraux told CBS Boston. ‘And as a mom it just broke my heart.’ The married mother of two had no napkins or towels on hand, so she was forced to use her own sweater to soak up the mess. Nightmare scenario: Jennifer Devereaux (right) says when her 3-year-old daughter Summer (left) had a bathroom emergency aboard a JetBlue flight, she was yelled at and embarrassed by the crew . Family trip: The mother of two, a photographer from Newton, Massachusetts, was returning home from New York with her daughters when the incident happened . As she was trying to tidy up, Mrs Devereaux said the flight attendant yelled at her. ‘And I said, “Please give me a break. My daughter had an accident because you wouldn’t let me take her to the bathroom. After I clean it up I will sit down.” She turned around and reported it to the pilot,’ said Devereaux. As the plane was turned around and returned to the gate, the captain’s voice came on the PA system announcing that there is a non-compliant passenger who would be removed by security guards. Jennifer Devereaux, who was traveling alone with her two daughters, grew fearful, but fortunately for her an off-duty pilot who was sitting in front of her was able to convince his colleagues in the cockpit to let her stay. Upon returning home to West Newton, the mother of two penned a complaint to the airline demanding an apology for the flight crew's behavior towards her family. Delay: JetBlue fFlight 518 (not pictured) was sitting on the tarmac in JFK for 30 minutes when her toddler declared she needed to go to the bathroom . She says JetBlue apologized to her Saturday, offered her a full credit and $5,000 to the charity of her choice.  Devereaux said this is the best response they could have received. 'She said ""I am a mom too. I understand what you’re going through and I am so sorry this happened to you,’” Devereaux explained. 'It just felt so good to hear those words from someone from that company.' JetBlue says employees will undergo sensitivity training.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teen in North Carolina was sent home from school on her last day of high school after school administrators determined that the outfit she was wearing was in violation of the school's dress code regrading skirt length. Her mother, however, has a plan to stick it to the school for what she and her daughter believe was an unfair punishment for breaking a fairly ambiguous rule. Violet Burkhart's mother's plan to protest the school's vague dress code: She's going to wear the exact same outfit to her daughter's graduation. Short: Violet Burkhart was sent home from school for wearing this dress, which administrators deemed too short . Protest: Amy Redwine (left) wore the same outfit to her daughter's graduation that got her sent home from school on her last day . 'I'm going to wear it in front of everyone and be proud just like she . should have been able to on her last day... With two hours left in the . day, Violet says teachers pulled her aside and said her dress was half an . inch too short,' Burkhart's mother, Amy Redwine, tells WGHP. The dress code at Central Davidson High School is admittedly vague. According to the school, it doesn't allow 'Shorts, skirts, skorts and dresses shorter than mid-thigh,' noting that 'Mid-thigh is a difficult measure.' The problem Redwine and her daughter have with the school is not with the dress code, rather with how administrators handled the situation. 'I thought my last day was going to be great and exciting, but they pretty much ruined it for me,' Burkhart told MyFox8.com. Too short: The principal told Redwine's daughter that the dress (pictured) was too short to wear to school . Her mother is equally upset with how the school handled things. 'I literally looked back at the clock and I’m thinking, it’s 1:00 in the afternoon on her last day of her senior year. My daughter — it’s supposed to be one of her best days and she’s there crying,' Redwine said. Burkhart says she wore that exact same dress to school at least five times before she was told to go home in the middle of her last day of high school. Another student at Central Davidson High School says she also had suffered from the school's vague dress code. 'My daughter goes to the same school and she was sent home. Not for the . length but she was told it enhanced her figure too much. Central . Davidson high school is a joke,' the mother of another student said. Pattern: Another mother also complained about the dress code after her daughter was sent home because her outfit 'enhanced her figure too much' As if the school's dress code wasn't vague enough, a clause in the dress code says 'Principals may elect to enact additional restrictions as deemed appropriate to preserve the educational environment.' In other words, if a principal doesn't like what a student is wearing, he or she may decide that it's damaging the 'educational environment' and force the student to go home.","Violet Burkhart was sent home from Central Davidson High School on her last day because administrators thought her dress was too short .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . While Rachel Canning hasn't made many headlines since becoming the 'spoiled New Jersey teenager' who took teenage angst to a whole new level by trying to divorce her mom and dad back in March, it doesn't mean she's stopped living life on her own terms. Now the 18-year-old who wanted to have her cake and eat it, too, has finished out the senior year she fought so hard to force her parents to pay for in a blaze of glory befitting the headlines she won back in March. When her parents refused to cough up for the icing, the syrupy sweet cheerleader hauled them into court to keep the honey flowing. She's since dropped the case and moved home again, while apparently keeping the boyfriend who court docs show was the reason behind their domestic strife. And if the party didn't stop then, it . certainly wasn't going to end as Canning edged ever closer to senior prom, graduation and her future as a college student free from the . influence of her mother and former Lincoln Park, New Jersey police chief . father. Graduation! Litigious cheerleader Rachel Canning dropped her lawsuit against her parents in March after a judge all but scoffed at her for wanted to live apart from her parents while forcing them to pay her private high school tuition . Prom! Senior prom appeared like the time of Rachel's (far right) life, though whose cashed she used for the fairy-like dress remained a mystery . Day to remember: Rachel (right) was dressed like the princess she was accused of being in so many headlines this spring as she attended Morrison Catholic High School's senior prom in May just months after suing her own parents . Catholic school girl: Rachel dropped her suit and moved back in with her parents soon after trying to get tuition out of them for the remainder of her senior year. Here, the 18-year-old is pictured at a court hearing, which she attended with several of her friends while wearing her Catholic school uniform . To be fair, the honors student would leave Morris Catholic High School with a $56,000 scholarship to Western New England University, enough to make one think twice before assuming she's some parasitic princess. However, photos posted to her social media accounts and those of her friends since the media circus around her suit died down mostly support her parents' court arguments that she's just a spoiled teen with a bad news boyfriend and a new found love of partying. Graduation was a good time for Canning, though she managed to sleep through her final chapel service as a catholic high schooler. She also who tweeted on the big day: 'I wanna be drunk when I wake up On the right side of the wrong bed.' Did the lyrics from English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran reflect reality for the 18-year-old? Parties! Rachel tweeted out these song lyrics on the day of graduation. Her parents accused the teen of hard partying the led up to her leaving home. She'd since moved back ion, but has the debauchery continued? YOLO? The teen managed to sleep through her last chapel service as a Catholic schooler, but the honoros student denied her behavior had changed in her March lawsuit . They do if it went anything like many of her last high school days and nights, when photos reveal Canning and her friends drinking and partying hard. Prom looked fun for the teen, too, though her photos from the night reveal she may not have attended on the arm of Lucas Kitzmiller, the boyfriend who Canning's parent's disapproved of so vehemently they were willing to let their daughter leave home rather than date him. Whether she attended with Lucas or not, Rachel still proudly displays a photo of the two of them on her Twitter account. Courtroom foes: She had sued Elizabeth and Sean Canning, pictured in court, after leaving home last year. They claimed her behavior had drastically worsened in part as a result of her dating a boy named Lucas. Residual anger? This month, long after the courtroom showdown that never was, Rachel tweeted this. Her father is a former Chief of Police in their town . That's where soon-to-be college freshman also had some choice words for people like her former cop father. 'The majority of cops are such assholes,' she tweeted. Soon Rachel will have all the freedom in the world to go against her parents' wishes as her adolescence turns into adulthood. But when her $56,000 runs out at Western New England--where tuition, room and board cost $46,154 per year--will she sue herself to cough up the cash? They must have settled: Even as she prepares to move away to Massachusetts for college, the 18-year-old is still pictured in social media with the boyfriend, Lucas Kitzmiller, who angered her parents so much . College-bound! Rachel (left at left and with the red cup at right) is now headed to college where she'll study biomedical engineering on a $56,000 scholarship.

"By . Mark Prigg . Amazon was today putting the finishing touches to its first phone, which is set to be unveiled within hours by boss Jeff Bezos. It is believed the the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.' It is believed the handset will initially be offered in the US only by AT&T in a deal that echoes the launch of the original iPhone. Scroll down for Video . Amazon's much rumoured holophone is set to be announced on June 18. The retailer released a teaser video on Wednesday, showing people's reaction to the device. Previously images of the handset have leaked online. The latest images (pictured) reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone . The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen. These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses. The rumoured deal has already riled AT&T's competitors, . Seattle based T-Mobile’s chief executive, John Legere, tweeted, 'Really, @Amazon? What happened to home-town pride?' Previously images of the handset have leaked online. It has been under development since 2009 at Lab126, Amazon’s secretive Silicon Valley hardware division. More than 1,600 people claim Lab126 as their employer on the professional networking site LinkedIn, according to Business Week. The latest images also reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone. 'Multiple trusted sources have verified the authenticity of the image, which was created for internal use by graphic designers at Amazon,' web site BGR said. The handset appears to take design cues from Apple's iPhone 5 and Google's Nexus handset. 'As can be seen in this new image published exclusively by BGR, Amazon’s phone will feature an overall look that is similar to many full touch smartphones currently on the market,' said BGR. 'In fact, it appears to take design cues from several existing smartphones including Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup and even the HTC One, which has a polished, chamfered bezel much like the one seen on Amazon’s phone.' The handset is believed to have a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work. It will run a highly customized version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets. The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, the report claims. This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September. The Amazon handset has a beveled edge similar to apple's iPhone 5 . Apple's patented system is slightly different to the 3D display Amazon is rumoured to be working on. The first pictures of Amazon's 3D handset were revealed last week, pictured, and appeared to feature four cameras and retina-tracking technology that are used to create a 'floating screen' effect . Previously the site has obtained images of the handset sheathed in a protective case. 'Finally, we have obtained exclusive photos of a prototype of the unreleased device, giving the world its first look at Amazon’s hotly anticipated phone, web site has previously BGR said. 'As can be seen in the images, the device is covered by a protective shell intended to prevent people without authorization from seeing the physical design of the phone.' KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the firm will launch a phone. 'We predict Amazon (US) will launch its own brand smartphone in 3-6 months, using the same hardware strategy as used for its e-reader and tablet,' he recently wrote. 'The supply chain will start stocking up materials in Q2 2014 for production.' It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console. The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. The handset is shown in a special protective case to shield its final design. However, the four cameras are clearly visible in each corner . The handset look almost like Nokia's Windows Phone with its large, rounded shell - although that is believed to be simply to hide the final design . Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box. 'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said. The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September . 'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO. The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus. The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast. Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen . The firm said it plans to add more services in the future. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US. Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.","Phone rumoured to show images that 'float above the screen like holograms'

"By . Damien Gayle . Fifty suspected members of the LA Crips street gang have been arrested in a massive swoop by 1,300 FBI agents and LAPD officers. The bust focused on the Five Deuce Broadway Gangster Crips, a gang with nearly 200 members operating in an area just west of the Skid Row district of Los Angeles, the FBI said. Officers and agents working in small, heavily armed units burst into homes and properties around the area to seize suspects and weapons. There were no reports of resistance to the surprise raids. A law enforcement officer escorts a suspected member of the Broadway Gangster Crips street gang after he was arrested in Los Angeles yesterday in a swoop which culminates a three-year grand jury investigation . The suspect he is interviewed by an FBI agent at a mobile police station drafted in for the huge operation . Suspects had their details taken in mobile police stations drafted in specifically for the operation before being carted off to jail. Large quantities of weapons and drugs were seized and taken as evidence. Most of those arrested were among 72 defendants named in a federal racketeering indictment which alleges their involvement in robberies, murders, extortion, witness intimidation and drug trafficking. The suspects are alleged to have been involved in dealing drugs including PCP, methamphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine and crack cocaine, and cannabis. U.S. Attorney André Birotte Jr said: 'Criminal street gangs make their livelihood by ruthlessly preying on the innocent people that live in the neighborhoods they claim as territory. 'What makes the conduct of this gang particularly insidious is not only the violent crimes alleged but also the exploitation of Skid Row drug users who are already living in difficult circumstances.' A law enforcement officer looks at weapons displayed on a table at a news conference announcing federal racketeering charges against suspected members of the Broadway Gangster Crips street gang yesterday . Weapons seized included handguns, shotguns and even hunting rifles . Police struck yesterday morning after a three-year grand jury investigation led to a 112-count indictment. Suspects were taken away in buses while officers displayed dozens of seized weapons, including pistols, shotguns and hunting rifles. Dubbed Operation Gremlin Riders, after the violent clique targeted, the swoop aimed at breaking up 'a criminal enterprise that used violence and intimidation to control an area centering on the intersection of 52nd Street and South Broadway in South Los Angeles,' the FBI said. The gang formed in the 1970s to confront rival street gangs, the FBI said, but had since grown into an organised crime cartel 'that conducts annual meetings and enforces a strict set of rules.' Specific allegations against members include four murders since 1987, including killings of unarmed victims with no gang affiliations; conspiracy to murder a fellow gang member who had given statements to police; 'follow home' robberies that targeted people who'd just been to banks; and 'numerous' drug deals near schools and playgrounds. It also accused gang members of firing shots at California Highway Patrol Officers during a high speed chase two years ago. FBI agents support a suspected gang member on to a bus to be taken away to jail after his arrest yesterday . This map shows the centre of the turf claimed by the Five Deuce Broadway Gangster Crips . Of the 50 people arrested yesterday, 48 were named in the federal indictment and two more were arrested on local charges. A further 17 grand jury suspects were already in custody on unrelated charges and eight more remain at large. All those named in the federal indictment face potential minimum sentences of 10 years in prison, but many face terms of life without parole. The Crips are an almost exclusively African-American gang founded in South Central LA in 1969 by Raymond Washington and Stanley 'Tookie' Williams. These days it operates as a loosely connected network of individual street gangs. Members of the Crips had been known for their use of the colour blue in their clothing, and their bitter rivalry with the Bloods, a rival gang identifiable by the colour red.","Bust focused on Five Deuce Broadway Gangster Crips in South Los Angeles .

However, the match failed to generate more tweets than the opener, where the hosts played Croatia in the opening match of the tournament. After falling a goal behind early in the game, Brazil rallied to win 3-1, maintaining their status as favourites for the event. Twitter dominated conversation around the match, with some 12.2 million tweets sent during the game. More than 150 countries joined in the discussion, and Brazil’s Neymar – who picked up 165,000 new followers over the 90 minutes – was the most talked-about player. Last night's match means the U.S. and Germany are now level-pegging at the top of Group G with one win each, while Ghana and Portugal are at the bottom. Ghana dominated much the rest of the game, making a total of 21 shots, but only scored one goal when Andre Ayew leveled in the 82nd minute. That was quick: Clint Dempsey scored 32 seconds into the U.S. World Cup team's game against Ghana on Monday . Just four minutes later, Brooks - a 21-year-old who came on at halftime because Matt Besler was injured — scored off a corner from Graham Zusi. It was the first time an American sub had ever scored in the World Cup. Dempsey's goal made him the first U.S. player to score in three different World Cups and was the fastest ever scored by an American in the tournament. Dempsey's goal showed the kind of technical flair seldom seen from a squad that typically scores through set pieces. Brooks' game winner came in the waning minutes as the Americans were desperately trying to survive waves of attacks from Ghana. DaMarcus Beasley, who became the first American to play in four World Cups, started the buildup to Dempsey's goal with a pass to Jermaine Jones, who fed it to Dempsey inside the penalty area. With a nifty move to split defenders John Boye and Sulley Muntari, Dempsey sent the left-footed shot past goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey, where the ball bounced off the post and in. Ghana applied relentless pressure on U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard and finally drew even when captain Asamoah Gyan flicked a backheel pass to Ayew, who used the outside of his left foot for a powerful shot. Ghana was still pressing for a winner when Brooks delivered the header. He appeared shocked to have scored, raising his hands to his head before falling to the ground to be mobbed by his teammates. Meanwhile, fans across the U.S. - and across the globe - are celebrating the win over the team that dashed their World Cup hopes in the previous two tournaments.","Over 174,00 tweets per minute were sent when Clint Dempsey scored in the first minute .

"By . Lydia Warren . The teenage stowaway who miraculously survived the flight from California to Hawaii in the wheel well of a plane has spoken out for the first time about his death-defying journey. Speaking to CBS San Francisco, 15-year-old Yahya Abdi, who is originally from Somalia, said he jumped aboard the jet in San Jose on April 20 because he was desperate to see his mother, who is living in Africa. 'I took that plane because it was the . closest one I could find that was going to go west,' Abdi said. As the plane took off, he crouched down, covered his ears and as they soared to 35,000 feet, nothing more than the outer shell of the plane protected him from a fatal plunge. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Yahya Abdi, the 15-year-old who hid in a plane's wheel well in April, said he was not scared throughout the five-and-a-half hour journey. He said he was simply desperate to see his mother . 'It was above the clouds, I could see through the little holes,' he said. Despite the harrowing journey, he insisted he was not scared and revealed he had planned the escape for a while because he was desperate to get away from his family's home in Santa Clara. 'I didn't want to . live with my stepmom,' he explained. 'Second of all, I wanted to find my mom. I haven't . seen her since I was young.'

Saved: He is pictured being taken for medical care but says he is well and has regained all of his hearing . Hiding place: He hid in this jet wheel well after finding the first plane that was heading west . It emerged last week that she has left the refugee camp because threats have been made against her life. She believes relatives of her former husband - Abdi's father - could be behind the calls. Abdlrasak Abas Omar, a legal protection officer at the camp, said that Abdule showed camp administrators logs of anonymous calls she said were made by people threatening her with death. She added to The Associated Press that the boy longed to see her, but couldn't because his father told him she was dead and didn't allow contact. She said his relatives are now out to get her. 'They are going to kill me, so that his claims that I was dead will turn out to be true,' she said. Abdi was hospitalized in Hawaii for two weeks, then flown back to California where he was placed in custody of Santa Clara County Child Protective Services.

"By . Associated Press . Eccentric Texas businessman-turned-artist Stanley Marsh 3, whose partially buried row of Cadillacs became a road-side tourist attraction in the 1970s, died Tuesday. He was 76. Marsh, long known in his hometown of Amarillo as a prankster and philanthropist but who faced indictment alleging he molested teenage boys late in life, died in Amarillo, criminal attorney Paul Nugent said. An heir to his family's oil-and-gas fortune, Marsh was a quirky but successful banker and television executive. But he was best known for his art, most notably 'Cadillac Ranch,' a row of 10 graffiti-splattered cars seemingly standing on their noses along Interstate 40 west of Amarillo. Stanley Marsh 3, who died yesterday, leans on one of the 10 Cadillacs buried down on his ranch west of Amarillo, Texas, along old Route 66 in June of 1984 . The display, which will celebrate its 40th anniversary Saturday, quickly became a tourist attraction after Marsh commissioned the Ant Farm, a radical art and design collective, to build it in 1974. The cars — acquired from junkyards, private owners and used car lots — were moved a mile west in 1997. In 2012, when Marsh was 74, several lawsuits were filed alleging he'd paid two boys, ages 15 and 16 at the time, for sexual acts. He settled the lawsuits the next year, but was indicted two months later on charges that accused him of sexually assaulting six teenagers in recent years. Marsh denied the allegations and vowed to fight them in court. No trial date had been set. 'It is unfortunate Stanley died before he had the opportunity to clear his good name,' Nugent said in an emailed statement. 'The criminal accusations made by those seeking to become millionaires will now forever remain mere allegations — untested and unproven in a criminal courtroom.' Marsh's artistic creations include a mesa painted to look as if it were floating and a football field-sized pool table hidden in the Panhandle terrain that only could be seen from the air. Hundreds of his mock road signs popped up in Amarillo neighborhoods, bearing such slogans as 'Big Deal' and 'My Grandmother Can Whip Your Grandmother.' 'Amarillo has lost a bit of its color,' longtime friend Wyatt McSpadden said. 'He certainly enlivened what might have been a kind of dull place.' Marsh, whose health had deteriorated in recent years after a series of strokes, had long been pulling pranks in Amarillo. 'By nature I'm an introvert, and I'm a shy person,' Marsh once said. 'When I do these stunts, which cause a great deal of attention, I can kind of shift gears and act like a master of ceremonies.' In this photo from November 28, 2012 millionaire artist Stanley Marsh 3 is booked into the Potter County, Texas, Detention Center . Marsh was born on Jan. 31, 1938, in Amarillo. His father and grandfather made their fortunes in the oil and gas business, but Marsh didn't follow in their footsteps. His given name was Stanley Marsh 'III,' but he changed it to '3'' because he thought the former was pretentious. His creative bent began as a child and included carving swords and painting with watercolors, prompting some to tell him that made him an artist. 'It's a lot better to be an artist than to be just somebody who makes things, so I said, 'Of course I'm an artist,' he told The Associated Press in 2009. He earned his bachelor's degree in economics and master's degree in American civilization from the University of Pennsylvania. He and his wife, Wendy, adopted five children and had numerous grandchildren, and lived in Toad Hall, a 300-acre estate on the outskirts of Amarillo. He returned to Amarillo after college in the late 1960s and impressed those who knew him as a prankster with his business skills by heading a local bank. In 1967, Marsh purchased KVII-TV and turned it into the city's top-rated television station within a few years. Marsh sold the station in 2002 but continued to go to his office and pursue artistic endeavors. In 1975, Marsh showed up at the Washington bribery trial of then-U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Texan accused in a milk-price scandal, dressed in a fringe Western jacket and carrying a pail of cow dung. Despite such antics, Marsh said he considered himself mature and responsible, a ""leader of men who is doing what I want to do, and more people should be like me."" But some felt he went too far. In 1994, Marsh was accused of locking a local teenager in a chicken coop and threatening him with a hammer for stealing one of the hundreds of diamond-shaped street signs he'd placed around town, some of which read: ""Steal This Sign."" Marsh later pleaded no contest to two misdemeanors. Although his art and shenanigans were often public, Marsh said he never wanted to be figured out. In 1994, he said he wanted his epitaph to read in part: ""Thanks, everybody. I had a good time.""","An heir to his family's oil-and-gas fortune, Stanley Marsh was a quirky but successful banker and television executive who was best known for his art .

"By . Associated Press . A bill that would have made California the first state in the nation to require warning labels on sodas and other sugary drinks was effectively killed on Tuesday. Senator Bill Monning's SB1000 failed on a 7-8 vote as his fellow Democratic lawmakers doubted whether a label would change consumer behavior. It needed 10 votes to pass. Certain sodas, energy drinks and fruit drinks would have included a label reading, 'STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay.' A shopper walks past the soda aisle at a grocery store in Los Angeles in 2011. California lawmakers today blocked a bill that would have required warning labels on the sugary drinks . It was developed by public health advocates using cigarette and alcohol warnings as a model. Representatives of the beverage industry argued that the bill was unfair by not applying to other foods and drinks, including lattes and chocolate milk. Mr Monning, of Carmel, said warning labels would be the most efficacious tool for educating people about the dangers of sugary drinks. 'Changing behavior is the hardest challenge in the world of medicine,' Monning told lawmakers before the vote. 'But you can't start to even make a commitment to make behavior change if you don't have the information.' His bill had support from the California . Medical Association, the California Center for Public Health Advocacy . and groups devoted to improving the health of minorities. A similar bill . introduced in Vermont stalled this year. The graph above shows the amount of sugar and the number of calories in a variety of sodas and other drinks . Democratic Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez noted that cigarette warning labels were accompanied by taxes and prohibitions on smoking in public places before tobacco use plunged. 'It wasn't necessarily the labels that changed peoples' habits, but it was the other requirements,' said Gomez, who represents Los Angeles. A county in California recently launched the Sugar Bites ad campaign to encourage less consumption of sodas and other drinks with added sugar . CalBev, the California arm of the . American Beverage Association, says it posts calorie counts on the front . of many beverage containers as part of a voluntary campaign that . started in 2010. Industry groups also say warning labels may conflict with an upcoming overhaul of the nutritional information labels regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Sugary drinks have been a target of public health advocates who see them as one of the biggest drivers of preventable diseases. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg pushed a ban on large servings of soft drinks in 2012. A court later struck down the ban after it prompted lawsuits and an aggressive campaign from businesses. Leaders in San Francisco and Berkeley are considering sending measures imposing a sugary drink tax to voters in November after nearby Richmond rejected such a tax in 2012. A children's health group recently launched a 'Sugar Bites' ad campaign in the east San Francisco Bay Area and state capital depicting sugary drinks as snarling monsters with sharp teeth held by anxious children. Mr Monning, who previously called for a soda tax, said he would keep pushing for warning labels.","The bill would have required certain sodas, energy drinks and fruit drinks to warn consumers that added sugar 'contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay'

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The mother of a three-month-old Maine girl who died while in the care of a baby sitter has filed a lawsuit against the caretaker and her 12-year-old daughter. The suit filed by Nicole Greenaway in Kennebec County Superior Court alleges negligence on the part of the Fairfield woman who was entrusted with the care of Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway and seeks unspecified damages. The baby sitter's daughter Kelli Murphy, who was 10 at the time, had faced a manslaughter charge, but pleaded guilty last month to several misdemeanors. Her mother Amanda Huard was never charged. Tragic: 12-year-old Kelli Murphy pleaded guilty to several manslaughter charges in connection to the 2012 death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenway (pictured) Seeking damages: Nicole Greenaway has filed a lawsuit less than a month after Kelli Murphy plead guilty in a plea deal . Greenaway's attorney, Sheldon Tepler, tells the Morning Sentinel the suit is an opportunity to achieve some measure of justice after being torn apart by Brooklyn's death by suffocation in July 2012. A lawyer who represented the mother could not be reached. The suit doesn't seek specific monetary compensation, reports Central Maine, but lists the types of damage the family suffered. Brooklyn's four-year-old sister Madison was in the room at the time of the baby's death and suffered 'great pain and suffering and mental anguish … requiring hospitalization and medical treatment.' Greenaway is also seeking damages for the suffering of her baby daughter and the anguish she has suffered since her death, funeral expenses and the loss of the comfort and companionship of her daughter. She's also asking for punitive damages 'to deter (Murphy’s) future outrageous conduct.' Tepler told Central Maine that suing Huard and Murphy is the only recourse for Greenaway. 'You can’t get revenge,' he said. 'People need to feel validated. They really need to feel that their loss is validated. The only way you can do that in this country is by seeking monetary damages.' Kelli Murphy pleaded guilty to several misdemeanors in a plea deal in May. A . judge signed off on the deal which dropped manslaughter charges against Murphy, now 12, in a closed-door hearing. As part of the deal, . Murphy will submit to a treatment plan and remain in the custody of the . Maine Department of Health and Human Services until she turns 18. Bereaved: The suit is against Kelli Murphy, 12, and her mother Amanda Huard, who had been babysitting Brooklyn when she died . Justice: Greenaway's attorney, Sheldon Tepler said the suit is the family's opportunity to achieve some measure of validation after Murphy avoided jail time and her mother was never charged . 'I'm . satisfied with the outcome. It was the best that we could accomplish . given the complexities of the case and the age of the juvenile,' Deputy Attorney General William Stokes said. Murphy was first charged in the death of three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenway in July 2012. The charges stem from a night in which the baby stayed over at Murphy's house while her mother Huard babysat the infant. An autopsy and toxicology performed on the baby found . large quantities of the same prescription medication Murphy took to control her Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The deal came after the baby's mother Nicki Greenaway called for charges against Huard, saying the woman was neglectful in watching Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway, and that she should be held liable for her conduct. The state disagreed. 'Legally speaking, it’s not possible,' Stokes said. 'One of the things we have to prove in any death is causation, and we don’t have any evidence that [Huard] caused anybody’s death.' The juvenile petition against Murphy . contained no additional details about the case, including Brooklyn's cause of death, but the baby's mother, Nicki Greenaway, claims to have been told her child was suffocated. When Greenaway saw her daughter for the first time at a funeral home, the baby had a black eye, bruises on her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her cheeks, she said. 'Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway has died as a result of your neglect,' said a notice delivered to Huard in the weeks after her child's death. 'You knew that (the 10-year-old) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so.' Gone too soon: Baby Brooklyn died while in the care of Murphy and her mother - who was babysitting that night . Brooklyn's mother, Nicki, said traces of the 10-year-old's medication was found in her daughter's system . Murphy had already been labeled as a . danger to children before Foss-Greenaway's death, according to documents from the DHHS which detail . that she suffers behavioral problems, including oppositional defiant . disorder, ADHD and attachment . disorder. Former tenants of Huard's house also claimed Murphy also harmed their baby. Ashley Tenney and Chad Hopkins have . named the 10-year-old as being responsible for their daughter's . hospitalisation in June, brought on by sudden seizures. Doctors found the same medication in eight-month-old Jaylynn's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together. Tenney and Hopkins were living with in the basement of Huard's home, the Maine Sunday Telegram reported. They say the girl was alone with . their daughter in June 2012, while Hopkins was elsewhere in the house and . Tenney was out at work. The . couple trusted the girl, they said, that she had shown a 'healthy . interest' in their daughter up until that point, offering to help with . diaper changes and bathing. When Tenney arrived home from her shift at Dunkin' Donuts she found her daughter pale and sweating. 'She was soaked in sweat, just drenched,' said Tenney, 20. 'She was so pale. Whiter than a sheet of paper.' As they rushed her to the emergency room at MaineGeneral Medical Centre in Waterville, Jaylynn began convulsing and fitting. 'She . was on her father's lap, and her head just dropped back, and she . rapidly started shaking,' Tenney said. 'The first one lasted like 20 . seconds.' The sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on. Medical experts consulted one another and Jaylynn was transferred to Maine Medical Centre in Portland to be reassessed. Shock: Ashley Tenney (left) claims Murphy was also responsible for her daughter Jaylynn's (right) hospitalisation in June . 'If her head went to the left her arm . went to the right and vice versa,' she said. 'Her heart rate was high . and they were worried and didn't know what to do for her.' In . Portland doctors probed Tenney about what medications were in Huard's . house, matching up the 10-year-old's attention deficit hyperactivity . disorder drugs with what they found in Jaylynn's system. So . much was detected, Tenney said, that her daughter 'should have been . dead'. She added that there 'wasn't any way' she could have ingested the . medication on her own. In . the days following the scare, Tenney and Hopkins began looking for a new . place to live, sickened by the belief that Huard's daughter had . deliberately hurt their own. She . said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10-year-old's . bedroom, filled with more than 100 photographs of Jaylynn, some torn, . others with words like 'my baby girl' written on them. The . couple were interviewed by workers from the DHHS Office of Child and . Family Services, as were with the 10-year-old and her mother. All four . were told that the girl should not be given care of young children. But despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later, this time with three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway whose mother, Nicki, had left in Huard's care overnight.","Nicole Greenaway filed a suit against Kelli Murphy, 12, and her mother Amanda Huard seeking damages .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Sir John Major who has argued that the Scottish Government should be handed wide-ranging powers in a bid to curb enthusiasm for the 'folly' of full independence . Stopping Scottish independence is more important than re-electing David Cameron  to safeguard Britain's 'special relationship' with the US, former Tory Prime Minister John Major has claimed. Sir John said Scottish independence would force Britain to give up its nuclear weapons - sparking a diplomatic crisis with Washington. It would also increase demands for independence in Wales and Northern Ireland and diminish the UK's influence in the world, Sir John said. He claimed the 2015 general election was one of the most important since Margaret Thatcher was first elected - but pales in comparison to keeping the union together. The former Tory leader said 'I don’t wish to disparage the importance of the 2015 General Election at all – it is one of the more important elections we’ve had in the last 30 years or so. But it is less important than maintaining the United Kingdom as an entity.' He said: 'Of course, one of the big implications of Scotland becoming separate would be the SNP's threat to expel Trident from Faslane. Sir John said this would 'in effect, be the end of the serious British nuclear deterrent'. Sir John said 'you can't just move those subs, they need proper ports, they need proper facilities'. He added: 'You're talking of many, many years before they would have them, by which time Trident may no longer be as relevant as it is now. And that affects not just us, that affects every European country and Nato. 'How will the United States react when one of the only two countries with a credible military and nuclear capability suddenly has the nuclear capability effectively wrecked? 'This affects the United Kingdom. It affects our security. There are long-term, strategic questions for the whole of the United Kingdom that depend upon the result of this referendum.' Yesterday, Sir John said: 'America would not forgive - nor forget - this, and yet the separatists assume membership of NATO is almost a given. Trust me, it is far from that.' The former Prime Minister said the UK cannot be ‘broken apart without damaging repercussions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland – some unforeseen, some unforeseeable’. He said: 'If Scotland were to become a separate country that would have serious implications, I believe, for Scotland, and negative implications. 'But it would also have very negative implications for the rest of the United Kingdom as well. 'If, for example, you see a country begin to fracture, does it have greater or lesser influence over its international bodies, in the European Union, in the United Nations, in the G7, in any of the international groupings? Self-evidently they have less. 'If you have Scotland deciding to be independent, what does that actually do inside the rest of the United Kingdom? 'Does that inflame a greater independence demand in Wales, for example, and it has implications in every part of the UK. We would be weaker. Alex Salmond's hopes of winning the September 18 referendum hinge on convincing undecided voters to back independence. Among those certain to vote the 'no' campaign currently enjoys a 20 per cent lead . Sir John, now 71, also accused Alex Salmond of trying to capitalise on ‘anti-English sentiment’ and the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn ahead of September’s independence referendum. In his first key intervention in the debate over Scotland’s future, the former Prime Minister said he was ‘sad’ the 700th anniversary of Robert the Bruce’s famous victory over the English will be commemorated just months before voters go to the polls. The ex-Tory leader said English voices should be ‘heard with respect, and without the petulant name-calling that has been the response to some English interventions during this campaign so far’. Sir John added: 'We were at war centuries ago, which – if I may be brutally frank – I find it rather sad that the SNP chose the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn for the vote, presumably to maximise the opportunity for any anti-English sentiment that may exist.' The Bannockburn commemorations take place next week, around 80 days before Scots go to the polls. Sir John claimed Scotland would go from having ‘real influence’ as part of the United Kingdom to ‘irrelevance’ as a small nation if people vote ‘Yes’ on September 18. He accused Alex Salmond of trying to capitalise on ‘anti-English sentiment’, and called on him to crack down on Nationalist ‘trolls’ abusing people on Twitter for supporting the Union. As Prime Minister Sir John blocked demands in Scotland for devolution over fears it would be used as a 'stepping stone' to independence. Ironically the SNP leader Alex Salmond (sat with Sir John at Wimbledon last year) was also against devolution - because he believed it would stop voters pushing for independence . Sir John, also rubbished Mr Salmond’s claims that an independent Scotland could join the European Union, calling it ‘fatuous’ and said it could require years of painstaking negotiations and concessions. After Harry Potter author JK Rowling was subjected to vile online abuse for giving money to the Better Together campaign: Sir John said: ‘If Alex Salmond cannot control these people, and perhaps he can’t, then he can at least disown them. And he should.’ Last night, SNP MSP Stewart Maxwell said: ‘John Major is just about the last person the No campaign will have wanted to see entering the debate here, given his track record in ensuring a Tory wipe-out in Scotland in 1997.’","Major says independence referendum more important than general election .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An eight-year-old boy whose parents launched a successful social media campaign to get him access to experimental new medicine is doing so well he didn't need dialysis Monday, and hopefully won't need it again on Wednesday. Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, Virginia, who was battling cancer and an accompanying infection, is now part of a new clinical trial for the drug brincidofovir, which is being developed by Chimerix Inc. And since his first dose on March 12, his deadly adenovirus has all but disappeared from his system. He was able to leave St. Jude Children's Hospital in Tennessee on April 10, and continue treatment as an outpatient. Good news: Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, Virginia, who was battling cancer and an accompanying infection, is ditching the dialysis after a few months on the drug brincidofovir, which is being developed by Chimerix Inc. Now he's ditched the dialysis - a big step that means Josh's kidney function is returning and the organs are clearing and filtering as they should. Since he's been out of the hospital, his health has improved in other ways too, his mom told Fredericksburg.com. Aimee Hardy said he no longer has tubes in his nose and can eat and drink on his own, with his favorite meal being Chick-fil-A. His family said they're now working on building up his strength with physical therapy that will get him walking and running. 'We practice walking,' Mrs Hardy told the news website. 'We trick him into doing leg lifts by kicking a ball.' The gravely ill little boy was given the experimental drug after his parents made their high-profile plea to the boss of Chimerix. Josh was fighting for his life in March after contracting the infection that caused internal bleeding and heart and kidney failure. But his family said the virus was barely detectable after just four doses of Brincidofovir. Feeling better: Josh, pictured before contracting the deadly virus, was discharged from hospital in April . New drug: Josh's family posted this picture of him getting his first dose of the experimental drug . Sick: Earlier this year, the then-7-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside . His mother Aimee, who campaigned the drug company, told ABC 11 earlier this year: 'We have gone from dire circumstances to discussing with our doctors what we need to do to get Josh discharged from the hospital. 'We are so grateful that the company was able to find a way for Josh to receive the medicine.' Josh was moved from ICU to a regular room at St Jude Children's Hospital, in Memphis, before he was later discharged. Earlier this year, the then-7-year-old could barely speak and was vomiting blood, while his family kept a desperate vigil at his bedside. Josh's body, weakened by chemotherapy after he had cancer for the fourth time, was struggling to fight of the adenovirus. The only available drugs were not working and Chimerix had refused to give the family access to the experimental medication Brincidofovir. Happier times: Josh was fighting for his life in March after contracting a virus that was causing internal bleeding and heart and kidney failure . But, after his family launched the #savejosh campaign, Chimerix relented. The company, in return, has been allowed to use data from Josh to help its FDA application, which could bring the drug on the market earlier. Chimerix chief Kenneth Moch announced on Tuesday, March 11, that his firm would begin a pilot trial for the drug immediately - with Josh as the programme's first patient. Moch had faced huge criticism for denying Josh Brincidofovir to fight off an infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant. Agreed: Chimerix chief executive Kevin Moch agreed to make the drug available after a campaign . In a statement, Moch said that after much careful consideration Chimerix would offer Josh the medicine. 'This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone,' Moch said according to Fox News. 'Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. 'It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of Brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.' Josh's physical condition improved almost immediately, although at the time his mother said he appeared to have lost his motivation after months of ill health. She told CNN his once-positive attitude appeared to have gone and he appeared exhausted. 'I haven't seen him smile lately,' she said back then. Josh suffered severe kidney damage after being given other drugs to try to halt the virus. This saw his require dialysis three times a week and had doctors fearing he'd need it for the rest of his life - something that haunted Mrs Hardy. 'If he could have gotten the Brincidofovir earlier, it could have been avoided. That will always bother me,' she said earlier. Her wishes may have now come true. The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior 'compassionate use' allowance. Previously Moch said that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients. However, the company received $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir. Battler: Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant . Before she was able to secure the drug for her son, Mrs Hardy said the situation was devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live. 'There's no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There's nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We're begging them to give it to us.' Josh's doctors also contacted Chimerix requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug. 'We have gone from dire circumstances . to discussing with our doctors what we need to do to get Josh discharged . from the hospital. We are so grateful that the company was able to find a way for Josh to receive the medicine' - Josh Hardy's mother Aimee . Josh was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times. He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments. In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems. 'Normally, Josh's immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Mrs Hardy wrote on her son's CaringBridge page. 'The challenge is his immune system can't be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.' Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, Fox and Friends has reported.","Josh Hardy from Fredericksburg, Virginia, was battling cancer and an accompanying infection .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A Connecticut prosecutor is dropping a disorderly conduct case against Paul Simon and his wife Edie Brickell two months after the couple fought in their home. Simon, 72, and Brickell, 48, had been scheduled to be in court on Tuesday but they did not appear and prosecutors told Judge William Wenzel they were declining to pursue the case. It means that the charges have now been dropped and will be eventually erased after 13 months. 'The prosecution will not proceed with the charges and it will be (discontinued) sometime later today by the judge,' Deputy Court Clerk Emmy Kalmanidis said. No charges: Paul Simon and his wife Edie Brickell, pictured in court in April, will not face disorderly conduct charges following a dispute in their home earlier this year. Prosecutors are no longer pursuing the case . Police say the couple fought during an . April 26 argument inside a cottage on their property in New Canaan. During the argument, Simon had attempted to leave the cottage but Brickell blocked the door and the incident escalated into a shoving . match, their attorney said. Brickell told police Simon shoved her and she slapped him. The . police report says Simon suffered a superficial cut to his ear and . Brickell, who smelled of alcohol, had a bruise on her wrist. But afterwards, the couple played down the fight. Scene: The couple got into the shoving match at their home, pictured, in New Canaan, Connecticut . Musical couple: Paul Simon and his wife Edie Brickell, who are both Grammy Award winners, married in 1992 . 'I got my feelings hurt and I picked a fight with my husband,' Brickell said in a statement. 'The police called it disorderly. Thank God it's orderly now.' The couple's lawyer also told MailOnline that the fight involved only 'a slight push' and said Brickell had told him that it was only the fourth fight the couple have had in their 22-year marriage. On May 16, the couple, who married in 1992 and have three children together, told the judge that the fight was atypical of their relationship and that they posed no threat to one another. Simon was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003 for his work as part of the duo Simon and Garfunkel, which produced hits including 'The Sound of Silence,' and is a member of The Songwriters Hall of Fame. Brickell, best known for the 1988 hit 'What I Am,' released by Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, won a Grammy this year with comedian Steve Martin for their bluegrass song 'Love Has Come for You.'","Prosecutors in Connecticut are declining to pursue the disorderly conduct case against the couple and the charges have now been dropped .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Sarah Dean . Nigella Lawson has received an apology letter from New Zealand immigration officials after they mistakenly thought she had been barred from the US because of her self-confessed drug use. The celebrity chef, who last year admitted to previously taking cocaine and cannabis, flew to New Zealand on May 3 for a promotional tour for Whittaker's chocolate. Before the 54-year-old arrived at Auckland Airport she was initially granted a 'special direction' visa to work in NZ. But officials have now admitted the waiver, which was issued in April, was not needed as there was no evidence she had been banned from entering the US. Scroll down for video . 'We're sorry': Nigella Lawson flew to Auckland airport in New Zealand, in May, on a visa waiver . In a letter, obtained by the MailOnline, Immigration New Zealand area manager Michael Carley said: 'We regret any inconvenience caused to your client and I hope this letter clarifies that your client is not considered to be an excluded person by Immigration New Zealand.' He explained that Immigration New Zealand previously believed Nigella's immigration status was 'inconclusive' so they had granted a 'special direction' visa to speed things along. A spokeswoman for Immigration New Zealand said the department ‘was aware of issues reported in the media about [Lawson’s] inability to travel to the United States’ when they were assessing her visa application. Nigella has no drug convictions so she is not legally barred from any country. Nigella Lawson's lawyer in New Zealand Megan Richards told MailOnline: 'The only comment we want to make was everyone was very happy with the outcome and how everything turned out.' Successful: Nigella Lawson had no problem with customs at Auckland Airport on May 3 . Apology: Immigration New Zealand area manager Michael Carley said: 'We regret any inconvenience caused' When asked how Nigella came to be considered an excluded person in the first place, Ms Richards said: 'I guess there were various media reports and I guess there was speculation about what may or may not have occurred. 'They've cleared up the position with their statement to us so that shouldn't be in doubt anymore. 'They looked at all the information they had and decided that perhaps that wasn't the case which they may have thought it was initially.' In the US, officials ask people who apply for a visa if they have ever been arrested or convicted in relation to illegal drugs. They can then decide to prevent entry to the country even if the person involved was never charged. However, Nigella was never arrested, and British police said in January that she would not face any police action over her admission of drug-taking, in part out of fears that charging her would deter other court witnesses from telling the truth. Reports that she had been banned from the US came after she tried to catch a British Airways flight to Los Angeles on April 2 but appeared to be turned away by officials.","British chef has received a letter from New Zealand immigration officials .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Locked up: Maksym Shynkarenko, pictured in 2004, traded tens of thousands of explicit images . A Ukrainian man who authorities said could be the most significant distributor of child pornography ever prosecuted in the U.S. has been sentenced to 30 years in prison. Maksym Shynkarenko, who was arrested in Thailand five years ago and extradited to the U.S. two year ago, secured a plea deal in Newark, New Jersey in January for running a network of websites that catered to pedophiles around the world. The 35-year-old will likely be deported when he is released from prison. 'You have pleaded guilty to one of the most serious crimes imaginable in our culture as human beings,' U.S. District Judge William Walls told him on Tuesday. 'I can't think of anything more horrific.' Shynkarenko, who wasn't involved in the production of child pornography but traded tens of thousands of hardcore images and videos, spoke briefly in court on Tuesday. 'I want to just say I regret my crime, and I am grateful for the chance to change my life,' he said. Shynkarenko traded pictures and footage that depicted children ranging from infants and toddlers to teenagers being graphically sexually assaulted or abused, his indictment showed in 2012. He and his associates advertised the websites with names such as 'Illegal.CP,' 'The Sick Child Room' and 'Hottest Childporn Garden'. The U.S. attorney's office said the investigation into a website that Shynkarenko operated between 2005 and 2008 has led to the criminal convictions of more than 600 U.S. residents across 47 states. The investigation was initiated after . agents from the Newark division of U.S. Immigration and Customs .

'Shynkarenko worked the supply side of a market that sells images of the most depraved, predatory abuse of children,' U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said. Walls said he wouldn't oppose a request by defense attorney Nicholas Wooldridge to have the three-and-a-half years Shynkarenko was jailed in Thailand deducted from his 30-year sentence. But the judge rejected Wooldridge's argument that Shynkarenko deserved a greater reduction because of the deplorable conditions of Thai jails. Wooldridge characterized Shynkarenko as a 'smart guy' who earned a degree from a technical college in Ukraine and who used his knowledge of computers to run the network of websites described in the indictment. He said Shynkarenko wasn't involved in the production of child pornography.","Maksym Shynkarenko, 35, was caught in Thailand five years ago, extradited to the U.S. two years ago and in January he secured a plea deal .

"By . Associated Press . Militants linked to Al Qaeda have been captured by Philippine security forces, one of whom was allegedly involved in the kidnappings of an American teenager and Australian ex-soldier. Police and army troops captured Jimmy Nurilla and Bakrin Haris on Monday in a raid on their hideout in Sangali village in the southern port city of Zamboanga in a volatile region where the Abu Sayyaf group has carried out kidnappings for ransom, bombings, extortion and other acts of banditry. One other militant escaped during the raid, police said. Kevin Lunsmann, the kidnapped teenage boy, talks to Filipino soldiers inside the Philippine military compound in Zamboanga, following his escape in 2011 . The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission said without elaborating that the militants were in possession of explosives and rebel documents when arrested. Nurilla was believed to be involved in a number of kidnappings, including of Kevin Lunsmann, an American who was 14 when he escaped from his captors in 2011 after five months in captivity on Basilan island, near Zamboanga. The militant also has been suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of Warren Rodwell, a former Australian soldier who was freed near the southern Pagadian city in March last year after 15 months of jungle captivity, according to the commission. Ransom kidnappings have long been a problem in the southern Philippines and have been blamed mostly on the Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaeda-linked group on a list of U.S. terrorist organizations, and its allied armed groups. The Abu Sayyaf, which currently has about 300 armed fighters, was organized in the early 1990s in Basilan, about 550 miles south of Manila. With an unwieldy collective of preachers and outlaws, it vowed to wage jihad, or holy war, but lost its key leaders early in combat, sending it on a violent path of extremism and criminality. Australian hostage Warren Rodwell, arrives at Philippines Western Mindanao Command, in Zamboanga following his release by militants in March 2013 . Kevin and his mother Gerfa, from Lynchburg, Virginia, were taken hostage on their summer vacation by Abu Sayyaf. The pair were visiting Gerfa's native country and were due to return home the following day when they were kidnapped at gunpoint. They were held for more than two months in a 5ft by 6ft wooden cage when Gerfa was freed. Kevin then made his escape two-and-a-half months later. He managed to sneak past guards and fled to the coast overnight, where he came across farmers, who contacted the military. Mr Rodwell, a father-of-three, was abducted at gunpoint on December 5, 2011, from his home in Ipil by Abu Sayyaf. He spent 15 months in the jungle with his captors before he was eventually freed for a ransom.","American Kevin Lunsmann escaped from his captors in 2011 after being held for five months .

"By . Sam Webb . Unfair: Danny Cohen, the head of BBC TV, says viewers and critics are praising critically-acclaimed big budget U.S. series at the expense of home-grown dramas . A top BBC executive has blasted the perception that American TV shows are far superior to their UK counterparts and defended British drama as the best   in the world. Danny Cohen, the head of BBC TV, says viewers and critics who laud critically-acclaimed big budget U.S. series like Breaking Bad, The Wire and Mad Men   are unaware of what the average British viewer is actually watching. He says wildly successful British dramas such as ITV's Broadchurch, Downton Abbey and gritty police drama Happy Valley are proof that audiences prefer   home-grown content. 'A trope has developed, a cultural meme that asserts that American drama is far superior to drama produced in the UK and at the BBC,' he said. 'It's an argument driven by box-set consumers who have a louder voice in Britain's cultural dialogue than the average family who sit down at night in   Britain's towns and villages to decide which drama they want to watch.' Over the last 15 years, and arguably starting with HBO's mafia epic The Sopranos, American broadcasters such as HBO and AMC have attracted praise for   producing sophisticated, intelligent and big-budget drama series. The fact that prohibition-era crime drama Boardwalk Empire's pilot episode was directed by Martin Scorsese and cost £11m to produce indicates the   importance TV executives place on their programming. Other countries have followed suit, as evidenced by the success of Denmark's The Killing. But . with viewing figures of more than 10million per episode for domestic . hits like Sherlock and Downton Abbey - and the enormous success of these . shows   throughout the world - he says Brits should be crowing about . their success on the smaller screen. Mr . Cohen, who earns £327,800 a year, wrote in his blog: 'In Britain, we are . not very good at celebrating our success. We somehow find it . embarrassing.' Police dramas: Broadchurch, which will soon be re-made in an American setting, drew more than 10million viewers for the finale. Criminal drama The Killing generated column inches but just under 600,000 viewers . Fantasy: The series 4 debut episode of Game Of Thrones on Sky Atlantic attracted 1.2m viewers. As well as viewing figures regularly topping 10million, Dr Who has also been sold around the world . Although . it is difficult to get an accurate idea of viewing figures because of . the changing ways viewers watch content, such as on-demand services like . BBC   iPlayer and 4OD, as well as paid subscription services like . Netflix and Amazon Prime, the figures appear to back up his views. Episodes . of ITV's Broadchurch - which, interestingly, is soon to be re-made for . American audiences - drew in more than 10million viewers. The Killing,   which TV reviewers dedicated many column inches to praising, peaked at 599,000. Dr . Kerry Gough is senior lecturer in media theory at Birmingham City . University and says the popularity of American TV shows partially stems . from the frustration of following a series week after week, which has . led to the 'Box Set Britain' mentality. With the vast array of articles written about it, you'd think everyone in the UK was glued to Mad Men every week. But on BBC 4 it had 355,000 viewers . Downton Abbey is incredibly popular in the U.S. Some viewers even hold viewing parties . HBO gangster epic The Sopranos has been hailed as the start of the renaissance of American TV drama . She added: 'American dramas have big budgets and special effects and is almost becoming the new film. British dramas go back to the roots, with relationships and the gravity of what is happening. 'They have more depth to the characters and are more engaging. But some shows like Game Of Thrones do both and it's a very savvy move by U.S. drama.' Critical U.S. darling Mad Men attracted 355,000 viewers at one point, whereas ITV's Downton Abbey regularly enjoys more than 11million viewers. Fantasy epic Game of Thrones is among the most successful U.S. imports and drew in 1.2million viewers on paid-for channel Sky Atlantic for   the season 4 debut. However, some episodes of the BBC's global smash Doctor Who enjoy nearly ten times as many. The third series of Ripper Street is being made by online giant Amazon after the BBC axed the Victorian crime drama. The show, set in London's Whitechapel in 1889 - six months after the gruesome Jack The Ripper Murders, was axed by the BBC at the end of last year due to poor viewing figures. There were also some issues with sound -  with dozens of viewers complaining to the BBC about  'meaningless mumbling' throughout the second series. But thankfully for fans, it was saved by online retailer Amazon - who have funded the third series along with production company Tiger Aspect. It will be aired on Amazon Prime Instant Video - formerly LOVEFiLM - in the autumn before being shown on BBC One a few months later.","Head of BBC TV Danny Cohen says too much attention is paid to U.S. dramas like Mad Men, The Wire and Breaking Bad .

"By . Graham Grant . A former soldier was yesterday found guilty of murdering a schoolgirl nearly 30 years ago in Scotland’s first ‘cold case’ conviction. Bus driver John Docherty strangled Elaine Doyle yards from her home as she returned from a disco in 1986, and lived a normal life until police reinvestigating the crime knocked on his door two years ago. Technological advances meant DNA recovered from the 16-year-old’s body was linked to Docherty, who still lived in Greenock, Renfrewshire, less than a mile from the lane where the murder happened. Bus driver John Docherty (left) strangled Elaine Doyle (right) yards from her home as she returned from a disco . The father of one agreed to a mouth swab test after the visit from officers working on the cold case inquiry. It was later found the chances of the DNA belonging to anyone other than Docherty, 49, were around one billion to one. As he was found guilty after a marathon trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, Elaine’s mother Maureen spoke of her family’s 28-year ‘nightmare’. Thanking Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, QC, and police who brought Docherty to justice, Mrs Doyle, 72, of Gourock, Renfrewshire, paid tribute to the ‘people of Inverclyde who have lived this nightmare with us for 28 years and always supported our family’. Carefree: Elaine's half naked body was found in a lane just yards from the safety of her own home . Mrs Doyle, a widow, added: ‘The result at court doesn’t make our day-to-day living any easier. 'The pain doesn’t go away but my son John and I take comfort that we now have justice for Elaine, which is all we, especially her dad Jack, campaigned for.’ Docherty, now of Dunoon, Argyll, was found guilty of strangling the teenager after a struggle that tore a clump of hair from her head. He stripped the terrified girl, or forced her to take off her clothes, in a lane yards from her home in Ardgowan Street, Greenock, on June 2, 1986. Docherty slipped through the net when detectives apparently simply forgot to question him. But years later DNA evidence – unknown in crime scene investigations at the time of Elaine’s death – was found on samples taken from her naked body. Forensic scientist Pauline McSorley said the odds against it belonging to anyone but Docherty were a billion to one, while pathologist Marjorie Turner said evidence pointed to the assailant strangling Elaine from behind. Historic case: Police officers stand at the scene of the murder in Greenock where Elaine Doyle died . The majority verdict, after more than four hours, rejected Docherty’s claim that he was at home with his parents in the town’s Anne Street. The eight women and seven men had heard 52 days of evidence, and hours were spent dealing with the unprecedented defence claim that a list of 41 ‘suspects’ might include the real killer. Besides Elaine, who had a part-time job as a jeweller’s assistant, and her friends at the Celtic Club disco, was Docherty. He was with John Faller, who told police Docherty had been with him. Police failed to go straight to Docherty to confirm the story. As forensic scientists refined techniques for extracting DNA from crime scene samples, they returned to the tape pressed against Elaine’s body in the hope of trapping tell-tale fibres. Docherty has been remanded in custody to await sentencing in Glasgow in August . Finally, in March 2006, persistence paid off but the microscopic result did not match any likely suspects whose DNA was held on any UK database. Operation Evergreen was launched and police sought DNA samples from all the men in the investigation files. By May 2012, they had traced Docherty, an ex-Royal Engineer who had returned to Greenock. He  willingly took the mouth swab test that gave police their breakthrough. Another vital link in the chain came when a key witness, Martin Brown, looked at photos taken to his London home. Mr Brown, now 52, had described a man with staring, angry eyes he had seen with a girl near Ardgowan Street at around the time Elaine might have been there. He told detectives in September 2012 a photo, culled from Docherty’s Army ID card, reminded him of the fleeting encounter 26 years earlier. Docherty did not give evidence but his defence team attacked the police investigation. Even senior officers leading the murder hunt admitted in court there were shortcomings. The so-called mistakes began with an act of compassion when a police blanket was draped over Elaine to shield her body from onlookers. Defence QC Donald Findlay claimed the scene had been so contaminated the DNA evidence was not reliable. Judge Lord Stewart told jurors although they had heard criticism of the early investigation, ‘extraordinary persistence, skill and determination’ had brought the case to court. He told Docherty the only sentence for murder was life but called for a background report. Docherty was remanded in custody to await sentencing in Glasgow in August. As he left court, Elaine’s brother John Doyle, 49, said: ‘The jury returned the right decision. I always knew John Docherty was guilty.’ Detective Superintendent Bobby Hendren of Police Scotland said the ‘senseless murder of Elaine has cast a long shadow over Greenock’. The conviction is a major success for a specialist unit set up by the Crown Office in June 2011 to help crack ‘cold cases’. Describing the work of the new unit, Mr Mulholland said 93 unsolved murders dating back to 1974 would come under scrutiny. The Elaine Doyle murder was the first case to go to trial following an investigation by the new Crown Office cold case unit. It was launched in 2011, with law chief Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, QC, vowing to snare killers who had evaded justice for years. He said the specialist team would use new forensic science techniques – including those related to DNA, ballistics and fingerprint databases – to determine which cases merited fresh investigation. He said: ‘We won’t give up and will seek to identify perpetrators using new forensic and other investigation techniques and prosecute them.’ About 70 murders, going back more than 100 years, remain unsolved. High-profile cases include that of banker Alistair  Wilson, 30, shot dead on the doorstep of his home in Nairn in 2004. Earlier this year, the Crown Office said convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore – long linked to the disappearance of Moira Anderson, 11, in 1957 – would be prosecuted if he were alive today. Following a review by the cold case unit, investigators declared he would have been charged over the death of the youngster, who went missing near her home in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire.","Bus driver John Docherty strangled Elaine Doyle yards from her home .

"The BBC’s comedy chief used £120 of public money to buy cupcakes for his staff, it emerged today. Shane Allen, who is paid a salary of £207,000, claimed the money back for 48 cakes last year. He also claimed expenses for taxis after watching comedy shows, hosting leaving drinks and buying comedy DVDs. The BBC insisted that the 48 cupcakes claimed for by comedy boss Shane Allen were for a programme production team (file picture) As the BBC's head of comedy Shane Allen is responsible for finding new talent and keep stars happy . The details of the spending emerged as the BBC released a slew of expense claims by executives. The revelations come as the Corporation faces fresh questions about its spending, amid warnings the licence fee could be scrapped altogether. Mr Allen claimed for 24 cupcakes on October 22 last year and another 24 on November 8. The BBC insistsed the cakes were a gift for a programme production team. The release also showed that he claimed £157.55 for a dinner linked to the sitcom Outnumbered, several taxis to take him to comedy gigs and £10 for a DVD - Pat Shortt 'One hell of a do Live'. The taxis included £7 to take him from the set of the Mrs Brown movie to a nearby tube station. He also claimed £211.85 for a leaving party for an unnamed member of staff attended by 15 people. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: 'There's nothing funny about blowing taxpayers' cash on cupcakes, so perhaps the Head of Comedy might be in the wrong job. 'Combined with exorbitant taxis and speaking course junkets, the general impression licence fee payers will get from these expense claims is of a culture of waste at the BBC. 'Unless there is more accountability for the way licence fee revenues are used, sympathy for this outdated tax will continue to wane.' The BBC’s head of television Danny Cohen and director of strategy James Purnell both registered tickets to a 'one-day Executive Public Speaking Course' called 'Own The Room' as gifts. Purnell, a Cabinet minister in the last Labour government, also claimed £324 for 'Attending the Labour Conference' and spent £275 registering for the Conservative Party conference. Mr Allen claimed £7 for a taxi to take him from the set of the Mrs Brown movie to a nearby tube station while £157.55 was spent on a dinner for the sitcom Outnumbered . There were further treats for staff from the controller of BBC Radio 3 Roger Wright who claimed £900 - equivalent to more than six licence fees - for a thank you lunch for the team of 36 people who had worked on the BBC Proms season. Wright, who is director of the Proms and is paid a salary of £219,650, also claimed taxi fares which amounted to £924 on taxis in a 36-day period last summer. With his previously published quarterly expenses, it brings his total taxi claim for last year's Proms season to £1,386. The newly released figures show the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob claimed £486.96 on taxis during the quarter. The £168,300-a-year executive - who earns further income for his presenting duties - also claimed for a £1,502.53 return flight to New York in November and £644 for a four-night spell in the boutique hotel, Sixty LES. The BBC said he was there to meet producers and also for filming commitments. The BBC's director of news James Harding - who is paid a salary of £340,000 - was reimbursed for flights to Delhi, Zurich and New York - which totalled £2,409.61. The BBC's former HR director Lucy Adams claimed £321 for 'dinner as part of HR director awayday'. Ms Adams, who left the corporation in March, was roundly criticised for overseeing the department while large payouts were controversially given to outgoing staff. In another claim, the BBC's director of workplace and safety, Paul Greeves, claimed £475 for 'thank you drinks' for 19 members of a 'successful procurement team'. Taxi claims for senior BBC executives for the three-month period have risen by 21.4 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter, to stand at £26,023. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'We have strict rules on when taxis are allowed, for example when public transport does not serve the destination or late night travel is required, and we have cut our taxi spend by 33% since the same period in 2009/10.'","Expense claims reveal spending by head of comedy Shane Allen .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A man in China blocked a road and started to collect tolls from motorists after his mother's pet dog was run over and killed. Police say the man wanted to recoup the 2,000 renminbi (£188) it would cost him to replace her the animal in Nanjing City in Jiangsu. Su Cheng said the dog had ‘brought great happiness’ to his mother who is in her 70s. On Saturday, the dog was run over and killed by a passing truck. Su Chenge's mother's dog lays by the side of the road in Nanjing City in Jiangsu, China, where it was hit and killed by a careless lorry driver . Su’s mother Gao was walking the dog when it was hit and was also nearly knocked by the lorry when she tried to stop it after the accident. The driver however had not only carried on without stopping, he had even sped up. ‘Su and his mother were quite angry, but they couldn’t find the guilty trucker,’ said a police spokesman. ‘To vent out their anger, Su and another two family members blocked the road to charge toll fees to passing trucks.’ Gao's dog lays dead  in Nanjing City, Jiangsu , Chinas after being hit by a lorry driver who not only did not stop but also sped uip after the collision . For each truck, Su charged 10RMB (94p) and he wrote down the plate number of the lorries in a notebook to know which ones had been charged. ‘According to Su, he would not stop until he collected the full 2,000 RMB from the passing by vehicles,’ added the police spokesman. ‘The truckers were annoyed and reported the case to the police.’ Police forced the bereaved Cheng to repay the lorry drivers and said he was not within his rights to penalise all lorry drivers for the actions of one. Cheng said: ‘I only wanted enough money to be able to buy my mum a new dog. She is a lovely old lady and needs companionship.’ No rip-off merchant: Su Cheng kept a list of the registation numbers of all the lorries he 'fined' so that no one got penalised twice .

"A 39-stone man has left his flat for the first time in three years after firefighters carried him out on a bed sheet. Hang Hang, 20, was unable to leave his flat in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, because of his size. The man, who lives on a diet of sugary foods such as pancakes, left the building for the first time in three years today - thanks to the help of Chinese firefighters. Heavy load: Nine firefighters came to the assistance of Hang Hang, 20, today - lifting the 39 stone man out of his apartment on a bed sheet, pictured. He hadn't left the building in three years because of his size . Easy does it: The firefighters struggle to lift the man - who was 23 stone by the age of 17 - down the stairs of his apartment. His mother says he will eat a stack of pancakes, a big bowl of porridge and vegetables in one sitting . In order to get him outside, Hang was carried on a thick bed sheet down the stairs by 9 firefighters. Following the success of the tricky maneuver, the man sat outside on a specially reinforced bed enjoying fresh air for the first time in 36 months. The 'rescue' was organised by a local newspaper - who campaigned for people to help him leave the house so he could enjoy some fresh air. Hang's mother told Chinese media her son had always struggles with his weight and tipped the scales at 23 stone by the ages of 17. However, after moving in with his mother three years ago, his weight ballooned and he went from 23 stone to 39 stone - leaving him trapped inside the flat. She told reporters: 'For one meal, he at least eats 10 pancakes, one large bowel of porridge, and vegetables.' Outside: Hang Hang is propped up by the men once they managed to get him out of the building.

Uribe had 'slimmed down' to about 61 stones after he was awarded the title of world's fattest human by the Guinness World Record's in 2006. When he died, his body - lying on the same bed - was taken to the Serorrey funeral home in Monterry, Mexico aboard a flat-bed truck. Funeral home director Pedro Reyes said Serorrey's cremation facility was the only one in the northern city of Monterrey able to handle Uribe's body.","Hang Hang, 20, ballooned to 39 stone and so couldn't leave his flat .

Mark Carney’s move from Canada to  London cost the Bank of England nearly £200,000 – making him Britain’s first  £1million Governor. The cost of relocating the former Goldman Sachs banker and his family – including flights, temporary accommodation, and shipping costs – was £102,816. The Bank also forked out £95,846 in tax related to the cost of the move, taking the total to £198,662, according to the central bank’s annual report published yesterday. Superstar: The Bank of England has spent £1 million employing its new governor Mark Carney, according to figures released days after he attacked the City for giving extortionate bonuses to 'superstars' Hand-picked: Mr Carney (right with George Osborne and the Lord Mayor of the City of London Fiona Woolf) was hand-picked by the Chancellor after guiding Canada's economy to stability following the crash . Mr Carney’s relocation package – on . top of annual earnings of £874,000 including a £250,000 housing . allowance – takes the total for his first year in charge to more than . £1million. It far outstrips the £309,297 his predecessor Lord King . earned. Revelations about Mr Carney’s package . come weeks after he warned that huge rewards for ‘superstar’ bankers are . causing inequality around the world. It comes weeks after Mr Carney turned his fire on City greed and the problem of growing inequality. He said globalisation had resulted in huge earnings which were 'amplifying the rewards of the superstar'. And in January, the Bank of England said it was planning to cut up to 100 jobs following a 'value for money' review. Mark Carney receives a basic salary of £480,000 - up from Mervyn King's £300,000. The Canadian then receives £250,000 accommodation allowance. With a 30 per cent pension contribution, the total reaches £870,000. And flying the 48-year-old over with his wife and children cost Britain £100,000 plus another £100,000 in tax. Mr Carney was hand-picked for the role by George Osborne after helping the Canadian economy recover faster from the downturn than any other developed major nation. He beat some of Britain's leading executives to the job despite insisting he will only serve five years - rather than eight, to reduce disruption to his children. It was his track record that prompted Mr Osborne to overlook favourites including Bank veteran Paul Tucker and Adair Turner, the former chairman of the City watchdog. Figures show Mr Osborne's decision cost the Bank £102,816 to relocating the superstar banker and his family to London, while also paying a tax liability of £95,846. The report today said: 'It is the Bank’s policy to relocate those appointed to senior positions as necessary, and to incur the costs of doing so. 'In line with this policy, the Bank relocated Mr Carney and his family from Ottawa to London. Procurement decisions in that process were taken by the Bank.' The Bank said it decided Mr Carney's salary through a remuneration committee, which takes account of salaries available elsewhere and how this 'might affect the availability of good candidates'. Its accommodation allowance for Mr Carney reflects 'the additional cost of living in London rather than in Ottawa'. Pedestrians walk past the Bank of England in the City of London. In January, the Bank of England said it was planning to cut up to 100 jobs following a 'value for money' review .

However, unlike Mr Carney he was eligible for the Bank’s old Court pension scheme, where benefits were 'significantly higher', a spokeswoman said. Mr Carney’s total remuneration for the eight months he was in charge for 2013/14 was £586,010. The report also disclosed for the first time that the governor has chosen to enrol in the Bank’s pension scheme rather than take a payment in lieu of this benefit. Beneath the highest echelons of the bank, it employs 632 staff on £80,000 or more, including 330 on £100,000 or more and four on £200,000 or more.","48-year-old paid £480,000 plus £250,000 housing allowance and pension .

"By . Becky Barrow . Struggle: It is the first time since 2006 that prices have decreased year-on-year (file photo) Family food bills fell last month for the first time in eight years, figures revealed yesterday. The Office for National Statistics said grocery prices were 0.6 per cent lower in May than they were 12 months before, as inflation fell to its lowest level in nearly five years. The first annual drop in food bills since March 2006 shows that the supermarket price wars are starting to cut costs at the checkout. Analysts said the figures will ease the pressure on the Bank of England to push up interest rates. The ONS said the Consumer Price Index measure of inflation dropped sharply, with prices of all consumer goods rising by just 1.5 per cent in the 12 months to May. This is the lowest inflation level since October 2009 – well below the Government’s target of 2 per cent. The Prime Minister said the drop in inflation, down from 1.8 per cent in April, means ‘more stability and financial security for everyone’.Falling food costs were driven by a variety of product categories, particularly bread, cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks, said the ONS. Tesco, Morrisons and the Co-op have slashed prices in a bid to lure back shoppers who have switched to cheaper discount stores. Morrisons has vowed to cut £1billion from the prices of more than 1,200 items over the next three years. But the ONS figures also showed that the squeeze on families remains acute, after six years of below-inflation pay rises. The ONS said falling food prices were . being driven by ‘a variety of product categories’, particularly bread, . cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks. The average worker currently receives an annual pay rise of 0.7 per cent, less than half the current level of CPI inflation. While food prices fell last month, they have risen by more than 70 per cent over the past eight years, nearly four times faster than salaries have increased. Slashed: Morrisons, Tesco and the Co-Op are locked in a fierce price war to prevent the rise of discount brands . Figures show food and soft drinks prices rose by 71 per cent between April 2006 and April this year. By comparison, salaries, including bonuses, rose by just 18 per cent over the same period. Debt charity StepChange estimates that around seven million people are so vulnerable that a 25 per cent fall in income would see them exhaust their savings in a week. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘It continues to look likely that CPI inflation will ease further, perhaps to as low as 1 per cent by the end of the year. ‘Against this low inflation backdrop, we believe the Bank of England is likely to tread cautiously and raise interest rates only very gradually over the coming years.’ The Bank of England has kept the base rate frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 but the governor, Mark Carney, said the first increase for seven years might come sooner than expected. The increases will be ‘gradual and limited’, he said in a bid to stop families from panicking about a rapid rise in rates.","Office for National Statistics said groceries were 0.6% cheaper in May .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A health and safety inspector has revealed he raised concerns about the Hillsborough stadium 12 months before the disaster but was told by his superiors to 'keep his nose out'. Paul Jackson, who worked for Sheffield City Council’s Environmental Protection Unit, claims he had been made aware of concerns over the crush barriers, their height and spacings a year before the tragedy which killed 96 Liverpool fans. But on April 15, 1989, one of the crash barriers gave way, crushing dozens to death in Sheffield Wednesday’s ground as Liverpool FC took on Nottingham Forest at the start of the FA Cup semi-final. 'Keep your nose out': A health and safety inspector has revealed he raised concerns about the barriers at Hillsborough in 1988 but he was told it was a 'politically sensitive' area . Today, Mr Jackson told an inquest he was ordered to turn a blind eye to the issues. He also claimed that a number of councillors were Sheffield Wednesday fans, making it 'politically sensitive'. 'I had been told there was problems with the barriers and I had been told not to get involved with it,' he told the Warrington hearing. He said before he went on a visit to the stadium in 1988, his line managers told him: 'Just don’t go into that area. Not to stick my nose in. 'That it was politically sensitive and that I should keep out of it. 'There had been previous concerns over them.' Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquests, asked if this caused him 'disquiet'. Mr Jackson said: 'It was sort of the approach on safety generally,' adding: 'In terms of things that happened at Sheffield City Council at the time, not terribly unusual.' The witness said he believed 'other parts' of the council would deal with the matter and it was an 'area looked after by somebody else.' He said he made his own visit to Hillsborough to look at the barriers. There he saw Dr Wilfred Eastwood, the club’s engineering adviser, a man of 'strong opinions' who 'knew his own mind'. Inquest: Mr Jackson was questioned by lawyers of the 96 victims of the tragedy as part of a hearing to uncover what happened in the run up to the disaster. Police and council workers will also give evidence . Mr Jackson added: 'I left it with the building surveyor and Dr Eastwood, who also made it clear he really did not want us there.' Ms Lambert continued: 'But you could have no confidence that they would act on these problems with the crash barriers?' Mr Jackson replied: 'I did not have any great confidence.' The jury heard Mr Jackson had made a statement to West Midlands Police in 1989 and he described a 'culture that contributed to the problem' concerning the council’s approach to safety. But when he gave the statement to police, Mr Jackson said he did not 'bring up' the matter of being told to 'keep his nose out' of the barriers problem at Hillsborough. Former council members have been questioned as well as representatives from Sheffield Wednesday FC and South Yorkshire Police. The hearing in Warrington continues.

"By . James Slack . Passport Office boss Paul Pugh offered a belated apology yesterday and admitted he had considered resigning over the shambles. Under hostile questioning from MPs, the chief executive – who is paid more £100,000-a-year – said he was 'sorry' for every case where service standards had not been met. But he denied presiding over an organisation in chaos - and insisted a backlog of around 480,000 cases was 'work in progress'. Apology: The head of the Passport Office, Paul Pugh gives evidence to Commons Home Affairs Committee at Portcullis House in London . Asked about images leaked by a whistle-blower, which showed boxes of passport applications piled up in Liverpool, Mr Pugh said the picture showed a 'well ordered, well controlled' holding area. He also defended the decision to launch a 'witch hunt' investigation to find the whistle-blower – saying anybody who had 'unauthorised contact with the media' must be identified. During a stormy session before Westminster's home affairs committee, Mr Pugh was repeatedly accused of putting holiday-makers summer holiday plans in jeopardy. Last week alone, 16,500 of the 165,000 passports that were issued were sent out late. Committee chairman Keith Vaz asked: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting? 'I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry. You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?' Grilling: During a stormy session before Westminster's home affairs committee, Mr Pugh was repeatedly accused of putting holiday-makers summer holiday plans in jeopardy . Mr Pugh replied: 'I absolutely . recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I . would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met . our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the . customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' 'Mr . Vaz, who revealed he had been forced to personally text the Home . Secretary to sort out the case of one constituent, asked: 'We can take . that as an apology?' 'Mr Pugh, who promised not to take a bonus next year, replied: 'It is an apology.' 'Labour MP Paul Flynn asked Mr Pugh if he had considered resigning, since that was what members of the public hit by the debacle would want.' 'He said he had considered quitting but it was his responsibility to lead the Passport Office through 'tough times. Mr Pugh denied a surge in citizenship approvals to migrants, who can then apply for their first passport, was to blame for the problem. 'He also insisted the decision to stop issuing passports from Britain's embassies overseas was not to blame. However, he admitted forecasts on the impact this decision would have had proved wrong. 'Officials had predicted an extra 350,000 cases would be dealt with in Britain. In fact, the figure was likely to be closer to 400,000. 'Mr Pugh could soon be facing a new crisis, MPs were told, as union leaders threaten to order a walkout at the Passport Office. Mike Jones, Home Office group secretary at the PCS Union, said senior officials wanted up to 600 new jobs and pay rises for their members. He said that, if managers do not open negotiations, the union could ballot for industrial action. Labour MP Ian Austin warned him this would cause severe inconvenience to 'hard-working families' who deserve a summer break. Mr Pugh said a strike would be 'extremely damaging to our customers and our public.' 'He denied claims by the PCS that a reduction of around 550 in the number of staff working in the Passport Office between 2010 and 2014 was to blame'In comments likely to infuriate the union, he said that, four years ago, some staff did not have enough work to do and would spend their days 'reading books'. Mr Jones said the Passport Office had 'lost control' of the backlog.' He said that at June this year the number of applications logged as work-in-progress stood at 493,289, up from 289,892 in March. This compares to 146,586 applications in June last year and 72,586 in March 2013.' 'MPs were frustrated that Mr Pugh had failed to deliver his own detailed figures to the committee.

"By . Daniel Martin . Simon Cowell might not be terribly flattered, but voters say that when they think of Ukip, they also think of him. A focus group said the party reminded them of the X Factor boss because it was so dependent on Nigel Farage’s celebrity. The research, which took place in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and Thurrock in Essex, was commissioned by Tory grandee Lord Ashcroft. Scroll down for video . The research, which took place in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and Thurrock in Essex, found that voters think of X Factor boss Simon Cowell (above) when they think of Ukip because of Nigel Farage's celebrity . When asked to come up with an image associated with Labour, the panel chose one of a man slouched on a sofa with a beer. One panel member said they chose the slob to represent Mr Miliband’s party because: ‘Labour encourage that kind of behaviour. They make it too easy for people not to work and earn their money.’ In a further headache for the Labour leader, when the focus groups were asked to choose words to describe the party, the top choices were ‘weak’, ‘confused’ and ‘dull’. Some chose a photo of a miner to represent the party, which Lord Ashcroft said could indicate they are seen as old-fashioned and in hock to the unions. The most popular photo to represent the Conservatives was a well-heeled family outside a country house, while one of the words chosen to describe them was ‘out-of-touch’. The Tories are also seen as ‘sensible’ and ‘aggressive’, while many panel members chose a photo of Big Ben to show they were too focused on London. Focus group said the party reminded them of Cowell because it was so dependent on Nigel Farage (above) As well as choosing a picture of Mr Cowell, the focus group chose a photo of a Union Jack to represent UKIP. The words chosen were ‘dangerous’ and ‘hope’. Lord Ashcroft said: ‘If a picture of a flag was a predictable choice to represent UKIP, a picture of Simon Cowell was surely not. ‘This symbolised the view that the party depended on the personality of its leader, who had become something of a celebrity – a status which he seemed rather to be enjoying. ‘Many gave Nigel Farage credit for having a refreshingly unstuffy approach and answering interviewers’ questions rather than avoiding them.’","Focus group said Ukip reminded them of X Factor boss and music mogul Simon Cowell because party was dependent on Nigel Farage's celebrity .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Militants in Iraq and Syria pose the gravest threat to Britain today, David Cameron has warned. The Prime Minister said the police service and spy agencies have been ordered to focus their efforts on the Islamic insurgents, particularly those returning to Britain. It comes after MailOnline revealed more British citizens have signed up to fight in Iraq and Syria than joined the Army Reserve last year. Ministers have been caught off-guard by the speed of the insurgency by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) sweeping through Iraq, with more evidence emerging of brutal executions. Several hundred Britons have travelled to the region to join militants in fighting, but just 170 extra reservists enlisted over the past year. Today Mr Cameron insisted the prospect of battle-hardened jihadists returning to the UK was a ‘real threat to our country’. Speaking at a joint press conference with Chinese premier Li Keqiang, Mr Cameron said: ‘No-one should be in any doubt that what we see in Syria and now in Iraq in terms of Isis is the most serious threat to Britain's security that there is today. ‘The number of foreign fighters in that area, the number of foreign fighters including those from the UK who could try to return to the UK this is a real threat to our country. ‘We will do absolutely everything we can to keep our people safe. 'That means stopping people from going, it means arresting people who are involved in plots, it means focusing our security, our policing, our intelligence effort on to that area of the world, on to those people.’ Britain is now looking to Iran for help in tackling the crisis in neighbouring Iraq. Foreign Secretary William Hague announced Britain is to reopen its embassy in Tehran for the first time since it was ransacked by an angry mob in 2011. 'There has never been any doubt in my mind that we should have an embassy in Tehran if the circumstances allowed,' Mr Hague told MPs. 'Iran is an important country in a volatile region, and maintaining embassies around the world, even under difficult conditions, is a central pillar of the UK's global diplomatic approach.' He stressed there were 'a range of practical issues' that had to be resolved before the base could start to operate again. 'Inevitably, the initial embassy presence will only able to offer a limited range of services at first. For the time being, Iranians will still need to apply in Abu Dhabi or Istanbul for visas for travel to the UK,' he added. Young jihadi: A child is pictured on an ISIS-supporting Twitter feed wearing a balaclava and holding a sign saying 'God is greatest' A senior envoy was appointed as Britain's non-resident charge d'affaires last year, as relations improved after perceived moderate Hassan Rouhani was elected president. There has also been substantial progress reducing tensions over Iran's nuclear ambitions. However Mr Cameron rejected the idea that the diplomatic rapprochement was connected to the crisis. 'Britain believes in and I believe in step by step building our relationship with Iran because we need to have proper dialogue with that country. 'We are having dialogue over the nuclear weapons issue and I think we should be having dialogue with it on issues of regional security,' the premier said. 'Obviously our relationship was at a low point after the appalling things that happened with respect to our embassy, but it is right step by step with a clear eye with a hard head, to rebuild that relationship. 'Now we would be doing that anyway irrespective of what is happening in Iraq, but I think what is happening in Iraq is certainly not a reason for not taking that step.' Charlie Cooper, an expert at the anti-extremist think tank, Quilliam Foundation, said the number of Brits signing up to fight in the Middle East would only grow. He said: 'People are going from Britain and the EU to fight for ISIS - the estimate is more than 500 and that number will probably rise. 'If you want to go and fight jihad, ISIS, which holds a particularly extreme view of Islam and wants to create an extreme Islamic utopia, is a very attractive group to fight for.'","Prime Minister warns of threat from Britons returning from fighting .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Judge Clifford Bellamy said the man's smoking habit was another example of him being unable to give up 'habit-forming behaviour', including . smoking cannabis and excessive drinking . A man was stopped from adopting his three-year-old grandson after a family court judge said he was concerned about his smoking habit. Judge Clifford Bellamy said several areas of concern had been raised about the man’s suitability for adopting, including drug use spanning three decades and smoking. The judge said the grandfather's smoking was 'significant' in the context of 'his ability to give up habit-forming behaviour'. This included a 30-year cannabis habit and worries over excessive drinking - as well as being unable to quit smoking, even with professional help. There were also concerns raised over domestic violence and problems with anxiety and depression. Judge Bellamy, who said no-one in the case could be identified, concluded that the little boy should be placed for adoption. In a written ruling, released after the family court hearing in Leicester,  Judge Bellamy said Leicestershire County Council had asked him to make an order allowing the young boy to be placed for adoption. The council, which was named in the ruling, had responsibility for the child. But the case had come about after the boy’s 17-year-old mother, who was 14 when she gave birth, opposed the council’s application. She suggested that her father and her father’s partner should care for the young boy, if she were not allowed. But Judge Bellamy said an assessment of the grandfather’s suitability had raised a 'number of areas of concern'. This included a history of domestic violence, worries about excessive drinking, problems with anxiety and depression, drug abuse and smoking, the ruling said. The grandfather had told the court how he had been a smoker for several years and had used cannabis regularly for about 30 years. He said he had not used cannabis since late 2013 - when he had 'decided' to give up his habit. But the judge said it was significant that the man had been unable to quit smoking - despite seeking help from a GP. Judge Bellamy said: '(He) has been a smoker for several years. Leicestershire County Council, whose headquarters are pictured, had responsibility for the young . boy and asked the judge to make an order so the child could be placed for . adoption . 'Whilst smoking is not necessarily a contra-indicator to (his) suitability as a long-term carer for (his grandson), it is significant in the context of his ability to give up habit-forming behaviour even with professional support.' He added: '(His) inability to give up his long-term smoking habit even with professional support casts some doubt on the reliability of his assertion that in December 2013 he gave up a 30-year cannabis dependency by sheer force of will-power without any professional support.' Judge Bellamy said social workers had flagged concerns about the mother’s 'drug abuse' and lifestyle. He said the evidence raised 'very real doubts' about the capacity of the mother or the grandfather and his partner to care for the little boy. He added: 'I have come to the conclusion that in this case the evidence points very clearly to placement for adoption.'","Smoking showed man's inability to stop 'habit-forming behaviour', judge said .

"By . James Rush . Tributes have been paid to Rio Andrew, 15, who died after falling ill at an illegal rave . Tributes have been paid to a 15-year-old boy who died after falling ill at an illegal rave, which police knew about two weeks before it was held. Rio Andrew was among 2,000 revellers who descended on a disused sorting office in Croydon, in the early hours of Sunday. The teenager, who was described by his school as 'destined for academic success', was taken from the venue by ambulance to hospital where he died yesterday afternoon. The teenager is understood to have drunk from a bottle of beer which is believed to have contained the illegal drug ketamine, the Croydon Advertiser reported. Scotland Yard said the cause of death has still to be confirmed and a post-mortem examination was being arranged. Borough Commander Simon Letchford confirmed police believed Rio had an 'adverse effect' to drugs taken shortly before his death. He said: 'We've got a number of lines of inquiry that we're following but we believe he's taken some sort of drug that's had an adverse effect on him. 'We want to identify who's provided that to him, where he's got it from and, if we can identify the individuals concerned, we'll look to prosecute them.' The force has launched an internal review after it emerged officers received intelligence about the illegal rave two weeks before it took place but took no further action. Tributes have been paid to Rio, from Notting Hill in London, who was described as 'a much-respected student' and an 'exceptional sportsman', particularly in shot put. The teenager is understood to have drunk from a bottle of beer which is believed to have contained the illegal drug ketamine, the Croydon Advertiser reported . The Year 10 pupil at Holland Park School in Kensington, west London, was chosen to be part of the Jamaican national team's guard of honour at the 2012 Olympics. In a statement posted on its website, Holland Park School said students and staff 'deeply regret this sad loss of a much-respected student'. 'Rio was an able scholar, destined for academic success,' the school said. 'He was also an exceptional sportsman and due to be awarded this Friday a prestigious sports award. 'The school wishes to send its collective sympathies and respect to all of Rio's family and friends. He will be greatly missed by the school community.' Tributes flooded on to Twitter following his death. Tributes have been paid to Rio, from Notting Hill in London, who was described as 'a much-respected student' and an 'exceptional sportsman', particularly in shot put . The rave was spotted by officers on routine patrol who saw 'large numbers of people inside, outside and heading towards' the disused building where music was being played on Saturday at around 9.40pm . One friend wrote: 'Today I lost one of my closest friends, Rio Andrew. Words cannot even explain how heartbroken I am. Love you dude.' Another tweeted: 'RIP Rio Andrew. You were so talented and amazing and it's such a shame. You were my mate since primary and it's heartbreaking to let you go.' One friend said: 'Rio Andrew, 15, my best friend dead. It's times like this where we won't be scared but we look at the world from a different angle.' 'The school wishes to send its collective . sympathies and respect to all of Rio's family and friends. He will be . greatly missed by the school community' - Holland Park School statement . A 19-year-old man who became ill at the illegal rave after reportedly drinking from the same bottle is still in hospital in a stable condition. Scotland Yard said it was aware of six other people who were taken to hospital. All six have been discharged. The rave was spotted by officers on routine patrol who saw 'large numbers of people inside, outside and heading towards' the disused building where music was being played on Saturday at around 9.40pm. Violence broke out after police clamped down on the rave by trying to stop more revellers getting to the building. Scotland Yard said a number of people in the crowd became violent, and missiles were thrown at officers. The window of a police vehicle was also smashed. Officers continued to surround the venue until they raided it on Sunday at about 8.30am. Fourteen people were arrested for a range of offences including drugs, violent disorder and money laundering. Rio Andrew was chosen to be part of the Jamaican national team's guard of honour at the 2012 Olympics . Two men have been charged with violent disorder and drugs offences, and a 47-year-old man and a 30-year-old man were given adult cautions for possession of class A drugs. Another three men were arrested on suspicion of money laundering, a 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and a 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. All five have been bailed pending further inquiries. Scotland Yard said another five men are still in custody after being arrested for handling stolen goods and criminal damage offences. Mr Letchford admitted he would have expected 'a bit more to have been done' after police were tipped off about the illegal rave two weeks beforehand. Speaking outside the Scotland Yard headquarters, he said: 'About two weeks before, we had a single piece of intelligence that suggested that there may be an event on at this venue. It was assessed at the time and no further action was taken. 'I've now asked for a review into the decision-making around that, why we didn't take any further action. I would have expected a bit more to have been done. I'll need to find out why that wasn't done at the time.' Mr Letchford said police allowed the rave to continue to avoid trouble spilling out on to nearby streets. 'Officers became aware a significant number of people had turned up at a disused venue in Croydon,' he said. 'Unfortunately, a number of those people then became violent and started to attack officers, throwing fire extinguishers. 'We think we had 2,000 people in a potentially very volatile situation. Officers continued to surround the venue until they raided it on Sunday at about 8.30am . 'The commanders on the ground made a very difficult decision to allow them into the premises and contain them into those premises, rather than allow them to go out into the streets and potentially cause significant damage to residential and business property.' He added: 'These events are, by their very nature, criminal. We're going to do everything in our power to identify those responsible.' Mr Letchford said police were not aware of a particularly dangerous batch of drugs linked to Rio's death but stressed that anyone taking illegal substances is putting themselves at risk. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact Croydon CID on 020 3276 2264.

"By . Amanda Willliams . Peter Thompson, 48, struck the behind of stewardess Agnieszla Kowalczyk during a Ryanair flight from Alicante but said it was an accident . A bridegroom has been spared prison after he drunkenly struck the bottom of an air hostess while he was flying home from his stag night. Peter Thompson, 48, allegedly struck the behind of stewardess Agnieszla Kowalczyk during a Ryanair flight from Alicante, in Spain. She told Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court that Thompson told her she . was very pretty, that he loved her and that he had looked at her as if . she was a ‘piece of meat.’ But he claimed he had accidentally hit Miss Kowalczyk while swinging his arms around in a drunken manner. When the plane arrived at Bournemouth Airport, Dorset, Thompson - a languages teacher - was arrested. He pleaded guilty to common assault on the basis that it was an accident, and he also admitted being drunk on an aircraft. Thompson, a teacher at a private language school from Poole, was let off with a community service order. The court heard Thompson, who is due to get married in August, was flying home from his stag do in Alicante, Spain, when the incident happened on May 4. At a previous court hearing, Lee Turner, prosecuting read a statement from the air stewardess. Mr Turner said: 'As she walked past he smacked her bottom with his open right hand. He wasn’t aggressive, she thinks he was trying to be funny but was actually very disrespectful.' But James Moore, defending, said that the offence had been an accident on Thompson’s part. He said his client had consumed an anti-histamine tablet and alcohol before the flight. He was also sold a discounted alcoholic drink by the air stewardess on the plane. Mr Moore said Thompson was in high spirits and was looking forward to seeing his fiancee when the incident happened. He said: 'He should have known that had he swung his arms around he was likely to make contact, and contact he made. 'He has an exuberant and bubbly personality and he got himself carried away but it was in no way nasty. 'Because he was in drink this offence has taken place. 'He . is a kind person who is truly remorseful for the fact that he has . appeared before the court and for the fact that he has caused the air . stewardess any distress. 'It was not his intention to cause her distress.' During the hearing Thompson’s fiancee gave a witness statement in support of his character. The court heard Thompson, who is due to get married in August, was flying home from his stag do on a Ryanair flight in Alicante, Spain, when the incident happened on May 4 . The air hostess told Bournemouth Magistrates' Court that Thompson told her she was very pretty and that he loved her and that he looked at her as if she was a 'piece of meat' He was also supported by statements by his brother, a former police officer, and the boss of the charity organisation at which he volunteers. District Judge Stephen Nicholls sentenced Thompson to a 12 month community order, 120 hours of unpaid work, and fines totalling £245. He said: 'You accept that when you went on the aircraft you had been drinking and that you were reckless and struck the flight attendant. 'Any offence in an aircraft is clearly an aggravated feature. 'Everybody on that aircraft has no easy means of escape therefore any incident that takes place there is a concern of upsetting the staff and passengers. 'This behaviour is out of character for you.'","Peter Thompson, 48, 'struck behind' of stewardess Agnieszla Kowalczyk .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A widow has been left distraught after the sea view she cherished with her late husband has been blocked by an extension next door. Joyce Reynolds, 84, and her husband Kenneth bought the four-bedroom home in Newquay, Cornwall, 14 years ago to be near the sea. Before he died last year, Mr Reynolds dedicated himself to building a terrace in the garden where they could sit to watch the waves. Distraught: Joyce Reynolds, 84, once had sprawling views of the Cornish sea but is now faced with a 15ft wall . Blocked: This is the start of a brick wall built by the guest house next door that will block Mrs Reynolds' view . But now, just months later, the terrace is shrouded in shade cast by a 15ft-high wall, blocking the sight of the shore. It is part of works on the Trewlawn Guest House next door, that will also see first-floor and second-floor balconies erected next to Mrs Reynolds' windows. Blasting the works, which started in January, the grandmother-of-12 said: 'My husband built the terrace - he used to love looking out there. 'We had beautiful views of the sea from both the bedroom and kitchen windows. 'I . used to love looking out during stormy days when the sea was rough. Now . the only way I can see the sea is if I go right to the end of the . terrace. Before: Mrs Reynolds and her late husband Kenneth, who died last year, bought the home 14 years ago for its view of the sea. Kenneth dedicated himself to building a terrace where they could sit to watch the waves . Works: Mrs Reynolds last year objected to the plans, which were put into action in January . 'My husband died last summer and a few months later this happened. 'This past year has been hell - it’s not what you expect at the end of your life.' Mrs Reynolds, who also has four great grandchildren, said she objected to the plans when they were first drawn up months after Kenneth died at the age of 85 of acute myeloid leukemia. Her neighbour and son-in-law have since written to the council to complain about their handling of the case, but they have had no progress. 'They . started building in January and it’s still not complete. There are . builders at the property five days a week making a racket. 'My husband used to love looking out there. We had beautiful views of the sea. Now I can't see anything' 'When the plans were first up drawn last year we objected twice . but Cornwall Council passed them and we couldn’t do anything more. 'My . son-in-law and neighbour wrote to the council a couple of months ago to . complain about whether they’re fit for purpose to pass this type of . planning permission as it goes against everything we believe. 'If we don’t have any success with them then we’re going to go to an ombudsman.' Despite the concerns, Newquay Town Council supported the plans when it met to discuss the application last year. But it ordered the guest house to erect 'screening' between the balconies and Mrs Reynolds' home to maintain her privacy. The town authority also requested that the balconies are only used as outdoor seating to keep noise levels to a minimum. Cornwall Council said: 'The occupiers of neighbouring properties were consulted in accordance with council procedure. Balconies: Balconies have also been erected next to Mrs Reynolds' windows in Newquay, Cornwall . 'Following receipt of objections from neighbours at numbers 20 and 26, two site visits were carried out in order to address their concerns. 'Having carefully assessed the proposal, it was concluded that any potential loss of view and light would not be so significant as to warrant a refusal of planning permission. 'The matter of possible loss of privacy from proposed balconies was addressed by the imposition of a condition requiring privacy screening. 'Potential loss of sea views and devaluation of property are not material planning considerations.' The council said it is checking the development is being built in accordance with approved plans and will meet residents on site to explain the development. The building’s owners - Isabel Fisher and Dirk Parker - did not wish to comment.","Joyce Reynolds, 84, bought seaside home with late husband for its view .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Rickie Lambert is set fulfil his boyhood dream of playing Liverpool against the club he left earlier this summer. In an ironic twist of fate, the Merseysiders will face Southampton on the opening day of the season. Lambert made the move to Liverpool, the club he supported as a boy, from St Mary's in a £4million move earlier this month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch new striker Rickie Lambert's first Liverpool interview . Debut: Rickie Lambert could make open his Liverpool account against his former club Southampton .

I didn't think the chance would come. 'I know how big Liverpool are - and it means everything to me - but I know what is important; I know it's what I do on the pitch and the minutes I play. 'I know that's what matters, and that's what I'll be focused on.' The fairytale scenario for Lambert would be to score in on his Reds bow against his former club. But with either Daniel Sturridge or Luis Suarez likely to occupy the lone striker's role on the opening day of the season, it remains to be seen whether Lambert will feature against Ronald Koeman's men.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Stabbed: Ernest Moyo, 27, now has prosthetic arms and legs after a gang stabbed his thigh and stomach outside a party in 2012, forcing doctors to amputate his limbs . A gang whose vicious attack caused a man to lose all four of his limbs have been jailed for 61 years. Ernest Moyo, 27, was leaving a party when he was accosted by the four thugs, demanding his mobile phone. When he refused, he was stabbed in the thigh and stomach then left lying in the road in Worthing, Sussex. Emergency services took him to hospital but infections from his wounds had already spread to his vital organs and he was put on life support. Doctors were left with no choice but to amputate both his arms and legs. That night, police arrested and charged Patrick Brookes, 27, before his three accomplices - Dominic Brookes, 19, Jeremiah Reynolds, 26, and Trey Johnson, 18 - were caught nine days later. Today, they were sentenced to a total of 61 years imprisonment for the 2012 attack. During trials at Hove Crown Court, all four denied involvement in the attack but the jury found them guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Unemployed Patrick Brookes, from Worthing, was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment. Reynolds, from North London, Dominic Brookes, from South London, and Johnson, from Worthing, were all sentenced to 15 years. Mr Moyo, who is also known as 'Joe', said: 'I am pleased with the outcome and me and my fiancé both agree that justice has been served. 'We are hoping to get married next year - this has now given us closure on what happened and we can put it behind us. 'We are glad this has now all finished and we can move on.' Mr Moyo fought for his life in hospital for months after the late night attack. Jailed: Patrick Brookes, 27 (left), has been jailed for 16 years for the attack which left Mr Moyo with infections that spread to his vital organs, forcing him onto life support. Dominic Brookes, 19 (right), was jailed for 15 years . Guilty: Trey Johnson, 18 (left), was 16 when he attacked Mr Moyo in Worthing, Sussex. He and Jeremiah Reynolds, 26 (right) were found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and jailed for 15 years each . He is now adapting to the tasks of daily life with the help of prosthetic limbs. Mr Moyo’s fiancée, Amy Dunne, said: 'For two to three months every day both our families visited him hoping and praying, before finally he was taken off the life support.

"By . John Drayton . The German team got some motivation help from explorer and adventurer Mike Horn during a sailing outing near their camp on Brazil’s Atlantic coast on Tuesday. Horn talked about his exploits, which include the solo circumnavigation of the Arctic Circle and a North Pole expedition. Germany captain Philipp Lahm was impressed, saying it was ‘incredible what the human body can achieve.’ Making waves! Germany stars Lukas Podolski (L) and Mirolsav Klose enjoy a day jet skiing ahead of the World Cup . Land ahoy! Bastian Schweinsteiger (L) on the boat ''Pangaea'' of adventurer Mike Horn in Santo Andre, Brazil . Life's a beach: Germany players including Mesut Ozil (L) and Philipp Lahm (2L) walk on the sand in Brazil . Ship shape: Germany players were given a motivational talk from Arctic explorer Mike Horn aboard his boat . Lahm says the presentation by the South African-born Swiss explorer showed that, ‘we must be well prepared, and have to respect the opponent.’ Lahm also admitted he is not sure where he will play in the German side at the World Cup. Injuries are forcing coach Joachim Low to have another look at his options - forward Marco Reus has been ruled out for three months after injuring his ankle in a warm game against Armenia. The attacking midfielder suffered partial ligament tear in his left ankle after a tussle with Artur Yedigaryan during his side's 6-1 victory. Consequently, Lahm is likely to be fielded as a defensive midfielder in Brazil rather than in his usual and preferred position as right back. Lahm says it’s the coach’s decision and that he is ready to play in whatever position he’s thrown into. But putting Germany’s top defender in midfield could weaken the already suspect back four of Low’s team. Samba style: Jerome Boateng and Mario Goetze (front, R) walk on the beach in the village of Santo Andre . Smile: Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer (L) poses for a picture with fans as he walks with his  Germany teammates . Cold facts: Horn talked about his exploits, which include the solo circumnavigation of the North Pole . Lahm played as a defensive midfielder a lot this season for Bayern Munich, also because of injuries to his teammates, and filled the role surprisingly well. That has led Low to test his captain in the new role and that’s where he played in the final warm-up match, a 6-1 win over Armenia. ‘You assume that if you played in one position in the final friendly, you will also play in the same position at the World Cup,’ Lahm said. ‘Of course I’ve spoken to the coach a lot, but it will be up to him to disclose what we discussed. At the end, it’s his decision in which position I play.’ Lahm became Germany captain four years ago, when Michael Ballack got injured and had to miss the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Loew never recalled Ballack and Lahm stayed as captain. ‘Nothing much has changed since then, except that I now have more experience. Your authority comes from your performance on the field,’ he said. Back to front: Phillip Lahm may be moved into his new midfield position after Marco Reus' injury . Down and out: Marco Reus has been ruled out for three months after injuring his ankle in a warm up game . Blow: Germany coach Joachim Low watches as Marco Reus is taken off during their friendly against Armenia . By moving into midfield, Lahm may squeeze out Bastian Schweinsteiger from the starting lineup. Schweinsteiger has been bothered by a knee injury and may not be fully fit for the June 16 opener against Portugal in Group G. Lahm sustained an ankle injury in the final club match of the season and missed most of the training camp. But the captain says he is ready now. ‘I am fine, my foot is OK, I can play,’ he said. Low usually uses two defensive midfielders and usually they are Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira. But Khedira is only coming back after missing six months with a knee injury and Loew is unlikely to risk playing both with doubts about their fitness. But strengthening the midfield could expose the defense. Jerome Boateng would then move to Lahm’s position as right back. But he normally plays as a central defender at Bayern and feels more comfortable in that role. Sacrifice: Bastian Schweinsteiger could lose his place in central midfield to accommodate Philipp Lahm . Shuffling the pack: Sami Khedira has just returned from injury while Jerome Boateng may be drafted in . Benedikt Hoewedes is not a natural-born left back and newcomer Erik Durm may get his chance despite a lack of experience. That position has been a weak link in Loew’s team for a long time. The two central defenders, Mats Hummels and Per Mertesacker, have not often played alongside each other and when they have, were not always the bedrock of stability. When attacking midfielder Marco Reus got injured in the match against Armenia and had to drop out of the World Cup, Loew decided to call up a defender in his place, Shkodran Mustafi. This could be another indication that Lahm is moving into the midfield.","Germany players were taken on a sailing jolly ahead of the 2014 World Cup .

"By . Richard Spillett . The BBC has defended its World Cup coverage after a slew of complaints about pundits and commentary. The corporation today acknowledged that some fans were unhappy after Phil Neville, Alan Shearer and commentator Jonathan Pearce were criticised online. But it brushed off the complaints, insisting its team is 'very strong' and it will 'take time' for viewers to get used to them. Scroll down for video . The BBC has defended its World Cup team after a barrage of criticism in the tournament's opening week . Former Everton player Phil Neville bore the brunt of heaviest criticism, with complaints about his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during England's opening game with Italy. The BBC received more than 400 complaints about his performance, with even the corporation's own presenter Danny Baker suggesting producers made a mistake by letting him cover the game. Viewers have also criticised Jonathan Pearce's commentary and said former Italian star Fabio Cannavaro and Brazilian Juninho, who have acted as pundits, are difficult to understand. During France's match with Honduras, regular commentator Pearce appeared confused by a computer animation that first showed 'no goal' when the football hit the post, before changing to 'goal' when it crossed the line. Regular pundit Alan Shearer has also been criticised on Twitter, with fans accusing him of 'stating the obvious' and 'being too negative'. French star Thierry Henry has been one of the only successes of the tournament for the corporation, being praised by fans for both his fashion and insight. The BBC has received hundreds of complaints about former England player Phil Neville's commentary . Responding to critics, the BBC published a statement on its complaints website today, defending its choice of pundits and commentators . It said: 'The World Cup is watched by an audience of many millions with a hugely diverse range of tastes and opinions and we value feedback from our viewers and listeners. 'We believe we have put together a very strong international line-up, with a wealth of experience and knowledge covering all aspects of the game at the very highest level. 'Thoughts on individual presenters and commentators can vary considerably so it's inevitable some viewers or listeners will dislike or disapprove of certain presenters and commentators. 'All our programme contributors are appointed on the basis of their experience, knowledge and talent, but judgements are often subjective and we would never expect everyone to agree with every choice we make, and appreciate that sometimes it can take time for viewers and listeners to get used to a particular individual's style of presentation or commentary.'

VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands . Not many people could have predicted Holland would beat Spain, let alone dish out a 5-1 thrashing to the world champions. But Louis van Gaal’s team are keeping their feet on the ground. Captain Robin van Persie, who, with Arjen Robben, became the first Dutch player to score in three different World Cups, said: ‘We shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves — we have a long way to go to win this. This is my fifth (major) tournament and I know how these things work: the euphoria vanishes just as quickly as it appears.’ But the Dutch have every reason to be euphoric. Their new system with three at the back works and allows Robben to play as a striker. With no defensive responsibilities, he can now focus purely on attacking. Australia fought hard against Chile and were undone by their fluid movement. But they did cause plenty of problems with crosses from deep and set pieces. Expect more of the same on Wednesday. Van the man: Robin van Persie scored twice as Holland stunned Spain 5-1 on Friday night . One to watch: Arjen Robben . Robin van Persie might have scored a beauty against Spain but it was Arjen Robben’s pace that tore the champions apart. Playing in a forward role, his direct running will terrorise Australia. Key clash: Matthew Spiranovic vs Robin van Persie . Australia struggled with the pace and strength of Chile’s frontline in their opening game and that could well continue against Louis van Gaal’s side. Van Persie was unplayable at times against the reigning champions Spain and Spiranovic will have to stay disciplined to have any chance of winning his battle with the Manchester United forward. Familiar face: Tim Cahill . The former Millwall and Everton man has given us a reminder of his power with a header against Chile.

In the previous Grand Prix at Monaco, Hamilton said him and Rosberg were not friends but merely colleagues following his second place to the German. A fortnight ago, Hamilton was visibly angry that Rosberg ruined his final qualifying lap at Monaco by stopping just off the track. The German had braked too late — he said accidentally; Hamilton implied it was intentional. The duo had previously both insisted their friendship, which goes back to their childhood as team-mates in karting, would survive the fierce test of a championship battle. Indicators that their differences had healed were evident during the race weekend in North America with the pair cooling their dispute before Rosberg took second place, while a brake failure forced Hamilton to retire midway through the race.

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . The party line from Spain as destiny awaits the world champions in the Maracana is that tiki–taka football is alive and well and the era goes on. The private whisper is that they may be bracing themselves to turn and run with the wind of change which is blowing up an electrifying storm of goals in this World Cup. D-day against the red-hot Chile peppers who gave England a recent roasting at Wembley stands not only for destiny but also decision. VIDEO Scroll down for the latest odds for Spain vs. Chile courtesy of talkSPORT and Coral . Setback: Spain may have to lose their tiki-taka style in order to stay in the 2014 World Cup . In terms which his countrymen will understand only too well, the Spanish manager is on the horns of a snorting bull of a dilemma. Stick or twist? Vicente del Bosque - who describes his team’s 5-1 collapse against Holland at the opening of their title defence as ‘unexplainable’ – confronts a choice which he has no need to tell us is unenviable. Del Bosque, who accepts his job will be on the line if they fail to qualify from the group, says: ‘Tactically it will be a different game from Holland because Chile are brave and quick and risk attacking all the time.’ Fernando Torres, a possible replacement for Diego Costa, says: ‘I hope we can win playing our style at a high level but if not we have to win any way we can.’ It is an enormous risk for any team to change tack in the midst of a major tournament. For the winners not only of the last World Cup but also two successive European Championships, a change so drastic will be condemned as heresy if it fails. VIDEO We're still hurting . Choices: Vicente Del Bosque must be considering changing the way his team play . So far as the eve of a match which could be pivotal for the development of the world game as well the outcome of Brazil 2014, the word is only that Spain are in profound deliberation. We are unlikely to get the verdict until an hour before the kick-off here, when del Bosque hands in his team sheet. For ‘uexplainable’ and unenviable read unthinkable in the minds of many if he sacrifices the high priests of tiki-taka, Xavi and Xabi Alonso, on the altar of accelerated pace, urgency and aggression. If the names of Pedro, the only real speed merchant at the Barcelona academy of possession football, and Koke, the midfield energizer of Atletico Madrid’s remarkable season, take their places then it will be new-game on. Perhaps he has still to make up his mind. Maybe that was why he closed the doors of the Maracana to prying eyes after the first 15 minutes of Spain’s supposedly open training session there 24 hours before kick-off. VIDEO Team Profile: Spain . Out? Diego Costa could lose his place in the starting line-up after a poor performance against Holland . But he has laid the ground for such a possibility by saying: ‘If we make changes after what happened in the second half against Holland we won’t be pointing a finger at anyone. All the players have our support but we have to manage the situation we are in. ‘We are capable of turning things around. We will keep doing several things the same way – but we are flexible.’ Not unnaturally, given all their successes over the past six years, most of the players are defensive of a winning system. Pepe Reina will be the beneficiary if del Bosque comes to the conclusion that Jose Mourinho was probably right all along and drops Iker Casillas after his horror show against the Dutch. Liverpool’s goalkeeper says: ‘This team is not dead. We will reverse the notion that this is the end of an era.’ Del Bosque, one of the finest managers of any epoch, will be more open-minded. Tiki-taka was not his creation but that of Pep Guardiola at Barcelona and Del Bosque is not as wedded to it as the man who has taken the style on with him to Bayern Munich. False nine: Cesc Fabregas could also be set for a starting place if both Costa and Torres are dropped . Versatile: Andres Iniesta (left) and Fernando Torres hope Spain can win any we they can . VIDEO All Star XI: Andres Iniesta . This Spanish inquisitor is very much his own man. He will be wise to the trends here. He will be aware that at the start of play on Day Six of this tournament more than 40 goals had already been scored compared with barely 20 at the same stage in South Africa four years ago, where Spain beat Holland with the only goal of the final. Del Bosque will be acutely aware of why this is happening. He has seen Germany amplify the alliance of power, pace and non-stop work-rate to high-technique, which is now one trademark of the game. He was too close for comfort as Holland demonstrated another, counter-attacking at blistering speed. Preparing: The Spanish players train ahead of their match against Chile on Wednesday . Shocker: Spain suffered a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Holland in Salvador last week . Andres Iniesta summed it up best: ‘At times, as well as keeping the ball, we will have to be faster and more direct. Now we have to win anyhow that works.’ Chile are not unlike the Dutch in that tactic. Although not quite as adept on the break as Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben, these South Americans do have a deadly rapier of a forward in Alexis Sanchez and they work flat out to supply him with chances. This is a dangerous game. So is changing a playing philosophy on the hoof. Del Bosque may settle for injecting some additional quickness but without fundamentally altering Spain’s basic structure. Such a compromise would be fraught in itself but if anyone can pull off this trick without falling between two stools it is The Manager From La Mancha.","Spain may have to lose their tiki-taka style if they are to progress further in the World Cup .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The current harmony within the England camp in Brazil despite the opening defeat against Italy is not in evidence at St George’s Park. This follows the surprising departure last weekend of Noel Blake after five years in charge of the England Under 19 team and seven as a national coach. Upset staff, albeit anonymously, have made strong complaints to Sports Agenda about Blake being made a victim of the new regime at the national training centre under director of elite development Dan Ashworth. Departure: Noel Blake has been made a victim of the new St George's Park regime, according to upset staff . They complain about a cliquey atmosphere, with Ashworth favouring his own appointments including close family friend Aidy Boothroyd as England U20 manager.

"By . John Drayton . Italy know they have to be sharp mentally and physically if they are going to avoid becoming the second team to be upset by Costa Rica at the World Cup. Uruguay fell victim to the Central American nation in their opening Group D game and now the Italians will play Costa Rica on Friday at the hottest time of the day in Recife. 'You have to face them prepared to play to the death because everyone would have predicted a victory for Uruguay,' Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi told the Italian media. VIDEO Team Profile: Italy . Wary: De Rossi has described the Costa Rica fixture as Italy's 'most dangerous game' at the World Cup . Threat: Arsenal's Joel Campbell scored for Costa Rica as they shocked Uruguay in their first game . 'I remember we played there (in Recife) last year in the Confederations Cup against Japan (Italy won 4-3 in the quarter-finals), and we suffered from the heat as well as Japan's speed. 'The game against Costa Rica is seen as the most dangerous game, because we play at 1pm local time and it will be really difficult.' Italy are level with Costa Rica on three points after opening their campaign with a 2-1 win over England on Saturday. 'Can we beat Costa Rica?' De Rossi said. 'There is no longer a World Cup as it once was, like in Italia 90 when games ended 8-0. 'We find teams are organised, with strong players and you cannot afford to think that Italy will beat Costa Rica just because we are called Italy.' The heat and humidity are a major concern for the Azzurri, so much so that Italy's team doctor, Enrico Castellacci, wants FIFA to allow time-outs for players so they can drink water in their next two encounters, which both kick off at 1pm local time. Players were not allowed drinks breaks during Saturday's game. Concerned: Italy team doctor Enrico Catellaci says FIFA should allow water breaks during the game . Sweaty: Not only are temperatures expected to be high but humidity could be a factor on Friday in Recife . VIDEO City Guide: Recife . 'It would have been good to have had a three-minute time-out during that game,' Castellacci said. 'Fortunately, we prepared well and none of our players had cramps. 'I hope that in Recife and Natal (the cities where Italy will play their next two games), where the conditions will be no better than in Manaus because of the times the games are scheduled for, FIFA will reconsider. 'The criteria is that if the temperature is 32 degrees Celsius or above then the time-out is almost automatic. 'However, what they don't consider is that with humidity above 70 to 80 per cent, it feels three or four degrees warmer. Missing: Veteran keeper Gianluigi Buffon will be absent again when Italy face the Group D minnows . 'With those conditions and in these type of games, one can lose two litres of sweat.' Italy trained on Monday at their base camp in Mangaratiba without several players, including De Rossi. De Rossi sat out the morning session with neck pain while defender Andrea Barzagli trained separately from the group with a minor muscular problem. Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and AC Milan defender Mattia De Sciglio, who watched the game against England from the stands, were also absent with the former out with an ankle injury and the latter sidelined with a calf strain.","Daniele De Rossi warns against complacency as Italy take on minnows .

'This is not a race between him and me, I never considered taking his place. I only think about my contribution because one must be realistic. 'I don't know if I'm even in the top 10 list of goalkeepers and I'm really not interested. 'My focus is on giving all I have every day. One feels satisfied when he gives the best he has.' Sirigu made his World Cup debut against England and came up with some good saves to help Italy secure victory. 'I felt excited prior to the game,' the 27-year-old said. 'I got so many phone calls and messages and I understood what this meant. 'Once the game started, I was calm. 'Having played in the Champions League, you start to get used to playing in crunch games. 'However, the World Cup is something else. It's a special atmosphere.' Stopper: Sirigu makes a fine save during the game against England . Beaten: Daniel Sturridge levelling the scores for England in the 37th minute . Italy are joint top of their group, level on three points with Costa Rica, who stunned Uruguay 3-1 at the weekend. Joel Campbell was the star for Costa Rica after scoring once and setting up another goal. 'In the Champions League I faced Olympiacos, where Campbell plays, and he really impressed me,' Sirigu said. 'I knew that in this climate he could really express his top potential. 'Costa Rica's win against Uruguay was unexpected and it has changed the cards even though the group is still wide open. 'However, it hasn't surprised me that much because I knew they would be a difficult opponent. 'They are a physical team that runs a lot and is hard to play against them.' Finisher: Joel Campbell scoring for Costa Rica against Uruguay in Group D on Saturday . Threat: The Central American's recorded a shock 3-1 victory over the group seeds . Sirigu, just like the other players and the coaching staff, is concerned about playing against Costa Rica in Recife at the hottest time of the day. 'It's going to be a delicate game,' he said. 'We are going to have to use more energy than in our previous game. 'We struggled against England and at a certain point, the atmospheric conditions made it difficult to breathe. 'At 1pm it will be all the more challenging. The sun at that time is very strong and you struggle more to focus. 'We just want to win and Costa Rica is eager to continue to surprise. We will face them in the best possible way.' Buffon and AC Milan defender Mattia De Sciglio returned to training on Tuesday at Italy's base camp in Mangaratiba. De Sciglio, like Buffon, missed Italy's 2-1 win over England in Manaus on Saturday because of an injury.

"England have been hit in the pocket for their slow over rate in the Lord's Test. Alastair Cook's hosts just ran out of time to force victory against Sri Lanka on Monday night in the first of two matches in the Investec series. A total of 17 scheduled overs were unbowled, by both sides, and some pundits suggested England might have gone 1-0 up after all had they managed to get through their full allocation against tourists who hung on for the nerviest of stalemates with nine wickets down on the final day. Paying the price: England have been fined for their slow over rate in the first Investec Test match with Sri Lanka at Lord's - after 17 scheduled overs were lost over the five days . Out of time: Stuart Broad and Liam Plunkett react after England ran out of overs in the final session with one Sri Lankan wicket left to take . Hit in the pocket: Alastair Cook will lose 20 per cent of his match fee as a result of the slow over rate . That remains open to conjecture, but there can be no argument with the International Cricket Council's official decision that England did not bowl as many overs as they should. They were deemed to be just one short of requirements. But the double-whammy nonetheless means Cook will be fined 20 per cent of his match fee, and his team-mates 10 per cent. Match referee Andy Pycroft made his judgement after taking into account the mitigation of time allowances for interruptions in play beyond the control of captain or players.","Alastair Cook's team ran out of time as they tried to take final Sri Lankan wicket in final session at Lord's .

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . Owen Farrell has been ruled out of the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton on Saturday with a knee injury – leaving Freddie Burns on course to reclaim the England No 10 shirt. The RFU confirmed on Tuesday morning that Farrell sustained a strained medial ligament in his left knee during the 28-27 second Test defeat in Dunedin last weekend and he will not be available for the series finale. It is a major disappointment for the 22-year-old, who missed the first clash with the All Blacks in Auckland due to his involvement in the Aviva Premiership Final. Injury blow: Owen Farrell will play no further part in the series after damaging his knee . Below par: The Saracens man was not at his best last weekend, picking up a yellow card . Revealing the bad news about the Saracens stand-off, England head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘The knee has been scanned and there is a strain there. It’s disappointing for Owen as he was desperate to play in the final Test but such is his character that he is already working on his rehab and still contributing to the tour. ‘Fortunately we have three other fly-halves to call on and we’ll make that selection call over the next few days. The squad trained well this morning and we will narrow down selection over the next 24 hours following the game this evening.’ Burns produced a superb performance at Eden Park, in his first Test appearance for a year, and Leicester’s new recruit from Gloucester is certain to take on the playmaker’s role again. Yet, his return to the starting XV will leave a bench place up for grabs, with Danny Cipriani seemingly ahead of Stephen Myler in the tussle to fill it. England’s injury problems appear to be easing somewhat, as centres Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell – who picked up ankle knocks in Dunedin – both trained on Tuesday.

"By . Matthew Tomaszewicz . Michael Bradley talked previously about the USA’s ‘willingness to suffer’ in this World Cup. Few took him as literally as things played out on Monday night. The United States secured a dramatic 2-1 win against Ghana - the team that has bested them at every level they’ve played competitively since they knocked them out of the group stage back in 2006. Embrace: Jurgen Klinsmann hugs his players after USA's 2-1 victory over Ghana . Nutter: John Brooks (left) heading the winner for his side in the closing stages . Joy: The former striker celebrating their dramatic late winner against the Black Stars . In many ways, the game last night was a reverse of the 2010 match. In that one, the States dictated the play to the Black Stars but didn’t finish their chances. On Thursday, Ghana were the aggressor, creating 20 shots to the US’s seven, but could only once find the back of the net. US manager Jurgen Klinsmann has talked incessantly about changing the US soccer system and play technically but for all the rhetoric the US did not control the match last night save for the opening salvo. Clint Dempsey attacked Ghana's right back flank and in goal worthy of questioning, 'Why Soldado for Spurs?' pinged a low liner in off the far post after introducing Ghana centerback John Boye to his jet stream. USA, as most teams do, got tentative after taking the lead and were forced to do so further when Jozy Altidore pulled his hamstring sprinting for an over-the-top ball. The injury and substitution exacerbated a major flaw in Jurgen Klinsmann’s squad selection: no back-up target man. Torn apart: Jozy Altidore grimaces after pulling his hamstring during the game . Banged: Clint Dempsey floored after being kicked in the face . The US - as has been often the case under Klinsmann opted for a pragmatic and conservative approach - unable to hold the ball up the field and unwilling to open up their rear guard through swift counterattacking. It was a painful watch for US fans as the US seemed to go into 'hold on' mode in the 23’. A trading of goals in the closing stages kept the scoreline in the US favor but the US’s preparation - the States used two subs before the 46th minute from non-contact muscle strains - and tactics - an inability to re-purpose the ball to their more dangerous right flank, and the absence of a simple adjustment of moving a striker over a fullback in an attempt to win more outlet duels - should be questioned. At the end of the day it was some simple German fundamentals that Klinsmann instilled early in his coaching tenure - specifically playing a simple holder than many questioned and moving the US centre-backs closer together - that won the day as the US conceded just once. Klinsmann did something his predecessor’s couldn’t - he beat Ghana. Can he keep dealing victories through his audacious tactics is up next?","USA beat Ghana in a dramatic 2-1 victory in Group G at the World Cup .

Here Sportsmail previews 10 of the big ones which will have fans the length of the country glued to their TV sets when the action gets underway in August. Champions again! Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany lifts the Premier League trophy in May . Man City v Liverpool (Saturday, August 23) The top two of 2013-14 do not have to wait long to square up this time around. The champions, who dropped just five points at home last season, came from behind to win this duel on Boxing Day, with Liverpool gaining revenge with a 3-2 success at Anfield later in the season. Time for one better? Steven Gerrard and his Liverpool side travel to Manchester City early in the season . Arsenal v Tottenham (Saturday, September 27) The Gunners did the double over their biggest rivals last season, with a pair of 1-0 victories. The teams were separated by 10 points at the end of the campaign, so the first derby match could be key in the race for a top four placing - with new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino getting his first taste of a north London derby. Keenly contested: The north London derby between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur is one of the better games . Man Utd v Chelsea (Saturday, October 25) The early season fixtures appear kind to new United boss Louis van Gaal, with the visit of Chelsea looking the most testing of the first quarter of the campaign. The outcome of a game against Jose Mourinho’s men could be an indication as to how the Dutchman’s rebuilding job is progressing - particularly with a derby against City next on the agenda. Bang! Samuel Eto'o fires beyond Man United goalkeeper David De Gea at Stamford Bridge last year . Liverpool v Chelsea (Saturday, November 8) Steven Gerrard’s slip in this match last season was a defining moment in Liverpool’s unsuccessful title bid. It enabled Chelsea to complete the double over the Reds, whose manager Brendan Rodgers will know there can be no room for errors this time around. Man Utd v Liverpool (Saturday, December 13) The Merseysiders tore United apart in this one in 2013-14, loosening David Moyes’s grip on the manager’s job a little more. United, low on confidence, had no answer to the Reds’ attacking verve, succumbing to a sixth home defeat of the campaign. If Van Gaal makes a positive impact at Old Trafford, it is unlikely to be as easy for the visitors next season. Did a job on them: Chelsea had no problem disposing of Liverpool at Anfield back in April . All smiles: Luis Suarez and Wayne Rooney shake hands ahead of a clash at Old Trafford last season . Man City v Arsenal (Saturday, January 17) Arsenal had no answer to City’s free-flowing football at the Etihad in December, losing 6-3. Arsene Wenger’s men led the table despite this defeat - but finished fourth. They also suffered heavy defeats at Liverpool and Chelsea, so this game could provide an indication as to whether they have made significant progress in their bid to be serious title contenders. Nipped in: Alvaro Negredo scores for Manchester City as they beat Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium . Everton v Liverpool (Saturday, February 7) Roberto Martinez, who last week signed a new long-term deal, is the latest Toffees manager seeking to close the gap between the Merseyside rivals. However, recent form suggests it will take time - Everton last beat Liverpool three and a half years ago and despite an impressive campaign, still finished 12 points adrift of them in 2013-14. Tucked home: Daniel Sturridge slots beyond Tim Howard as Liverpool hammered Everton at Anfield . Burnley v Man City (Saturday, March 14) Home form is likely to be key if the Clarets are to retain their Premier League status. The last time they were in the top flight, 2010-11, they were unable to manage the feat - but they bloodied a few noses at Turf Moor along the way. Manchester United and Everton were beaten and Arsenal could only escape with a point - however, City won 6-1 there. Grinning: Craig Bellamy, then at Manchester City, celebrates scoring against Burnley in the 2009/10 season .

"Turkish footballer Emre Belozoglu was handed a two-month and 15 days suspended jail sentence on Tuesday for a racist slur he used against Ivory Coast midfielder Didier Zokora during a match in 2012. The court sentenced the Fenerbahce and Turkey national team midfielder on the grounds that the act constituted an insult crime of 'religious, racist, ethnic, sexist or sectarian discrimination.' The incident, in which Zokora accused Belozoglu of calling him the 'N' word, occurred in April 2012 at a playoff match between Fenerbahce and Trabzonspor. Punished: Emre Belozoglu has been given a two-month and 15 days suspended jail sentence . The sentence was suspended by the court as Belozoglu had not had any previous incidents of a racist nature, the judge said, and on belief that he would not repeat his behaviour. Belozoglu was accused of racism three times during his three-year career at Newcastle United, but the English FA's investigations failed to prove the accusations. Belozoglu became the first Turkish footballer ever to have been handed a prison sentence for racism. Zokora, in Brazil now for the World Cup, had previously played in England for Tottenham Hotspur.

"By . Louise Cheer . Supermarket giant Coles has been misleading its customers about its 'freshly baked' bread, the Federal Court has ruled. On Wednesday, it was found labelling on the supermarket's Cuisine Royale and Coles Bakery products that stated the goods were 'Baked Today, Sold Today' - and in some cases 'Freshly Baked In-Store' - were false, misleading and deceptive. The Federal Court has ruled Coles has been misleading its consumers about its 'freshly baked' bread products . It was found the products were partially baked and frozen off-site, then transported and finished in store at a Coles bakery. Additionally, the Cuisine Royale range was baked and frozen overseas. The products were then promoted as 'Baked Today, Sold Today' or 'Freshly Baked In-Store'. They were also placed near signs that read 'Freshly Baked' or 'Baked Fresh'. The court ruled Coles was giving a misleading representation that the partially baked bread products had been baked on the day of sale or baked in a fresh process using fresh not frozen product. When handing down his judgment, Chief Justice James Allsop said it was not the court's place to dish out advice on how Coles ran its operations, but urged it to look at the way it promoted its bread products. ACCC chairman Rod Sims (left) said the move from Coles gave them a competitive advantage. But Coles spokesman Jon Church (right) said it was never their intention to mislead the public . 'A start would, however, be to make it tolerably clear to the public that the recent baking was the completion of a baking process that had taken place sometime before, off site, and that ""freshly baked"" actually meant the completion of the baking process of frozen product prepared and frozen off site by suppliers,' he said. ACCC chairman Rod Sims said they had been concerned about Coles' misleading claims. 'These claims also placed independently-owned and franchised bakeries that freshly baked bread from scratch each day at a competitive disadvantage,' he said. 'Today's decision confirms that Coles misled consumers about the baking of these bread products. The bread was being baked off-site and not in-store, and in some cases overseas . 'Consumers should be able to rely on the accuracy of credence claims made by businesses like Coles to promote their products, especially where those claims are used to compete with smaller businesses which are genuinely offering a differentiated product.' According to the ACCC, credence claims are representations of a premium or special characteristic that are difficult for a consumer to test the accuracy for themselves. They can be a powerful marketing tool that can be used to mislead consumers if they are not used properly, which can have the potential to impact on the competitive process. These claims are a priority area for the ACCC at this point in time. Coles spokesman Jon Church said it was never their intention to mislead the public about their breads and would be changing its labelling soon. 'Whether baked from scratch in-store or ""par baked"" by our suppliers and finished in our ovens, our bread and baked goods are great quality products which taste great and are convenient for customers. They have won a number of awards around the country,' he said. 'In talking to customers about the ‘par-baked’ bread range, we certainly never set out to deliberately mislead anybody, but we completely accept that we could have done a better job in explaining how the products are baked. 'We are already well advanced in changing product packaging and other information.' The Federal Court will hand down its court orders to Coles in Melbourne at a later date, with Channel Nine reporting the supermarket giant could face a fine of up to $1 million. The ACCC is seeking penalties, declarations, injunctions, costs and other orders.","Coles Bakery goods state they're 'Baked Today, Sold Today'

"By . Emily Crane . A teenager jailed for at least 24 years for shooting dead one of three friends walking to an Adelaide New Year's Eve party has challenged his murder conviction claiming he was too drunk to specifically intend to harm anyone. A lawyer for Liam Humbles, 19, asked the Court of Criminal Appeal on Wednesday to overturn her client's murder conviction saying it was based on error. Humbles was found guilty in March of murdering Lewis McPherson, 18, and the attempted murder of Lewis' friends Liam Trewartha and James Lamont. Scroll down for video . Liam Humbles, 19, was jailed for at least 24 years for shooting dead one of three friends walking to an Adelaide New Year's Eve party in 2012 . The trio were walking to the party in Warradale, south west of Adelaide, on December 31, 2012, when they came across Humbles, an acquaintance, who fired shots at them while affected by drugs and alcohol. Humbles' lawyer, Marie Shaw QC, said the judge overlooking his trial made an error in concluding that the 'grossly intoxicated' teen had the specific intent to murder. 'There is a difference between basic intent - to fire the gun, to do various acts - and specific intent (to kill),' Ms Shaw told the court. She said Humbles was found to have a blood alcohol reading of between 0.252 and 0.284. Humbles was found guilty in March of murdering Lewis McPherson (pictured) and the attempted murder of Lewis' friends Liam Trewartha and James Lamont . He had been drinking all day and was described as being in a 'comatose-type state' when he passed out on a bedroom floor, before being woken up by a friend who wanted Humbles' pistol. After they argued, Humbles was ejected from the house and soon after those inside heard the shots being fired. Ms Shaw said Humbles had exhibited 'bizarre behaviour' and when police came to the scene, he could not stand up, lost his balance when sitting down and fell asleep on the way to the police station. A lawyer for Humbles asked the Court of Criminal Appeal on Wednesday to overturn her client's murder conviction saying it was based on error . His condition would have been heightened by his young age and the emotional state he was in after being ejected. Ms Shaw also contended that the 24-year minimum term was 'manifestly excessive'.

"By . Sarah Dean . A second Marist church official, who held high positions in the order up to 2012, has said he didn't know touching a child 'intimately' was a crime and would need to get legal advice to find out. Alexis Turton, who was until 2012 head of the orders' professional standards office, has told the Royal Commission into Institutional Handling of Child Sexual abuse, he only knew sexual intercourse with a child was a crime in the 80s. He was giving evidence in the case of former brother Gregory Sutton who was jailed in 1996 for 67 counts of sexual abuse against boys and girls in NSW, Queensland and the ACT. On Wednesday, it was also revealed that three days after it became known that police were investigating Sutton, Turton put the paedophile on a plane to Canada. Turton denied repeatedly that he knew police were involved when he sent Sutton for 'intensive therapy' to the Southdown clinic in Canada. Marist Brother Alexis Turton at Wednesday's hearing of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse . Br Turton became involved in 1985, when as vice-provincial he visited St Carthage's school in Lismore where the principal had raised concerns about Sutton's behaviour with primary school girls. He told the commission he was not aware in 1985 that Sutton had a history of abuse at other schools, specifically at a primary school in far North Queensland where the principal had told the order Sutton was interfering with boys. As far as he knew, there were no files the order had that would record his history. He told Simeon Beckett, counsel for the commission, that in 1985 he would have considered an adult having sexual intercourse with a child to be a crime but while he knew touching was wrong he would have to check if it was criminal. Mr Beckett said: 'Are you seriously saying that if an adult touched a child on the vagina, for example, that that was to your knowledge, not a crime in 1985 and 1987?' Convicted paeodophile Gregory Sutton was sent to Canada for 'intensive therapy' Br Turton: 'No, I couldn't say that to my knowledge that it wasn't a crime. I certainly couldn't say that. I would know it would be very wrong and probably criminal, but I would want to go to an expert if it came to a definition.' Mr Beckett: 'What if a child was made to touch an adult, a man for example on the penis. Did you consider in 1985 to 1987, whether that was a crime?' Br Turton said: 'I would consider it definitely to be wrong'. He also told the commission he did not interpret 'inappropriate behaviour' as specifically relating to sexual assault. When Sister Julia, the principal at St Carthage's informed the order she had sent letters to Sutton about his behaviour, Br Turton saw them as warning in the industrial relations sense and did not act to remove Sutton. He was finally moved in 1987 but Br Turton said he was not responsible for that because it was in the hands of the then provincial Br Alman Dwyer. Sutton was sent to the clinic in Canada on August 18, 1989 and documents produced at the commission showed he was telling people there that when investigations began to surface about his sexual activities with children 'within three days he was on a plane heading for Canada'. Another communication from Canada to Br Turton dated August 30, 1989 stated that Sutton had said his provincial had decided he should come to Southdown and this 'was due to the fact that investigations were occurring on himself for school activities five years ago regarding his child abuse'. Br Turton denied he had sent Sutton to Canada to avoid the police investigations in Australia. And when he was told that sending Sutton to Canada was first raised by him on August 15 and he was on a plane on the 18th, Br Turton said he did not consider it 'excessive haste'. 'I didn't see it as excessive haste; I saw it as continuing the process that we had been through to get him through to intensive therapy,' he said. Brother Anthony Hunt has told a Royal Commission that during the 1980s he was not aware that child sex abuse was a crime . He said it was possible a session was starting in Canada and there would be a significant break until he got to the next one. At the time, parents of children who were at St Thomas More School, Cambelltown, NSW had gone to police alleging Sutton, who was there from 1984 to 1985, had abused year five girls. Mr Beckett put it to him that the account he gave the commission about the reason for sending Sutton to Canada was false. 'That is not correct your honour,' Br Turton said. Br Turton also denied that he was the author of a memo which detailed Sutton's history of abusive behaviour with children going back to the 1970s. In that memo the name 'Bart' is used, not Gregory Sutton although the history is Sutton's. 'It's a mystery to me', Br Turton said. Mr Beckett put it to him that the name was used to deceive a reader on the subject of the memorandum, and readers were likely to be police and anyone involved in civil litigation against the Marist Brothers. 'I am totally mystified by this document. I can't make any other assessment of it,' Br Turton said. On Tuesday, the former superior of a NSW Marist Brothers community and deputy principal of a school for 600 students also told an inquiry he did not associate child sexual abuse with crime in the 1980s. Brother Anthony Hunt was head of the Lismore Marist community to which Gregory Sutton - who was later jailed for sexually assaulting 15 children - was attached from 1985 to 1987. Brother Hunt was also deputy principal of the Marist Trinity College in Lismore which had 600 students at the time. He gave evidence at the royal commission into child sexual abuse that although concerns were raised with him about the behaviour of Sutton at St Carthage's primary school, he left it to the school to deal with it. Towards the end of two-and-a-half hours of evidence he said he considered complaints of inappropriate behaviour by Sutton as 'excessive expressions of affection' and had not heard the word pedophile at the time. 'When you give that answer, that as the deputy principal of that Catholic college in the mid-to-late 80s in this nation, you did not understand that the sexual assault of children was a crime?' Presiding Commissioner Justice Jennifer Coate asked. Brother Hunt responded 'I would have to say that's correct at the time.' Justice Coate asked him if he accepted that part of his role was to protect children. 'What is the difficulty that you have with accepting that it was a crime,' Justice Coate asked. Justice Coate asked him if he had seen media reports at the time about people charged with sexual offences against children. 'I don't specifically remember, but I can't rule it out,' Brother Hunt said. Justice Coate asked: 'Is that a serious answer to the Royal Commission, Brother?' To which Brother Hunt replied it was the best he could do with his understanding at the time. He said at the time he saw it as his duty to pass on concerns about brothers to the provincial and deputy provincial of the order who headed the community in Australia. Brother Hunt said his awareness grew in time and in retrospect he was sorry for the 'great harm that was done to children'. Meanwhile, Swimming Australia's response to child sexual abuse allegations made against two high profile coaches is to come under the spotlight at a royal commission next month. The commission will examine Swimming Australia's reaction to claims made against Olympic coaches Scott Volkers and Terry Buck.","Brother Alexis Turton said he would have had to get expert advice .

"By . Louise Cheer . An 18-year-old man woke up in hospital two days after he took a SnapChat pill with little memory of his terrifying brush with the drug. The Palmerston teenager was hanging out with his mates when he took the $35 drug on Friday at 8.30pm, and two hours later he was fighting for his life in the back of ambulance. The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, said all he remembered was asking someone to call an ambulance before collapsing on a driveway next door. Scroll down for video . A 18-year-old man, who spent two days in intensive care after taking a SnapChat pill (pictured), said he could hardly remember what happened . 'That's all I sort of remembered other than waking up in hospital and in the ambulance,' he told Nine News Darwin. The 18-year-old, who works for a local company, warned others of the effects of the drug. 'From my point of view, I definitely say don't take it,' he said. 'There's a choice. Go find yourself something else if you want to have a good time. 'Stay clear of the SnapChats for sure.' The Palmerston teenager wanted to remain anonymous but spoke out about his Friday night experience with the drug . The man was in intensive care for two days at Royal Darwin Hospital. He was just one of four people who were hospitalised in Darwin alone on Friday. The drug is named after the photo-messaging phone app, SnapChat, has similar properties to a notorious drug that contains bath salts. It is sold in a pink or blue form with green speckles and the app's logo imprinted on it. Police are expressing grave concern about the drug, which is causing people to behave in an erratic and irrational manner and causing aggressive and disoriented behaviour.

"By . Sarah Dean . Rexona is a popular with young people abusing aerosols in Alice Springs . One of Australia's top deodorant brands are looking into how they can reduce abuse of their aerosols after they became the favourite product for children as young as 10 to inhale in the Northern Territory. Shops in Alice Springs have removed Rexona from their shelves and placed it behind the counter, where glue is also safely stored, after it was stolen by children trying to get high. Rexona met with the Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service recently to discuss what can be done about the intoxicating hydrocarbon fumes from their product, CAYLUS manager Blair McFarland told MailOnline. The Alice Springs-based youth service saw a sniffing outbreak involving hundreds of young people in the local area over the Easter weekend. Shops in the Northern Territory town saw their supplies of Rexona depleted and youth workers found almost 200 empty cans of the product on a hill next to the town. 'The town kids showed the bush kids how to sniff and they all headed up to Billy Goat Hill that weekend,' Mr McFarland said. The majority of the kids involved were just 12-years-old. Mr McFarland has lived in Alice Springs for 30 years and previously successfully campaigned to have the abusive chemical found in petrol removed in the Northern Territory. He explained that kids stole the deodorant product from supermarkets and left the cans on the ground. Alice Springs branches of Woolworths, Coles, Mad Harrys, Eastside, Northside and Flynn Drive supermarkets at first agreed to remove the product from shelves for two weeks and have now extended that promise. Mr McFarland said 'the majority of sniffers here are aboriginal but that's because 30 per cent of the population here are indigenous'. This is a file photo of children in the outback . 'It does bad things to the nervous system. If you inhale it then it melts the fat around your nerves,' he said. 'In Alice Springs it's an ongoing problem... the majority of sniffers here are aboriginal, but that's because 30 per cent of the population here are indigenous.' The youth worker described how was in a supermarket with co-workers and noticed aerosol abusers wondering the aisles. Outbreak: The Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service found children sniffing Rexona on a hill in Alice Springs . 'They all headed up to Billy Goat Hill that weekend': Around 200 cans of aerosols were abused by young people over the Easter weekend . 'You can smell them from two or three metres off - they stink of Rexona,' he said. Mr McFarland believes education about the effect of sniffing aerosols does not work. He says the only thing that can stop the damage being done to children's brains is to remove the supply of the product - just like they removed petrol that could be abused from the Northern Territory. 'In the NT we've pretty much managed to eliminate petrol sniffing,' he said. There used to be around 500 people sniffing petrol every day in the area. However, he said 'a subset of those 500 have gone on to seek other highs'. Three young people ended up in hospital from sniffing aerosols in Alice Springs, in April 2013, and Mr McFarland warned of the 'brain damage' the product can cause. 'People seek it out if they have not other forms of drugs,' he explained. He also blamed a government reduction on youth services in the area for a rise in aerosol abuse. There is now just one patrol on the streets, Tangentyere Youth Patrol, which usually picks up 70 children a night from the streets and takes them home. 'The underlying problem is there is nothing for them to do now in Alice Springs.' The problem of aerosol abuse is not limited to the Northern Territory, Mount Isa in Queensland has also reported trouble. And it is an issue with drug abusers around the world. Among adolescents, inhalants are the second most widely used class of illicit drugs globally. More than 2 million children aged 12-17 years report using inhalants at least once in their lifetime. Despite meeting with Rexona, Mr McFarland said the company was very clear that changing their product to remove hydrocarbon fumes would be a 'difficult' thing to do. Mr McFarland said Unilver - Rexona's parent company - had also agreed to visit Mount Isa and assess the problem. A Unilever spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Unilever takes the abuse of aerosols seriously. 'Whilst new technologies may become available in the future, at present all available research that has been conducted by us and international organisations indicates that there isn’t a viable technical or reformulation solution available that will address the issue. 'We have been actively engaging with community groups, the police and government agencies on the issue and continue to explore other ways that we can help them to address solvent abuse in high risk areas. 'All of our products are clearly labelled with guidelines detailing how to use aerosols safely and carry warning and caution statements regarding the misuse of the product.'","Youth workers have met with leading brand Rexona to discuss problem .

"By . Louise Cheer . While thousands are expected to flock to Australia Zoo on July 24 to celebrate Bindi Irwin's 16th birthday, there will be one face missing from the crowd. Bindi's grandfather Bob Irwin has opted not to join in the festivities, but instead the patriarch will be in Queensland’s far north working on a crocodile conservation project. The Irwins have invited guests and the public to join in on Bindi's big day and celebrate in style with contortionist acts, rock climbing, African drumming and hula hooping workshops. And in a fitting move for Steve Irwin's daughter's party, guests have been asked to attend in an animal onesie. Scroll down for video . Bindi's (right) 16th birthday party will be held July 24 at Beerwah's Australia Zoo. She is pictured here with her mother, Terri, and brother, Robert . But more than 2,500km away, Bob Irwin will be enjoying a quieter day in Cape York – six years after rumours of a family rift erupted between the late croc hunter’s father and wife, Ninemsn reported. An Australian Zoo spokeswoman was unable to confirm if Mr Irwin had received an invitation directly from his family to attend. ‘I’m not sure why Bob is not attending,’ she told Ninemsn. Revelations that there was trouble brewing in the Irwin clan came to light when the late Steve Irwin's father revealed he was saddened he had not received a visit from his granddaughter after suffering a heart attack in 2008.

Mr Irwin resigned from his position at Australia Zoo to 'carry on Steve's work' solo after a rift with his son's widow, Terri Irwin. Bob Irwin (left) will not be attending his granddaughter's birthday bash. His son, Steve Irwin (right), died after a stingray barb pierced his chest in 2006 . But since the incident Mr Irwin did not say whether or not he had received a visit from either of his grandchildren in the past four years, but did say he kept in 'regular' contact with family members. 'I think Terri's done a great job with those children, she's had to raise them herself,' he said. 'They are well-adjusted children – they have a good background with their dad. Nobody could be more down to earth than Steve was. 'They’ve got a great future ahead of them.' After leaving Australia Zoo in Queensland’s Beerwah, Bob Irwin continues to his links with environmental conservation and is working on a plan that would allow landowners to put parts of estates up for conservation. But Mr Irwin still keeps a close eye on his grandchildren's high profile conservation efforts. 'I’m really excited about the projects they are involved in,' he said. After celebrating her 16th birthday, Bindi told Ninemsn she planned to turn her head to 'tackling the bigger issues facing our world today'. Mr Irwin's absence from celebrations comes eight years after he opened up about his rift with his late son's widow, Terri Irwin (left) pictured here with her son, Robert (centre), and Bindi at her 11th birthday . 'The non-consumptive use of wildlife and over human population tend to be topics that are not openly discussed and until we start talking about these issues, we can't create positive change,' she said. 'I am currently studying a Certificate III in Business and Tourism with Sunshine Coast Tafe, I hope to be able to use this to work alongside my mum and help manage Australia Zoo. 'I also hope to continue my film work in order to spread my message of conservation, I am looking forward to seeing what the future holds for me.' There will be more than enough Bindi to go around on July 24 with the birthday girl planning to make appearances on the day. From 12pm she will feed crocodiles live with Terri and her brother, Robert, and grab a free piece of Bindi's birthday cake as well at 3pm. After the celebrations, the 16-year-old plans to have a quiet one with her immediate family, chowing down on some Chinese food.

"By . Mike Dawes . Assistant coach Robin McBryde has revealed Wales will again consult the International Rugby Board over the performance of referee Romain Poite. The Welsh management were unhappy with how Poite handled the scrum in their first Test hiding against South Africa on Saturday. Wales had been confident of keeping on the good side of the Frenchman, having previously sought IRB clarification over Poite's decision to continually penalise and eventually yellow card Gethin Jenkins in the Six Nations loss to England at Twickenham. Disappointed: Wales are upset about the decisions of Romain Poite (right) during their heavy defeat . But they encountered further issues in the 38-16 reverse at Kings Park. 'We are seeking a bit more clarification on the scrum from (IRB referees' boss) Joel Jutge, who I will meet again this week,' said former hooker McBryde. 'I don't want to be too critical because there are a lot of things for referees to look at. It's the specifics of the technical aspects of the scrum. 'There are a couple of times when we've been penalised and we want to make sure we're seeing the same things as the referee. 'We met Romain before the game and still those decisions went against us. We just need to clarify things.' But the tourists know Poite's performance in no way influenced the outcome in Durban, where Wales were blitzed by the Springboks. And fly-half Dan Biggar admitted the Wales camp are hurting after being swept aside with ease. 'It is hugely disappointing to lose any game, but what made it worse was it felt like South Africa did not have to work particularly hard for any of their points,' he said. Dejected: The Welsh players watch on after a South African try in the 38-16 defeat on Saturday . 'They are an outstanding team, they were clinical and if you give these sides a sniff they will take it. 'But what can we do? Give up this week and take another hammering or do we roll our sleeves up, show a bit of mental toughness and togetherness and try and go out to put in a spirited performance and upset the odds. 'That is the view we are taking. That's the way to go rather than feeling sorry for ourselves and thinking it will be same again. 'We are hoping it won't be, we have dusted ourselves down, we have some very strong characters in this camp and we want to surprise the 'Boks on Saturday.' The disappointing nature of Wales' performance was only added to by the experience on show in the starting XV. Improvement: Biggar, who scored 9 of Wales' 16 points, says they must be better in the second test . Wales could call on over 700 Test caps and 10 British & Irish Lions but were miserably off the pace. It leaves head coach Warren Gatland and company with a major selection dilemma given the strong displays of youngsters like scrum-half Gareth Davies, wing Jordan Williams, prop Samson Lee and full-back Matthew Morgan on tour. Lock Luke Charteris admits there will be plenty of nerves around the camp ahead of the team announcement for the second Test. He said: 'We are over here with a big squad, because of the midweek game, so the options are there for the coaches if they want to make changes. 'After what happened on Saturday, I guess there will be quite a few nervous boys come team selection day on Thursday.'","South Africa won first test 38-16 .

"By . Richard Sears . An 85-year-old Japanese man has earned the reputation of being perhaps the world's oldest stalker after making unwanted amorous advances to an 80-year-old great grandmother. The granddad fell for the octogenarian apple of his eye when they shared a hospital room with his wife, who has since died. On his release from hospital and later entering the lonely life of an aged widower, Takeo Nitta, from Hashimoto - 250 miles from Tokyo - remembered the granny from the adjoining bed. Takeo Nitta, 85, was arrested for breaking into a 80-year-old woman's home after he left numerous messages on her answering machine wanting to 'go out' He started leaving telephone messages on her phone's answering machine to the effect of 'I'm waiting outside your house. Let's go out.' The unnamed great granny was having nothing of it and complained to the police. Nitta was warned to stay away from the woman but when he continued with the messages he was given a second warning. But, the Japan Today website reported, his behaviour escalated to the point that on May 2 he broke into the woman's house. He has now been arrested and faces charges under Japan's anti-stalking laws. It has not been revealed if he has been detained behind bars. A police spokesman said the grandfather had largely admitted that he had been making advances to the woman, who has not been named. The elderly man, from Hashimoto (pictured) in Japan, met the great grandmother in a hospital room she shared with his now deceased wife . The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported last week that the couple had met when Nitta and his now-dead wife shared a hospital room with her. The website said the number of crimes committed by the elderly in Japan is rocketing because so many people are living longer. Government figures show the number of criminals aged 65 or older in 2011 had risen six-fold in two decades. Statistics show that while most crimes by the elderly amount to shoplifting or theft, violent incidents are on the increase. Now, if the charges against Takeo Nitta are proved, police can open a new file under the heading Octogenarian Stalking.","Takeo Nitta from Japan, was arrested after breaking into the woman's home .

"By . Leesa Smith . A five-year-old boy has been hailed a hero after coming to his mother's aid when she collapsed with a serious heart condition in their home in Charlestown, Northern NSW, in November. When brave Myles found his mum, Mel Wellham, unconscious on the kitchen floor, he knew exactly what to do because he had been practicing on The Triple Zero Kids Challenge mobile phone app. His mother had been diagnosed with Vasovagal Syncope in May last year after spending four days in intensive care. The condition means she can pass out with very little warning, so she decided to prepare Myles in case another episode occurred when she was alone with her son. Scroll down for video . Myles Wellham has been hailed a hero for calling Triple-0 when his mother collapsed in November . ‘He said he was really scared but we pre-warned him because he knew how sick I was,’ Ms Wellham told the MailOnline said. ‘We said to him ""if something happens you just call because mummy’s heart will always kick back in, it’s just something that happens and mummy just needs help”.’ It clearly paid off in November with the 11-minute recording of the emergency call proving how calm and brave the little boy was despite admitting later he felt scared that his mother was unconscious on the kitchen floor. Ms Wellham was playing Lego with Myles on his bedroom floor when she started to feel unwell. ‘I gave him my phone while I went to the kitchen to get a drink,' she said. ‘I said to him “if anything happens you know what to do”.’ ‘He told me he came looking for me when I didn’t come back,’ she said. ‘He said he knew I was unconscious because of the game he plays on my phone.’ Myles knew to call the number which was saved in his mother’s phone with a picture of an ambulance on it. ‘My mum won't wake up,’ he can be heard telling Triple-0 operator Jason Brown in a recording from the day. Myles (middle) received a teddy bear and a certificate for being such a brave boy when his mother (right) passed out on the kitchen floor . The courageous boy stayed on the phone talking to Mr Brown for the entire 11 minutes until the paramedics arrived at the home. Only in kindergarten at school, Myles was able to tell Mr Brown that his mother was 40-years-old and that she was still regularly breathing by obligingly saying ‘now’ every time she took a breath. He followed every instruction given by Mr Brown including shaking her shoulder and tilting her head to check for any foreign objects. In a very sweet moment, when asked his mother’s name, Myle’s innocently replied with ‘Mummy’. Mel Wellham hopes more children can take a leaf out of her son, Myles' (pictured) book and learn from The Triple Zero Kids Challenge mobile app . Myles was presented with a NSW Ambulance Star Award, which recognises bravery shown by children facing difficult medical situations on Tuesday. Paramedic Ken Smith was at the Hillsborough Public School ceremony to hand the award over to Myles in front of his classmates. His mother is beaming with proud about Myles' heroic efforts. ‘He was amazing – he did a great job – it makes me very emotional,’ she said. ‘I really hope more kids can take a little leaf out of his book and play with the app and learn.’ ‘By calling Triple 0 people can work out where you are even with a little bit of information– miles didn’t even know our phone number and stumbled a bit on the address but he got it.’ Mel Wellham said Myles was quite overwhelmed with the attention he received at the award ceremony at Hillsborough Public School on Tuesday .","Myles Wellham, five, called Triple-0 after his mother, Mel Wellham, collapsed and was knocked unconscious in their home in November .

"By . Louise Cheer . A Sydney father is taking on department store giant Myer to stop it stocking dolls he has labelled as 'anorexic'. Mark Chenery, from Manly, was shopping at Myer at Warringah Mall with his four-year-old daughter, Sophia, when the Winx dolls caught his attention on May 1. 'We were in the toy section and I noticed this doll,' he said. 'What struck me first was their legs, they looked seriously anorexic. Mark Chenery handed over a 1,315-signature petition, with daughter Sophia and Fair Agenda director Rebecca Wilson . The super-skinny Winx dolls have outraged a Northern Beaches father who says the toys send the wrong message to healthy kids . 'I have always had an objection to Barbie dolls, which are out of proportion for kids dolls, but this took it to another level.' The Winx dolls are based on characters from Italian cartoon Winx Club set in the fictional world of Magix where three schools educate fairies, witches, wizards and warriors. Dolls are sold by retailers with prices up to $49.99. Mr Chenery was so outraged by the Magic Wings Bloom range of dolls - which are aimed at children four years old and up - that he posted a photo of one on social media where it caught the attention of campaigning group Fair Agenda. 'I posted it on Facebook and I had such a great response from family and friends, and one of them thought I should start a campaign and here we are 1,300 signatures later,' he said. 'One of the reasons I reacted so strongly was because I just know how much Sophia loves dressing up as a fairy. 'By presenting such body images to kids, it’s sending a dangerous message.'

Mr Chenery said Myer had been in contact with Fair Agenda in relation to the issue. Fair Agenda executive director Renee Carr said they threw their support behind the campaign because it was an issue members of the group were interested in. 'When we saw how much support Mark's campaign  was getting, and the kinds of messages of support being shared by eating disorder specialists, counsellors and early childhood educators; we wanted to help him deliver those messages to Myer - to make sure they saw just how important this issue was to customers,' she said. 'We also had hundreds of members come together around the country (at) our launch earlier this year to share the issues they wanted to see on the agenda, these kinds of issues attracted a lot of support.'

"By . Mark Prigg . A massive security flaw in Google's Gmail service that could have been used to extract millions of addresses has been revealed. The flaw was only found when an Israeli security researchers raised the alarm with Google. The search giant said the flaw has now been fixed - and paid the researcher for his tip. Scroll down for video . The newly revealed flaw could have been used to capture the email address of every user of Google's mail service. The exploit uses a sharing feature of Gmail that allows a user to 'delegate' access to their account. By tweaking the web address, Hafif found it was possible to reveal a random user's email address. By automating the character changes with a piece of software called DirBuster, he was able to collect 37,000 Gmail addresses in about two hours. Oren Hafif says the trick would not have exposed passwords or . otherwise allowed easy access to those accounts, but could have left . users vulnerable to spam, phishing or password-guessing attacks. 'I bruteforced a token in a Gmail URL to extract all of the email addresses hosted on Google,' he revealed in a blog this week. 'I could have done this potentially endlessly,' says Hafif, a Tel Aviv, Israel-based penetration tester for security firm Trustwave, told Wired. 'I have every reason to believe every Gmail address could have been mined.' The exploit wouldn’t have just affected personal users of Gmail, Hafif said, but also every business that uses Google to hosts its email, including even Google itself.

Hafif says it took Google another month after his report to fix the bug. The company initially declined to pay him under its bug bounty program for rewarding hackers who expose and help fix its security flaws. But it later relented and paid him $500. A Google spokesman confirms that the company patched Hafif’s email-stealing bug and paid him a reward for his help, but declined to respond to requests for further comment. Hafif also admitted he has no idea if the flaw had been used. 'We’ll never know,' he said.","Exploit took advantage of a flaw in account sharing .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Jonathan O'Callaghan . Samsung has unveiled its latest tablet, claiming it is 'setting the bar higher' with the device - its thinnest and lightest to date. The Galaxy Tab S, available from next month, features colour-enhancing technology which it claims remains clear and bright even in sunlight and ensures the 'best visual experience anywhere, any time'. And, for the first time, Galaxy users will be able to make and receive calls directly from their phone to the tablet thanks to a new ‘call forwarding’ feature. The new Galaxy Tab S 10.5inch tablet available from next month features colour-enhancing technology which it claims remains clear and bright even in sunlight. The Galaxy Tab S, which comes in two sizes, 10.5-inch and 8.4-inch, and two colours - titanium bronze or dazzling white - also allows consumers to multi-task by surfing the web, watching videos, sharing content and making calls simultaneously without having to close one application to access another.

JK Shin, chief executive of Samsung Electronics’ mobile division, said: ‘With the launch of the Galaxy Tab S, Samsung is setting the industry bar higher for the entire mobile industry. ‘It will provide consumers with a visual and entertainment experience that brings colors to life, beautifully packaged in a sleek and ultra-portable mobile device.’ Samsung called the new gadgets 'personal visual devices'. To pump up the picture quality, the company brought a wider color range to the screen, and announced HD quality for Netflix and YouTube. 'It portrays the true colors that content creators intended,' said Michael Abary, a senior vice president at Samsung Electronics America. Industry commentators suggested Samsung was aiming to take on Apple’s iPad at the upper end of the market. The prices - £449 for the 10.5 inch and £349 for the 8.4 inch - are actually higher than the iPads, although they offer expandable storage up to 128GB. In the US, both tablets will be available in July, and will cost $399 for the smaller screen and $499 for the larger one. Apple's iPad (Air pictured) currently dominates the tablet market, but Samsung will be hoping to change that. The Galaxy Tab S comes in two sizes, 10.5-inch and 8.4-inch. It will also be available in titanium bronze or dazzling white. The device lets users multi-task by surfing the web, making calls and more simultaneously . Samsung's tablets, along with nearly two thirds of the tablets on the market, run Google's Android mobile operating system. However, according to IDC, Apple remains the top tablet vendor in the world with its line of iPads. Samsung's global tablet market share rose to 22 percent in the first quarter, from 18 percent the year before. Apple's lead, meanwhile, has dwindled from 40 percent to 33 percent during the same period. Duncan Bell, operations editor at UK-based gadget magazine T3, said it should be able to compete with the iPad. He said: ‘After several years of releasing a market-confusing glut of middling-to-good tablets, the S seems to be an attempt by Samsung to say ""this time we’ve got it right"". ‘The specs leaked so far suggest a device easily able to go toe to toe with the iPad. 'However, Apple’s device is so dominant that the S will also need to be cheaper if it’s to truly compete.’ Jack Parsons, deputy editor at Android Magazine, said: ‘On first glance, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S looks like every other tablet, but at 10.5-inches it’s just a little larger than normal. 'However, it is the first Galaxy tablet to feature a Super AMOLED screen, which on this size canvas offers 288 pixels per inch - surpassing both the iPad Air and Kindle Fire HDX.’ Samsung unveiled their new Galaxy Tab 8.4 inch model (right) and 10.5inch model which aim to rival the iPad Air and Mini . Stuart Miles, founder and chief executive of technology site Pocket Lint, said the new tablet could trigger a change in strategy from Samsung. ‘The rumours surrounding the Samsung Tab S tablets suggest that we should see a range of fantastic flagship Android tablets that are finally able to compete with the iPad Air or iPad Mini on a like-for-like basis,’ he said. ‘Previously, successful Android tablets have been aimed at the mass market entry-level and that has left power users wanting more. 'That move by Samsung is likely to be welcomed by those looking for something powerful and comprehensive rather than just a device designed for surfing on the sofa.’","Korean firm Samsung reveals its Galaxy Tab S to compete with Apple's iPad .

A . section of the Great Barrier Reef is shown on the left pre-Tropical . Cyclone Ita. The right image shows the dead coral following the storm . which hit the region in April . To create the amazing underwater images, Google and the Caitlin survey developed the first ever tablet-operated underwater cameras. Complete with their own propulsion system, the images are captured through a spherical camera housing that allows continuous high-resolution, 360-degree imagery to be collected as divers steer through the reefs. On a typical run it will capture over 1000 panoramas, which are then stitched together to produce a virtual dive experience. In the aftermath of Ita, the Catlin Seaview Survey sent a team of divers into the Great Barrier Reef to see how badly the storm had impacted the area. The team had previously surveyed the area in 2012, in collaboration with Google, to create an underwater ‘street view’ of the region. Equipped with the first ever tablet-operated underwater camera, dubbed SVII, divers were able to see the dead corals, damaged reefs and destroyed sea life left in the wake of the storm. Ita was the second major storm in three years to hit the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea off the North East Australian coast. Pictured is part of the Great Barrier Reef pre-Tropical Cyclone Ita.

Acting as a breakwater, the reefs themselves seem to have reduced the power of the storm’s impact and, as a result, Cyclone Ita left those areas mostly intact. But there were more pockets of intense damage found in the shallower Ribbon Reefs on the Great Barrier Reef closer to the coastline. ‘We found areas with extensive damage next to perfectly healthy reefs that appeared virtually unaffected by the storm’ said Richard Vevers, one of the divers and director of the Catlin Seaview Survey’s Project. ‘There were differences not just between the sheltered and exposed parts of reefs, but also differing levels of damage to areas immediately adjacent to one another’.

However, we do not have the same control over storms and cyclones. ‘Ensuring that coral can bounce back from these disturbances is at the heart of the matter. The more we reduce other stressors on the reef, the better the chance that coral can bounce back. ‘Given the steep decline of coral on the reef, it’s clear we have a lot of work to do.’ The Ribbon Reef region of the Great Barrier Reef (pictured) suffered most from the impact of tropical storm Ita.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . True&Co collected information about the shape of 500,000 women's breasts to create a range of bras (pictured) designed to fit different shaped bodies . Shopping for a comfortable bra can sometimes prove a surprisingly complicated and frustrating ordeal. But now one company claims to have created a collection of bras that fit differently shaped women perfectly - based on information collected from over 500,000 females. Over two years, True&Co used seven million different data points to analyse the shape of all these women. And they discovered a staggering 6,000 different breast shapes. Data scientists in San Francisco trawled through the information to create a ‘Uniform’ line of underwear that promises to fit perfectly, Tech Crunch reported. The company launched in 2012 as an online fitting room that let customers find a suitable bra using an online quiz, which includes a clever algorithm. The method was developed by Michelle Lam and Aarthi Ramamurthy and uses information given by a customer in a questionnaire to determine her shape and what kind of bra she should be wearing. Now that the company has been trading for two years, it has built up a considerable amount of data which has allowed it to personalise bras further and create a colour-coded system called True Spectrum, which looks a little like a paint chart. ‘You would not believe the amount of data our system has to deal with in real time. It knocks us on our butt sometimes,’ chief executive Michelle Lam said.

There are eight different categories on the colour wheel, which are based on the size, shape and curvature of breasts. ‘Citrine’ is the most common shape, with around 28 per cent of women having full and round breasts. Lam said that curvature is the most important feature in trying to build a comfortable bra, but it is often overlooked by retailers. True & Co launched two years ago and aims to find the perfect bras for its customers by using a unique algorithm. Different shapes are pictured . She . explained that if women have a flat sternum, underwiring in bras can . cause pain, regardless of how well the rest of the bra fits. The . duo are still working on perfecting the algorithm, and admitted that . their bras for ‘Mulberry’ type women do not fit as well as they might. Lam . thinks that as more women take the company’s online quiz, their product . line will diversify and women with more unusual proportions will be . able to buy a bra that really fits them. ‘This . is just the beginning of the future of shopping. True&Co has only . just scratched the surface on its goal to deliver on the perfect fit,’ she said. A Japanese lingerie company has created a concept bra that claims to be able to sense when a woman is in love. Ravijour recently engineered a concept bra that only undoes when ‘true love’ is detected using a built-in heart monitor, that syncs with a smartphone app. The bra is not currently on sale and there is no indication as to whether it will be made, but the prototype has a front clasp with a sensor and a light that glows pink if the wearer is in love with a person nearby. In a promotional video, the sensor monitors the smart bra wearer’s heart rate and transmits the data in realtime to an iPhone app using a Bluetooth connection. An app seemingly processes the data – measuring heart rate elevation using a specially built algorithm as well as pre-set data - and only when a woman’s heart rate is suitably elevated and she is in love does the bra catch open. While some would-be wearers might worry that any excitement might cause their underwear to ping off, the creators of the bra say that the catch will only be released when a woman is in love so that her Adrenal Medulla (part of the adrenal gland) secretes the hormone Catecholamine, which increases her heart rate.

"By . Jilly Johnson . The last time I squeezed myself into a cut-out swimming costume was in 1970. I was 16, at a beach party in Cornwall. Of course, back then I had an athletic, streamlined body — far superior to what you see today. The swimsuit was black, shiny, with gold hoops that barely held it together at the sides. There was also a slash sliced out of the front, exposing most of my youthful decolletage. I looked as slick as an otter but barely dared to move in case of a wardrobe malfunction. After a day of holding my breath, I resolved to stick to my usual bikinis. Far easier  and less nerve-racking. This summer, though, cut-out costumes are back with a vengeance in almost every High Street shop, including traditionally more staid stores such as Debenhams and John Lewis. And unlike the precarious costumes of my youth, many claim to be secure as well as sexy, designed to bridge the gap between a bikini and a swimsuit. So could this new breed of cut-out cossies really be the solution for those 60-somethings, like me, whose bikini days are behind them but who still want to look good on the beach? Matthew Williamson at Debenhams, £31.60, debenhams.co.uk . My, this looked terrifying — but once it was on, I loved it. The low neckline was rescued by a clever clasp, which held me all in but still looked marvellously racy. The cups also have removable padding — great if, like me, you have a generous bust.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Will the next amazing technology to explore the solar system and beyond be an advanced telescope, a high-speed mission to Neptune, or something else entirely? With that question in mind, Nasa has selected 12 advanced proposals for further study in the first phase of its 2014 Nasa Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) programme. The goal of NIAC is to turn science fiction into science fact through pioneering technology development - and the ideas will now be given funding to try and bring them to fruition. Scroll down for video . Nasa has revealed 12 concepts for future space travel and cosmic science as part of its Nasa Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) programme. This includes a proposal to snag an asteroid with a net to prep it for further study (illustration shown) The selected proposals cover a wide range of imaginative concepts, including a submarine to explore the methane lakes of Titan and a concept to safely capture a tumbling asteroid. It is hoped the seedling investments may provide the breakthrough technologies needed to support Nasa’s plans for exploration beyond low-Earth orbit, into deep space, and even on to Mars. These initial 12 proposals will be studied for nine months before Nasa then selects which ideas to study for a further two years. 'The latest NIAC selections include a number of exciting concepts for planetary exploration,' said Michael Gazarik, NASA's associate administrator for the Space Technology Mission Directorate in Washington. 'We are working with innovators around the nation to transform the future of aerospace, while also focusing our investments on concepts to address challenges of current interests both in space and here on Earth.' The proposals range from exploration concepts for use within our solar system to new techniques to advance existing experimental technologies. Illustrated here is a proposal to send an autonomous submarine into Titan's largest sea, Kraken Mare, to see what is 'underwater' Nasa's Space Technology Mission Directorate chose this year's proposals based on their potential to transform future aerospace missions. All of them plan to do this by enabling either entirely new missions or breakthroughs in future aerospace capabilities that could accelerate progress toward Nasa's goals. NIAC Phase I awards are approximately £60,000 ($100,000), providing awardees the funding needed to conduct a nine-month initial definition and analysis study of their concepts. If the basic feasibility studies are successful, proposers can apply for Phase II awards, which provide up to £300,000 ($500,000) for two more years of concept development. Titan Submarine: Exploring the Depths of KrakenA . proposal for a submarine to explore Titan’s largest northern sea, . Kraken Mare. The craft would autonomously carry out detailed scientific . investigations under the surface of the methane sea. Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid Transit System (Herts)A propellant-less propulsion concept for deep space . missions. Herts is like an electric solar sail - it is an array of . wires extending out up to 20 miles (30km) from a rotating . spacecraft that would gather energy from the sun. It would be capable of . reaching speeds more than 430 miles (700km) per second - and at top speed could . travel from the sun to Neptune in a year.

This would be done by firing a ‘harpoon’ with a tether attached that would reel the spacecraft in, like a sort of cosmic fishing rod (illustration below). One of the most interesting proposals is the Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid Transit System (Herts), illustrated here. This would use electrically biased wires to harness the energy of the sun and accelerate to speeds of more than 430 miles (700 kilometres) a second, enough to travel from the sun to neptune in just a year . 'The 2014 NIAC Phase I candidates were outstanding, which made final selections decisions particularly difficult,' said NIAC Program Executive Jay Falker. 'So we considered various kinds of potential benefit and risk, and developed this portfolio to really push boundaries and explore new approaches, which is what makes NIAC unique.' The visionary, long-term concepts for technological advancements were assessed based on their potential value to future agency space missions and operational needs. The projects are chosen through a peer-review process that evaluates their potential, technical approach, as well as benefits, for study in a timely manner. But although many of the concepts are promising they are only that, concepts, and are still many years from implementation.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A team of scientists at Columbia University claim hybrid smart TVs that blur the line between televisions and the internet are vulnerable to a simple hack. Coined the ‘red-button attack’ - named after the red button used on modern smart TV remotes to access additional content - the flaw can be exploited with just a $250 (£150) transmitter. In just minutes, someone using a smart TV could find their various internet accounts sending spam, printing coupons and writing fake reviews without their knowledge. Hackers could, in theory, also use these accounts to harvest personal information. Scroll down for video . Scientists at Columbia University have revealed how modern hyrbrid smart TVs (stock image shown) are vulnerable to an attack that was not previously known. Dubbed the 'red button attack', hackers could hijack broadcasts to access a viewer's various connected internet accounts, including Facebook . Yossi Oren and Angelos Keromytis from the Network Security Lab have outlined their research in a paper set to be released later this year. The hack is apparently remarkably easy to perform. Experts in London recently proved it's possible to use drones to steal data. They modified an aircraft capable of tapping into a phone's Wi-Fi settings. Once it had access, it was able to read and steal personal information. Called Snoopy, the drone takes advantage of smartphones that actively search for networks. From this it can also see networks those devices have accessed in the past. During tests, hackers exposed credit card information and passwords. According to Forbes, it would occur while someone is watching TV and would be over in just 12 minutes. The attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in Hybrid Broadcast-Broadband Television (HbbTV). This ‘allows broadcast streams to include embedded HTML content which is rendered by the television,’ the researchers wrote in their paper. ‘This system is already in very wide deployment in Europe, and has recently been adopted as part of the American digital television standard.’ The hacker would then, in essence, take over the channel a viewer was watching for a short amount of time. This would be done by using a simple amplifier, costing as little as £150 ($250) on a rooftop to hijack networks across an area of 0.5 square miles (1.4 square kilometres). Alternatively, a transmitter could also be placed on a drone, which could hover outside the windows of houses to hijack TVs. In doing so, the hacker would have access to any websites the viewer was logged into on their smart TV. This could range from getting access to their Facebook accounts to writing fake reviews on websites for products. The attack could be carried out by attaching a small and cheap transmitter to a drone (stock image shown) and then hovering outside a victim's window. The attackers could also set up a transmitter on a roof to potentially hijack tens of thousands of TVs across an entire city . HbbTVs broadcasts can be hijacked because they are not linked to a web server, which also makes attacks virtually untraceable. ‘This enables a large-scale exploitation technique with a localised geographical footprint based on radio frequency (RF) injection,’ the researchers continue. This ‘requires a minimal budget and infrastructure and is remarkably difficult to detect.’ ‘In a dense urban area, an attacker with a budget of about $450 (£270) can target more than 20,000 devices in a single attack.’ There are a number of possible solutions. The most drastic includes cutting all internet access to smart TVs. Alternatively, broadcasters could begin to integrate smart TVs into a network that could see if they are being hijacked by monitoring for high spikes in signal strength. Perhaps the most simple solution, though, would be to have a confirmation box pop-up on screen when a viewer’s smart TV is trying to open an app such as Facebook. This, however, would detract from the current seamless and smooth . integration between TV and internet favoured by companies at the moment. 'This potential attack method isn't related specifically to the use of the red button on a TV remote specifically, but to any interaction with a smart TV,' says David Emm, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab in Russia. 'Such an attack would effectively be a ""man in the middle"" attack, with hackers placing themselves between the consumer and the broadcaster and injecting their own, bogus information into the broadcast stream - for example, fake adverts and other content. 'After hacking the radio signal, hackers ""become the broadcaster"" and even have the ability to hack into anything sent or received by the consumer. 'One problem with such an attack is that, since it would involve hacking into the radio signal through the use of an antenna, it would be difficult to track down the attackers. 'It’s reminiscent of someone sniffing the traffic on a public Wi-Fi hotspot or setting up a fake one. 'Providers need to ensure they are considering such security implications of new technology. 'When new technologies emerge, the focus tends to be on the positive benefits - how the technology will make people's lives easier - not enough focus is placed on the risks inherent in the use of the latest technology. 'Smart fridges, garage doors, car entertainment systems and electricity meters are all examples of new technology that all benefit from Internet connectivity, but the extension of technology in this way also brings the possibility of more cyber-attacks.'","Researchers at Columbia University claim smart TVs can be hacked .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . After years of examinations, theories and controversy, Leicester Cathedral officials have unveiled the final design for the tomb in which Richard III’s remains will be reburied next year. They also confirmed that the coffin that will hold the 15th century ruler will be made by one of his sister’s direct descendants. The remains of Richard III were . discovered under a car park in Leicester city centre in 2012, but a decision on his final resting place has only now been decided after some controversy. This handout issued by the Diocese of Leicester shows the final design for the tomb in which Richard III's remains will be reinterred next year. Leicester Cathedral also confirmed that the coffin set to be used to rebury the 15th century ruler will be made by one of his sister's direct descendants . Dean of Leicester David Monteith told a . news conference in the city that the cost of the reburial project had . been finalised at around £2.5 million ($4.25 million). The approved tomb, which has been accepted by the Cathedral Fabrics Commission for England, features a large block of Swaledale stone with a deeply incised cross. This sits above a dark plinth of dark Kilkenny stone, carved with King Richard’s name, dates, motto and coat of arms. Unveiling images of the King’s final resting place, the Dean of Leicester said: 'This is a tomb which reflects the era in which it is designed as well as the solemn purpose for which it is commissioned. Discovered: The remains of Richard III (pictured) were discovered by archaeologists in a council car park in Leicester in 2012. There had been heated discussions as to where the king was to be buried before the high court confirmed he would be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral . 'To do anything else would be a pastiche of a medieval tomb and would ignore the fact he is being reburied in the 21st century.' The coffin will be built by cabinet-maker Michael Ibsen, a known direct descendent of Richard III’s sister, Anne. Of the total project budget of £2.5 million ($4.25 million) the Diocese of Leicester will contribute £500,000 ($850,000) for central costs, fees, contingency and initial preparation of the Cathedral. Private donations are also being sought for extensive capital works on the cathedral necessary as part of the re-burial project. Richard III will be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral (pictured) after judges said it was time to give him a 'dignified burial'. The site is just streets away from the car park where his remains were found . 'We are now in a position to move forward with absolute certainty,’ the Dean added. 'We recognise that we are carrying out this responsibility on behalf of the entire nation and that the eyes of the world will be on Leicester at this unprecedented time. 'Our ambition for the scale of the re-interment events therefore reflects the importance of this momentous occasion.' Richard III, whose remains were discovered under a car park in Leicester city centre in 2012, was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. The approved tomb, which has been accepted by the Cathedral Fabrics Commission for England, features a large block of Swaledale stone with a deeply incised cross, above a dark plinth of dark Kilkenny stone, carved with King Richard's name, dates, motto and coat of arms (illustration shown) Richard III's has also been given a funeral crown (pictured) which was commissioned by an historian who was involved in the dig that discovered Richard III's remains. The crown is gold plated with enamelled white roses. There are rubies and sapphires at the centre of the roses representing the livery colours of the house of York . Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city, saying he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'. But . the High Court told the claimaints, who were part of the Plantagenet . Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling condemned the Alliance legal action last month, saying it had 'taken up so much time and money'. Grayling said: 'I have been very clear . from the start that the decision to grant an exhumation licence for . Richard III was taken correctly and in line with the law. 'I am pleased the court has reached the same conclusion and comprehensively rejected all of the claimant’s arguments.' Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. Scientists found he had a curved spine and was riddled with roundworm . During the War of the Roses, . Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in . 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the . rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward . V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a . campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth . Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He . was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes . disappeared. Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any . threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It . has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, . although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones . found in the Leicester car park last year. Last . year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after . finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard . III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were . infected with roundworm during his life.

"By . Mark Prigg . Google is preparing to launch a fitness service to keep track of health and exercise data. Called Google Fit, it is expected to be revealed at the search giant's developer conference later this month. It is expected to offer almost identical features to Apple's HealthKit product, launched earlier this month. Google's service is expected to combine information from health apps and personal fitness devices . Apple's senior vice-president of software engineering Craig Federighi spoke about an app that could send information to your family doctor . Google's service that will combine information from health apps and personal fitness devices, in another competitive move against Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co, Forbes reported. The new service, to be called Google Fit, will make its debut at the Internet company's developer conference later this month, Forbes said on Thursday, citing anonymous sources. It is not clear if Google Fit will be integrated into Android, Google's mobile operating system, or offered as a standalone app, the report said. Google declined to comment on the report. Health data could become the next big battleground among tech companies as a new generation of wearable electronic gadgets allow users to measure heart rates, sleep patterns and exercise activities. Last week Apple announced 'Healthkit,' which will pull together data such as blood pressure and weight now collected by a growing number of healthcare apps on the iPhone or iPad. It means iPhone users will soon be able to have their blood pressure, temperature and pulse monitored by their mobile – and the results sent direct to their GP. It will rely on additional equipment, such as a wrist-strap  heart monitor that connects wirelessly to the iPhone. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said a key feature of the app was its ability to send an automatic alert to a doctor if vital signs approach dangerous levels. Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. Ram Fish, Vice President of Digital Health for Samsung is pictured displaying the Simband . Samsung's wristband can monitor: . heart rateblood flowrespirationgalvanic skin responsehydrationgas and glucose concentrations bloodsubstances carried in the surrounding air . In May, Samsung also launched a health platform for third-party app developers, along with a reference design for a tracking wristband. 'There is a tremendous opportunity at the intersection of health and technology,' said Young Sohn, president and chief strategy officer for Samsung Electronics’ Device Solutions. 'This is the single greatest opportunity of our generation. 'This is a big enough challenge—we cannot do it alone, we have to do it with partners.' Samsung expects to make 'beta' test versions of its Simband wristband and SAMI data service later this year. It has been partnering with scientists from the University of California, San Francisco and other institutions to test its devices and offer suggestions. The system would also include ways to exchange and analyze data. Samsung believes that could help detect heart problems and other medical conditions sooner.","App expected to combine information from health apps and personal fitness devices .

"By . Ryan Parry In Hailey, Idaho . The home town celebration for Sgt Bowe Bergdahl may have been cancelled amid the furor of the POW's controversial release but there is one person looking forward to his return to Hailey, Idaho, at least. Actor Dawson Howard was pictured posing next to a ‘Bowe is Coming Home’ sign he helped make - but was last year found guilty of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl. The 33-year-old registered sex offender, . who worked with Bergdahl at a restaurant in Hailey, was accused of rape . and lewd conduct in connection with the teenager in 2011. Scroll down for video . Busted: While Bowe Bergdahl was in captivity, pal avoided serving time after pleading guilty to a felony . A town divided: The town of Hailey is relieved that Bowe Bergdahl is coming home, but just how he should be welcomed became a huge controversy. In the end, the mayor decided to cancel a planned public celebration . But after making a plea deal with prosecutors the two sex crimes were dropped and Howard agreed to plead guilty to a single felony offense of sexual abuse of a child under 16. Blaine County Sheriff Gene Ramsey said Howard's relationship with the young girl dated back to 2008, when he was a camp counselor and the victim was enrolled in a local drama camp at St. Thomas Playhouse. The sheriff said Howard began an 'online relationship' with the girl in July 2011 and that he had sex with her about a month later. 'On August . 20, he allegedly picked up the 14-year-old girl at a parking lot in Sun . Valley and drove her to a house in Ketchum where he was house-sitting,' Ramsey said. At . a sentencing hearing at Blaine County 5th District Court in October . last year, Judge Robert J. Elgee gave Howard a six-year suspended prison . sentence. Hanging tough: Bowe, who worked in a local restaurant with Howard, went paragliding in Sun Valley, a few miles north of Hailey, in 2005. He was fit as a fiddle then . He also imposed a $1,000 fine and ordered a $5,000 civil penalty to be paid to the victim. At sentencing, Hailey attorney Douglas Werth, assigned as public defender, noted that Howard had no prior criminal history.  'He . has accepted that what he did was wrong. He’s admitted the sexual . contact he had with this girl and he’s willing to participate in . sex-offender treatment.' Sgt. Bergdahl, meanwhile, is still being debriefed about his ordeal in . Germany. Unlike his relatively fit appearance on the day of his release, . CBS . reports that in the proof-of-life video sent to the US  last January . the POW stuttered when he spoke, held his arm in such a way that it . looked injured and appeared thin. Photos obtained by MailOnline prior to his captivity show him to be a robust athlete involved in many pursuits. Bergdah's release has been shrouded in controversy as accusations of his defection from his unit continue to mar his return. En garde: Besides being a talented ballet dancer, Bowe fenced with the Sun Valley Swords Club . Twinkle toes: Bowe was a serious student of the ballet before he left  for the Army. He took lessons at the Sun Valley Ballet School . A public welcome home celebration featuring Grammy-winning singer Carole King in honor of freed POW Bowe Bergdahl in the tiny town of Hailey, Idaho was abruptly cancelled this week.The official reason given was a concern for public safety, but MailOnline learned that it was not the only reason the party was scrubbed. Today's decision follows a row that erupted in Hailey between Mayor Fritz Haemmerle and US Army Platoon Commander Jonathan Kennedy, who lives in Hailey. In an email to Mayor Haemmerle - seen by MailOnline - former US Army platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy said: ‘If Individual members of the community wish to hold sedate, private celebrations to commemorate Bowe Bergdahl's homecoming, they are of course free and welcome to do so. It would be, however, a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony, financed by public money, were to be held. Howard, however.  was . thrilled when he heard of Bergdahl’s release on Saturday and has been . seen out on Main Street in Hailey discussing the good news. He even helped make signs and banners outside local shops to celebrate the soldier's return. He . told reporters he used to work with Bergdahl in a local restaurant in . Hailey years ago adding: 'I'm happy to hear he was freed.' Up until his arrest Howard was known in Hailey and wider Wood River Valley area for having appeared in numerous theatrical and musical productions. He had a leading role in a nexStage Theatre production of the Shakespeare comedy “Twelfth Night” and it’s believed he also knew Bergdahl through his dancing at Sun Valley Ballet School.","Hailey townies Bowe Bergdahl and Dawson Howard worked together at the local coffee shop before Bowe went into the Army .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . Police have released an image of a distinctive tattoo in an effort to identity a man whose dismembered body was found partially encased in cement inside a garage behind a Detroit home. The cut-up corpse was found May 30 by a neighbor who noticed an overwhelming foul odor and called police. An officer discovered some of the parts, which were believed to be from one entire body, after opening one of several plastic containers inside the garage. Mystery: Detroit police have released this image of the tattoo in an attempt to identify the victim, who body parts were found encased in cement . Neighbor Terrence Hayes, who smelled the body parts, told WJBK of his experience on May 30. 'Smelled like a dead rat – a smell you don’t want to smell, like something dead. Real dead,' he said. 'I just saw the foot and then that’s it.' Police said in a statement Monday that the victim had a tattoo on his forearm reading, 'R.I.P. Deisha,' with '8/23/81-4/7/09' underneath. Mary Mazur, Director of Communications . for the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office, told MailOnline in a . phone interview that a forensic anthropologist was able to pull a soft . tissue sample from the victim and recover the body parts from the . cement. 'One crate . contained the head and the torso, which was completely intact,' she . said. 'The other crate contained the arms, legs, feet and hands.' Recovered: A spokesman from the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office, the building of which is pictured, has said multiple body parts were recovered . Mazur said a previous fingerprint test run against data from both local and state police was unsuccessful because of decomposition. Mazur said the findings suggested 'some level of dismemberment,' and that the cause of death has not yet been determined.
