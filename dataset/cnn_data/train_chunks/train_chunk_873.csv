"By . Jill Reilly . Andrew Bell, 50, told a sixth-form student he was in love with her . A history teacher who told a sixth-form student he was in love with her was sacked for gross misconduct. Andrew Bell, 50, pursued her for nine months, and sent her unwelcome text messages and emails, a conduct panel heard. He now faces a teaching ban. Mr Bell, a history and archaeology teacher, was sacked when bosses at Colchester Sixth Form College, Essex, found out he had repeatedly contacted the girl for nine months. He appeared before a National College for Teaching & Leadership conduct panel hearing this week and was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct. The panel heard Mr Bell had led a school trip to Paris, which the student had attended in March 2012. After the trip she became distant from him in her lessons and two months later he agreed to her mother's request not to see her on a one-to-one basis. However, over the coming months he sent five e-mails and texts, including one which said he was in love with her. Her mother saw one of the texts, which read: '’I’m in Paris again and I’m remembering how much I was in love with you. 'I’m sorry I couldn’t show it then, I wont hassle you anymore but I just wanted to finally tell you what I wanted to say for so long.....x andy’. Her mother contacted the college, on North Hill, Colchester, and Mr Bell was suspended. Mr Bell told the hearing the word 'love' had been used informally. He admitted the facts of the case but denied they amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The panel found the most serious text message, sent in March last year, used the words: 'I was in love with you'. It said: 'In the light of the final text, the preceding contacts can only be seen as unwelcome and crossing a professional boundary. Mr Bell, a history and archaeology teacher, was sacked when bosses at Colchester Sixth Form College, Essex, found out he had repeatedly contacted the girl for nine months (file photo) 'The panel were concerned such an experienced teacher failed to follow well understood safeguarding policies when he became concerned about his relationship with the student.' The panel noted Mr Bell had repeatedly displayed poor professional judgement. Mr Bell also admitted being absent for one night of another trip to Berlin and allowing students to drink more than was agreed on the Paris trip. The panel said these were 'isolated errors in judgement' that did not amount to unacceptable professional conduct. It will announce the sanctions on his conduct, which could include a ban, next week. Mr Bell was also found guilty of gross misconduct by the college’s disciplinary hearing in May last year. A spokesman for the college said: 'In the investigatory and disciplinary processes we liaised closely with Essex County Council’s safeguarding and personnel departments. 'We were advised the issues related to professional misconduct and were not criminal behaviour and we were not required to report this matter to the police. 'The recent findings of the National College for Teaching & Leadership are in line with the internal findings.'","Andrew Bell, 50, pursued the sixth form pupil for nine months .

Walmart apologised for the photo and said the item was sold by one of the company's online marketplace sellers and not directly by Walmart. 'We were horrified to see that this item was on our site. We sincerely apologize, and worked quickly to remove it,' a statement from Walmart read reported ABC News. 'The item was sold through a third-party seller on our marketplace. 'We have shared our disappointment with them and have learned they are removing the publisher of this item entirely from inventory.' Prisoners on a death march from Dachau move towards the south along the Noerdliche Muenchner Street in Gruenwald . Sears pulled the poster from its website, though a description remained that called the poster a 'generic Gate with inscription Arbeit Macht Frei, Dachau Concentration Camp, Dachau, Upper Bavaria, Bavaria, Germany Poster Print by Pa.' Sears said this in a statement: 'The item, which was listed by an independent third-party on Sears Marketplace, violates our guidelines and was immediately removed.' Amazon did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment. The events that unfolded in Dachau continue to haunt the world years after it first opened its gates on March 22, 1933. More than 188,000 political prisoners, Jews and other groups persecuted by the Nazis were kept in Dachau, which was used as a labor camp and place where medical experiments took place. In a final act of cruelty, guards at the camp forced more than 7,000 prisoners, most of them Jewish, on a death march as American troops drew close in April 1945. Many of the starved and weak prisoners who struggled to keep up were shot dead. Those who survived were liberated by the Allies in May . In June auctioneers were condemned by Jewish leaders after selling off a haul of Nazi memorabilia in Adelaide. About 20 items from the First and Second World War went under the hammer . and were sold to military enthusiasts willing to fork out between $300 . and $700 for a slice of Third Reich history. But Jewish Community Council of South . Australia president Norman Schueler said auction house Mason Gray . Strange should have known better than to remind survivors of the . Holocaust and their families of the horrific time. Last year an investigation by the Daily Mail revealed how online auction site eBay was profiting from the . sickening trade in Holocaust relics. It . caused global outrage and led to an apology from eBay, which removed 30 . items from sale – including the uniform – and pledged to make a £25,000 . donation to charity.","The image was on sale in the home decoration category .

"By . Jill Reilly . Michael McDonagh and his family caused drunken chaos on a flight to Stansted Airport from a funeral in Dublin . An Irish family downed cans of Guinness, urinated on the floor and and fell into as passenger on the return flight from a wake in Dublin. The McDonagh family were on a Ryanair flight to London Stansted when they caused drunken chaos on board, Highbury Magistrates Court heard. Father-of-two Michael McDonagh, 28, and his family produced their own cans of Guinness after they boarded and several were confiscated by flight attendants. He and ten of his traveller relatives were in ‘high spirits’ at the departure lounge and caused numerous problems for staff and other passengers. One member of the McDonagh clan tumbled into another passenger when he ran down the aisle of the packed aircraft. Another went to the use the toilet but succeeded only in urinating all over the floor. Prosecutor Penny Ferguson said: ‘This occurred on 13 March this year. ‘The defendant and a number of his family members were on a Ryanair flight to London (Stansted) which landed at around 6pm. ‘There were a number of problems due to noisy behaviour. ‘The group refused to stay seated and got up, were singing and drinking cans of Guinness. ‘They were causing a nuisance.’ At one stage the family were causing such a disturbance that the pilot ordered the rest of the passengers to fasten their safety belts. Michael McDonagh, an out-of-work mechanic, had stood shouting in the middle of the aircraft before he dashed down the aisle and hitting a woman passenger. ‘The defendant was moving at speed,’ said Miss Ferguson.

"By . Allan Hall . Doctors inadvertently made Michael Schumacher's condition worse by not putting him on artificial respiration straightaway after his skiing accident, a German magazine claimed today. Stern claims the Formula One star's supreme fitness could have worked against him in making medics think he was not as gravely hurt as he actually was. His condition dramatically worsened in . the first few minutes of being airborne in the rescue helicopter, necessitating a stopover in . Moutiers - where an opening was cut into his trachea for the respirator . pipe - thus tripling the flight time from Meribel to Grenoble to well . over one hour. Citing a medical source, the magazine said: . 'Had the airborne rescuers arrived at the scene minutes later they would . have recognised that it was a matter of life and death. 'But they put Schumacher into the helicopter without artificial respiration.' Schumacher (pictured with wife Corinna) fell and cracked his head while skiing in Meribel in December . He currently lies at the University of Grenoble Hospital in - a delay which the magazine said was critical to his health. The claims come as the racing driver's devoted wife Corinna was handed the broken ski-helmet he wore on the day he suffered catastrophic brain injuries. It was given back to the family by French justice authorities on Wednesday after they declared their official investigation into the 45-year-old's accident on December 29 last year was closed. The prosecutor in the town of Albertville, charged with the probe into Michael's low-speed ski accident, declared there was no third party involvement in the tumble which saw the seven times world Formula One champion smash his head on to rocks. 'Too optimistic': A German magazine claims doctors made Michael Schumacher's condition worse because they misdiagnosed the severity of his injuries which meant he didn't go straight to a specialist unit . Consequently the helmet - which . smashed into three pieces when he plunged on to a rock hidden in snow on . the slopes of the French Alpine resort of Meribel - has been returned . to his family. The helmet-mounted camera he had on together with the rented skis he used at the time of the accident were also returned. Schumacher, who spent his 110th day in an artificial coma on Thursday, is the subject of a fierce medical debate being played out in the German media about whether vital time was lost in getting him to the right hospital after his crash. FOCUS magazine asked on its website today: 'So what happened in the time between Méribel and Grenoble?' Waiting: The Grenoble University Hospital, where Schumacher has been in an induced coma for three months . Stern added: 'If it is true, that Schumacher could have been ventilated sooner and operated on sooner, the consequences are potentially dramatic. 'The outlook for such patients improves dramatically when doctors operate within the first hour after the accident — a rule spread among medical professionals. 'Time will only tell if that was also true in the case of Schumacher.' So far, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has not commented on the new allegations. His management continues to insist that he shows small signs of life, but there is no indication when he will - if ever - fully come around from the coma. A spokesman for Meribel Town hall said there would be 'no comment' on the on-going allegations about the Schumacher case. The French high mountain police referred all calls to the local prefecture, where a spokesman said: 'The matter remains the subject of investigation.' He, too, said there would be no comment. There was no comment from any of the medics who are treating Schumacher either.","Stern claims his supreme fitness made medics misjudge severity of illness .

"By . Allan Hall . Formula One legend Michael Schumacher lost vital time in the hours following his ski accident because doctors at the scene made crucial mistakes, it was claimed by a German magazine today. The detour his rescue helicopter made from Meribel where he fell to a local hospital allegedly made his condition worse because the trip to a specialist unit that would have taken 20 minutes in a direct flight ended up taking an hour. Stern magazine in Germany claimed the decision to take Schumacher, 45, to a clinic at Moutiers rather than straight away to the University of Grenoble Hospital - where he is currently in his 109th day of a medically induced coma - was a huge mistake. Stern claims to have a medical source in France for its page one exclusive tomorrow. The claims are similar to those made by former Formula One doctor Gary Hartstein a fortnight ago. 'Too optimistic': A German magazine claims doctors made Michael Schumacher's condition worse because they misdiagnosed the severity of his injuries which meant he didn't go straight to a specialist unit . It claimed that doctors at the scene . misdiagnosed the severity of the injuries of the motor racing giant. They were too 'optimistic,' said the magazine. This was perhaps because Schumacher was conscious and seemed to be in full control of his senses while he was on the slope where he smashed his head on to rocks. But later that night he underwent two emergency operations and, at one stage, doctors did not think he would last until morning. 'Lost time always further increases the risk for the patient in such cases,' said the magazine in a lengthy report about the accident he suffered on a ski-run on December 29 and its immediate aftermath. 'It is recognised in medical research that every minute counts in such a serious brain injury until the proper care can be accessed and for him that is the specialised section of the Grenoble clinic.' It said the time taken to land in . Moutiers to get the Formula One star intubated for a ventilator 'made . Schumacher`s condition rapidly worsen' during the next flight to . Grenoble and that such a procedure should have been carried out before . the helicopter lifted off from the slopes. Schumacher (pictured with wife Corinna) fell and cracked his head while skiing in Meribel in December . It . said his condition 'dramatically and rapidly' deteriorated on this . second flight, requiring more time at Grenoble for computer scans and . surgery than would otherwise have been the case. The Moutiers hospital says he became comatose on the flight and needed to be treated for the onward journey. The claims are similar to one made by Mr Hartstein, the former chief doctor of Formula One, who claimed Schumacher lost vital hours because he was airlifted to the 'wrong' hospital. He said earlier this month that he believes this decision could have majorly affected his chances of recovery. He told The Sun: 'You do not take patients with a suspected head injury to hospitals that do not have neuro-surgical capability.' Hartstein, who was F1 sport's chief doctor between 2005 and 2012, said he had learned of 'serious lapses of judgement' in Schumacher's care and that the world is witnessing the long goodbye of motorsport's legendary figure. Waiting: The Grenoble University Hospital, where Schumacher has been in an induced coma for three months . Hartstein says he had heard from 'usually . impeccable sources' to say that these lapses 'could, and almost . certainly did, worsen the outcome in Michael's case.' Stern also called into question the safety of helmets such as that used by Schumacher which split in two when he hit the hidden rock in snow on the fateful day of the accident. 'For accidents like this the protection of commercially available ski helmets is not sufficient by far', it said. 'Many winter sports enthusiasts weigh in on false security - but a fall from a height of 75 cm can destroy a helmet that accords with European specifications.' At the weekend, Sabine Kehm, his manager, told a German TV programme of the 'small steps' he is allegedly showing as doctors battle to bring him around from the coma. But halfway through his fourth month in such a state, there are many medical experts in the world who think that Schumacher may be in a 'waking coma' where he can open his eyes but do nothing else. The French high mountain police referred all calls to the local prefecture, where a spokesman said: 'The matter remains the subject of investigation, and it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage.'

"By . Allan Hall . A German furniture store is offering £15 gift vouchers to customers who return mugs that the company sold decorated with roses and poems - next to the photograph of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The sale of anything featuring the former Fuehrer is strictly forbidden in modern-day Germany and can be punishable with severe fines. But the Hitler-decorated mugs somehow crept into the stock of the Zurbrueggen home improvement store in the city of Bielefeld - which remains a base for the British army in Germany to this day. Scroll down for video . Error: The Third Reich-era Hitler stamp is printed between petals and poetry on the mug's decoration, and is not immediately obvious. The store is now offering a gift voucher to any customer who returns one of the mug . The Hitler decoration on the mugs - which were made in China - came in the form of an old 30 pfennig stamp with a swastika postmark over it. It is not immediately obvious what is depicted on the stamp, although Hitler is unmistakable under closer scrutiny. 'I thought I wasn’t seeing too well when . I saw I had Hitler sitting down to breakfast with me,' said Agner . Teewald, who bought one of the mugs for her morning coffee at her home . in nearby Herford. Banned: The sale of anything featuring Hitler is strictly forbidden in modern Germany . The company spoke of a 'pretty stupid amalgam of unfortunate circumstances' which led to the Nazi mugs going on sale. Christian . Zurbrueggen, the owner and managing director of the store, says an . investigation is underway to discover how the face of Hitler made its . way on to the ceramics. The stamp is printed between petals and poetry and is not detectable with a cursory glance. Now the store is offering a gift voucher to any customer who returns one of the mugs. The Chinese factory that made them produced 5,000 total, although only 175 actually sold - all for less than £3 each. The remaining 4825 cups have already been destroyed. Now the store is offering the voucher in a bid to get back the 175 out of a batch of 5000 made in China mugs that were actually sold. They were sold for less than three pounds each. Mr Zurbrueggen also apologised profusely and called the incident 'truly terrible.' He said the mugs were loaded so quickly on to company shelves that no store workers noticed the 'embarrassing error.' The Chinese factory responsible has also apologised and promised a full investigation.","Furniture store in Bielefeld, Germany sold the Hitler mugs in error .

"By . Allan Hall . These are the cigars that the man who founded the Gestapo and gave the order for the Jewish Holocaust puffed on at the height of the Battle of Britain. Once belonging to Hermann Goering, the cigars and a signed copy of Adolf Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf went on display at the National Liberation Museum in Groesbeek, Netherlands earlier this week. Made especially for the Luftwaffe chief, the cigars were taken from him when he was arrested by U.S. troops in Austria in 1945 as he tried to move towards a castle he intended to be his last bolthole. History: Hermann Goering's cigars and a signed copy of Adolf Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf have gone on display. An inscription on the box translates as: 'Custom made for the Marshall of the Realm Hermann Goering' They were purchased after the war - along with a signed copy of Hitler's . autobiography Mein Kampf - by a Dutch government official who was later charged with trying to have items looted by the Nazis returned to their rightful owners. The cigars were made by a German company using Sumatra tobacco and were manufactured and presented to Hitler's deputy in August 1941 when the aerial assault that the Nazi leadership saw as the precursor of the occupation of Britain was in full swing. 'Perhaps he smoked them and reflected on the losses incurred on his bomber fleet by the Spitfires and Hurricanes of the RAF,' a National Liberation Museum spokesman said. 'They are an interesting addition to our collection of Nazi regalia,' he added. Monster: The cigars were custom made for Hermann Goering (pictured). Goering was Adolf Hitler's deputy, the head of the Luftwaffe, and the man who founded the Gestapo and gave the order for the Jewish Holocaust . An inscription on the cigar box translates as: 'Custom made for the Marshall of the Realm Hermann Goering'. Marshall of the Realm - or Reichsmarschall - was the highest rank in the armed forces of Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Hermann Goering was the only man ever to hold the rank, with Hitler appointing him Reichsmarschall primarily to make it clear that he was considered senior to other Nazi commanders. Caught: Hermann Goering was convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg and sentenced to death. He cheated the hangman on 15 October 1946 by taking a cyanide pill that he had concealed in his teeth . The cigars, the signed copy of Mein Kampf and the files of Louis Otto - the man who kept the Nazi memorabilia as souvenirs - were given to the museum by his son earlier this week. Goering once boasted that soon after his death 'every home in Germany will have a statue of Hermann Goering in it.' But he was convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg and sentenced to death. He cheated the hangman on 15 October 1946 by taking a cyanide pill that he had concealed in his teeth. Goering died within minutes, with his body buried in an unmarked grave.","Cigars were made during Second World War especially for Hitler's deputy .

"By . Allan Hall . An old man relaxes in the sun in the twilight of his life....far away and long ago from the time he wore the dreaded double-lightning flashes of the dreaded S.S. and worked in Auschwitz. Now Hans Koenig, 94, is poised to answer for his role at the extermination camp where the Nazis put 1.1 million people to death during the Second World War. He is among a handful of former servants of Hitler who thought they had got clean away with their crimes only to faces charges of complicity in mass murder. Now Hans Koenig, 94, sits in the sun in the twilight of his life....far away and long ago from the time he wore the dreaded double-lightning flashes of the dreaded S.S. and worked in Auschwitz . Prosecutors, who arrested Koening and two other former Auschwitz guards in recent weeks, claim he assisted in the execution of prisoners in the camp in occupied Poland. His family insist he was an administrator and had nothing to do with the mass slaughter that took place on a daily basis behind the barbed wire and watchtowers of the complex. Koenig, an ethnic German from Bratislava in what was Czechoslovakia, was known as a  'bruiser” in Auschwitz, a guard who allegedly liked cruelty for its own sake. Koenig, 94, is poised to answer for his role at the extermination camp where the Nazis put 1.1 million people to death during the Second World War . He doesn’t deny being at the camp and said:  'At the time the German ethnic group I belonged to had to be tested and I was happy to be a part of that.  We shouted hurrah!' He claims no knowledge of the gas chambers, of the ‘selection’ of victims on the infamous train platform at the camp in occupied Poland, of starvations, beatings, murder. ''They should leave me alone,' he moans.  'It was all a long time ago...' Prosecutors, who arrested Koening and two other former Auschwitz guards in recent weeks, claim he assisted in the execution of prisoners in the camp in occupied Poland . Perhaps the most notorious of all the Nazi concentration camps, 1.1million Jews were killed at Auschwitz. The camp consisted of three main parts: Auschwitz I (the base camp) Auschwitz II - Birkenau (the extermination camp) and Auschwitz III - Monowitz (the labour camp). During the war the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the infamous SS - 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. It was run by camp commandant Rudolf Höss who was tried and hanged in 1947 for his part in the extermination. The camp was liberated by the Red Army on January 27 1945, the day was subsequently declared International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Following its liberation the camp has become a symbol of the holocaust and has operated as a museum since 1947. Until last week Koenig was a prisoner in the penal hospital Hohenasperg but has since returned to his home near Stuttgart. Soon a court will have to decide whether he is competent enough to stand trial: one of the other two guards arrested in February has already been told he will not answer any charges because of the fragile state of his mental and physical health. Koenig lives in a shared house that he built with his brother-in-law in the 1960’s. According to neighbours he passes his time playing chess with old friends, sunbathing when the weather is good, occasionally pottering around in the well-tended garden. 'He was in the local Catholic church organisation,' said a female neighbour. 'In his living room are photos of his grandchildren.  Until he retired he was an administrative clerk with the Stuttgart tram authority.” Koenig was arrested due to the verdict in the trial against John Demjanjuk three years ago in Munich. Demjanjuk was convicted of being a guard at the Nazi extermination camp of Sobibor without a single witness being called to testify what his role was in the camp where 250,000 Jews were murdered. It was enough that he was a cog in the machinery of mass extermination. But his son Helmut, 62, said: 'My father wasn’t deployed in Auschwitz but was only involved in the site management. I hope that he will be acquitted.'","Hans Koenig, 94, is poised to answer for his role at Auschwitz .

"By . Allan Hall . Extraordinary bravery: Marie Jalowicz Simon used cunning, guile and desperate pragmatism to stay one step ahead of her Nazi hunters, living in underground slums, on coal piles or the beds of not-so-kindly Berliners with a conscience. © Hermann Simon . For three years Marie Jalowicz Simon lived a life of isolation and fear in the dark heart of Nazism. She was what the Gestapo called a  U-Boat, one of the scores of Jews who managed to survive out of sight beneath the surface of society. Marie remained hidden for three years in Berlin and her battle to avoid capture and stay alive is told in a powerful new book, Submerged. She died 15 years ago but the book, just published in Germany, is based on tape recordings she made about her time in hiding. ‘She became a submarine and she stayed  submerged and she lived,’ said her son Hermann. From 80 cassette tapes, Hermann and author Irene Stratenwerth have produced what has been described as a masterpiece. The book says that by 1941 both Marie’s parents were dead. She was 25 and working as a slave labourer at an arms factory in the capital. By this time the Nazis’ plans for Jews had moved from deportation to slavery and eventual extermination. As time dragged on and workmates disappeared, she realised that she could be next. So she failed to turn up for work one day and then went to the forced labour office pretending to be a neighbour who said Marie Simon has been deported. Despite her ruse, the Gestapo came looking for her and she had to go on the run. She said: ‘I did not want to belong to the community of death. I wanted to live.’ 'Submerged': The title of  the book (left) is a reference to the names the Nazis gave Jews like her;  'U-Boats' who stayed hidden beneath the surface of a society that wanted to put them on to trains to concentration camps, then to gas chambers (right) Slaves: Jewish slave labour girls line up for work. Marie Jalowicz Simon was 25 in 1941 when she started working as a slave labourer on a lather at a Siemens plant in the capital . She dyed her hair, scavenged a set of false papers and became known to the handful of Berliners who would give her shelter. One . night here, one night there, sometimes sleeping in a coal pile, other . times surrendering to the advances of not-so-kindly helpers. ‘Not all motives were noble,’ she said. ‘I had to be pragmatic.’ She was alive when the city fell to the Red Army in May 1945. ‘The . survival of every single submerged person was based on a chain of . coincidences that was hard to believe and often wonderful,’ she said. ‘I . lived on a tightrope.’ Terror: Had she been captured, she would most likely have ended up in a concentration camp like this at Auschwitz, where she would probably have been sent to a gas chamber . Almost nowhere to hide: While in hiding in Berlin, she had to keep a keen eye out for the 'catchers,' often Jews themselves, who were deployed by the Nazis to engage in conversation in parks, cafes and on the street with people they thought were other Jews on the run (this picture was taken in 1938)","Marie Jalowicz Simon's tale has been told in autobiography 'Submerged'

"By . Allan Hall . Michael Schumacher (pictured in 2012) has today been in an artificially induced coma for 69 days since the ski accident on December 29 . The family of F1 legend Michael Schumacher have been informed by doctors treating him that the chances of recovery are now so slim that only 'a miracle' can save him. Today the 45-year-old winner of seven grand prix titles has been in an artificially induced coma for 69 days since badly injuring his brain during a low-speed ski accident in the French Alps on December 29.  Most artificial comas last for a period of two to three weeks. His management team, led by spokeswoman Sabine Kehm, insist that he remains in the 'wake up' phase of his treatment as doctors continue to decrease the powerful narcotics that have kept him unconscious. Official news about his condition is minimal: but sources close to the family say the prognosis for Schumacher could not be worse. 'He is in terrible shape but until the family issue a statement we cannot write about it,' said one senior German journalist. 'The family have, we are told, been informed that only a miracle can bring him back now.' However, Italian sports newspaper La . Gazzetta dello Sport is claiming that the seven-time world champion is . no longer on a ventilator and is now breathing independently. Focus magazine reported a fortnight ago that the wake-up phase had been stopped due to complications and that he was placed back in the coma. That was denied by Kehm although experts say that such a super-fit individual as Schumacher would have expelled all the drugs from his body by now, and that if he was going to wake up, he would have done so already. This week was a vital one for Schumacher: two months into his coma - induced to slow down brain functions, thus allowing it to heal more rapidly - doctors were hoping for a sign that he was aware of his environment. Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is claiming that the seven-time world champion is no longer on a ventilator and is now breathing independently . They look for a fluttering of eyelids or a movement of fingers that is more than a reflex nerve twitch. 'This . has not happened,' said another source close to the family. 'On Sunday . his wife Corinna spent her 45th birthday at his bedside with their . children Gina Marie and Mick, his brother Ralf and his father Rolf . Schumacher. 'They talked and talked and prayed for him to acknowledge their presence. But he remains comatose with tubes feeding him, supplying him with air, giving him medicine and removing waste from his body. 'The doctors have given it to them straight. There is little hope left that he will come out of this. 'Miracles happen, of course, and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy. But all the money in the world cannot fix what has happened to him.' Three times daily Schumacher's joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. This week was a vital one for Schumacher (pictured here in 2012) - two months into his coma, doctors were hoping for a sign that he was aware of his environment . The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally. Experts say that perhaps the greatest risk of all facing Schumacher in his prone position is pneumonia. The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection.  He has already had - and conquered - one lung infection. His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep it flowing. Hobby: Schumacher, pictured here in 2005, was injured in a skiing accident on December 29 . He lies on a special air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing a potentially fatal infection. Gary Hartstein, a former F1 doctor, wrote on Sunday: 'The majority of the patients that come out alive from a coma after this amount of time suffer severe disabilities.' He and others say the supposed mouth movements that Schumacher's former teammate Felipe Massa saw were probably nothing more than pure nerve reflexes that repeatedly occur in coma patients and not conscious movements.","F1 driver has today been in artificially induced coma for 69 days .

"By . Allan Hall . German Chancellor Angela Merkel has refused to accompany China's president Xi Jinping on a visit to Berlin's Holocaust memorial, it was reported today. The German Chancellor is said to fear that a tour with President Xi would be used as propaganda in an ongoing fight with Japan over crimes committed in  China during World War II. President Xi is due to visit Berlin at the end of March and his aides specifically requested an official tour of the standing stones near the Brandenburg Gate which commemorate the six million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime. Denied: President Xi Jinping's wish for Angela Merkel to accompany him to the Holocaust memorials in Berlin during his official visit, was declined . His wish was declined by Merkel’s office as well as a request for her to accompany Xi to the Memorial to the Victims of Fascism and Militarism on the Unter den Linden. President Xi's official tour of Second World War memorial sites in Germany is intended to be used to highlight how Japan fails to atone for their crimes during World War II, compared to Germany, and to embarrass Japanese officials, the Telegraph reports. Spiegel magazine reported the snub this week stating: ‘The German government, Berlin sources told Spiegel, wants to avoid becoming involved in the tiff over history currently straining relations between Beijing and Tokyo. Government sources said that Xi was: 'Of course, welcome to visit World War II memorials on his own time.’ China suffered greatly under the Japanese invasion of its territory before WW2 broke out in Europe. No-go area: President Xi's aides specifically requested an official tour of the standing stones near the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin, but will have to walk alone . A allied military tribunel concluded that 142,000 were killed, a number which the Chinese more than doubles, claiming that 300,000 people died. China has repeatedly castigated Japan for not showing the same contrition for war crimes that Germany has expressed since 1945 for its atrocities under Nazism. Although Tokyo has repeatedly apologized for the suffering caused in China during the war, the periodic visits by Japanese leaders to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial which honours wartime leaders, continues to irritate Beijing. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last visited the shrine at the end of December. An unnamed German diplomatic source said: ‘The Germans are really uncomfortable with this kind of thing. They don't like China constantly comparing them with Japan and going on about the war. 'Mrs. Merkel doesn't want to be a pawn in any propaganda war.’","China's president requested Merkel accompany him on memorial tour .

"By . Allan Hall . The elderly German recluse who was found to have a hoard of art looted by the Nazis worth close to a billion pounds has owned up to having a second stash of masterpieces. Picassos, Renoirs and Monets are among the 60 additional works found at the second home of Cornelius Gurlitt in Salzburg, Austria. They are estimated by experts to be worth over £100million pounds - but it remains unclear if Gurlitt's father, an art expert who worked for Hitler, stole them or acquired them legally. Hidden treasures: Cornelius Gurlitt's house in Salzburg, Austria, where 60 works including Picassos, Renoirs and Monets have been found after he told investigators in Germany they were there to stop them being stolem . Gurlitt, 80, became internationally infamous in November last year when customs officials revealed they had seized 1,406 lost masterpieces that staggered the art world from his Munich apartment. His father Hildebrand was exposed as personal adviser to Hitler - acquiring paintings for a museum the Nazi leader planned to build in Linz after the war and selling the modern art the Fuehrer detested to raise money for weapons. The first stash has been proven to include several hundred paintings that were either looted from Jewish collectors or purchased from them at knock-down prices so the owners could buy expensive exit visas to escape Germany. One rare Chagall masterpiece was looted from a Jewish family by the Gestapo in 1941. Savely Blumenstein, whose collection also included Picassos and Pissaros, was seized in Riga, Latvia, when the German marched in. He was able to escape to America and in 1981 the West German government paid him less than £15,000 compensation for the painting called 'Allegorical Scene', which experts say would sell today for more than £1million at auction. At the end of the war 'Monuments Men' - the American army's art sleuths - quizzed Hildebrand Gurlitt on suspicion of criminal art dealing on Hitler's behalf, but he was never charged. He bequeathed his collection to his son who sold objects piecemeal down the years to live from the proceeds.

An artwork by the German painter Franz Marc: At the end of the war 'Monuments Men' - the American army's art sleuths - quizzed Gurlitt's father on suspicion of criminal art dealing but he was never charged . After the Gurlitt haul was seized investigators said they doubted he had any other additional artworks.  But his home in Austria - he acquired Austrian citizenship sometime in the Sixties - was only searched on Monday. According to the authorities the premises were searched and the paintings taken away at Gurlitt's request as ""a precaution against break-ins and theft."" A spokesman for Gurlitt, who is demanding the return of the bulk of the collection, said he has authorised an expert evaluation of the Salzburg paintings to ensure they are ""not looted Nazi art,"" but believed them not to be. A spokesman for German prosecutors handling the Gurlitt art haul said they had no comment on this claim adding: ""We have taken note of this but have nothing further to add.""

"By . Allan Hall . and Chris Pleasance . Ronald Balfour, the real-life Monuments Man who died trying to save artworks in WW2, has been written out of the new George Clooney film . The family of the real-life Monuments Man who helped to save priceless pieces of art from the Nazis are upset that he has been written out of history by a new Hollywood film. Ronald Balfour was just one of two men from the monuments, fine arts and archives (MFAA) division to die while trying to protect art from being destroyed at the end of the Second World War. Now George Clooney has been accused of writing the shy academic out of history after failing to even mention Balfour's name in his new blockbuster. While Balfour was not married and had no children himself, his ten nieces and nephews are said to be 'saddened' that an opportunity to remember their uncle's bravery was missed. Instead the Hollywood account sees Americans claim the glory for rescuing history's glittering prizes. The . film  - directed, co-written and starring George Clooney - follows a group of . MFAA officers from after D-day until the end of the war and is based on a . book by US writer Robert Edsel. The MFAA involved around 345 men and women from 17 nations. It was led by the Americans, but Britain provided the second-largest group of volunteers. Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville plays the only English role -  a fictional academic called Donald Jeffries. He is part of the MFAA frontline team led by Clooney's character, George L Stout, and who is based on a real MFAA officer and well known American art collector. Scroll down for video . Subject of a new film: George Clooney's movie 'The Monuments Men' follows the heroic exploits of the monuments, fine arts and archives division trying to save works of art at the end of WW2 . Despite providing the second-largest consignment of volunteers for the unit, the only English character in the film - played by Hugh Bonneville - is entirely fictional . Reporting for duty: Bill Murray plays one of the experts employed in the team . Balfour was killed aged 41 in early in 1945, at Cleves, in . north-western Germany while he was trying to  protect historic church . artefacts with two German civilians. He was killed by a shell while . trying to save a medieval . altarpiece. He . had recently saved a 14th century archive and had managed to persuade . Canadian troops not to blow up the medieval Steintor city . gate at Goch. Polly Hutchison, 65, one of Balfour's nieces, told The Times: 'He certainly was a very brave man, and could have been a very successful academic. 'He was old enough not to join up, but it was a subject close to his heart. He wasn't saving art for one side, he died saving it for mankind. This hoard of art, found in a 12th century castle belonged to Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi propaganda minister . Towards the end of the conflict, soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art, including this one in a salt mine at Merkers, Germany, which is being inspected by American General Dwight D Eisenhower . Many of the works, hidden across Europe, are still missing. Last year £1bn worth of art was found in the apartment of German Cornelius Gurlitt . 'He probably would have been very shy and modest about it, but as a family we are very proud of him.' In Germany, he is celebrated and a local archive and a street has been named in his honour. His family accepted a bravery award the Johanna Sebus Medaille, on his behalf, in 1985. But in his home country, little is known of him  although an archive room is named after him at King's College, Cambridge. The only other man from the unit to be killed as American architect Walter Huchthausen who was shot near Aachen in April 1945. It is not the first time that American film producers have rewritten history to the detriment of Britain. In the 2000 film U-571, an American submarine intercepts a stricken German U-Boat and steals an Enigma code machine, helping decipher the German army's coded messages. In fact it was a British ship, HMS Bulldog, that boarded the submarine, and their achievement was not capturing the machine (Bletchley Park already had three) but finding the code books. The film is also set in spring 1942, almost a year after the Enigma code was actually deciphered, and seven months before the US even joined the war. In another re-write, the beginning of 2001 movie Pearl Harbor features Ben Affleck's character almost single-handedly winning the Battle of Britain after Pearl Harbor attack. In fact the Japanese assault on the Hawaii base happened after the Luftwaffe's attacks on Britain, and while a few American pilots were involved in the air defence, America as a country was not involved in the war at that point. Serial offender Affleck also toyed with the truth in Oscar winning Argo, which he starred in and directed. In the film six American diplomats are trying to escape from Iranian revolutionaries who occupy their embassy. According to Affleck the British refuse to offer them shelter. In fact the British embassy did offer them refuge, risking being attacked themselves, but were unable to find the US staff in time.","Ronald Balfour was one of just two men in the monuments, fine arts and archives division to die trying to protect works of art during WW2 .

"By . Allan Hall . Fears are growing in Germany that stricken F1 legend Michael Schumacher may be in a coma for the rest of his life. German weekly news magazine Focus reported that 'Schumacher could be in a coma forever' after speaking with experts on his condition. Bild newspaper also reported that his condition is so grave that there are currently no plans to wake him. Fearing the worst: German media has been speculating that Michael Schumacher may never come out of his coma after speaking to experts about the progress of his condition following his skiing accident last month . Legend: Schumacher is widely considered the greates F1 driver of all time after winning seven World title . He has been in an artificially induced state of unconsciousness for 18 days now and the silence from his management and the medical teams treating him in Grenoble, France, lead many to fear the worst. The coma means that oxygen to his brain is reduced, therefore it works less and is better placed to recover from the injuries sustained during a low-speed ski accident on December 29. But Schumacher, 44, has not recovered anywhere near sufficiently to be awoken from his coma, leading to the speculation that he might be committed to it for the rest of his days. Patients placed in such comas are usually brought out of them after one to two weeks. 'There may have been complications', said neurosurgeon Andreas Zieger of the University Clinic for neurosurgery in Oldenburg to Focus magazine. 'We should not speculate here. Ultimately, we are talking about life and death. A coma can in theory be maintained for a lifetime. It won’t hurt the human brain.' Strain: Corinna Schumacher and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash . But side effects include anaesthetic increasingly stressing the liver, muscle breakdown and rises in intracranial pressure as a result of cerebrospinal fluid not circulating efficiently. Professor Zieger added: 'Brain injuries are among the most complicated injuries that can happen to the human body. 'Predictions about how long a person might be in a coma or potential complications are seldom reliable.' Cologne neurological expert Professor Gereon Fink fears that his long coma indicates serious damage in the brain and that his condition remains critical. 'He assumes that Michael Schumacher’s health condition is apparently worse than hoped for,' reported a news website. Support: Fans hold F1 Ferrari team flags outside Schumacher's hospital. While some racing teams have banned drivers from risky off-track activities, Ferrari says it has issued no such directives . Devoted: Fans leave a collection of Schumacher merchandise and a letter attached to a fence in his home town of Kerpen, Germany . 'If the injuries are so severe that it would harm the patient, he is kept longer in the medically induced coma,' said professor Fink. 'Depending on where bleeding has taken place can lead to unilateral paralysis, speech disorders or personality changes.' Schumacher, whose wife Corinna and two children are maintaining a constant bedside vigil in France, has undergone two operations since the accident at the resort of Meribel and has undergone fresh scans this week. German media said that the risk of brain haemorrhage remain high and why he is still classified as critically ill. His catastrophic accident has already had a knock-on effect for some current racing drivers who, according to Bild newspaper, have now been issued with a list of off-track activities they are now banned from undertaking. Bild says skiing, motocross and motorbike riding are out. Red Bull, it reports, has banned driver Daniel Ricciardo from surfing in the sea off his hometown of Perth in Australia because of the danger of shark attacks. Ferrari says it has issued no such directives to its drivers saying: 'We trust our drivers to be able to decide what is dangerous and what is not.'","German media rife with speculation after speaking to brain injury experts .

"By . Ruth Styles . She might be just 16 years old but Becca Caxton from Hull has big plans for her future - and for that of her family. Despite her tender years and lack of work, Becca is planning for life as a benefits mother - much to the horror of her mother Anita, 38. 'I think kids shouldn't have kids and I . told that to Becca before she got pregnant,' fumes Anita, 38, who has a part time role as a delivery driver for Iceland. Pregnant: Becca Caxton, 16, is pregnant and has dropped out of school to live on benefits . 'I don't think it is right. I . think they should both work, work until they're much older and can . provide and be responsible for a child.' Becca, however, says she wants to move out and plans to move into a council flat with boyfriend Sonny Smith, 17, when the baby arrives. 'I do feel bad for [moving out and getting benefits] but obviously I . need the money to provide for a baby so she's [Anita] just going to have to deal . with it,' says Becca. 'I don't care what people say about me being 16 and pregnant . because I wanted it and it's not their lives and anyone can look after a . baby - it's not hard to do.' Becca's hometown, Hull, has a teenage pregnancy rate 60 per cent higher than the national average - and the unemployment figures to match. Not only is the Yorkshire town home to the highest percentage of job seekers in the UK, the youth unemployment rate is above 25 per cent. Worried: Boyfriend Sonny says he wants to finish college and get a job to support his new family . Children: Becca's mother Anita, 38, says she is horrified by her daughter's choice and wants her to get a job . As a result, many teenagers, among them Becca's sister Charlotte, 19, and brother Michael, 18, have joined the dole queue and show little inclination to do anything else. 'Teenagers are a pain in the backside,' says their mother Anita, . 'because when there's nothing out there for them, they don't want to get . up, they don't want to do anything, they complain they're bored... They're the bane of my life they are!' Anita herself was on the dole until recently, only getting a job when faced with losing £120 a week in child benefits should Becca move out. Nevertheless, she has high hopes for her children and says she'd like them to do better, in particular Charlotte. 'It's quite annoying to think that you are 19-years-old and you can't do anything,' complains a furious Anita to a reluctant Charlotte. 'You could be a barrister. You could be a solicitor!' Unfortunately for Charlotte, she, like Becca, has little in the way of qualifications and failed to pass her English and maths GCSES. Boyfriend Sonny does have qualifications and has just started college but despite admitting to misgivings, says he will go along with Becca's plans for a benefits baby. Bad odds: Becca and Sonny live in Hull, one of the worst parts of the country for youth unemployment . Hard: Becca's sister Charlotte and brother Michael both sign on due to lack of job and learning opportunities . 'It was a real shock due to me being . really young and having just started college, so not really able to provide for . a baby,' says Sonny of the moment he discovered he would become a father. 'Thanks to the benefits system, it's going to be a lot easier.' Becca has no such qualms, with her only complaint being told she can't start claiming benefits on her own account until the baby is born. 'I was so happy,' she says of the moment her pregnancy was confirmed. 'I was just smiling in the doctors but I knew I wanted it. I can't wait to move out!' While Sonny has qualms about being on benefits and Anita has found a part time job, it seems the only member of the Caxton family reluctant to sign on is the youngest, 15-year-old Aaron. 'I'm not going to be signing on because . you don't learn anything from that,' he insists. 'I think everyone who signs on  in . this house is ridiculous!' But Anita has other ideas. 'He's got learning difficulties to an . extent, he's deaf... I suppose if somebody saw him, they would say he . was going to end up on the social.' For Aaron's sake, you can't help but hope she's wrong.

"By . Martin Robinson . Crash: Richard Husband, pictured outside court, was heard saying 'what have I done' after an ambulance crashed into a tree killing its driver and patient, a jury was told today . A motorist accused of killing an ambulance driver and a patient after he forced them off the road and into a tree held his head in his hands and said 'look what I've done', a court heard today. Richard Husband, 26, had been listening to loud music before he pulled out to overtake a car in front that had stopped to let the emergency vehicle pass, it is alleged. The manoeuvre forced the overtaking ambulance to veer off the road and crash into a tree, a jury heard. Its driver, paramedic Gillian Randall, 42, and patient Francis Ironside, 88, were both killed. In the aftermath of the collision, Husband was said to be hysterical and 'in bits' and said 'Oh my God, look what I've done.' The school care worker later told police that teenage pupils in his Seat Alhambra people carrier had turned the music up loud at the time of the crash. A court heard that Randall should have seen the ambulance coming in his mirrors before he pulled out in front of it on the A337 between Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst, Hants. Husband had been driving the teenagers from Fernhill Lodge home in New Milton to Coxlease school in Lyndhurst when the crash occurred at 9.35am on April 26 last year. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court that the ambulance was heading to Southampton Hospital with Mr Ironside who had collapsed and was seriously ill. Mr Ironside's son David was in the back of the ambulance with his father along with paramedic Richard Riley. Both men were seriously injured in the crash. Miss Maylin said: 'The ambulance was travelling on emergency response on the A337 towards Southampton. Francis Ironside was seriously ill. He required immediate medical treatment. 'David Ironside heard sirens being activated and from where he was sitting he could see the reflection of flashing blue lights. 'The ambulance was using lights and sirens.' Fatalities: Paramedic Gillian Randall, 42, and patient Francis Ironside, 88, both died when the ambulance was forced off the road in the New Forest . The court heard the ambulance had been travelling at speeds of up to 70mph prior to the crash. Dr Melissa Judd, whose Skoda Yeti car Husband had tried to overtake, said she saw the ambulance approaching in her rear view mirror before pulling over. Miss Maylin said: 'All of a sudden she (Dr Judd) was aware the Alhambra behind her had slowed. 'She thought it was to allow the ambulance to pass but in fact it pulled out as if to overtake her. 'She was aware there was an impact with the driver's side of the Alhambra and the ambulance. 'She saw debris from the ambulance and saw the car fly up into the air.' The court was told that drivers who stopped at the scene had described Husband as 'hysterical' and 'in bits.' Miss Maylin said: 'Dr Judd saw Richard Husband get out of the car. She heard him say 'Oh my God, I didn't see it' 'Another witness, Paul Mundell, heard him say 'look what I've done'. ' Miss Maylin said Tommy Strange, a passenger in another car, said Husband was holding his head in his hands and heard him say 'I had my music on, I didn't see it.' The court heard that in a statement to police following his arrest at the scene, Husband said the pupils in his car had been playing their music too loud. Miss Maylin added: 'He said he told them repeatedly to turn it down and then he himself turned it down. 'He said he was driving within the speed limit when he saw the vehicle in front indicate. 'He said he checked his mirror and signalled and seeing no other vehicles he began to overtake. 'He maintains the ambulance was not visible to him when he began the manoeuvre. 'If Mr Husband, when he commenced the manoeuvre, had either checked his mirrors or looked over his shoulder, he should have seen, if not heard, the ambulance.' Husband, from Brockenhurst, denies two counts of causing death by careless driving. The trial continue.

A sci-fi obsessed couple who stole £2.3million and spent huge sums on memorabilia in an 'orgy of greed and self-indulgence' will have their much-loved collectables auctioned today. Spendaholic Julie Nickerson, 55, from West Yorkshire, was jailed for five years after she splashed£500,000 on a house, £200,000 on holidays and even £16,000 on Star Trek costumes. Similar amounts were also spent on Darth Vader's helmet, a mint condition Millennium Falcon model, remote controlled daleks and hundreds of other items due to be sold by police today. Her newsagent husband Anthony, 48, jailed for two-and-a-half years, would was called Britain's best kept paper boy because he would deliver the papers in his £50,000 Mercedes. His role was funnelling the millions his wife stole from her laundry company employer through his business. Sci-fi gold: This mint condition replica Millennium Falcon was one of more than 1,000 items bought by a couple later jailed for their part in a £2.3million theft . Proceeds of crime: West Yorkshire Police have demanded a costume worn by the character Scotty in the television programme Star Trek, left, and Darth Vader's helmet, right, be sold to recoup cash . Today 1,000 rare pieces of sci-fi memorabilia they bought only to be seized by police will be auctioned. Actual costumes used in the Star Trek films, including Scotty's jacket, a replica Millennium falcon from Star Wars and remote control Daleks are among the lots in the unusual collection. On instructions from West Yorkshire Police, Wilsons Auctions in Northern Ireland is putting the collection up for sale with no reserve price on any of the items. Aidan Larkin, assets recovery manager at Wilsons, said the auction presented a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity for sci-fi fans. 'These items come round very, very rarely,' he said. 'It's rare for such a large, significant . collection of these items to become available. Normally at the . specialist toy auctions there are one or two items of a certain range - . we have complete waves of toys that were produced.' The Nickersons, pictured outside court, spent the cash on lavish luxury holidays, a house worth half a million pounds a fleet of Mercedes cars and also memorabilia . Collectable: This scale model of the U.S.S. Enterprise is among the diverse and valuable collection once owned by Julie and Anthony Nickerson . Obsessed: This large Bronze & Gold Remote Control Dalek was bought for a huge sum by the couple . Mr Larkin, who said he expected a lot of on-line bids from the United States, said the set of six Star Trek costumes were probably the most valuable items for sale. 'We have been informed when the costumes last changed hands in Christie's Auctions in New York a few years ago the couple in question spent $27,000 (£15,800) on these costumes,' he said. The auction gets under way at 6.30pm in Wilsons' headquarters in Mallusk in north Belfast. The diverse and valuable haul was once owned by a husband and wife who build it up using their ill gotten gains. The Nickersons spent the cash on lavish luxury holidays, a house worth half a million pounds which came complete with five acres of land, a hot spring and swimming pool and a fleet of Mercedes cars. They also splashed £17,000 on film memorabilia from Christie’s Auction House in London and spent a further £10,000 on motorsport events at Silverstone. In May Mr Nickerson admitted transferring and concealing just under £925,000 between July 2009 and December 2012, while in December last year, his wife pleaded guilty to stealing £2.3million from JLA Ltd between 2005 and December 2012 after she was made redundant. Mrs Nickerson, who worked in the accounts and finance department at the firm in Halifax, stole the cash over a seven-year period beginning in 2005. She also admitted money laundering and fraud in relation to a fallse representation made to HM Revenue and Customs. The court heard her husband turned a blind eye to his wife’s dishonesty, and was told by the judge ‘you helped her’ with a theft ‘in breach of trust’. The pair spent the cash on lavish luxury holidays, a house worth half a million pounds which came complete with five acres of land, a hot spring and swimming pool, pictured, and a fleet of Mercedes cars . Recorder Anthony Hawks told Mrs Nickerson, who sobbed as the sentence was read out: ‘You have taken in excess of £2million. You and your husband didn’t need that money. ‘There was no pressing need for the money for an operation or a sick family member. You were comfortably off. ‘What you did was to embark on an orgy of greed and self-indulgence which only came to a head when you were made redundant. ‘You lived a lavish lifestyle. You took holidays that other people could only dream of. You spent thousands of pounds of sports memorabilia. You bought expensive vehicles. The list goes on'.","Julie and Anthony Nickerson stole £2.3million from a cleaning company .

"By . James Gordon . When it comes to re-inventing the razor, Gillette has managed to pull off the feat hundreds of times. First it was two blades, then four, now five... and the mens' grooming company has come out with a head that swivels and adjusts according to the contours of your face. The new Fusion ProGlide is a razor that as the handle that moves, the head also angles and pivots. Scroll down for video . Money to be made: Americans spent $3.7 billion on razors and blades over the last year . The company claims it will 'change the face of shaving'... but what's less clear is how much this shaver will change your face. But such allegedly smooth perfection doesn't come cheap. The razor will be on the market for $11.49 and will be one the most expensive out there. The battery-powered version costs even more with a suggested retail price of $12.59. 'For more than a century, since King C. Gillette introduced the very first safety razor in 1901, Gillette has revolutionized the way the world shaves, fusing state-of-the-art engineering with precision manufacturing,' said Patrice Louvet, group president of Global Grooming and Shave Care. 'Gillette invented the original pivot, and we’ve once again changed the shaving experience. The Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Technology is truly shaving rebuilt to deliver the best a man can get.' A closer shave: Gillette has announced a newfangled, swiveling ball-hinge razor, which starting at $11.49 will be one of the most expensive razors on the market . Compatible: The handle will work with Gillettes existing Fusion ProGlide cartridges . Not everyone is convinced by Gillette's own hype however. Daniel Foxhill, a marketing consultant based in New York says he is getting sick of having to upgrade to a new razor almost every years. 'Men have been shaving since the stone age. I don't see how this blade is going to make the slightest difference. Whether you use a plastic razor, one with two blades, one with seventeen or whatever - point is, it's just a money grabbing exercise and I'm not going to fall for it.' Frank Taylor from Connecticut says he has recently joined the Dollar Shave Club and is saving a fortune on monthly blades. 'Only Gillette could take as simple an activity as an everyday shave, spin it into a science full of marketing gimmicks, and charge a fortune for it.' Gillette introduced the new technology at a launch event in New York that featured live music, a shave of actor Omar Epps and the usual company proclamations that its latest razor would change shaving as we know it. The new handle will work with Gillette’s existing Fusion ProGlide cartridges. The . pairing of the new handle and the blades is a marketing tactic to boost . sales of the brand’s most expensive razor cartridges, which cost about . $20 for a pack of four at stores. Many . Gillette consumers continue to use the older and less expensive Mach3 . system rather than adopting the Fusion ProGlide, which was introduced . four years ago. Kevin Roose from New York Magazine is similarly wary of Gilette's new product. 'ProGlide FlexBall is a bad idea. A really bad idea. In fact, the razor represents everything terrible about America's innovation economy. By now, everyone knows how razor companies make their money. They sell you cheap razor handles, then burn you later with expensive cartridge refills. On top of that business model, Gillette and other market leaders introduced an arms-race component to the industry – going from two blades to three, then to four and five and six. Each new blade adds only a smidgen of extra utility, but it convinced gullible customers that they needed to upgrade their models every few years to stay current. A few years ago, though, something happened that threatened Gillette's dominance. Upstarts like the Dollar Shave Club began exploiting the obvious – namely, that it shouldn't cost $20 for a pack of razor cartridge refills – and began to shave away (sorry) some of Gillette's competitive edge by selling razors for cheaper over the internet. The shaving industry, as they say in Silicon Valley, had been disrupted.' Americans spent $3.7 billion on razors, blades, and shaving products in the 52-week period ending March 15, according to Nielsen data. That represents a decline of 2.7 percent from the previous year. Procter & Gamble, which owns Gillette controls about 80 percent of the US razor blade market and holds a 40 percent share of the disposable razor category. The new Gillette blade will be available in stores by June.","New razor will be a dollar more than the current top-line ProGlide blade .

"By . Richard Spillett . They were once the epitome of the swinging sixties, a wild-living rock 'n' roll band followed around the world by flocks of adoring groupies. But despite still playing to sell-out crowds, it seems the Rolling Stones' backstage habits have mellowed with their age. Now old enough to be claiming their pensions, guitarist Ronnie Wood has revealed the band spend most of their free time playing backgammon and watching murder mysteries. Scroll down for video . Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, pictured with wife Sally Humphreys, has revealed the veteran band now spend much of their time on tour watching TV box-sets together . The band recently resumed their sell-out world tour, playing to packed stadiums in Denmark and Sweden. But anyone who thought that the band had returned to their party-loving ways now that they are back on stage would be mistaken. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph today, Wood said the band are often left tired by the amount of travelling they do and now spend much of their time watching TV together. He said: 'We watch 19 murder mysteries in a row. We're on Above Suspicion at the moment... Even with Jagger I go, ""Let's go and watch House of Cards"".' The 67-year-old said the band got so hooked on one series while in China, they had to send a runner out at 4am to track down the next box-set. After becoming addicted to US series Breaking Bad, the band were met backstage by Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman in the hit show. Wood told the paper he is also into jigsaw puzzles because they are 'good for the brain' and his wife, Sally Humphreys, 36, recently organised a backgammon tournament for band members. Wood and Jagger perform together at Earl's Court, London during the band's heyday in 1976 . The band on stage in Stockholm, Sweden earlier this month during the latest leg of their current world tour . Wood has been sober since emerging from rehab in 2010 and he and his wife now have a completely alcohol-free fridge, he said. The couple met more than a decade ago when Wood was still married to ex-wife, Jo. But following his divorce and a string of rumoured younger partners, they got together in 2011 and married the following year. The Stones recently wrapped up the 14-show Scandinavian leg of their world tour, where they played to a total of more than 780,000 fans. Despite the foursome, made up of Wood, Jagger, Charlie Watts and Keith Richards, having a combined age of 280, they joked to the crowd in Roskilde: 'This band is really picking up steam now'. They are now due to play a nine-show tour of Australia and New Zealand starting October 25 and finishing November 22. The tour was postponed in March to allow Jagger time to mourn the death of his partner L'Wren Scott, who committed suicide in New York in March, aged 49. Wood's interview was published after Jagger spoke for the first time about his 'very hard' time since her death. He told the Today show in the US: 'I'm doing OK. It was difficult, you know, very hard year, but I got back into it by working on touring with the [Rolling] Stones in Europe, and doing other things.'","Rolling Stones were once famous for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll lifestyle .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Film fans have been left tantalising clues about what some scenes in the new Star Wars movie will look like – because the production crew left equipment behind in one of the locations. Last week cast and crew descended on Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, for a shoot, leading to intense speculation and excitement about how that location would feature in next year’s hotly anticipated blockbuster. Now, pictures have emerged of pieces of film kit scattered around the beauty spot, the crew having moved out. Left film kit behind, you have: Plugs and wires left in Puzzlewood, Gloucestershire, by the Star Wars Episode VII film crew litter the forest floor . Excitement: The location of the film equipment has led to speculation about just how the Forest of Dean will feature in the new film . Nonchalant: Some might wonder why the film crew weren't more careful about what they left behind . Lush: The Forest of Dean is known for its knotty pathways and pristine flowers, plants and trees . Wires, plugs and ramps haphazardly litter parts of the forest floor, with some  wasting no time casting an eye over the scene, eager to try and work out where the actors and actresses might have been filmed. Due for release in December next year, Star Wars: Episode VII features the stars of the original 1970s trilogy Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher alongside newcomers and unknowns. It will be set 40 years after the original films in the same fantasy galaxy, and fans have been buzzing with debate about which planet the lush green forest of Puzzlewood might represent. Clue: Might this clearing be one of the locations in J J Abrams' contribution to the space saga? Search: Some wasted no time casting an eye over the places where kit had been left, eager to work out where the actors and actresses might have been filmed . Following in their footsteps: Walkers trekked through Puzzlewood shortly after the cast and crew left . Bright idea: Floodlights seen at the edge of the forest, which has been used in several major productions . Atmospheric: The knotted trees and winding paths of Puzzlewood have been used to film the BBC fantasy dramas Dr Who, Merlin and Atlantis . The production recently made news when Harrison Ford broke his foot during filming. After initially being confined to a wheelchair, he is now walking on crutches . The knotted trees and winding paths of the forest, a popular family tourist attraction, were said to have been the inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien's enchanted woodlands in Lord of the Rings. More recently they have been used to film the BBC fantasy dramas Dr Who, Merlin and Atlantis. Fans have speculated Puzzlewood could be a return to the lush green territory inhabited by Yoda or the Forest Moon of Endor, inhabited by Ewoks. Some fans have speculated that the Forest of Dean could be used to represent the Forest Moon of Endor . Ideal: The Forest of Dean is the perfect place to recreate an other-worldly atmosphere . Wood you believe it: The film crew has a lot of tidying up to do after the week-long shoot . The film crew did their best to hide the reason they were at the site when it was first discovered . Sizing things up: The cast and crew occupied a huge area of land in Gloucestershire . For the original Star Wars trilogy, the spectacular redwood forests of northern California were used for the Forest Moon of Endor. And the frozen landscape of Hoth was represented by the northern wilderness of Norway - which was so cold in real life that some scenes were shot out of the crew's hotel doorway. Few details about the set have been released, but Kevin Smith - the director of Clerks (1994) and Dogma (1999) - gave a few tantalising details after a recent visit. In a Q&A session at the Neuchatel International Film Festival in Switzerland, he said: 'It was tactile; it wasn't a series of f****** green and blue screens in which later on digital characters would be added. It was there; it was happening. Cast and crew members pictured last week at their temporary home in the Forest of Dean . Due for release in December next year, Star Wars: Episode VII features the stars of the original 1970s trilogy - Mark Hamill (left), Harrison Ford (right) and Carrie Fisher (centre) 'It's like Field of Dreams,' he continued. 'And if [director J.J. Abrams] builds it, we’re all going to come because it's amazing. It looks fantastic. 'I cried, and I hugged that guy.' Star Wars will be hoping the scene they create at Forest of Dean is better than the last time the legendary films were shot in an English forest. Whippendell Woods near Watford, Hertfordshire, were used as the meeting point between The Phantom Menace's Jedi knights and Jar Jar Binks - probably the least beloved Star Wars character of all time.","Last week Star Wars Episode VII cast and crew descended on Puzzlewood .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A family were left baffled after discovering a strange ‘sea monster’ washed up on a British beach. Lisa Worthington, 42, chanced upon the creature while out walking the family dog with husband, Peter, 52, and their two children. The two-foot long skeletal remains were found on the high tide mark on the beach in Weston-Super-Mare, north Somerset. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: The two-foot skeletal remains of a sea creature were found on Weston-Super-Mare beach . The family decided to take the mysterious skeleton home so that her 10-year-old son Tyler could show his friends. Lisa, a stay-at-home mother, from Uphill, near Bristol, said: 'It was really quite strange. We were just walking the dogs when we stumbled across it. It was very strange. 'People have come up with some crazy ideas as to what it could be. My friend even thought it could be a llama, as the long tail-y bit looks like a neck. Odd: The remains baffled one marine biologist, who declared that he'd never seen anything like it before . Hot-spot: Weston-Super-Mare, in north Somerset, is popular with tourists in part thanks to its huge beach . 'I guess with it being washed up on the beach you would expect it to be a fish or something, but it doesn't look very fishy. 'My son was fascinated by it. I've definitely not seen anything like it before. He wanted to take it to school for show and tell. 'He carried it home in a big carrier bag. It absolutely stinks now though. I’ve told him he’s going to have to get rid of it.' The family posted an image of the skeleton on Facebook where speculation grew about what the creature could be. Mystery solved? One marine biologist believe the skeleton could be that of a thornback ray (pictured) Some suggested the animal was a lizard or swan whilst others claimed it was some kind of large fish or stingray. Marine biologist, Steve Simpson, said: 'This is certainly nothing I have seen before.' Other deep sea creature experts said that it was likely the skeleton was that of a thornback ray. Shelby Temple, a professor at Bristol University, said: 'I think that is the remains of a thornback ray (Raja clavata). 'They are fairly common on muddy/sandy substrates around the UK and Europe. 'The photos certainly make it look like a weird deep sea creature. You wouldn't want to inadvertently step on that tail!' The discovery followed a rare bluefin tuna worth close to £1million being brought ashore by five university friends in Cornwall. Another remarkable find: Five university friends found a rare bluefin tuna in Cornwall, worth around £1million . Strict EU laws designed to protect the critically endangered species – which are highly prized in Japan for raw fish dishes such as sushi and sashimi – mean it is illegal to catch or sell them. So Sarah Little, 22, Laura Pickervance and Shauna Creamer, both 23, and Charlotte Chambers and Hannah Ford, both 24, will not make a penny from the extraordinary find they made while holidaying in Cornwall. The 7ft 1in specimen, which was perfectly edible, has been sitting in a fisherman’s freezer prior to being taken to the University of Exeter on Sunday where it will be dissected and studied by experts, rather than served up in a restaurant.

"By . Ted Thornhill . The family of a 79-year-old widow have attacked the ‘joke’ sentence handed down to a hit-and run-driver who killed her - after he was jailed for just six months. Brenda Davies was hit by school caretaker Richard Thompson, 32, who had his children in the car at the time of the collision on December 3, 2012. The pensioner had been crossing a junction when she was struck by Thompson as she walked to buy her morning newspaper at around 7.30am. 'Joke' sentence: The family of Brenda Davies (pictured), killed in a hit-and-run, has criticised the six-month sentence handed down to the culprit . Tragic: The pensioner had been crossing a junction (pictured) in Rugeley when she was struck . She suffered catastrophic injuries including a fractured skull and smashed ribs and even had to have her leg amputated after the smash in Rugeley, Staffordshire. Brenda was rushed to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent and was on a life support machine for a week. The mother-of-one was transferred to Cannock Chase Hospital two weeks later but died from heart failure brought on by injuries from the accident on January 28, 2013. Anger: Ian Mancor, Mrs Davies' son, said the sentence handed out to the hit-and-run driver was 'ridiculous' Callous Thompson, who had his three children with him in the car at the time, fled the scene even though his BMW’s wing mirror was left in the road. A court heard he then dropped his kids off at his sister’s and arrived at work five minutes late, but told them he felt ill and went home. He later went on to the internet to check if there were any automatic traffic surveillance systems on the road and took no steps to notify the police about the collision. At home with the dog: Brenda Davies  in Rugeley, in the mid-1990s, while in her mid-to-late 60s . Thompson, of Rugeley, was due to face trial this September but changed his plea and admitted causing Mrs Davies’s death by careless driving. He also pleaded guilty to failing to stop and failing to report an accident but was given a jail term of just six months at Stafford Crown Court on Friday. Judge Simon Tonking also banned Thompson from driving for a just two years. Yesterday, Mrs Davies’ only son, Ian Mancor, blasted the ‘ridiculous’ sentence and said the law needed to be changed. Gathering: Brenda Davies (second left), pictured at her home in Rugeley in the mid-1990s, was left with catastrophic injuries by the 2012 incident . The 59-year-old, who lives in Stafford, said: ‘I was appalled. I was expecting a much longer sentence. The man drove off and then lied about what he’d done. ‘He was obviously guilty because innocent people don’t flee the scene. When they caught him he told lies, he denied he had been at the scene. ‘He said the wing mirror had been stolen a few weeks before. ‘I just feel that justice hasn’t been done. What worth is a human life? An old lady going about her business was run down and he didn’t stop at all. ‘He will be out in three months. And he only got a two year driving ban and he will be back on the roads. ‘It’s disgusting, the law needs to be changed. If you shoot somebody they take the gun off you and you don’t get it back. ‘A car is as lethal as a gun, but you run somebody down and you get it back in two years. It’s absurd.’ Retired social worker Mr Mancor also told how Thompson changed his plea several times, dragging the court process out for almost two years. He added: ‘He pleaded guilty initially and then he wanted to vacate his plea. Because of that we were in court a number of times so it dragged it out. ‘It was going to go to trial in February but was put back to June. Then it was put back to September and it was only a few weeks ago that he changed his plea. ‘I don’t know why he did it but I can only presume he saw the pathologist report and knew the game was up. ‘I had to go off with stress for four months. I went back to work afterwards but I just couldn’t concentrate and went off again on long-term leave. I then took voluntary redundancy.’ Prosecutor Nick Burn told the court an eyewitness described Thompson’s black BMW ‘screaming round the bend towards me’. Mr Burn added: ‘It’s plain she had entered the crossing when the defendant’s vehicle, travelling in the Stafford direction, was in collision with her.’ Thompson was arrested and later admitted he was the driver, but told police he was unaware he had struck a person and thought it was an animal. Defending him in court, Steve Hennessey said: ‘He simply didn’t see Mrs Davies.’ Mr Mancor, who is single and has no children, is now writing to his MP, Jeremy Lefroy, in a bid to get the sentencing rules in cases of causing death by careless driving tightened up. And he said his mother, who was widowed twice, had been a bright and active woman who walked a mile and a quarter every day and was a member of her local gym. Mr Mancor added: ‘We would meet up in Stafford for a coffee and a panini and she would catch the bus in. ‘She was also a keen gardener and enjoyed doing cryptic crosswords. It was harrowing to see her deteriorate in hospital. ‘Had she lived, she would have needed 24-hour care. It was heart-rending.’ Mrs Davies worked as a museum guide and at the National Association for Widows, but was retired at the time of the horror smash. Her first husband, James Mancor, passed away in 1977 aged 70 and her second spouse, Garfield Davies, a retired headmaster, died aged 60 in 1984 just a year after they had married.","Brenda Davies was hit by school caretaker Richard Thompson, 32 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A teenage girl has described how she used her brown-belt karate skills to fight off a hooded man who attacked her in broad daylight and initially knocked her out cold. Terrified Shannon Stacey was walking along a path close to her home in Normanby, near Middlesbrough, at about 1pm on Friday when she noticed a large branch on the ground blocking her path. As she bent down to move it, her attacker jumped out from bushes and punched her in the face so hard that she blacked out and fell to the ground. Terrified: Shannon Stacey, 16, has spoken of her ordeal at the hands of a hooded attacker . The 16-year-old said: ‘I was walking from the bus stop with my earphones in when I felt something hit the side of my face. ‘It didn’t know what to think at first; everything went dark and I could hear a buzzing sound before I saw a man stood over me. It was then I realised he had punched me.’ The attacker, who was wearing a snood-type scarf covering his face and grey gloves, demanded Shannon hand over her phone, money and shopping bags, but the brave teenager refused. She said: ‘My reaction was to say no. I was in complete shock.’ The attacker punched and kicked Shannon, who has just left Eston Park Academy, at least another three times before pinning her to the ground. Shannon said: ‘He hit me again, and told me to hand over my bags so I threw one at him, and I was trying to block his punches. He had me pinned to the ground.’ Shannon, who has a brown belt in karate, managed to fight off the thug before running home just yards away. Shocking: The attacker punched and kicked Shannon, who has just left Eston Park Academy, before pinning her to the ground on a secluded pathway . ‘I kicked and punched as much as I could and he eventually stopped,’ Shannon added. ‘I was screaming as loud as possible which I think must have scared him off.’ The attacker fled empty-handed on a red and white bike towards Normanby centre. Mother Helen Stacey, who was in the kitchen at the time of the attack, said: ‘Shannon ran through the gate screaming and crying with blood pouring from her face. It’s any mother’s worst nightmare - I instantly thought the worst when she said a man had jumped on her. ‘I rang the police who were here in minutes. It was just horrendous. We were all in a state of panic and shock.’ Shannon was taken to Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital for X-rays on her face and wrist. Helen, also mother to Adam, 12, and Joe, two, described Shannon as ‘brave and courageous’ for fighting off her attacker. ‘I’m just glad she has done karate,’ she added. ‘She has been very brave, and we just all hope whoever did this is caught before it happens to someone else.’ Shannon’s attacker is described as being in his twenties, tanned, of average build, with a local accent. He was wearing a grey tracksuit. Cleveland Police said: 'We are investigating but haven't made any arrests yet.' Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101.","Shannon Stacey was attacked on a path close to her home in Normanby .

"By . Julian Robinson . She faced 20 years of heart-ache, spent £30,000 and even remortgaged her house refusing to give up hope of becoming a mother. But cradling her new born daughter in her arms, Louise Gilbert said the two decades of grueling IVF treatment, crippling emotional stress and severe financial strain was a price worth paying. The 39-year-old, from Sandhurst in Berkshire,  was just a teenager when she was told she had already been through the menopause. In the years to come, she endured the heartbreak of failed IVF treatments, three miscarriages and a divorce. Louise Gilbert, pictured with her baby Sofia, went through the menopause when she was just a teenager . But she has no regrets and her dream finally became reality two years ago when her daughter Sofia was born. Mrs Gilbert, a hairdresser, was left . devastated when she was told by a doctor in 1994 that she was going through the . menopause at an extremely young age. She said: 'By 2004 I had been trying to . get pregnant for 10 years. I'd come off the pill when I was 19 and had . IVF three times, each time a failure. 'I was completely heartbroken. I felt as if my dream had crumbled around me. 'Holding . Sofia in my arms for the first time was an unreal experience. I now . have the perfect family. It's something I never thought I'd have.' Despite the odds being stacked against her, . Mrs Gilbert and her first husband, whom she married in 1999 and has . since divorced, resolved to try IVF, eventually remortgaging their house . to pay for repeated attempts. Louise Gilbert, pictured right when she was pregnant for the final time, says she has no regrets about waiting 20 years and spending £30,000 in the hope of conceiving her daughter Sofia, left, now almost two years old . She said: 'I insisted on an ultrasound scan on my womb to see if there were any eggs left in my ovaries. 'The scan confirmed that I'd gone the whole way through the menopause already, and I was no longer producing eggs. 'I'd been on the pill for several years so had no way of knowing when the change had happened. I was desperate for children, but I was told there was no chance of having my own biological child.' The couple were not eligible for NHS funding - but she vowed to do whatever it took to become a mother. She appealed for an egg donor by putting an advert in a magazine and in 2001 she started private treatment at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Despite conceiving twins, both foetuses were sadly lost. A second round,which brought the total cost to that point to more than £8,000, also failed to produce a viable pregnancy. Mrs Gilbert said: 'I felt cheated because I put myself through so much. Mark Gilbert, pictured, 'could not stop crying' when little Sofia was born in July 2012 . 'Finding a donor had been a nerve-wracking experience and I wasn't sure I could do it again.' The couple then tried an egg-sharing scheme at a fertility clinic in Aldridge in the West Midlands. She said: 'This time the treatment cost £10,000. We were told even before we started that it was unlikely to work, but we pushed ahead anyway. It was a time of huge disappointment and heartbreak. 'I was constantly worried about money. All my friends were becoming pregnant.' Mrs Gilbert's first marriage eventually ended in divorce in 2004. Cracks started to develop in the relationship as the stresses and strains of the ordeal started to take their toll and they eventually agreed to go their separate ways. 'We were arguing all the time. Having IVF really put pressure on our relationship,' she told The Mirror. 'Not having a baby just highlighted our other difficulties. We’d been together since we were kids and at that age we didn’t know any different. 'We were very different people as we grew up that started to show.' This scan, during the final course of IVF treatment, was the image they had both been waiting for . Louise Gilbert, pictured with her baby Sofia, never gave up hope of being able to give birth . Newly single, she decided to take the opportunity to focus on her own health and wellbeing, joining a gym and losing more than three stone. 'I changed my social circle and found more friends. I tried enjoying life a bit more,' she said. After setting up a mobile hairdressing business she met Mark Gilbert, 37, a vehicle mechanic, who was the brother of a client. The pair married in May 2011. Six months later, they flew to a fertility clinic in Marbella, Spain, where she would receive an egg donation and IVF treatment at a cost of another £10,000. Mrs Gilbert said: 'I knew the time was right to try for a baby again and Mark felt the same way. 'A client mentioned that someone she worked with had had a baby at the clinic and I was encouraged to hear that the centre had a high success rate. The years of trying finally paid off for Louise Gilbert when she saw this scan having become pregnant in 2012 . Louise and Mark Gilbert, pictured right on their wedding day, flew to a fertility clinic in Marbella, Spain, where she would receive an egg donation and IVF treatment. It proved successful with the birth of Sofia, left . 'I felt much more relaxed - it was very helpful to be able to get away from the UK and not juggle the demands of treatment with the pressure of work. 'I was extremely nervous. I'd lost pregnancies during treatment before and part of me knew that this round was doomed to failure too.' The treatment resulted in Mrs Gilbert conceiving twins with her husband, but hopes were tempered when one of the foetuses was lost ten weeks into the pregnancy. She said: 'I just prayed that the other twin would hang on. I had several sleepless nights. I could feel the baby kicking within me, but part of me still refused to believe we would actually get to the finishing line.' On July 25, 2012, Mrs Gilbert finally allowed herself to celebrate when given her newborn daughter Sofia to hold in her arms. The couple plan to save up enough money to return to the clinic in Spain in the hope of producing a brother or sister for Sofia, pictured . She said: 'Mark couldn't stop crying. We were over the moon. Having been through so much over the years, I was simply overjoyed. 'If only I'd known about the Marbella clinic earlier, perhaps I wouldn't have had to live for so long with so much disappointment. Now I want as many people as possible to know about it, because I know there are thousands of other women out there who are in the same position as I was. 'Once we've got the money, I'd like to go back to the clinic to give Sofia a little brother or sister. It would be wonderful to make our family larger. 'But if things stay as they are, I would be perfectly content.

"By . Julian Robinson . Rebecca May, pictured, needed an urgent transplant after her liver turned green and swelled to twice its original size . A teenager was left with yellow eyes and a green liver after developing a disease so rare that experts still have no idea what is wrong with her. Becky May, from Plymouth in Devon, first noticed a problem when her eyes went a funny hue. She went on to visit hospital every week for six months as doctors tried to work out what was wrong. Medics discovered the 19-year-old's liver had swelled to twice its size and turned green, immediately putting the teenager on the transplant list. Liver specialists, who performed the operation, are still baffled by the mystery illness. She said: 'I went to my GP about something else but had noticed my eyes were yellow. 'The doctor was pretty concerned that I might have hepatitis and did a blood test straight away. 'I went to a special jaundice clinic where they tried to investigate the most obvious reasons why my eyes might be yellow. 'When they first mentioned the word ""transplant"" I was terrified. The thought of being operated on freaked me out. 'Because I didn’t really know what was wrong with me I didn’t know if the transplant process would be the same as for other people.' Finally it was decided that she should be put on the organ donor list - and her listing was backdated six months. After first being listed on December 5, 2013, she received a phone call on December 29 to say there was a liver waiting. The teenager said: 'The caller said an ambulance would be round in an hour to pick me up, but it was there within 10 minutes. We actually beat the liver to the hospital in the end. 'The liver was split - which means I got the large right lobe and a child was given the smaller left lobe. They both grow to become fully functioning livers.' She was taken to King’s College Hospital, in London, where the seven-hour operation began at 7am on December 30. Her liver was green because of all the bile she wasn’t managing to process. Becky remained at King’s for 12 days, and then was transferred to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. She said: “The first few days I wasn’t allowed to get up and couldn’t eat. When someone has a split liver they can’t eat for four days to protect the connection. 'When I left hospital it was a case of trying to get my strength back, but it took me a while because I had lost most of my muscle mass and slept so much in hospital. 'But I realised how lucky I am - I just though that I could be dead - so I’d better get up and do stuff. Becky May was transferred to Derriford Hospital, pictured, in Plymouth after having her liver transplant. Doctors say they still do not know what has caused the 19-year-old's illness . 'I’ll be on immune support medication . for the rest of my life to make sure the liver doesn’t reject, and I . have just come off steroids which they give younger people to make sure . it doesn’t reject. 'I don’t really know how I managed to get through it all. I wanted to protect my family and friends so I tried not to talk too much about it. 'My friends were 17 when I got ill and I thought that they might not be able to deal with it, but my boyfriend Sam got most of my moaning.' The 19-year-old, who will begin a degree at Plymouth College of Art in September, said: 'I’m really looking forward to starting at university - this time last year I didn’t think I would be able to. 'I got ill just before my 18th birthday so I couldn’t go out and have a drink to celebrate. 'It's more important to me now to get what I want out of life and not just plod along' 'But I’m never going to be able to do that now, which bothers me, but when you put it in perspective it doesn’t really matter.' Becky said the experience had inspired her to make sure she has a successful future and refuses to lead a 'mediocre' life. She said: 'It’s more important to me now to get what I want out of life and not just plod along. I don’t want to be mediocre anymore. 'I’m in the process of writing a letter to thank my donor’s family and show them that I’m making the most of it. I’m so thankful - I’m only alive because of someone else. 'And a family that are grieving - that they could think of someone else at that time is amazing.' Katie Ramos, 35, is a liver transplant and HCC nurse at Derriford Hospital, and has worked closely with Becky throughout her treatment. She said: 'It took so long to work out what was wrong with Becky basically because she is the first one to have it. We still don’t really know what it is because it’s so rare. 'She has been remarkable the way she has dealt with everything, and the donors should be thanked for their gift to people like Becky.'","Becky May's condition so rare doctors don't know what's wrong with her .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Potholes are the bug bane of every driver, but it seems that they're not a modern affliction. Archaeologists have discovered that as far back as the Roman Empire, drivers were forced to deal with faulty and uneven road surfaces. Wheel ruts found in a newly excavated road surface in Devon are thought to be similar to those at Pompeii, and were caused by carts being driven over them. A Roman road discovered on an archaeological dig has repairs to the road surface, proving pot holes are nothing new. Small pieces of clay and rocks (pictured) were found that had been laid after the original rocks had been placed, suggesting the Romans attempted to fill these ruts and make the road smoother . Clay and rocks found in these ruts, that appear to have been laid after the original rocks had been placed, suggest the Romans attempted to fill them to make the road smoother. Archaeologist Danielle Wootton, the Devon Finds Liaison Officer for the Portable Antiquities Scheme said: ‘The road must have been extensively used, it’s intriguing to think what the horse-drawn carts may have been carrying and who was driving them. 'This is a fantastic opportunity to see a snapshot of life 2,000 years ago.’ The excavation at Ipplepen began following the discovery of a complex series of archaeological features thought to be part of the largest Romano-British settlement in Devon outside of Exeter.

"By . Julian Robinson . Older people are more likely to have a stroke if they are suffering from depression or stress, research has found (file image) Stress, hostility and depression put older people at much greater risk of suffering a stroke, a new study has warned. The three factors are associated with a 'significantly increased risk' of stroke in middle-age and older adults, researchers have found. Hostility alone more than doubled the likelihood of having a full-blown or 'mini' stroke, also known as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), a study claims. Chronic stress increased stroke and TIA risk by 59 per cent, and depressive symptoms by 86 per cent. Scientists used questionnaires to assess chronic stress, depressive symptoms, anger and hostility in 6,700 men and women aged 45 to 84. Over a period of eight-and-a-half to 11 years, a total of 147 strokes and 48 TIAs occurred within the group. The only trait not linked to a higher risk of stroke was anger, despite the strong association with hostility. The researchers defined hostility as a 'negative way of viewing the world' and measured it by assessing participants’ cynicism. Study leader Dr Susan Everson-Rose, from the University of Minnesota in the U.S., said: 'There’s such a focus on traditional risk factors - cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking and so forth - and those are all very important, but studies like this one show that psychological characteristics are equally important. 'Given our ageing population, it’s important to consider these other factors that might play a role in disease risk. 'Stroke is a disease of the elderly predominantly, and so learning more about things that can influence risk for stroke as people age is important.' The findings are published in the American Heart Association journal Stroke. Chronic stress was measured in five different areas relating to personal health, the health problems of close others, work or the ability to do a job, relationships and finances. Scientists used questionnaires to assess chronic stress, depressive symptoms, anger and hostility in 6,700 men and women aged 45 to 84 . Based on participants’ answers, scores were allocated for depressive symptoms and anger levels. The associations remained significant after accounting for age, race, sex, lifestyle and other factors known to influence stroke risk. Dr Everson-Rose added: 'One thing we didn’t assess is coping strategies. 'If someone is experiencing depressive symptoms or feeling a lot of stress or hostility, we don’t know how they manage those, so it’s possible that positive coping strategies could ameliorate some of these associations or effects. 'We did not inquire about coping. I would say that’s one of the tasks for future studies.'","Depression and stress associated with 'significantly increased risk' of stroke .

"By . Daniel Martin . Anger: The Labour leader criticised the Government for its ‘inexplicable silence’ over civilian casualties in the Palestinian territory under attack from Israel . Ed Miliband’s ‘ultra-critical’ attack on David Cameron’s response to the Gaza crisis will hamper Britain’s ability to help bring about peace in the Middle East, the Tories said yesterday. The Labour leader criticised the Government for its ‘inexplicable silence’ over civilian casualties in the Palestinian territory and its failure to tell Israel that its actions are ‘unacceptable and unjustifiable’. Yesterday Justice Secretary Chris Grayling hit back, saying ultra-critical comments about Israel would make it harder for Britain to help find a peaceful solution. And Downing Street accused Mr Miliband of playing politics with the Middle Eastern conflict because he feels the public is increasingly taking the side of the Palestinians. As the row intensified, Mr Grayling said: ‘I think we in Britain have to be enormously careful to try and work in a way that encourages a ceasefire, encourages an end to the action on both sides. ‘I don’t think it helps if we make strong comments that are going to put us in less of a position to do that.’ The row came as an Israeli strike killed ten and wounded 35 at a United Nations school in the town of Rafah, which was being used as a shelter for people displaced by the 27-day conflict between Israel and Hamas. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon described it as a ‘moral outrage and a criminal act’. But Mr Cameron has refused to join a growing international clamour led by those who regard Israel’s tactics as disproportionate. The Labour leader had said the Prime Minister was ‘wrong’ not to oppose Israel’s incursion into Gaza, adding: ‘His silence on the killing of hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians caused by Israel’s military action will be inexplicable to people across Britain and internationally.’ Last night Mr Miliband, who describes himself as an ‘atheist Jew’, stood by his comments. He told Channel 4 News: ‘I speak as a friend of Israel ... but I think that day by day, as we see these outrages on our television screens, Israel is losing friends in the international community.’ More than 60 of Mr Miliband’s relatives are believed to have been killed in the Holocaust. 'Moral outrge': A man carries one of the victims of the Israeli attack on a UN-run school in Rafah, southern Gaza . A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We are shocked that Mr Miliband would seek to misrepresent [Mr Cameron’s] position and play politics with such a serious issue.’ More than 1,750 Palestinians have died since Israel began its operation to prevent Hamas missile strikes into its territory and block tunnels used to launch cross-border raids. Israel has lost 64 soldiers and three civilians. ‘I don’t think it helps if we make strong comments': Justice Secretary Chris Grayling hit back at Mr Miliband, saying ultra-critical comments about Israel would make it harder for Britain to help find a peaceful solution . █ Jon Snow has been accused by his peers of peddling propaganda in his reporting on Gaza. The Channel 4 News presenter made an online video appeal that described the growing death toll among children and called for action from viewers. ‘We actually share some responsibility for those deaths, because for us it is no priority whatsoever to stop it,’ he said in the YouTube clip. But BBC Afghanistan Correspondent David Loyn criticised him, saying: ‘Emotion is the stuff of propaganda, and news is against propaganda.’ Channel 4 News said the clip received ‘overwhelmingly positive feedback’. Buried: Rescuers claw at the rubble of a house after finding a young boy trapped by an Israeli air strike . Trapped in the rubble, a wounded boy cries in terror and pain as Palestinian rescuers fight to free him. The youngster was pulled to safety from the rubble of a house destroyed by an airstrike in Rafah that killed at least nine members of the same family. After another day of bloodshed, UN officials said it was powerless to help many of the injured because almost half of Gaza’s medics are unable to get to work. Rafah has been targeted by Israeli strikes from land, sea and air. Palestinians say corpses are littering the streets and casualties have to be treated on the floors of overcrowded hospitals, which have also been hit.

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Ed Miliband’s political guru has joked that Labour should ‘tax the dead’ to pay for long-term care – because they can’t vote.

He is a good friend of Ed Miliband, right . At the same conference, the party’s spokesman for civil society, Lisa Nandy, said she thought a compulsory levy on people’s estates was a ‘reasonable idea’. The controversial comments were caught on tape in January at a conference organised by the Fabian Society think tank. Lord Glasman, a close friend of Mr Miliband, has spoken out in favour of a compulsory levy. At the conference delegates were asked to vote on their favoured policies – and the levy was among the top five. Also appearing at the meeting, Miss Nandy said she was ‘keen on this’, adding: ‘I think this is a reasonable idea.’ Plans for a compulsory levy on estates to pay for social care were mooted before the last election but was scrapped by Gordon Brown, pictured, because of its unpopularity . The plan for a compulsory levy on estates to pay for social care – dubbed a ‘death tax’ by critics – had been mooted before the last election but was scrapped by Gordon Brown because of its unpopularity. Andy Burnham, the party’s health spokesman, has often said he would like to see such a levy. But Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, told LBC Radio yesterday: ‘It is not the policy of the Labour Party to have a tax on death.’ The Conservatives said a 15 per cent levy would lead to the average Briton paying £46,000. Tory backbench MP Bob Neill said Lord Glasman’s ‘incredibly distasteful’ remarks showed a lack of respect for taxpayers. ‘Labour’s appetite for extra taxes and wasteful spending knows no bounds,’ he said.","Lord Glasman jokes Labour should 'tax the dead' to pay for long-term care because they can't vote .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . A third year of drought in California has meant farmers have become increasingly  dependent on ground water for their crops - and now the land is sinking beneath their feet. A USGS study found that land sinking had been measured at nearly one-foot per year in one area in the San Joaqin Valley, and that it is reducing the flow capacity of the Delta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct, two key sources of water. Increased pumping of groundwater is damaging vital water infrastructure, the U.S. Geological Survey says. No end: Houseboats and boat docks on Digger Bay Marina in Shasta Lake City, California on 24 July 2014. Water levels show below the reddish banks which is 41 meters (135 ft) from crest and 36 per cent of capacity as California goes through its third straight year of dry weather . Sinking feeling: Visitors take photographs at the bottom of Folsom Lake, which is 17 per cent of its capacity, in Folsom, California . 'We were surprised at the amount of land being affected,' Michelle Sneed, a USGS hydrologist and the report's lead author. 'We were also surprised by the rapid rate of (sinking).' Case Vlot, a farmer who uses groundwater to keep his crops of corn and alfalfa alive says the ground at his Central Valley farm is sinking between six and eight inches a year. Chase Hurley runs a water company nearby that sells river water to farmers who don't have groundwater to depends on. Now, reports SF Gate, Vlot's underground wells are collapsing and the dam Hurley depends on has sunk so far that the river is threatening to spill over. The two, along with other California farmers, are trying to brainstorm ways to curb the heavy reliance on groundwater and that resulting damage. Farmer Case Vlot stands in a dry river bed that has sunk due to subsidence . And farms aren't the only ones suffering from the sinking land. Railways, roads and pipelines - things that extend over a long distance - are also under threat from an increase in the rate of ground sinking, Sneed said. For California's bullet train project, which would speed through the Central Valley, the sinking ground is being taken into account for the system's design, Frank Vacca, the chief program manager for the California High Speed Rail Authority. He said the rail system will be made of a flexible material that can give into movement. Huntington Lake, California: An observation deck over the lake is left high and dry as the water level in Huntington Lake is only a third full . Crisis: Cattle graze before near the California Aqueduct on grassland that remains dry and brown at the height of the rainy season . 'This is just one more box to check on our list of engineering considerations,' Vacca said. Woodley said the issue has already affected construction projects on the massive San Joaquin River restoration, already projected to cost $1 billion. The issue of sinking land in the San Joaquin Valley is not new, but had slowed in recent decades after the construction of the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal. But the sinking problem in the two years studied 2008-2010 was exacerbated by drought, the report found. In those dry years, there was less rain, but also limits placed by water regulators on surface water use. This caused farmers and others to increase the amount of water pumped from underground; there are no restrictions on groundwater pumping in California.","The ground is sinking up to a foot each year each year in California farming areas .

"By . Alex Greig . A New York City morning show correspondent who had to deliver a live report in a bikini was also forced to endure the inappropriate comments of an over-excited Fox anchor back in the studio. One could be forgiven for thinking Good Morning New York co-host Greg Kelly, 45, had never seen a woman in a swimsuit, such was his enthusiasm for a bikini-clad Anna Gilligan, who went to New Jersey's Action Park to try out the new Tarzan rope swing. The segment was a lighthearted report on the park's new attractions but became increasingly awkward as Kelly, the son of former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly, was unable to contain his enthusiasm for Gilligan's figure. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Demanding job: Kelly said she didn't know which was more scary - disrobing on live TV or the Tarzan ride - but little did she know there was worse to come . Making a splash: Gilligan went flying through the air, plunged into the water and made it back in front of the camera in record time . Inappropriate: That's when things became somewhat awkward, with Kelly repeatedly commenting about her body despite his co-host's admonishments . 'I don’t know which is scarier, the ride of taking off my clothes,' Gilligan said before stripping off her robe and swinging out over the water before letting go. 'Wow, here she goes - in a two-piece!' Kelly observed as Gilligan took the plunge into the water. She swam over the the edge of the water and emerged dripping wet to put her earpiece back in and report back on her experiences in record time, as Kelly observed, 'Look at her, it's like something out of a movie... Indeed.' His co-host in the studio Rosanna Scotto urged him to 'stay appropriate,' but before Gilligan could get a word in, Kelly had leered, 'Nice swimsuit,' and asked her why she was so out of breath. Gilligan admirably ploughed through it, ignoring Kelly's remarks before attempting to sign off so she could go and get dressed again, but Kelly wasn't having it. video source Fox New York . Awkward: An enthusiastic Kelly was so eager to keep the reporter on-screen even as she tried to sign off that the cameraman took the camera off Gilligan to focus it on the pool . Unimpressed: Kelly's co-host Rosanna Scotta warned him repeatedly to 'be nice' and 'stay appropriate' before finally asking him, 'What is wrong with you?' Later: The High Anxiety ride Anna Gilligan tried out later in the day can't have caused her any more grief than the swimsuit segment with Greg Kelly . 'Hold on a second, not so fast Anna!' he shouted, before asking her a series of pointless questions. 'I just want to talk to her for a little while,' Kelly told Scotto after she admonished him to 'be nice' and 'stop milking this shot.'

"By . Lydia Warren . and Alex Greig . Monica Lewinsky has spoken out about becoming 'the most humiliated woman in the world' when salacious details of her affair with then-President Bill Clinton emerged. As part of her return to the spotlight, Lewinsky shared details in a new National Geographic documentary, 'The 90s: The Last Great Decade?', which will air starting next Sunday. On Tuesday, the Today show gave a first . glimpse at the three-part special, in which Lewinsky, now 40, opens . up about the day a 445-page report by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was published. 'That was one of the worst days of my life,' she said. 'I was a virgin to humiliation of that level, until that day... I was the most humiliated woman in the world. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky will appear in a special NatGeo documentary detailing how her world was turned upside down when details of her affair with Bill Clinton emerged in the 90s . 'To have my narrative ripped from me, and turned into the Starr report, and things that were turned over or things they delved out of my computer that I thought were deleted. I mean it was just violation after violation.' Lewinsky, who was 22 when she first began her affair with the president, said she was also left devastated by the media coverage. 'To be called stupid, and a slut, and a bimbo, and ditzy, and to be taken out of context, it was excruciating,' she said. 'To be in the vortex of this media maelstrom was quite alarming, and frightening. And confusing. I think a lot, too, had to do with the fact that I was a woman.' Stepping out: Lewinsky attended the Marie Curie Timeless Party at the Royal Hospital in London on Monday . Lewinksy's . interview, which also shares her suicidal thoughts and whether or not . she feels she deserves an apology from Clinton, will air on Monday. Her re-emergence into the spotlight comes after 10 years of self-imposed exile. The . former White House intern made her intentions known with a revealing . article in May's issue of Vanity Fair, in which she made her desire to . move beyond her affair with President Clinton clear. 'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,' she wrote in the Vanity Fair . story. 'I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President . Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.' And . on Monday night, Lewinsky cut a stylish figure as she stepped out at . the Masterpiece Marie Curie party at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in . London. Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Sitting pretty: Lewinsky, pictured at the event on Monday, has said she decided to 'stick her head above the parapet' and come out of her self-imposed exile nearly two decades since the scandal . She mingled with stars such as Clive Owen, Yasmin Le Bon and Princess Beatrice at the event to benefit the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity,  which provides home nurses to people with terminal cancer. The timing of Lewinsky's decision to return to the spotlight coincides with the release of Hillary Clinton's memoir Hard Choices as speculation as to whether she will run in 2016 ramps up. Lewinsky says that after laying low when Hillary ran for office in 2008, she's unprepared to put her life on hold for another possibly eight to 10 years. 'I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past - and other people’s futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.' Life-altering: Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures . Hillary Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and wants everyone else to do the same. The former Secretary of State also revealed she did not read an essay Ms Lewinsky wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated her husband's presidency. In an interview for People magazine in early June, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future.' However, Republicans have signaled they don't consider her husband's scandal from the late 1990s out of bounds in the realm of 2016-style political dialogue. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely GOP . presidential contender, answered criticisms of the Republican record on . women's issues by saying in January that the last Democratic president . engaged in 'predatory behavior' with a woman, Lewinsky, who was 22 when . her liaisons with Clinton began in 1995. Memoir: Hillary Clinton has been doing the rounds on a press tour of her new book Hard Choices. She says she has 'moved on' from the Lewinsky scandal . Hillary Clinton also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public. Lewinsky says she wants to use her experiences to help others facing public humiliation, citing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi, who killed himself after he was streamed via webcam kissing another man and was ridiculed on social media. 'Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?' she wrote. 'My current goal is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.","Lewinsky, now 40, will appear in a National Geographic special next week .

"By . Alex Greig . A Kazakh woman left disfigured after undergoing radiation therapy for cancer in her jaw that she never had is undergoing reconstructive surgery at a Kentucky hospital Monday morning. Lessya Kotelevskaya, 30, is receiving the $1 million surgery for free after a doctor at the University of Louisville Hospital heard about her plight and offered to help. It is expected to take up to 24 hours to complete. Kotelevskaya was misdiagnosed with cancer in her jaw in 2001 and underwent intensive radiation therapy that left a gaping hole in her cheek and no jaw bone. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Undergoing surgery: Lessya Kotelevskaya received aggressive radiation therapy for a cancer she never had after being misdiagnosed by Kazakh doctors . She was wheeled into surgery around 7:30 this morning. Her surgeon, Dr Jarrod A. Little, is working for free and will spend the next 24 hours in surgery with Kotelevskaya. Her cousin Oleg Sennick, 43, who moved to the U.S. in 1996, discovered her struggling to survive in 2012 and brought her to the U.S. for treatment. It was while he was working as a hairdresser that Sennik mentioned his cousin's situation to a client, who happened to be married to a doctor from the University of Louisville Hospital. She mentioned the case to her husband, and he said his colleagues may be able to help. 'She has a terrible problem, I know how to fix it. The rest is immaterial,' Little told ABC. Little will remove the dead tissue from Kotelevskaya's jaw, then take a piece of her leg bone and attach it, with skin and blood vessels attached, to the remnants of her jawbone and secure it using screws and a titanium plate. Big day: Dr Little speaks with Lessya Kotelevskaya and her cousin Oleg Sennik before surgery this morning . Long-lost cousin: Oleg Sennik spent years searching for his cousin Lessya Kotelevskaya after moving to the U.S. in 1993 only to discover her destitute and sick . Little says helping people like Kotelevskaya is what made him want to become a doctor. 'Plastic . surgery is typically associated with cosmetic stuff, and this is the . other part of plastics that took 11 years of training after college,' he . told ABC. 'This makes it all worthwhile.' Kotelevskaya has been so excited about the surgery that she hasn't been able to sleep, Sennik said. 'I just want to become a normal person . so I don't have to concentrate on my face,' Kotelevskaya, who had been living at a car wash when she was rescued by her cousin, told the Sun Herald. 24-hour surgery: Dr Jarrod Little is performing the surgery, which is expected to take up to a day and costs $1 million . The mother of a . seven-year-old boy, Erik, was 19 when she was told she had terminal . cancer in her jaw. She had gone to her doctor after being elbowed in the . face during a basketball game. The aggressive radiation treatment . she was given disfigured her face and made it difficult for her to eat, . talk or live a normal life. Her cousin says she was also given an abortion without her knowledge or consent. The 30-year-old can barely open her mouth and for nearly ten years believed she had a terminal disease. 'She pulls food apart and jams it behind her teeth and it leaks out the other side,' Little told ABC. 'She has gotten really innovative dealing with it.' For more than 10 years Lessya Kotelevskaya hid from society after aggressive cancer treatment left a gaping hole in her cheek. Her . husband left her after she became pregnant with her son, Erik, and . she began living on the edge of society, sometimes without a roof over . her head and taking on menial night jobs so that no one could see her . face. As well as damaging . her face, the misdiagnosis ruined Ms Kotelevskaya's life. She was . married and helped run her own clothing store at the time but, when the . treatment left her unable to eat or speak properly her husband left in . 2007 and the store was forced to close. Life-changing: Lessya Kotelevskaya, pictured in 2013, is to be given reconstructive surgery to repair damage caused by radiation treatment . Reunited: With her cousin's help, Kotelevskaya has begin making a new life in the U.S., where her son is in the first grade . 'She couldn’t work, because everybody would look at her and say something’s wrong with her, and she’s going to die anyway,. She was totally rejected by society,' Oleg Sennik, her cousin, told the Courier-Journal. With no business or immediate family to rely on, Kotelevskaya began a life in the shadows of society. To avoid the unkind stares of strangers, the mother took night jobs such as cleaning gyms or carrying sand to . people's doorways in winter. At one point, she was so hard up that Kotelevskaya, who has to hold a towel to her face when she eats to prevent food dribbling out the hole in her cheek, had to live in the utility room of a car wash. When her cousin eventually traced her, she weighed just 79lb. Sennik took her for treatment in  Ukraine, where he had been raised, and it was there that she first realized her cancer diagnosis was wrong. The first 72 hours after the surgery will be critical, says Little, because of the risk of a blot clot, which would undo all the work. Kotelevskaya will need to spend the next three weeks after the surgery in hospital recovering. Adjusting: Kotelevskaya and her son Erik enjoy their first Christmas in the U.S. in 2013 . Little explained that it was possible for doctors to mistakenly identify benign tumors in the jawbone for cancer. 'If you're not accustomed to looking at them underneath the . microscope, or you don't have specialized pathologists like we do here, . they can be mistaken for malignant tumors,' he said. To repair the damage suffered by Kotelevskaya, she had initial surgery on November 14. Today's operation is the final piece of the puzzle. Little said the procedure was common practice for his medical team because Kentucky has some of the highest rates of head and neck cancer. 'She missed so many years of her life. She said that this is the first time she’s feeling like she doesn’t have to hide,' Sennik said.

"By . Alex Greig . A six-year-old boy has died after he was pulled unresponsive from a suburban Chicago swimming pool during a summer camp program. Michael Duda from Justice was swimming with 72 other children at a Bridgeview public pool as part of the Village of Justice Park District summer camp. Bridgeview police said in a press release that the children were being cared for by 10 adult camp counselors. Tragic death: Michael Duda, six, was pulled unresponsive from a pool during a summer camp outing and later died . Police are now interviewing camp counselors and witnesses and have seen security footage taken of the pool. 'We have reviewed the videotape taken from the pool security cameras, but they do not show much other than the boy being rescued from the shallow end of the pool,' Chief Walter Klimek, Bridgeview Police Department told ABC7. Michael Duda was pulled from the shallow end of the pool at 1.43pm Tuesday. He was unable to breath and lifeguards immediately began CPR. There were about 300 children swimming in the pool, fewer than the 345 allowed capacity. Investigation: The public pool at Bridgeview has been closed while police work to determine what caused the child to become unresponsive . Supervision: Lifeguards were on duty and there were 10 adult camp counselors overseeing the 73 children who were a part of the camp group when Michael Duda drowned . Paramedics arrived and the little boy was transported to the intensive care unit at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn. According to CBS, Duda was listed as having a 'weak pulse' at 8am Wednesday morning, but died that evening. 'We are not sure exactly what happened, but we do know based on interviews, the lifeguards acted quickly,' Klimek told ABC7. Klimek said the police department is still interviewing witnesses to determine what could have caused Duda to become unresponsive. The pool has been closed for three days while police continue their investigations. The Justice camp runs all summer, with children divided into groups according to their age. They participate in music, games, and craft activities, as well as weekly field trips to the local pool and other sites.","Six-year-old Michael Duda was pulled from a Chicago area pool unresponsive .

"By . Alex Greig . A Wisconsin man has allegedly attacked two people with a Samurai sword in the boarding house-style building where they all lived, partially scalping and killing one of them. Young Choi, 29, has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the attack that killed Dustin Vanderheyden, 27, and wounded David Gerard, 24. The attack happened outside an apartment above Yanger's Bar on North 4th Street in Watertown on Thursday around 5pm. Sword attack: Young Choi, 29, allegedly killed Dustin Vanderheyden, 27, and injured another man in a frenzied attack at the boarding house where they live . Vanderheyden was stabbed multiple times and Gerard was injured in the incident, which ended in a stand-off between Watertown police and Choi, who finally surrendered after police brought in a negotiator. According to the Journal-Sentinel, Choi had told Vanderheyden's wife in the days preceding the attack that he was going to kill Vanderheyden so that he could have her for himself. The woman told police that she persuaded Choi that the pair couldn't be together and that she didn't think he was any danger. Court documents state that Choi had made 'bizarre statements all week long about being God,' and upon his arrest told police that officers could call him 'God.' Violent end: Vanderheyden died of his injuries in hospital after being stabbed multiple times in the abdomen . Envy: Court documents state that Choi had tried to convince Vanderheyden's wife (pictured with Vanderheyden on their wedding day) to leave him to be with Choi . An hour before the attack, a third resident from the building heard hysterical yelling, reports Channel 3000, and found Vanderheyden in Choi's apartment. He told police that Vanderheyden told him he had 'saved him,' and that Choi was 'crazy.' During the attack, Gerard, a tenant on the first floor of the building, heard Vanderheyden screaming for help and went upstairs to investigate. He thought Choi was hitting Vanderheyden with a stick, but realized it was a Samurai sword when he reached out to grab it, suffering lacerations to his hand and thumb. There was hair and blood on the floors and walls, and Choi was repeatedly asking Vanderheyden, 'Who's God?' Neighbor's quarrel: The attack occurred at the boarding house accommodation above Yanger's Pub, where Choi, Vanderheyden and his wife lived . Injured: Gerard received four stitches in his hand after trying to grab Choi's sword from him . Police found Choi on the top of a stairwell leading to the second floor. Officers negotiated with the man and he eventually surrendered. Vanderheyden was found with several stab wounds on the second floor. He was rushed to Watertown Regional Medical Center and went in to surgery but died of his injuries. Choi was calm when police took him into custody. When he was questioned, he said, 'What do you want me to tell you? Want me to say I feel bad about it? Are you checking my humanistic nature? Checking all my psychological bounds? Or am I just a ruthless killer?' according to court documents. Two other swords were found in Choi's apartment in the boarding house. Gerard received stitches for his injuries in hospital and was released. He told WISN that he's upset no one else went to help Vanderheyden during the attack. 'I mean, there's a bunch of people living in a small space and the guy was screaming,' he said. 'In hindsight, I know I did everything I could in the situation but now that (Vanderheyden) died, I'm second-guessing things with myself.'","Young Choi, 29, was arrested and charged with first-degree homicide in the death if his neighbor .

"By . Alex Greig . Police are investigating the death of a nine-month-old baby after she was left by her father for several hours in a hot car in Florida. Steven Lillie opened his truck around 4:45pm Monday and discovered his baby daughter unresponsive in the back of the vehicle. The infant had been left strapped in her car seat inside the closed vehicle in the sun for almost five hours. Tragic discovery: Father Steven Lillie discovered the body of his baby girl in his car after leaving her behind in this parking lot while he went to work . Witnesses told Channel 9 Eyewitness News that Lillie was supposed to have dropped his daughter off at daycare on his way to work but apparently forgot. Lillie arrived at the Fraternal Order of Police telemarketing office at 566 Barton Boulevard just after midday, as temperatures rose to the high 80s. The car was a black Dodge pickup, reports Florida Today. The parking lot outside a strip mall has no shade. Inside the truck, the heat would have risen to 100 degrees, reports Eyewitness News. 'The temperature would have been brutal,' Rockledge police Lieutenant Donna Seyferth said. Lillie discovered his daughter almost five hours later and his screams alerted his coworkers that something was terribly wrong. Lillie's coworkers called 911. Fatal error: Police say a disruption in Lillie's usual routine caused him to forget that he hadn't dropped his daughter off with her caregiver before driving to work . Dangerous heat: The temperature rose to the high 80s Monday afternoon, and inside the sealed car would have reached up to 100 degrees . 'The child was unresponsive when the officers arrived. They took as many life-saving measures as they could. Ambulance and rescue did the same, but the child did not survive,' Lieutenant Donna Seyferth told Channel 9. According to WKMG, some disruption in Lillie's usual routine caused him to forget he had not dropped the baby off with her caregiver. About four hours later, a family member asked him about the girl, prompting him to rush outside where he made the awful discovery. Witnesses told WKMG that Lillie was so distraught by the discovery that he collapsed. The baby was rushed to Wuesthoff Hospital but doctors were unable to revive her. Police spent the evening speaking with Lillie. No charges have been laid but the investigation in ongoing.","A nine-month-old baby girl was found unresponsive after being left in a car for several hours as temperatures rose to the high 80s .

"By . Alex Greig . Body found: Police found an SUV belonging to Raquel Calderin, 42, who hasn't been seen since September 2012. Human remains were discovered inside the car . A car belonging to a Florida woman missing since September 2012 has been found, and police discovered human remains inside. Police found the blue Ford Expedition belonging to Raquel Calderin, 42, submerged in a canal north of the Tamiami Trail. Calderin's estranged husband, Jesus Maqueira, 56, was charged with her murder in February 2013 after allegedly admitting to the murder but taunting police, saying they had no proof without a body. The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's Office is now working to identify the human remains. Raquel Calderin and Jesus Maqueira had been married for 20 years and had three children when she filed for divorce in September of 2012. Calderin was a school custodian who had left her husband in July 2012 and filed for divorce and a restraining order. According to the Miami Herald, friends of Calderin say Maqueira was a jealous and domineering husband who frequently physically and emotionally abused his wife. In 1996 and again in 2009 Calderin sought a restraining order against her husband for domestic violence. She repeatedly left the home for days at a time, staying in women's shelters. Finally, after meeting another man, Dagoberto Vasquez, in a supermarket Calderin left her husband good. The Miami Herald reports that Maqueira then began stalking his wife, bombarding her with phone calls and text messages such as 'die whore.' He would park his car across the street from Gloria Floyd Elementary where she worked as a custodian and stay for hours. Charged: Jesus Maqueira was arrested in February 2013 for the killing of his wife, with whom he had three children . New development: Krome Avenue north of Tamiami Trail, near where Calderin's SUV was discovered submerged in a canal . On the final day Calderin was seen, Maqueira confronted her at the school with the couple's 15-year-old daughter in tow and tried to convince her to return home. She refused and after Maqueira had left, her supervisor allowed the shaken and emotional Calderin to leave early, around 9:30pm. Calderin phoned Vasquez, with whom she was living, as she left the school. But at 9:38pm, the call dropped out. Calderin was never seen again. After months of searching for Calderin, Maqueira was brought into the Miami-Dade Police Department for questioning. His alibi for the night Calderin had disappeared had fallen through, and his cell phone records placed him near the elementary school that night. Denial: Despite allegedly confessing to police, Maqueira has since denied having anything to do with his wife's disappearance . Miami-Dade Detective Juan Segovia told the Miami Herald that Maqueira at one point told police sarcastically, 'Look, I killed her, take me to jail,' and made light of the fact that there was no physical evidence. 'Mr Maqueira laughed out loud at these investigators and stated that without a body there was very little we could do to him,’ Segovia wrote in a report of the interrogation. According to the Miami Herald, Maqueira had made cryptic comments to friends and family that whoever had killed Calderin 'would never be found because she was probably dead in a canal.' Maqueira was arrested for murder and aggravated stalking in February 2013. An inmate who had befriended Maqueira at the Metro West Detention Center who is now a witness against him told detectives that Maqueira confessed to the murder, saying he hid in the back of Calderin's SUV and beat her to death before driving the car into the canal, reports the Miami Herald. He is scheduled to go on trial for Calderin's murder next month.","A car belonging to Raquel Calderin, 42, was found submerged in a Florida canal .

"By . Allan Hall . Forensic scientists have identified the remains of a woman found buried at the estate of Hitler's deputy Hermann Goering 21 years ago as those of his wife Carin. Carin, born Carin Fock in Sweden, died aged 42 in 1931 and was buried in her homeland. But as Goering rose through the Nazi ranks he had her body exhumed and transported to his massive hunting lodge outside of Berlin called Carinhall in her memory. Nazi love: The body of Carin Goering (left), the first wife of high-ranking Nazi Hermann Goering has been discovered on the site of his former hunting lodge near Berlin . Nazi leaders: Adolf Hitler visits Hermann Goering at his Carinhall hunting lodge where the body of his first wife Carin, which Goering had exhumed from her native Sweden, has recently been discovered . As the Red Army advanced on the estate early in 1945 Goering ordered his vast art collection to be transported to safety and the place dynamited. Ever since then it has a been a magnet for weekend treasure hunters who pore over the ruins convinced they will find missing masterpieces in the rubble and undergrowth. In 1991 they did find a chest with human . remains which was sent to Sweden's National Board of Forensic Medicine . for identification. An expert called Marie Allen and her colleagues, together with Anna Kjellström at the Stockholm University osteoarchaeological research laboratory, have now used state of the art methods to determine whose they were. Hermann and Carin Goering pictured in the early 1920s (Ieft), and the shrine he built in her memory (right) Analyses of the total of 26 bones showed that they were from an adult woman while DNA analyses confirmed that they are from a woman. The researchers then performed two kinds of genetic analyses. A comparison of so-called mitochondrial DNA evinced identical DNA sequences between the skeleton and Carin Goering's son, indicating a mother-child relationship. 'The variant of mitochondrial DNA we saw in the bones is a relatively common one, occurring in about 10 per cent of all Europeans. Therefore we went on to study nuclear DNA,"" said Ms. Allen. They were able to show mother-son kinship. Reduced to rubble: Goering had his Carinhall hunting lodge destroyed as the Russian Red Army advanced into Germany . 'The results of our anthropological . and genetic analyses, together with historical data, provides several . pieces of evidence in the identification of the remains of the former . Nazi leader Hermann Goeing's wife, Carin Goering.,' she added. After the testing the remains were reburied in Sweden with family members present. Goering, . who founded the Gestapo secret police, organised the bombing of . defenceless cities in WW2 and was a prime architect of the Nazi . Holocaust, was sentenced to death at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials.","Goering's first wife Carin died of heart failure in 1931 .

"By . Alex Greig . A Boston police officer risked life and limb to rescue a chihuahua that was stuck in a submerged pickup truck on Saturday. Carver police received a call from South Meadow Village, a 55-plus retirement community where a 2004 Toyota Tacoma belonging to Debra Titus, 59, was under eight feet of water. Officer David Harriman responded to the call and when he arrived on the scene, removed his gun belt and his shoes and drove into the murky water to save Moochie, the chihuahua. Moochie's savior: David Harriman carries the half-drowned chihuahua to safety after rescuing him from a completely submerged pick-up . Moochie's owner, Debra Titus, had managed to get out of the truck and to shore, and one of her two dogs, Stitch, had also swum to safety, leaving little Moochie stranded. According to the Boston Herald, Titus was on shore 'completely frantic' when Harriman and his partner arrived. Dog lover: Officer Harriman owns an eight-month-old English bulldog who he says he'd do anything for . She got the right policeman though. Harriman is described by his colleagues as an 'avid dog lover' and didn't hesitate to get in the water. 'We showed up at the water and saw the vehicle was submerged. We were told a dog was still in it so I did what I felt I should do - go in and get the dog,' he told the Boston Herald. 'It definitely wasn’t easy. I was able to get the door open and then go through some items in the back until I was able to find the dog.' Moochie was unconscious when Harriman got to him, but came to after he gave the dog 'a little squeeze.' 'He wasn't moving at all when I first got to him, and then when I got him to the surface, he came to,' Harriman told WCBV. 'He'd been under the water for quite some time.' A grateful Debra Titus was ecstatic to get her dog back alive and well. Harriman said he has an English bulldog called Jax and that he understands that dogs are like family members. He had to leave almost as soon as he rescued the job and get back to work, but he returned later to check on the shaken pup. 'An hour later, when I went back to the scene, he looked like a little fluff ball. We’d all do it. I know it’s something that’s important to us,' he told the Boston Herald.","Officer David Harriman dove into a murky lake to rescue Moochie the chihuahua from a submerged pickup .

The father of Kaylah Hunter told police he last spoke with Fox on June 3. He reported Fox, his daughter and baby Kristian missing on June 6. 'If her husband is spotted pulling up from an abandoned in a U-Haul truck going in with hammers and tools, and then a couple of days later, whatever, her body's down there. We're not rocket scientists standing here but we're not idiots,' said Alicia Fox's uncle Michael Fields to My Fox Detroit. 'To sit there and to run away when people are looking for your family lets me know that you are one thing - you're a coward. And you're going to be a coward for the rest of your life. And you don't have to answer to anyone but God, and he's going to get you brother, believe that.'

"By . Alex Greig . Suspect: Roland Cummings is suspected of stabbing to death Aurele Fecteau, a man he knew and had helped around his home . Police have arrested a 44-year-old man for the fatal stabbing of a 92-year-old Maine man two weeks ago in his home. Authorities say Roland Cummings is scheduled make his first appearance on a murder charge either Monday or Tuesday in Kennebec County Superior Court in Augusta. Cummings was arrested Friday in connection with the May 23 death of Aurele Fecteau, who was found stabbed to death in his bed at his home in Waterville. Police say Cummings knew the victim and used to do odd jobs around Fecteau's house. Cummings' sister, Deborah Berry of Waterville, tells the Morning Sentinel that . her brother has been struggling with drug addiction. It's unclear if he . has a lawyer. Cummings grew up in the Bingham and Waterville areas, lives with his mother and is not employed. Detectives said Fecteau was stabbed to death in his bed and that Fecteau's house had been burglarized. Fecteau's body was found by relatives who became concerned after not hearing from him for a few days. They were horrified to discover the violent way in which Aurele Fecteau's life ended. His daughter-in-law Lorraine Fecteau told WGME that the family is in shock and they did not expect 'his life would be cut short in such a horrific way.' Horrific end: Aurele Fecteau was a father of seven who lived alone in his Maine home after his wife passed away in 1999 . Neighbors also became concerned about the nonagenarian after his lawn became overgrown. 'He was good about keeping his lawn mowed,' neighbor Nancy Morissett told the Press Herald. 'He used a riding mower even with him not being able to see too good; he’d be out there, and I thought last night it was kind of strange because I saw him two or three days ago.' Fecteau had lived alone since his wife Jeanne died in 2009 but his children were frequent visitors. Fecteau was a father of seven and an avid outdoorsman who loved hunting, fishing and gardening. 'He was a good man, a good family man,' Marjory Clifford told the Press Herald. 'He was a home man; his boys took him fishing in the summer. He took care of his grounds; he was always working on his gardens and his house.' Prior to his retirement, he was employed as a paper machine tender by Hollingsworth & Whitney, later Scott Paper Co., for 40 years.","Roland Cummings, 44, has been arrested for the fatal stabbing of 92-year-old Aurele Fecteau .

"By . Alex Greig . A 17-year-old girl is lucky to be alive after falling out of a moving party bus that was making its way to her high school prom onto a California highway. The unusual sight of young people in formal wear running across the southbound lanes of the 73 Freeway greeted alarmed Orange County drivers on Saturday at around 7:30pm as friends of Charlotte Boyse rushed to her aid. The Corona Del Mar High School student was on her way to Mission Viejo with 55 other teens to their prom when a window on the bus suddenly opened and she fell out onto the road. Prom night in hospital: Charlotte Boyse was lucky to survive a fall from a bus taking her to her high school prom Saturday . The Orange County Register reports that Boyse leaned back against a window for someone to squeeze past her when it popped open. Two of her friends tried to grab onto Boyse when they realized what was happening, and managed to pull her upright so that she didn't fall on her head, possibly saving her life. The two girls grabbed Charlotte and 'prevented her from landing on the back of her head, and instead righted her so she landed on her backside,' Conrad Boyse told the Register. Shockingly, the driver of the bus was oblivious to Boyse's accident and despite pleas from students to stop, continued driving for about a quarter mile. Quick-thinking: Two friends grabbed Boyse (circled in this pre-accident prom photo) as she fell from a bus window, managing to pull her upright so that she fell on her backside rather than her head, possibly saving her life . Freeway fall: Boyse, seen in her hospital bed with friend Payton Gronnerud, crawled to the median and managed to avoid being hit by a car, suffering only cuts and grazes . Multi-lane freeway: Witnesses say Boyse crawling across this stretch of road to the median, and police say it was fortunate she fell early on Saturday night when traffic was light . When he did stop, he wouldn't let students off the bus on the freeway, so several students jumped out of the open window Charlotte Boyse had fallen from and ran to help her. The students didn't know if Boyse was dead or alive. The girl had . managed to get herself to the median where she had waited for about 10 . minutes before being able to flag down a couple who called 911. A driver who was about 20 seconds behind the bus saw a girl crawling across the road toward the center divider and other students running towards her. 'I noticed a girl kind of crawling off the freeway, into the center-divider area, and there were, I think, two boys, at that point, who were just getting to her,' witness Colleen Kreuger told KTLA. 'I was running toward where the girl was, and one of the boys started heading toward me. I asked him what had happened. He said, ""My friend fell out of the window of the bus.""' A prom to remember: Boyse was released from hospital Sunday after spending prom night in hospital with some friends who elected to stay with her . Boyse suffered serious cuts and abrasions but initially felt no pain. 'I was in complete shock,' she said. 'My shoe broke off, my phone flew from me.' She was taken by ambulance to the Children's Hospital of Orange County and released late Sunday. Several of Boyse's friends skipped prom to spend the night in hospital with her, and Conrad Boyse is eternally grateful to the girls who helped his daughter. 'She would unquestionably be dead without them,' he told the OC Register. 'We are so grateful for the quick thinking and heroic actions of these kids, and for the outpouring of love and support for Charlotte.' Boyse's parents said the teens were not drinking, and no alcohol was found on the bus. The bus was rented by about 30 couples attending the prom from a company in Anaheim called Party Bus Limo Rentals. KCal9 News reports that a spokesperson for the company said the bus had gone through safety checks before picking the teens up for prom.","Charlotte Boyse, 17, was on her way to prom in a party bus with 55 other students .

"By . Alex Greig . Chicago police have used facial recognition technology to identify and convict a thief - the first person to be captured thanks to the department's new technology. Pierre D Martin, 35, was captured on Chicago Transit Authority surveillance footage robbing two men at gunpoint in separate incidents in 2013. Martin was identified robberies using NeoFace technology that the police department bought with a $5.4 million federal grant. The face that gave him away: Pierre Martin was identified using facial recognition technology and sentenced to 22 years . He is the first man arrested by Chicago police with the help of facial recognition technology and has been sentenced to 22 years in state prison. The Chicago Sun-Times reports that 35-year-old Pierre D. Martin was sentenced this week. Armed robbery: Martin's face was clearly visible in security footage . In February 2013, he was filmed approaching his 20-year-old victim on board a Pink Line train, pulling a gun on him and demanding his phone. When the train began to move, he jumped off and escaped. Martin committed a similar crime on a train platform in January 2013. He was convicted by a judge last month of one 2013 robbery and then pleaded guilty to the othe robbery. Using the facial recognition technology investigators could compare those images against 4.5 million criminal booking shots. Martin, a convicted felon, came back as the number one match, then witnesses identified him in line-ups. His mug shot was in the police database following convictions on aggravated unlawful use of a weapon in 2009 and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. 'This case is a great example that these high-tech tools are helping to enhance identification and lead us to defendants that might otherwise evade capture,' Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez said in a statement.","Pierre D.

"By . Alex Greig . Residents in a New York apartment building have grown accustomed to the heavenly voice that regularly fills the stairwell in their apartment building. The rest of the world, however, was astounded when a YouTube video of janitor John Maldonado surfaced and his stunning vocal stylings carried off Mariah Carey, John Legend and Whitney Houston ballads with ease. Maldonado has been cleaning floors and taking out the trash in the Lenox Avenue, Harlem apartment building for nearly a decade, using the cavernous echoing hall ways and basement as a makeshift practice room. Scroll down for video . Crystal clear: John Maldonado's voice brightens the day of residents in the Harlem apartment building where he is a cleaner . Studio time: Maldonado hones his singing as he cleans the apartment building . He says he wants to be a singer but when he was younger he was shy and didn't chase his dream. 'When I was younger I used to sing for my family for get-togethers,' Maldonado told PIX11 News. 'I sing for my friends, but I never really pursued it. Secretly I always wanted to be a singer but I’ve always been nervous.' Now, Maldonado, who was born in the Bronx and now lives in Brooklyn, is hoping to trade his mop for a microphone. Somehow, his incredible voice failed to get through the audition process on singing shows like American Idol and the Voice, but Maldonado is still hopeful. He posts videos of himself singing on his YouTube channel, Mop4aMic, where the response is positive. Hopeful: Maldonado hopes to one day trade in his mop and become a professional singer . 'Unfortunately I can’t afford studio time at the moment,' he told Pix 11. 'In the meantime I use the hallways for the echo and I’ve put some videos up on YouTube and some people have taken notice.' If his singing career does take off, though, the residents at Lenox Avenue will miss his dulcet tones. 'I hear him singing and I come running out of my apartment and swing that door open and just tell him, ""Sing it, baby! Woo!,""' one resident said. 'I thank the Lord! He can sing.

"By . Alex Greig . Two San Diego police officers - a husband and wife - have been arrested on suspicion of possessing and selling drugs. Authorities say 41-year-old Jennifer Charpentier and 32-year-old Bryce Charpentier were taken into custody Thursday morning. They were booked into jails and there's no word on whether they have lawyers. Jennifer Charpentier has 18 years with the department and works out of the Western Division. Her husband is a six-year veteran assigned to the Mid-City Division. Newlyweds: Jennifer and Bryce Charpentier were arrested Thursday on drugs charges . Bryce Charpentier was booked on charges of possession and sales of a controlled substance, conspiracy and being under the influence while in possession of a loaded gun. Jennifer Charpentier was charged with conspiracy and possession and sales of a controlled substance. County sheriff's deputies made the arrests during a drug task force investigation. San Diego police say the officers have been placed on leave and the department is cooperating with the sheriff's investigation. Veteran: Jennifer Charpentier is an 18-year veteran with the force, while her husband Bryce Charpentier has been with the Mid City division for six years . Bright future: The couple began dating in 2011 and married in 2013 but were both arrested and placed on leave from their positions with the police force . The two have been married since late 2013 and have four children between them. ABC 10 reports that Mrs Charpentier was released from the Las Colinas Detention Center at 5:30am after posting $50,000 bail. Her husband was bailed earlier in the evening. Mr Charpentier is expected to appear in court June 9, and his wife the following day. Bryce Charpentier played mid-level professional hockey with various leagues until 2007. Sources told ABC 10 that Mr Charpentier has had a problem with prescription drugs since he suffered a career-ending hockey injury, and that both husband and wife had been 'acting strangely' in recent months and were 'withdrawn and secretive.' Neighbors of the Charpentiers, though, described a happy family that was always smiling, waving and playing out the front of their home. Shocking: Neighbors say about 30 FBI agents and police officers descended on the Charpentiers' home . Residents in the Charpentiers' gated community said they were shocked to hear of the charges leveled at the family. 'I saw probably about 30 FBI agents, sheriffs, cops, all gathered around the yard,' one told San Diego 6. Police took several items from the home and a silver SUV. The case is the latest embarrassment for the San Diego Police Department this year. Since February, officers from the department have been charged with a slew of crimes, including domestic violence, sexual assault against female suspects and DUI.","Bryce Charpentier, 32, and Jennifer Charpentier, 41, were arrested as part of a drug bust yesterday .

"By . Alex Greig . A New Orleans homicide detective and visual artist has been placed on desk duty following accusations that he wrote a message in the coagulated blood of a murder victim at a crime scene. The New Orleans Police Department confirmed that Charles Hoffacker, 32, is the subject of a complaint that he wrote in the blood of a murder victim last week. He has been decommissioned and cannot wear his uniform or carry a gun while an investigation is being carried out. Art imitating life: Charles Hoffacker is accused of writing in the blood of a homicide victim . Double life: Charles Hoffacker, seen creating one of his artworks, is a detective by night and an artist by day but has been accused of overstepping the boundaries . Dedicated: Hoffacker feels deeply each homicide that he investigates, says a longtime friend . Hoffacker's attorney Eric Hessler told WWLTV that Hoffacker's actions have been exaggerated and that the body and all physical evidence had long been removed from the scene when the alleged blood-scrawling took place. Furthermore, he says, Hoffacker didn't violate any departmental rules. Hoffacker is a respected New Orleans artist who channels his experience as a homicide detective into his works. From 3pm until midnight, he investigates gritty killings across the city, but each morning he can be found painting at home. His works range from tongue-in-cheek portraits of political figures including Dick Cheney and Anthony Weiner to a mosaic of notorious local gangster Telly Hankton created using thousands of bullet casings. Creative outlet: Hoffacker channels the things he sees on the streets of New Orleans into his artwork . 'I don’t think I would be as passionate about my art as I am, if I was not a policeman,' Hoffacker told Ozy. 'I wouldn’t have the ideas, I wouldn’t have the passion, I wouldn’t have the pain. 'I go see young black men torn apart by gun violence every day in New Orleans. I offset that by coming home, clearing my head and painting.' New Orleans has one of the highest murder rates in the country. Although it's fallen dramatically in recent years, it's stull eight times higher than the national average. Hessler says stress may have been a factor in Hoffacker's actions. 'This was an isolated incident that happened during a very, very difficult time for New Orleans and for this officer also,' Hessler told WWLTV. 'And I’m hoping that the NOPD sees it that way and treats it that way.' Crime scene: Hoffacker's attorney says that Hoffacker did not violate any departmental laws and that the body and all physical evidence had been removed from the scene when the alleged incident happened . He says Hoffacker had worked two double shifts over the Memorial Day weekend that saw four people killed and another 15 wounded, a very high toll even for New Orleans. The owner of Barrister's Gallery, which has regularly shown Hoffacker's works for almost a decade says that the artist-cum-detective feels deeply the violence and turmoil to which he is exposed on a daily basis. 'On at least two occasions, he described crime scenes to me with such pathos, such personal anguish, that I remember distinctly on one of those times tears coming out of his eyes,' Andy Antippas told WWLTV.'If there were 50 more like him, our police force would be a lot stronger. Whatever it is he’s been accused of, someone has misconstrued something.' On one occasion, Hoffacker donated a charcoal portrait of a murder victim to the victim's family so they could auction it off to raise a reward to find the suspect. The New Orleans Police Department's Public Integrity Bureau now has 14 days to determine whether to classify the investigation as criminal or administrative.","Charles Hoffacker, 32, has been accused of writing a message in the blood of a murder victim .

"By . Will Payne In Livingston, New Jersey . The grief stricken family of an honor roll student gunned while down driving home after a night playing video games joined hundreds of devastated mourners at his funeral yesterday. A full Irish pipe and drum band sounded as a black hearse carrying Brendan Tevlin’s body arrived for the service in a long funeral procession, flanked by around a dozen police outriders. Once inside Reverend Brian Needles paid tribute to the, ‘Amazing, gifted and respectful’ 19-year-old and spoke of his family’s, ‘unbearable pain and unrelenting grief’. He added that no one could understand why the model student’s life had been cut so tragically short. Beloved: Hundreds of devastated mourners gathered for the funeral of 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin in Livingston, N.J., who was gunned down last week. Police remain baffled by what they say is a targeted murder . Life cut short: Rev. Brian Needles of the Church of St.Philomena officiated at the sad service. 'Brendan, an amazing gifted young man¿ with so much potential, so much to look forward to, so much to offer this world, never getting a chance, it¿s just not supposed to be like this,' he said . The pipes are calling: A full Irish pipe and drum band sounded to pay tribute to the fine young man. Brendan was also a bagpiper with the Essex County Shillelagh Pipes & Drums. He went on to say, ‘It’s not supposed to be like this, a mother and father are not supposed to bury a child…. ‘Brendan, an amazing gifted young man… with so much potential, so much to look forward to, so much to offer this world, never getting a chance, it’s just not supposed to be like this.’ At the end of the hour-and-a-half long Catholic service held at The Church of Saint Philomena, Livingston, New Jersey, Brendan’s two brothers Brian and Sean and sister Michaela paid tearful tributes to, ‘the best brother in the world’. They also thanked the local community for the outpouring of grief and the countless offers of support the family has received since Brendan’s brutal slaying in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Between tears, Brendan’s sister Michaela told the congregation how he touched the lives of, ‘Every person he ever encountered’ and lived every day to the fullest. She also described him as someone who truly made a difference. Close: Brendan, here with his younger brothers and sister Allison was the closest of siblings . At the end of the emotionally charged ceremony, that brought the small town of Livingston to a standstill, Brendan’s siblings, his father Michael, mother Allison and around a dozen other relatives comforted each other as they left the church. They then drove off to a private burial service at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey. Brendan’s family and friends have been absolutely devastated by his brutal slaying, which has left everyone who knew him utterly stunned. After spending the evening at a friend’s house playing video games, he reportedly texted his mom to say he was heading home, before getting in the family’s Jeep Liberty between 11.30pm and 12.00am.

Police say the killing 'does not appear random'"
"By . Kieran Corcoran . A Pakistani immigrant who killed his wife for feeding him lentils should be given a short sentence because the lack of home-style food will make jail 'difficult', a court was told. Noor Hussein, 75, beat his wife to death with a stick in their New York apartment in 2011, and was convicted of the killing in May. Earlier the New York Supreme Court heard how he lashed out at Nazar Hussein, 66, because she made him a vegetarian lentil dinner instead of cooking goat. In papers submitted to the court, prosecutors said: 'The defendant asked [his wife] to cook goat and [his wife] said she made something else. Fussy eater: Noor Hussein (centre), pictured at the New York Supreme Court, was convicted of killing his wife after she made him the wrong dinner . 'The conversation got louder and his wife disrespected defendant by cursing at defendant and saying motherf***** and that the defendant took a wooden stick and hit her with it on her arm and mouth.' And food again returned to the centre of the trial in arguments over sentencing - when defense lawyers for Hussein said he should be given a shorter sentence because of the hardship of doing without Pakistani food. Attorney Julie Clark wrote in papers submitted to court: 'His inability to speak English and his inability to have Pakistani food will make his incarceration even more difficult than the average inmate.' She argued that on that basis he should be given 15 years in prison, rather than the maximum of 25, the New York Post reported. Prosecutors dismissed their arguments, saying there were no 'mitigating factors', and said the maximum sentence should be given. In a hearing yesterday, Supreme Court Justice Matthew D’Emic gave Hussein 18 years, which he said is likely to be a life sentence because of the killer's age. Wrangles: The court (pictured) heard that the hardship of going without Pakistani food in prison ought to mean Hussein is given a short sentence. He was eventually given 18 years inside . In an emotional speech to the court, given via a Punjabi translator, Hussein denied killing his wife, then begged for death himself. He said: 'Please do me justice and hang me. Give me electric shock so I can die.' Earlier in the trial it had been argued that Hussein hadn't meant to kill his wife, and also that his lashing out at her was unremarkable because wife beating is routine in Pakistan. The court was told gruesome details of the attack, with prosecutor Sabeeha Madni describing how Hussein attacked his wife as she lay in her bed. She said he left deep lacerations on her head, arms and shoulders, and causing her brain to haemorrhage. Court papers state he beat her with a stick that the family had found in the street and used to stir their laundry in a washtub. He then tried to clean up the blood that splattered onto their bedroom wall before calling his son for help, Madni said.","Noor Hussein beat his wife to death after she failed to feed him goat in 2011 .

"By . Alex Greig . The Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority aims to improve the state's students' access to higher education, but a recent publication indicates that students aren't the only ones in need of some learning. The book, sent out to every junior in the state, outlines what students need to know to prepare for college - but there's a small problem. The word Kentucky is misspelled on the spine of the book to read 'Kentucy.' The state of education: The Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority's free book was distributed to every junior in the state of 'Kentucy' The error has been pointed out gleefully to the KHEAA on social media. Erin Klarer of the KHEAA told WDRB that the board is aware of the mistake. Schools, parents and even state officials have informed staff about the typo, says Klarer. It's embarrassing, she says, but the cost of reprinting and redistributing the book would be about $70,000. Egg on their faces: The KHEAA says that to reprint and redistribute the book would cost $70,000, so they're going to let it stand . Consequently, she told WDRB, the KHEAA is going to just 'deal with the egg on our face.' In an introductory note at the front of the book, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear praises the KHEAA as 'the state’s premier college planning and financial aid publication for high school students.' 'We got these a few weeks ago from the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority. Again... HIGHER EDUCATION,' tweeted a student.","The Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority distributed a book to every junior in the state about how to prepare for college .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . He may be trying to encourage more people to enter the digital world, but Prince Andrew was less than impressed when pop star Will.i.am's mobile phone went off next to him in an interview. The royal reminded the Black Eyed Peas frontman and reality show judge him to turn devices off before important engagements - such as their joint appearance on TV. The two are partnering to promote an award designed to teach computer skills to inner city children. Not impressed: Prince Andrew looked sternly towards Will.i.am's leg when his phone went off in a TV interview . 'Leave it in the car!': The royal explained that he makes sure his phone is nowhere near to avoid such gaffes . After the excitable popstar was left fumbling for his mobile in an interview broadcast this morning, the prince revealed that he leaves his phone in the car when appearing on television - advising Will.i.am to do the same. He said: 'I leave my digital devices in the car when I am doing engagements - based on the fact that they might accidentally go off. Andrew had just made a point about elitism in education, when the singer was left apologising for the high-pitched ringtone coming from his pocket. Will.i.am was given the opportunity to reveal who the call was from, but sheepishly turned off the device and said he would check later. Prince Andrew initially laughed along and kept his thought to himself, but was later asked whether he was as digitally-aware as his fellow interviewee, at which point he decided to offer some advice. The awkward moment came in an interview with Susannah Reid on ITV's Good Morning Britain. Laughing it off: The interview, on ITV's Good Morning Britain, continued in a jovial tone after Will.i.am hid the phone under his leg then turned it off apologetically . The two appeared on the programme to promote the Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award, which aims to make young people more employable. Explaining the origins of the project, Will.i.am said: ‘I got invited to Buckingham Palace and Prince Andrew was there and I was so over the moon and just full of excitement and I was telling him, young kids in inner cities, we need to find opportunities for them, get them up to speed. ‘I didn’t think that conversation would follow up with let’s partner up and do something providing opportunities for kids to brings ideas to culture’. Prince Andrew said: ‘If we don’t give young people the skills to be able to work in this environment, they are going to feel even more ostracised than they may or may not do today.’ After the interview the Prince also revealed that he is a fan of the Black Eye Peas singer's music, but refused to appear in a selfie alongside Miss Reid and Will.i.am, instead asking that the photographs be taken from a distance.","Royal was appearing with Black Eyed Peas singer to promote digital award .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A schoolboy was rescued from deadly quicksands Bay this week by firefighters who were luckily training nearby. Kavan Humphreys, 13, was fishing around Morecambe Bay in Lancashire with his father and a friend when he strayed into a particularly treacherous area and started to sink. The boy called out to his father for help, by which time he was waist-deep in the mud. Stuck in the mud: Kavan Humphreys, 13, got stuck while looking for a place to fish in Morecambe Bay, Cumbria . Trained: The firefighters had been practising quicksands rescues nearby when they received the call. They used a sand lance - a special kind of pump - to loosen the treacherous mud so that they set Kavan free . Alan Humphreys, 44, knew he risked getting trapped himself if he followed he son, so faced an anxious wait when he called the fire service to come to Kavan's aid. By coincidence, the rescuers were able to arrive in minutes - because they have been practising quicksand rescues just moments before. The firemen were able to reach Kavan by using inflatable walkways to cross the treacherous sands. From there they were able to use sand lances - a special pump designed to soften quicksand - to shift the boy free from the mud and pull him to safety. After the hour-long procedure, Kavan was given medical checks, but was unharmed and was at school the following day. Mr Humphreys said: 'He’d gone to a channel where there might be fish, crossed to the other side and sunk. Reaching out: After an hour-long rescue operations, the firemen were able to pluck Kavan from the sands . From safety: The firefighters used inflatable walkways to approach Kavan without getting trapped themselves . 'He shouted for me so I walked round the corner, where there’s a bit of a cliff, and I could see he was knee-deep in quicksand. 'I knew I couldn’t get to him without getting stuck myself so I kept my cool and phoned the coastguard.' Fire station manager Paul Dorrington said: 'We’d been practising on a colleague who was up to his chest in quicksand and had just released him when we got the call. 'Mud sets like concrete so we turned on the water to liquify it, which allowed us to lift one leg out at a time. 'We were in a very fortunate position - the tide was well out so we had time on our side. It could have been a very different story.' Kavan was pulled free in less than an hour and handed over to a waiting ambulance. He was taken to hospital for precautionary checks but was back at school the following day. Morecambe Bay is notorious for its shifting sands and unpredictable tides, which can catch out unwary walkers on its huge mud flats. Rescued: Kavan was eventually set free, completely unharmed by his ordeal. Though rescuers warned it could have been worse were the tide not so far out at the time . The return: Kavan was checked over in an ambulance, but was unharmed and able to go school the next day . The most deadly incident at the bay came in 2004 when 21 workers fishing for cockles drowned after being trapped by incoming tides. The men and women - illegal Chinese immigrants working for gangmasters for very little pay - could not be rescued after they were overcome by a combination of the cold February weather and incoming seas, which their leaders had failed to predict properly. A Lancashire Fire Service spokesman said: 'The sands of Morecambe Bay shift over the years and the shore has changed dramatically. 'Thirty years ago much of the shoreline was grass or marsh but about ten years ago the river came right in to the shore, scouring away the areas where it was safe to walk. 'Now there are many areas of soft quicksand close to the shore.' Arnside Coastguard station officer Nigel Capstick said: 'Of all the scenarios we train to prevent and resolve, quicksand rescue is undoubtedly the most difficult and onerous. 'A child stuck up to the waist, especially with an incoming tide, is our worst nightmare, as the possible consequences do not bear thinking about. 'However, it is a very real possibility as the sands out in the Bay are truly lethal. 'We urge everyone to take the warnings seriously and not to hesitate to dial 999 and ask for Coastguard if you think someone may be in trouble.' The Morecambe Bay disaster took the lives of 21 Chinese immigrant workers, who were labouring on the sands at night for pitifully low pay. They were part of a gang of almost 40 workers, who were picking cockles from the mud flats out to sea when they were surprised and cut off by the incoming tide. The workers - none of whom had permission to work in the UK - tried to swim back to shore but most were overwhelmed by exhaustion and the February cold before they made it back. Labour: The drowned workers were picking cockles on the mud flats of Morecambe Bay (file photo) In total 14 workers are thought to have escaped, while the rest were later found dead on the sands. An inquest into the workers' deaths heard that the cockles were being bought from the workers - hired by illegal gangmasters - at a rate of just £5 for a 25kg bag, or 9p per lb.","Kavan Humphreys, 13, out with his father and a friend at the bay in Lancashire .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Gun owners in Georgia are now free to take weapons into churches, bars, libraries, schools and airports thanks to a new law relaxing gun control rules. New legislation, which came into effect yesterday, means that the 500,000 Georgians with a gun licence will be allowed to to enter the public buildings with their weapons openly displayed. Critics described the bill as a 'guns everywhere' law and say it is the most extreme in the U.S. and could lead to more violent crime. New law: The sweeping legislation was signed into law in April by Georgian governor Nathan Deal, centre . Opposition: Critics, who call the legislation a 'guns everywhere' law, protested against it but did not stop gun activists securing the dramatic expansion in the number of places they can freely bear arms . Gun enthusiasts have hailed the legislation, named the Safe Carry Protection Act, as a triumph of their constitutional right to bear arms. Bars and 'unsecured' government buildings, such as libraries, will be expected to allow gun carriers in by default, while other locations, such as churches, will need to opt in before guns are freely allowed on site. Airports are also covered by the legislation, although guns will continue to be banned in restricted areas and will not be allowed on flights. Jubilant gun owners celebrating at a shooting range in Atlanta yesterday said the new law vindicates rights 'given to us by God'. One activist told Sky News: 'It's a victory for the second amendment rights ... the right to keep and bear arms.' Another said: 'Those rights are protected by the constitution and are given to us by God'. The law faced heavy opposition while moving through the state's senate. Controversial clauses allowing guns to be carried on university campuses were struck out while the law was being drawn up. Some surveys showed that a majority of Georgians opposed the law, but lawmakers in the state had the powerful gun lobby to contend with, which piles pressure on legislators to support the rights on gun owners. The loosening of laws in Georgia could lead to the same happening in other states, while Tennessee, Oklahoma Missouri have recently passed their own laws. 'Idiotic': Critics fear that the new gun laws will lead to a rise in violent crime . Triumphant: Gun activists say it is their right to carry weapons where they like, and deny a link to violence . When the signing-in took place in April, Alan Gottlieb, the founder of pressure group the Second Amendment Foundation, told MailOnline: 'You will see other states start to adopt this concept and it will spread across America'. On social media, the law was roundly condemned, though some activists defended the rules. Briton Joe Difford tweeted: 'The ""guns everywhere"" legislation in Georgia is the most idiotic law ever. Having a gun won't make you safe because everyone else has one!' Sarah Jennifer added: 'Ah America, after more mass shootings earlier this year? REALLY?! You'll never learn, will you?' Michael Weston, a gun activist from the U.S., tweeted: 'New Georgia gun law set to take effect and Liberals say: the sky is falling, as usual, NO facts just faux hysteria.'","Safe Carry Protection Act came into force in the U.S. state yesterday .

The driver had her Vauxhall Combo seized by officers in, who then posted a picture online as a warning to other drivers. An image from inside the van shows how the driver - a 30-year-old woman - would have been able to see practically nothing from behind the wheel. Pulled over: Police stopped the driver of this van, who had obscured her windscreen almost entirely with plastic planks while out and about in Aston, Birmingham . She was stopped just after 8am today while driving through Aston, Birmingham. Police also found out that the van was uninsured, and the driver was given a court summons for driving without insurance. After pulling over the car, officers tweeted: 'Not to all vehicle owners. Do NOT drive your motor when the windscreen is covered in plastic fascias!' Not much of a view: Officers posted this picture online, showing how it is practically impossible to see out of the van. The driver was also uninsured and must now appear in court . Passers-by spoke of the incredulity they felt on seeing the vehicle stopped by officers. Adrian Loveday, 34, said: 'I was driving through Aston when I saw this chap get pulled over. At first I thought it was a joke, he [sic] couldn’t see a thing out of his windscreen.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Thief: Michelle Roberts, 45, admitted stealing from her own relatives at a wake for her dead uncle . A woman who robbed her own family at a wake for her dead uncle has been jailed. Michelle Roberts, 45, rifled through the handbags of mourners at an event to commemorate her uncle, Fred Rousell. She took several bank cards, £80 in cash as well as £300 of John Lewis vouchers from relatives at the event in Southend, Essex. Roberts was called 'mean and despicable' as she was given a six-month prison sentence after admitting theft and fraud. Basildon Crown Court heard how she used the stolen cards to spend more than £400 on an online shopping spree from Asda and a music website. She even tried to convince her widowed aunt that she had cancer in an attempt to collect money from her in the guise of charity donations. Roberts, from Greenwich, South East London, had sneaked into a kitchen during the wake to pilfer their belongings. She pleaded guilty to four counts of theft and three of fraud. The court heard that she took advantage of grieving relatives and broke her family apart at the wake in 2011. Jamas Hodivala, prosecuting, told the court: 'For the last two years Mrs Rousell feels unable to put her husband to rest because of the incident . 'Obviously the incident caused her great upset and distress and, because Mrs Rousell's family were previously very close, she feels the family relationship has been broken as a result.' Handing her the six-month jail sentence, Judge Jonathan Black said: 'I deal with these offences in detail because they fully reflect the mean and despicable way you committed the offences. 'Despicable': Roberts, pictured above covering her face as she leaves court, was criticised by the judge for taking advantage of her grieving relatives to steal their money . Guilty: Roberts admitted four charges of theft and three of fraud at Basildon Crown Court (pictured) 'You used time of great grief of Mr Rousell’s family to steal from vulnerable family and friends.' Steven Fitzpatrick, mitigating, told the court his client should not be jailed as she suffers from depression and anxiety. But Judge Black jailed Roberts for six months before defiantly telling her: 'Your manipulative behaviour has even extended to those people who wrote this report.' The case comes a year after Roberts escaped a jail sentence at Dartford Magistrates’ Court for bogus charity collecting around pubs in Kent.","Michelle Roberts, 45, rifled through handbags at wake in Southend, Essex .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . An inmate at a notoriously lax open jail was caught trying to smuggle a rabbit inside to keep as a pet. The prisoner at Hollesley Bay open prison in Woodbridge, Suffolk, is thought to have found the animal while outside on day release. He was able to bring the rabbit back inside the prison - nicknamed Holiday Bay because its laid-back regime - where convicts managed to build it a hutch and started treating it as a prison pet. Lax: The prisoner was able to bring a rabbit back inside Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk - nicknamed Holiday Bay by inmates . Prison wardens eventually found and confiscated the rabbit, then gave it to a rescue centre. The inmate is thought to have found the rabbit roaming wild, as opposed to taking it from a previous owner. It is unclear whether the pet was kept in one prisoner's room or elsewhere in the jail. He has since been disciplined for the breach, which took place several weeks ago. A Hollesley Bay spokesman said today that it 'wouldn't be hard' for an inmate to smuggle an animal into the prison. She said: 'This is the country, there are dozens of brown rabbits sitting all round the prison as well as other animals like muntjac deer. 'If someone wanted to pick one up and take it back to their room it wouldn't be hard but as soon as it would have been found it would have been moved swiftly along.' Dennis Driver, Chairman of Hollesley Parish Council, said: 'The prisoners seem to just walk in and out as they like. 'They aren't allowed sharp items or animals but who knows if they are checked. The security does seem to be a bit lax. I'm sure all sorts of stuff is smuggled in there. 'I think the prisoners would just do it for a laugh. Rabbits come up to you and they probably just picked it up and took it in there. The rabbit fiasco is the latest in a string of embarrassments for Hollesley Bay, which last week the target of a bizarre theft. Low security: The jail in Suffolk is mocked by inmates because of its lax regime . An audacious thief broke into the jail, slipping through a skylight to steal £3,000 of tobacco meant to be sold to inmates. The cache was stolen from the prison's main storeroom in a late-night raid before it could be sold to convicts. Police hunting the culprits are understood to have found a shoe print near the scene. The tobacco was taken between 4.30pm on Monday, June 16 and 8am on Tuesday, June 17. Suffolk Police said up to 300 packets were taken. A prison spokesman said: 'Earlier this month a quantity of tobacco products was stolen from HMP Hollesley Bay. This is now a matter for the police.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . It may be hard to believe, but the quality of air over major U.S. cities has improved over the past decade, new satellite images show. Data collected by probes orbiting the earth for almost a decade has shown that the concentration of a damaging pollutant above cities including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles has dropped by as much as 42 per cent. Information from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) shows that, between 2005 and 2011, there is significantly less nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. Changes: As shown above, Nasa data indicates that levels of pollutant nitrogen dioxide have dropped significantly across the U.S. between 2005 and 2011 . Nitrogen dioxide is a yellow-brown gas produced by burning petrol, and is regulated by the U.S. government. It has been linked to a host of respiratory problems, and can make those who breathe it in more vulnerable to diseases like flu. The levels above major cities have fallen, despite both the human population and number of cars on the roads steadily increasing. According to scientists, the welcome change comes because of better technology, economic changes and tougher state regulation. Windy city: Chicago, pictured above, has experienced the most significant change, with 43 per cent less of the pollutant between the more red picture, in 2005, and the less red one from 2011. Pull the slider to see the difference . East coast: Philadelphia, pictured above, saw a 26 per cent decrease from the redder image in 2005 to the bluer one in 2011. Pull the slider to see the difference . Information shown in the images, which colour areas of high-quality air in blue and low-quality air in red, indicates that some cities have had their share of nitrogen dioxide drop by more than 40 per cent. Chicago has 43 per cent less of the pollutant in their air than in 2005, Los Angeles 40 per cent less and Atlanta, Georgia, experience a 42 per cent drop. New York's figure decreased by 32 per cent, Philadelphia's by 26 and Houston, Texas, had a 24 per cent drop. The measurements were taken in the summer months and averaged out over several years. However, the U.S. Envrionmental Protection Agency says the levels of pollution are still too high. According to its estimates 142million people, almost half the US population, live in areas with unhealthy air. Nobody walks: Los Angeles had its pollution fall by 2005 between the redder image in 2005 and the bluer one in 2011. Pull the slider to see the difference .

Bryan Duncan, a Nasa atmospheric scientists based in Greenbelt, Maryland, said: 'While our air quality has certainly improved over the last few decades, there is still work to do – ozone and particulate matter are still problems.' Nasa says the new information will supplement existing data, which is usually taken from the ground rather than space. 'You can't control what you don't measure,' said Russ Dickerson of the University of Maryland, College Park, and member of the NASA Air Quality Applied Sciences Team – created in 2011 by the NASA Applied Sciences Program to serve the needs of U.S. air quality management through the use of Earth Science satellite data, suborbital, and models. 'NASA measurements of air quality have value to the people with the authority to control emissions and develop policy.'","Data collected from probes orbiting earth shows fall in nitrogen dioxide .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Passengers all around the world were left without their bags yesterday after a technical fault at Heathrow Terminal 5 left bags piled up in the departure lounge. Staff struggled to deal with the huge backlog by hand as disgruntled fliers bombarded British Airways - the only airline which uses the terminal - with complaints. Fliers were stranded without clothes and equipment as far away as Africa and the U.S., with BA still unable to say how many were affected or how long they will be without - but admitting thousands of bags were likely to be caught up in the blunder. Pictures from the terminal yesterday show hundreds upon hundreds of bags lined up in the terminal after the 30 miles of conveyor belts which usually move 12,000 bags a day for the airline were put out of action by an IT fault. Chaos: Thousands of passengers have been left without their bags thanks to an IT fault at Heathrow's Terminal 5, which left the complicated bag processing system out of order. Fliers landed in Africa and the U.S. without luggage after 30 miles of conveyor belts which usually move 12,000 bags a day were put out of action . By hand: Struggling BA staff carted thousands of bags through the airport to cover the breakdown, which left some planes departing without all the right luggage . Today airport bosses admitted that some of the baggage had failed to make it through - despite efforts to move it all by hand - and promised to get the bags back to their owners as soon as possible. Rachel Memory said: 'No baggage on board flight from Heathrow to Vancouver. YVR [Vancouver airport] gave us no reference number - shambles' Ted King, of Bishops Stortford, Essex,said: 'Well done @British_Airways for leaving all our luggage in England, now in Uganda without any clothes.' Kathryn Sharples said: 'Please advise where bags from yesterday's BA0778 [to Stockholm, Sweden] are. No answers from Menzies or BA CS phone lines. Poor.' A British Airways spokesman told MailOnline: 'On Thursday morning, the baggage system in Terminal 5 suffered an IT problem which affected how many bags could be accepted for each flight. 'We are very sorry for the difficulties . this has caused and we have been working hard with the airport to make . sure we reunite all of our customers with their luggage as quickly as . possible.' Queues: Disgruntled fliers have been left all over the world with no bags. So many have gone astray that the usual lost luggage tracking system is not working properly . Anger: Fliers to destinations all over the world voiced their disgruntlement on Twitter. One told how there had been no baggage on a London to Vancouver flight . No fans: This unlucky passenger touched down in Uganda with no luggage and no medical equipment after the technical fault, which affected conveyer belts . No reply: Many of the usual sources of information for tracking lost bags have been put out of order because the system is so overloaded with frantic passengers . The airline was left apologising to customers who took them to task over Twitter. They declined to explain how many bags went missing, or how long it will take to move the baggage to their rightful homes. Guidance issued online says that so many bags have gone missing that the usual lost luggage system will be unable to trace it properly. Passengers have been told that they can purchase essential items which BA will later reimburse. A Heathrow spokesman said: 'Yesterday Terminal 5’s baggage system experienced an IT issue which meant that bags were processed manually for a period. We are sorry to any passengers who were affected and we are working with airlines to reunite passengers with any bags that missed their flight.’ The baggage blunder comes just weeks after Heathrow opened its brand new Terminal 2 - the opening of which managed to avoid any disasters, helped in part by running the terminal at only one tenth of its full capacity. The difficulties are a reminder of Terminal 5's ill-fated opening six years ago, where technical faults led to almost 30,000 bags being lost.","Hundreds of bags were left piling up as struggling airport staff dealt with a huge backlog by hand .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A nine-year-old boy accidentally hanged himself on a rope 'Heath Robinson-type' contraption by his bunk bed made of dressing-gown cords he used to watch films with his brother. Liam Gardner, from Ebbw Vale, South Wales, set up a network of cords by the bed to hold up his tablet computer while it played videos, an inquest heard. But the boy, who shared the room with his brother, got caught up in the cords while using them as a swing and was strangled. Hanged: Liam Gardner, nine, (pictured left and right with his father Shane) became caught up in a rope contraption he set up in his room while using it as a swing . Coroner David Bowen compared the set-up to the creations of W Heath Robinson, an early 20th century cartoonist famous for drawing ostentatiously complicated machines. The inquest heard how Liam's mother Kiara Willis, 33, went upstairs in May last year to find Liam unconscious with the cord around his neck. The family tried to cut him down, and attempted to revive him while ambulances came, but Liam was later pronounced dead at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff . Ms Willis, who has four other children, said the contraption had only been set up a few days earlier. She recalled being downstairs when Liam's brother Delmi called for her help. She said: 'My 12-year-old screamed “Mum!” and I knew something was wrong. I ran upstairs - he was just dangling there. Inventive: Liam set up the device to suspend a tablet computer on which he could watch films, but it had only been up a few days before he became fatally entangled inside it . 'I tried to get him off and I couldn’t. My 16-year-old got a knife and tried to cut him down. 'We tried to give him mouth to mouth and we were on the phone to the ambulance. It all happened so quickly. Liam was always climbing on things and jumping off them.' Horror: Liam's mother Kiara Willis, pictured, told the inquest of the moment she discovered her son . Coroner David Bowen said: 'I’m satisfied that Liam was a typical nine-year-old full of life and had no appreciation of danger. 'He shared a bedroom with his brother and they had suspended a Heath Robinson-type of contraption which they used to watch videos. 'While it wasn’t being used for that he would put his body through the contraption and use it as a swing. 'I’m satisfied that was what he was doing the moments before he died.' Mr Bowen said the dressing gown cord 'must have twisted in a totally unexpected way with fatal results.' He recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest in Newport, South Wales. His father Shane Gardner, 34, wrote a message to Liam on a social network site. He said: 'Why, why why did you have to leave us at such a young age? 'Daddy loves you so much so nothing will ever be the same without you.' After the inquest, Ms Willis said: 'He was a happy-go-lucky little boy. He loved life and playing and winding people up. 'I want parents to be aware of the dangers of bunk beds. I never thought this would happen.'","Liam Gardner made device from dressing gown cords to hold up computer .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Tracey Emin has said she would like her controversial unmade bed artwork to stay in the UK - but doubts it will because nowhere can afford the £1million price tag. My Bed - derided by many critics at the time - is a dishevelled monument to 'ladette' culture, surrounded by used condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts and vodka bottles. It almost won the prestigious Turner Prize in 1999, and will go under the hammer at Christie's auction house in London next Tuesday, where it is expected to net current owner Charles Saatchi between £800,000 and £1.2million. Scroll down for video . 'Iconic': Emin said My Bed, which nearly won the Turner Prize, 'changed people's perceptions of art' Popular: The bed, pictured on display in 2003, is currently owned by Charles Saatchi which could make £1.2m from the sale . Ahead of the sale, Emin, 50, said she would prefer the work go on display rather than vanish into a private collection, but doubted anywhere could produce the necessary cash. She told the Evening Standard: 'I feel kind of philosophical about it. The Tate really want it but they haven’t any money. No one has any money to buy it.' Earlier today she revealed how she is struck by flashbacks when she's near the bed, the display of which she said 'changed people's perceptions of art'. She said: 'This is a surreal experience. Every time I'm near the bed or install the bed I get flashbacks and recollections of when I first saw the bed, which was in my bedroom and that was 16 years ago. 'When I made the bed today, I actually had to get in it and pull the duvet over me and push it back to make it feel real and look real. 'Even the smell and everything, it's all still there for me. It's very, very evocative. Except it's like waking up, I wouldn't say a nightmare, but definitely ... it's really strange. Pricey: Emin revealed that she doubts any UK galleries will be prepared to pay between £800,000 and £1.2million for the piece . Up close: A close up of Tracey Emin's piece 'My Bed' which features cigarettes and used condoms . 'It's now going on a different journey. I just hope it goes to a nice place. It's helped me a lot.' Emin said reactions to the artwork, which she produced after a traumatic relationship breakdown, varied across the globe. She said: 'In Japan they were shocked by my dirty slippers but they stole some bloody knickers and some condoms'. 'In America it was like, ""Yeah, we've seen feminist art before, we've done it already"", no fuss, just treated it like a regular artwork. 'Of course in the UK, it just exploded with the Turner Prize. It just went crazy. I still think it's iconic. There was nothing in the world in art that has ever looked like this, that has ever been like this, it's seminal. 'It changed people's perceptions of what art is and what art can be. That's why it's still really special to me. If I could I would show this at my next exhibition. I still love it, I still stand by it and I made it 16 years ago.' Saatchi, who paid £150,000 for My Bed in 2000, is selling it to support the work of his public gallery in Chelsea.","My Bed features condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts and vodka bottles .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. 'Disgusted': Carrie Davies, pictured with four-month-old Trystan, said . she was 'ashamed and embarrassed' after being asked to move while . breastfeeding - but staff said they only wanted her to feel more comfortable . The mother of three, from Caerphilly, South Wales, says she is 'disgusted' by the incident, which made her feel like she was doing something shameful. Ms Davies said: 'She told me I could not breastfeed in the dining area and asked me to sit in a corner by the toilets. 'I felt like a naughty school child who had been stuck in the corner. It was meant to be a nice girlie lunch but they made me feel like I was doing something disgusting. They made me feel embarrassed and ashamed.' 'I did not want to make a fuss, so I just moved, but my son got upset and I got upset. I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible, so we paid the bill and left. 'I was utterly disgusted by the company’s disregard for the breastfeeding laws we have in the UK.' Restaurant: Ms Davies was eating at the Global Buffet in Cardiff with a friend when a waitress suggested she move because a large school group was also eating in the restaurant . Ms Davies, who also has an . eight-year-old son and a daughter, five, said she had never had a . problem breastfeeding in other restaurants. She . said: 'I have never come across such an attitude towards nursing . mothers - it’s no wonder people are put off breastfeeding their babies. Carrie Davies is the latest of a string of mothers who have been singled out for breastfeeding in public. Earlier this month Rhea Holly was called 'disgusting' and a 'slut' by customers at a Costa Coffee shop in London. It came hot on the heels of a mass protest organised by outraged mothers outside a Sports Direct outlet in Nottingham, where Wioletta Komar had been told not to feed her son because of 'company policy'. More shockingly, even hospitals have stigmatised mothers. Allison Smith, 32, was told to use a 'dingy' storage cupboard at a children's hospital in Sydney, Australia, three weeks ago rather than feed her son in public. 'I . have breastfed all three of my children, but in the past, I felt there . was too much of a stigma attached to breastfeeding to do it in public. 'It is only now I’m a bit older that I feel comfortable to do it in public, so I did not expect to be accosted like this.' 'I wear nursing tops, so I can feed my son whenever he’s hungry without anyone even seeing my breast.' The Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place, such as a restaurant, cafe, shop or public transport. But restaurant bosses say they only made the suggestion so that Ms Davies could be more comfortable feeding her son. David Sun, a manager at the restaurant, said: 'We welcome everybody and breastfeeding is no problem at all. We deal with thousands of customers and we understand the law.' 'We regularly have customers breastfeeding in our restaurant, but often, they ask a member of staff if there is a quite area available. It is a huge restaurant and we are always able to provide a quite corner for mums to breastfeed in peace. 'On this occasion, the customer was sitting at the table to breastfeed, so one of our members of staff approached her to ask her if she would prefer to go to a quiet area that might be more convenient for her. 'At the time, we had 130 kids in the restaurant on a school outing and we thought the customer might feel more comfortable in a more private area of the restaurant.' The . Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding . woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport . It states that a business cannot discriminate against mothers who are breastfeeding a child of any age. In . Government guidelines, companies are advised to make sure women they . are providing a service to 'are allowed to breast feed on your premises . if they want to'. It also advises that staff are trained to understand the rights of breast feeding mothers. Under the Act 2010, discriminating against someone because they are with a breastfeeding mother is also prohibited.","Carrie Davies, 27, was asked to move at the Global Buffet in Cardiff .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A mother whose baby had a heart attack after being given contaminated feed in hospital has spoken of her anguish at being suspected of poisoning him. Frances Blacklock, 27, was caught up in a police investigation before her son was a week old after he went into cardiac arrest while on a drip feed and in an incubator at University College Hospital in London (UCLH). He had been delivered by Caesarean section on February 7 2012, and was taken to another hospital to have surgery to correct a bowel problem diagnosed while he was in the womb. Probe: Police launched a probe after Mason Blacklock (right) fell ill in hospital - much to the shock of his mother Frances (left) But soon after he was brought back to UCLH, he suffered the heart attack, which investigators later found was due to excessive magnesium in his IV feed. After the incident, hospital staff phoned Ms Blacklock, who rushed in only to discover her son in a weak and dire state - which nobody could explain. She said: 'I was told to come to . the hospital as soon as possible, as Mason was back on an incubator. When I got there, he was also on a ventilator and looked grey. It was . horrific but no one could tell what had happened.' The new mother was then told that police would investigate the incident amid fears her son was poisoned. Mason survived and is now two years old - but it took a year-long probe by police and medical investigators to conclude that the feed had been to blame. Ms Blacklock said: 'The investigation was awful, even my partner and I had to be . eliminated from suspicion. To be involved in something like that was . just heartbreaking, especially when all we cared about was Mason getting . better. 'Mason . is now two and a half and, while he needs regular appointments at UCLH . to check his progress, he is on his way to what we hope will be a full . recovery.' In danger: Mason suffered a heart attack just days after having emergency surgery . Ms Blacklock - who says her partner was also under suspicion - is now taking legal action against the Quest Healthcare - the company which produced the feed. She has also called for safety regulations to be overhauled. She said: 'We want to know how these problems happened and what is being done to . prevent them from happening again. 'The recent problems outlined by . Public Health England brought all of the bad memories back from our . experiences. No one else should have to face what we have been through . and lessons must be learned.' David Body, a lawyer at solicitors Irwin Mitchell, who represent Ms Blacklock and her son, said: 'The recent reports linking feed contamination to the death of a child have shone a spotlight on this issue and the products that vulnerable patients are administered during hospital treatment. 'Our work on behalf of Mrs Blacklock means we understand the ordeal undergone by parents when an event like this happens and the uncertainty about the long-term consequences this can have on affected children.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that the 2012 investigation took place, which concluded that no crimes had taken place. A UCLH spokesman said: 'Mason came to us as a very sick baby and when he was six days old his condition deteriorated rapidly. 'Due to the astute intervention of our clinical team, this was discovered to be due to high levels of magnesium in Mason’s blood. 'We are pleased that our swift intervention saved his life. We are in regular contact with Mason’s family - who have nothing but praise for our care - and are delighted that he has grown into a healthy two-year-old boy'. A legal representative for Quest Healthcare said: 'There was no issue raised at the . time of any liability on the part of Quest Healthcare for any medical . issues concerning Mason Blacklock; nor was any such issue raised at the . time by the Blacklock family or their solicitors who expressed . satisfaction with the outcomes. 'Fifty five bags of the same batch of the . food was supplied by Quest Healthcare and no problems of any kind were . reported, and no subsequent issues have been raised about any of their . products.’","Frances Blacklock, 27, gave birth to her son Mason in February 2012 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . House prices will soar to 13 times average wages before the end of the decade unless urgent action to build more homes, Labour warns today. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds uses a speech today to accuse the Tories of paying ‘lip service to aspiration’ while home ownership has slumped to its lowest level since 1987. The warning comes as Nationwide reported house prices increased to another new all-time high of £188,949 on average in July, although the pace of growth is showing signs of slowing. Labour claims that on current trends, average house prices in the UK will hit £358,834, and top £832,240 by 2020 . In the latest stage of Labour’s summer offensive, Miss Reynolds releases analysis showing the cost of an average home will reach £359,000 by 2020. On current trends, London prices are forecast to hit £832,240 within six years. It also claims that by 2020 the average deposit in the UK will be more than £70,000. It is claimed that by 2020 the housing shortage will have hit 1.3 million homes, the equivalent of three cities the size of Birmingham. In a speech in Nottingham, Miss Reynolds will say: 'While the Tories say the housing market is back on track, the truth is they’ve presided over the lowest level of house building since the 1920s. 'We’re not even building half the homes we need to keep up with demand.’ Chancellor George Osborne launched the multi-billion pound Help to Buy scheme to help people struggling to afford a deposit onto the housing ladder. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds accuses the Tories of paying ‘lip service to aspiration’ But Labour claims the scheme, which has helped thousands of people buy their first home, has only fuelled demand without addressing the shortage of properties available, pushing up prices. Latest figures show that house prices paid by first-time buyers are up 11.3 per cent year-on-year, compared to 10.7 per cent for people who already home a property. Miss Reynolds adds: ‘The Tories claim to be the party of home ownership. But on their watch home ownership has fallen to its lowest point since 1987. 'The Tories pay lip service to aspiration and home ownership but they’re not willing to take the action necessary to deliver the homes we need to meet these aspirations. 'The only way to ensure more people can buy their own home is to build many more homes. That is the litmus test of aspiration today.' Latest figures from Nationwide said property prices rose by 0.1 per cent month-on-month across the UK, marking the smallest rise seen in 15 months as stricter mortgage lending rules helped to fuel a slowdown in activity, the building society said. On a year-on-year basis, growth in values remained in double digits for the fourth month in a row, although the pace of the annual uplift fell back from 11.8 per cent in June to 10.6 per cent in July. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said the winding down of price growth 'was not entirely unexpected, given mounting evidence of a moderation in activity in recent months'. Miss Reynolds will claim that Labour councils are planning to build more homes than Conservative or Liberal Democrat councils. According to the party’s analysis, Labour authorities are committed to building 862 homes a year, compared with 508 by Tory councils and 393 by Lib Dems. She will point to Labour’s plans to build at least 200,000 new homes a year, put an end to land-banking and reform the housebuilding industry to make it more competitive. However, the Conservatives said that in government Labour promised to build 240,000 homes a year and barely reached half that number. Average deposits in the UK are on course to reach £71,767, according to Labour analysis . Tory housing minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Under the last government Britain was building fewer homes than at any time since the 1920’s. Labour’s record on housing was truly appalling. 'By contrast, housebuilding is now at its highest for a number of years and we have already delivered over 445,000 new homes, including 200,000 affordable homes. 'There is still more to do, but the real threat to this recovering housing market would be a Labour Government. Labour would cut housebuilding through taxes and red tape – and it’s hardworking taxpayers who would pay the price for this failure.' The Bank of England has suggested interest rates will rise before the election, with house prices soaring by 10 per cent year-on-year. But yesterday Labour's shadow chanellor Ed Balls said the hike in mortgage bills was the fault of the government. 'Already today, even before living standards have stopped falling, this government's failure to get more houses built means there is now a real risk that interest rates will rise prematurely to rein in an unbalanced housing market.'","On current trends, London house prices on course to hit £832,240 by 2020 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Warm weather has sent British Gas profits tumbling by 26 per cent, as customers turned their heating off. The energy giant made £265million less in the first half of this year than it did in 2013, despite hiking its prices at the onset of winter. Consumer groups said families were still being hit with price rises, after the watchdog Ofgem warned energy suppliers were making an increasing amount of money from the typical household, up to £106 for the coming year. British gas made £265million less in the first half of this year than it did in 2013, despite hiking its prices at the onset of winter . British Gas parent company also saw profits fall, down 35 per cent to £1.03 billion. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw said: 'With challenging trading conditions on both sides of the Atlantic in the first half, earnings will be lower in 2014 than in 2013. However, the group is well positioned to return to growth in 2015.' He went on: 'This is a business that is very affected by the weather and we had two unusual phenomena this year. 'Firstly, we had warmer weather in the UK which meant actually our average customer's consumption of gas was down 24 per cent. 'We also simultaneously had very cold weather in the US - the Polar Vortex - which resulted in generating companies charging us with a lot of additional sort of ancillary costs. 'The combination of those two meant that at the group level the profit was down. We see a much better picture for the second half of the year.' British Gas serves around 11 million homes. Last autumn it ratcheted up his prices by 9.2 per cent before trimming charges by around £50 after the government removed some so-called green levies on bills. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw blamed warmer weather and the 'Polar Vortex' for the slump in profits . But Centrica said the average bill was expected to be £90, or 7 per cent, lower this year reflecting warmer weather and energy efficiency measures. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: 'British Gas profits are down because of a warm winter, not lower prices. Ofgem reports that supplier profit margins are set to double, while energy costs continue to be the top consumer concern. 'Energy companies must do everything they can to pass on any savings to their customers including falling wholesale and network costs. 'That's why we need the competition authority to establish whether the price we pay for our energy is fair.' British Gas has come under pressure to cut bills after Ofgem pointed to falling wholesale gas and electricity prices - while it is also facing a full-scale competition probe which could see it vulnerable to a break-up. However latest figures from the regulator suggesting rising pre-tax profit margins from household supply are disputed by industry body Energy UK. Separate figures from French-owned EDF - another of the so-called Big Six suppliers, serving around four million households - showed that operating profits in the UK rose 9.5 per cent to £560 million for the first half of the year. It said the growth was the result of higher output from its nuclear power stations, compared with a period last year when more of its generating capacity was out of service for planned maintenance. EDF said a decline in gas sales due to milder weather was partly offset by 3.2 per cent growth in customer accounts.","Big Six supplier made £265million less in the first half of 2014 than in 2013 .

David Cameron has revealed how his weekly meetings with the Queen help him to ‘sort out the problems’ in his own head – but doubts she gets much out of it. The Prime Minister said that after 60 years on the throne, the Queen has ‘literally heard it all before’. And he revealed the hour-long sessions on a Wednesday evening pass without tea or coffee – or anything stronger. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron meets the Queen every week for an hour, but he admitted he is not sure she gets anything out of their chats . Prime Minister David Cameron today lifted the lid on his weekly chats with the Queen during a Q&A session at United Utilities in Warrington . Prime Ministers are granted an ‘audience’ with the monarch every week, when Parliament is sitting, to update the head of state on the major issues the country faces. But speaking during a Q&A session in Warrington today, Mr Cameron admitted that there is nothing left to shock or surprise the Queen, who has been served by a dozen prime ministers. He told staff at United Utilities in Warrington: ‘It is one of the great privileges of my job. I see Her Majesty every week when Parliament is sitting. But there is no cups of tea, no cups of coffee, nothing stronger. ‘It is probably one of the most valuable hours that I have because when you think of her Majesty, I am her 12th Prime Minister. ‘She started with Winston Churchill and she has literally heard it all before.’ When the Queen meets the Prime Minister there is no-one else in the room, and there is no official record made of what is said. Mr Cameron told apprentices that his audiences with the Queen help to clear his head, but they drink nothing stronger than coffee . As part of his tour this morning, Mr Cameron stopped off for a coffee at the Buttonwood services on the M62, where he was recognised by some onlookers . Mr Cameron said he found the chance to discuss domestic and international problems and challenges with someone outside the political process ‘an incredibly useful exercise’. But he admitted that the Queen might be slightly less enthusiastic about the experience. ‘I am not sure it is always of huge benefit to her, but it is of great benefit to me,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘Because I find it helps sort out the problems in my own head about the things we need to do. ‘I think she is the most amazing public servant. I think we are so lucky to have a symbol of national unity that we do in our royal family and to have someone who has fulfilled that role so magnificently for all these years. ‘It is hard to think of a time when she has ever put a foot wrong. ‘I think she is an absolutely magnificent person in the work she does.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Women cyclists should have slow lanes to ‘pootle along’ in to stop them being intimidated by lycra-clad men tearing through towns and cities, a former Labour minister has claimed. Meg Hillier said women do not want the ‘muck sweat’ of cycling and fear they will fall off their bike when other cyclists are ‘whizzing past you’. Each year women cycle around 20 miles each, compared to 80 miles for men, latest figures show. Scroll down the video . Women struggle to know what to wear when cycling to work and are put off by people lycra speeding past them, Labour MP Meg Hillier suggested . Ms Hillier, a Home Office minister in Gordon Brown’s government, called for roads to be redesigned to encourage more women to cycle. She suggested there should be ‘a fast and a slow lane’ to separate the hardcore speed freaks from those who find the extreme pace ‘quite scary’. The MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch also called for ‘cycling friendly fashion’. New cycling data from the Department for Transport show marked differences between the sexes. Women in their twenties are most likely to cycle, covering 53miles every year, but still well behind the 84 miles covered by men of the same age. The MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch also called for ‘cycling friendly fashion’ Forty-something men cyclist most, racking up 161miles compared to just 24miles for women aged 40-49. Ms Hillier told the Telegraph: ‘One of the big things is also that women don’t want the “muck sweat” of cycling. There are some fashion designers around Hackney and east London now which are designing cycling friendly fashion, but not enough yet. ‘Men arrive at work in flat shoes and a suit if you are going to an office job and so it is easier to turn up on a bike – for a women there is the worry of wearing a skirt, or a dress, maybe high heels, then you have to think about something else to wear on your bike, how to carry your work clothes. Although there are plenty of women who hop on and go.’ She said cycle planners had to consider how to mark cycling ‘a normal thing’. ‘I think Hackney has tried to pioneer that where you can cycle down a normal road, and you are not forced down rat runs and with the lycra-clad mad cyclists. ‘It can be quite scary with all these people whizzing past you and you are afraid you are going to fall over. ‘When cycling is planned ideally, you have a fast and a slow lane, so those that want to pootle along at a normal pace can do so.’ In the last decade the number of miles cycled by men has soared from 57 to 80miles, a 40 per cent rise. But among women it has risen from 18 to 20, an increase of only 11 per cent. Among the under-60s, women walk further than men. Overall, men of all ages walk 80 miles a year to women’s 193miles.","Meg Hillier says women do not want the 'muck sweat' of cycling to work .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Wages under the coalition will have fallen more sharply than under any government since Victorian times, Labour claimed today. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls used a major speech on the economy to warn after inflation are down by 2.3 per cent, the worst fall since Benjamin Disraeli was Prime Minister. Mr Balls echoed Ronald Reagan's campaign to be US President when he asked voters if they were better off than four years ago, as he warned interest rates could rise early because the coalition has failed to build enough homes. Analysis by the House of Commons Library  shows wages are expected to fall by 2.3 per cent during this Parliament, the lowest since 1874-80 . Mr Balls's speech in Bedford is the latest stage in a Labour summer offensive to seize control of the political agenda with less than a year until the general election. He pointed to analysis by the House of Commons Library which shows that by 2015 'working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any Parliament since 1874'. The forecast of a 2.3 per cent fall in real earnings between 2010 and 2015 will be the first time incomes have been lower than when a government came to office since the 1920s . Mr Balls said it means average wages after inflation are down by more than £1,600 a year since 2010. He claimed David Cameron will try to cut the top rate of tax again – from 45p to 40p for those earning over £150,000 if the Tories win next year’s election. Mr Balls told an audience in Bedford: ‘While David Cameron and George Osborne complacently claim the economy is now fixed, the truth is most people are worse off under the Tories. ‘For working people, average wages after inflation are down by over £1,600 a year since 2010. ‘By 2015 working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any Parliament since 1874. 'It’s also set to be the first time since the 1920s that people are worse off at the end of the Parliament than they were at the beginning. ‘From a Conservative-led Government that promised to make working people better off back in 2010, this is a dismal record of failure.’ In 1981 Ronald Reagan asked US voters if they were better off . British politicians often look across the Atlantic for inspiration. Labour is mimicking another politician from the US: Ronald Reagan. In the 1980 US election campaign  Reagan attacked Jimmy Carter, asking voters: ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’ Labour has made clear it plans to pose the same question to voters in 2015. In his party conference speech last year, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'In 2015 you'll be asking: am I better off now than I was five years ago and we already know the answer for millions of families will be no.' Labour-commissioned research shows that over the five years to 2015 average earnings are expected to have declined by 2.3 per cent. That will be the biggest fall since 1874-80, when average earnings fell 2.6 per cent. At that time, Britain was suffering in the ‘Long Depression’, which, like the most recent recession, was sparked by trouble in the financial sector, the ‘Panic’ of 1873. Mr Balls said: ‘Working people can’t afford five more years of the same old Tory economics. We know the Tories’ real economic plan - it’s to cut taxes at the top and hope that wealth will just trickle down.' The Bank of England has suggested interest rates will rise before the election, with house prices soaring by 10 per cent year-on-year. But Mr Balls said the hike in mortgage bills was the fault of the government. 'Already today, even before living standards have stopped falling, this government's failure to get more houses built means there is now a real risk that interest rates will rise prematurely to rein in an unbalanced housing market.' He went on: ‘Having already cut taxes for millionaires in this Parliament, they’re champing at the bit to do it again if they win the election - cutting the top rate of tax for people earning over £150,000 again from 45p to 40p. Another tax cut worth £3 billion for the richest one per cent of our country. ‘We know George Osborne wanted to cut it down to 40p in his omnishambles Budget two years ago. David Cameron won’t rule out doing it. And Boris Johnson and the right are now demanding it. ‘This is the real Tory agenda for a second term. The same old Tories standing up for the few, while everyone else is left behind. And it shows just how much is at stake next year.' And he will claim Labour will make ‘long term changes to create an economy that works for all working people, not just a few’. It will be based on ‘big reform, not big spending’, he said.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, faced questions last night over why he gave a parliamentary pass to a friend of his wife. Wealthy businesswoman and Labour donor Farah Sassoon has since donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’s bid for re-election. Tory MP Rob Wilson is demanding to know why access to Parliament has been granted to Mrs Sassoon, who was pictured last year cavorting in the back of a taxi with Mrs Bercow. Scroll down for video . John Bercow is facing questions about why Mrs Sassoon has a pass to enter Parliament . The official register of MP’s interests shows Mr Bercow has received £5,000 from Trust Reservations, the Labour-supporting company run by Mrs Sassoon. The firm has also given £2,385.84 to Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls. The Guido Fawkes blog reported that Mrs Sassoon has also received a pass for her to ‘bypass security checks into Parliament’. However, Mr Bercow is being challenged about why the pass was granted. A parliamentary pass gives the holder full access to the high-security Palace of Westminster estate. They are given to MPs, aides, journalists and staff who work in the Commons and the Lords. Passes – which are granted only after a full security check – are prized because they allow the holder to wander unaccompanied around the estate and gain access to MPs and officials, as well as restaurants and bars in Westminster. Mr Wilson, Tory MP for Reading East, has written to the Speaker to ‘raise the concerns of several of my constituents’. Mr Wilson adds: ‘Integrity, accountability and openness, are part of the seven Nolan Principles of Public Life which are enshrined into Parliament by their inclusion in Code of Conduct for MPs.’ He sets out several questions, including why Mrs Sassoon was given a Parliamentary pass, what kind of pass it was when it was issued and when expires. The letter asks what was ‘the intended purpose of her company’s donation to your office and whether Mr Bercow consulted with ‘with any of the Parliamentary authorities, such as your foremost adviser, the Clerk of the Commons, on the propriety of accepting a donation having issued this pass’. Mr Wilson demanded answers from Mr Bercow by this Friday, noting that he has given Mr Bercow the opportunity to respond before considering referring the matter to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Mrs Sassoon is married to hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns. Their daughter Sophia is a star of Made in Chelsea. In October Mrs Sassoon was pictured leaving an awards ceremony with Mrs Bercow and the pair are thought to regularly party together. A spokesman for the Speaker said: 'For security purposes, House officials do not confirm names of pass holders. However, the Speaker would like to confirm that his wife applied for a pass for a female friend in 2012. 'It is not unusual for residents living on the Parliamentary Estate to be able to apply for passes for close friends and family. All applications go through security clearance checks. ‘Farah Sassoon made a donation to ‘the Speaker’s seeking re-election’ campaign fund on 7 June 2014 (it was accepted on 1 July 2014). ‘The donation was towards the Speaker’s re-election fund, not to his office. As you are aware, the convention that the Speaker is independent of party dates back to the mid-18th century. 'When a Member of Parliament becomes Speaker of the House she or he resigns from his or her political party and run as an independent candidate under the banner of ‘the Speaker Seeking Re-Election’. 'The donation is for this purpose, and is listed as being so in the Register of Members’ Interests under ‘Sponsorships’, in accordance with the rules.’","Wealthy businesswoman Farah Sassoon is a also Labour donor .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . More than 300,000 people are so poor they cannot afford to go bankrupt, a report warned today. The Centre for Social Justice claimed thousands of people cannot even raise the £525 fee to go bust. The think tank called for more community banks to help millions of people to access finance not available from the big high street chains. The Centre for Social Justice said millions of people struggle to get finance from standard high street banks . Families need access to cheaper loans to help them to make ends meet, the CSJ said. It calls for red-tape to be cut to allow credit unions to become Community Banks which offer more stable loans and banking services at cheaper rates and on better terms. CSJ director Christian Guy said: ‘There is a growing group of people under intense pressure as a result of problem debt. ‘This debt rips into families and traps people on the edges of our society. Many don’t know where to turn. ‘Worse, people in poorer communities are effectively excluded from mainstream banking – hit hard by punitive fees, penalties and crippling debt.’ The report warns that the problem of people getting into money problems ‘appears to be getting worse’, with overall personal debt almost doubling in the past decade. There are now 2.2 million more people estimated to be in need of debt advice than in 2011., the CSJ said. The think tank said it had ‘heard from debt charities about the number of people who become trapped in debt… but are unable to afford the £700 (including a £525 deposit) required to apply for bankruptcy’. Christians Against Poverty estimated that there are 315,000 people who are too poor to go bankrupt each year. Official figures show young women are almost twice as likely to fall into personal insolvency as men of the same age. In some parts of the country, more than one in every 1,000 women aged under 25 have gone bust. Figures from the Insolvency Service show how among the under 35s, women are more likely to go bust than men . They are buying designer clothes and other expensive goods as they try to emulate the rich and famous. The growing level of bankruptcy and other financial problems is seen as a hangover of the credit crunch, and changing lifestyles which mean young women are more willing - and able - to take on debts. The Insolvency Service’s figures show that last year 7.8 women aged 18 to 24 became insolvent for every 10,000 adults compared with a rate of 4.0 for men. More women than men were also going bust in the 25-34 age group, although the difference was not so stark. The personal insolvency rate for women was 32.8 per 10,000 adults last year, while for men it was 25.6. The figures, for England and Wales, show that around 14,730 women aged 18 and 34 were overwhelmed by their debts last year, compared with around 10,950 men.","Centre for Social Justice calls for community banks to help the poorest .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The cost of applying for a driving licence is to be slashed by up to a third under plans being announced today. New drivers who want their first licence will pay just £34, down from the current £50. The price of renewing licences and the fee for tacographs will also be cut under efforts to ease the cost of motoring. The coalition has long argued it is ending the war on the motorist, curbing parking fines and cutting the duty on petrol and diesel. New transport minister Claire Perry, promoted in this month's reshuffle, will today launch a consultation on the plans to dramatically cut the cost of a driving licence, . She said: 'The cost of driving can be significant, especially for new drivers. 'I’m pleased to say that we are planning to save drivers £18million a year by cutting licence fees, thanks to the DVLA making significant savings to their running costs.' Drivers who apply online for their first driving licence would see the fee drop from £50 to £34. Drivers who renew their licence after 10 years would see the fee drop from £20 to £14. The online reduction is 32 per cent and the paper application reduction is 15 per cent. All driver tachograph cards would fall from £38 to £32. The Department for Transport expects the changes to save drivers nearly £18 million and the industry around £2 million every year. Transport minister Claire Perry said young drivers were especially affected by the high cost of motoring . Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'I have been working hard to drive savings across the whole public sector and it's great to see the benefit of these efficiencies feed through to drivers and businesses' pockets. What the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) have shown today is that you can do more for less.' DVLA is currently reviewing all the fees they charge to motorists. Today's consultation is the first step in this ongoing review. The consultation closes on August 25 2014 and the Government is hoping to introduce the new fees by the end of October 2014.","First licence application to fall from £50 to £34 as part of DVLA review .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Business minister Matt Hancock revealed how his family's firm had to put up a sign warning people not to drink bleach . Health and safety inspectors refused to sign-off the family firm of a government minister until they put up a sign telling people not to drink bleach. Business minister Matt Hancock revealed the bizarre experience as he railed against ‘heavy-handed’ jobsworths threatening small firms with unnecessary rules and regulations. Promoted to attend Cabinet in this month’s reshuffle, he will tomorrow unveil plans to allow companies to collect evidence of over-officious red-tape getting in the way of doing business. The government claims there are too many bodies inspecting businesses, often duplicating work and imposing unnecessary and costly burdens on those struggling to stay afloat. Mr Hancock says he understands the struggles people face with the ‘stress and worry of meeting monthly bills’ and they should not be added to with pointless inspections. He grew up watching his parents build an IT software firm, and the impact of daft regulations when it was visited by health and safety inspectors. Without a sign expressly warning people about the perils of drinking bleach, they would have been failed, he says. 'The only thing they could find that was wrong was that there was a bottle of bleach in the kitchen that wasn't labelled correctly,’ he told The Sunday Times. ‘I remember writing the poster that says, 'There is bleach in the cupboard, please do not drink it.' When we put that up they passed us.’ He later added: ‘When I was growing up my parents started and grew a small software firm in Chester, so I’ve seen first-hand the stress and worry of meeting monthly bills and the constant search for new finance. ‘It’s these personal insights that power this government's determination to make Britain the best place in the world to start up and grow a business.’ Tomorrow he will announce plans to allow business groups to collect and present evidence of excessive burdens to ministers and regulators. It means industry bodies themselves will review enforcement of regulation in their sectors. It will cover fresh produce and livestock industries first, before being rolled out to other sectors. Mr Hancock added: ‘The worst cases are where there are two different regulators. One says: ""You've got to do this"" and the other says: ""If you do that, I'll fine you."" There are 11 different regulators of farms. The aim is to have one group of people who take into account all the different regulations and check they are being applied in a reasonable way.’ Mr Hancock will tomorrow announce plans for industry groups to review inspections and report directly to ministers on the impact on their business . The Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill, which will return to Parliament in the autumn, aims to reduce red-tape on growing firms. It includes better access to finance, and making it easier for a small business to get a loan from a lender other than their bank. New ‘cheque imaging’ technology – where recipients use a smartphone to take a picture of a cheque – will speed up clearing times from six days to two days. Mr Hancock said: ‘Every village, town and city throughout the country is host to a range of small businesses from shops, garages and cafés, to manufacturing firms and tech start-ups. We are backing business every step of the way with the first small business bill, to help create the prosperity and secure the jobs we need. ‘Small businesses are the driving force of our economy and this bill is part of the government’s commitment to back enterprise and help firms to start-up and scale-up.’","New business minister Matt Hancock rails against 'heavy-handed' rules .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg has ordered a last-ditch fight back to claim credit for the economic revival. The summer offensive will seek to answer the question ‘what have the Lib Dems ever done for us?’ as polls show the Tories are credited with the return to growth. But while Mr Clegg and his closest ally Danny Alexander promise to 'face-off' with George Osborne, Vince Cable is has gone off-message by grumbling about low wages. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and his closest ally Danny Alexander, pictured at the Commonwealth games last week, want to claim more credit for the economic recovery . New figures on Friday showed Britain’s economy has finally bounced back from the deepest recession in post-war history. Growth of 0.8 per cent between April and June draws a line under the worst downturn the nation has faced. Chancellor George Osborne declared: ‘Thanks to the hard work of the British people, today we reach a major milestone in our long term economic plan.' It means the economy is now larger than before the 2008 financial crisis. However, the Lib Dems fear they are getting none of the credit for the turnaround. Now Mr Clegg’s party has drawn up Operation Roman, named after the running joke in after Monty Python's Life of Brian when fed-up protesters complain: ‘What have the Romans ever done for us?’ Britain's economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months to June, taking the total size of the economy back to levels not seen since before the financial crisis hit in 2007 . It has taken much longer for the UK economy to return to pre-crash levels than it did after recessions in the 1970s and 1990s . Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Mr Osborne’s deputy, is planning to use speeches and leaflets sent to activists to insist the recovery would not happening without the Lib Dems. He told the Sunday Times: ‘It is spelling out the answer to the question: what have the Liberal Democrats ever done for us? ‘As Liberal Democrats it's our single biggest challenge over the next few months to make sure that we get our fair share of the credit for the recovery. ‘’Every single headline is Osborne this, Osborne that. But the truth is that none of what has happened could have happened without the Lib Dems. We will be aggressively putting our case across. ‘It is also going to mean that Osborne and I are going to have to battle in public. It's a battle for headlines and for airtime to get that message out there. ‘If that means George and I face off from time to time, that's absolutely fine.’ It has taken six long years to reverse the decline which began in early 2008 and saw the economy shrink by 7.2 per cent by the middle of 2009. The International Monetary Fund now expects the UK economy to grow by 3.2 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015. The uplift of 0.4 points for this year and 0.2 points for next year is the largest boost for any major economy in the world. But Mr Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, has been accused of focussing on the negatives instead of trumpeting his party’s success. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has gone off-message, grumbling about the low level of wage growth . In a series of regional newspaper articles he highlighted how while employment levels are improving strongly, pay growth has fallen to just 0.3 per cent, lagging well behind inflation at 1.9 per cent. In a South West newspaper he said: 'Wages have only grown by 0.1 per cent in the last year.' And he added that Yorkshire and the Humber ‘wages grew by just 0.5 per cent in the last year’. Chris Leslie, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Vince Cable has admitted what David Cameron and George Osborne refuse to recognise about this government's economic record ... wages have been growing more slowly than prices and are now down over £1,600 a year since 2010,' he said. 'But Vince Cable and the Lib Dems are part of a government that's failing to tackle this cost-of-living crisis while giving millionaires a huge tax cut. Labour's economic plan will make Britain better off and fairer for the future.'","Lib Dems claim record growth would not be happening without them .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Cash-strapped families should not waste their money on organic food because they think it is healthier, the government has warned. Shoppers should instead spend their money on whatever they can afford, even if it means eating tinned or frozen vegetables which are in no way ‘nutritionally inferior’. The government now faces calls to end £20million of subsidies to organic farming, which owes ‘more to myth than evidence’. Critics want the government to end its £20million funding for the organic industry, arguing it does nothing to improve the health of the nation . A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 per cent more antioxidants than non-organic crops. But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic is a healthier option. Amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables, the government is at pains to stress that families feeling the pinch should not waste their money on organic. Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said: ‘It can be difficult balancing a family budget, but in providing a varied, balanced diet nobody need feel they have given their family a nutritionally inferior diet by choosing lower-priced, conventional products.’ Just 30 per cent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Among the lowest income groups, just 24 per cent of adults manage their Five-A-Day. Baroness Jolly added: ‘All fruit and vegetables count toward this, whether fresh or frozen, dried or canned, organic or not. ‘There is no evidence to suggest that there is a nutritional premium in some forms above others. ‘Frozen vegetables, for example, are as valuable as fresh in meeting our 'five a day'.’ The government encourages mothers who receive Healthy Start vouchers for fruit and vegetables ‘to get the best value for their vouchers, but we would not expect them to prioritise organic products’. She added: ‘Organic products provide a useful extension of consumer choice, but it is worth emphasising that, nutritionally, they are no better and no worse than conventional products.’ She said the only benefits of organic farming were enjoyed by ‘birds, insects, mammals, plants and fungi’. ‘It is up to the consumer to decide how they spend their money on their fruit and veg. There are many reasons why an individual might wish to choose organic products but nutritional benefit should not be one of them.’ The comments came in a debate in the House of Lords, in which Lib Dem peer Lord Taverne tore into supporters of the organic movement which ‘owed more to myth than evidence’. He said early enthusiasts included Rudolf Steiner ‘had crazy ideas such as planting according to phases of the moon’ and even Adolf Hitler ‘was completely sold on organic farming’. Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said there were many reasons why people might buy organic, but 'nutritional benefit should not be one of them'. Lib Dem Lord Taverne said organic has become a 'kind of religion that is impervious to scientific evidence' Lord Taverne added: ‘For some, the organic movement is still a kind of religion that is impervious to scientific evidence.’ Claims that it is free of pesticides ignore the fact that levels in non-organic food make little difference to health, he said. ‘One cup of coffee contains more carcinogens than you would ingest from a whole year’s consumption of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables. Of course, that should not stop you drinking coffee.’ He called for Defra to make an important change of policy. ‘It should stop spending more than £20 million a year on subsidising farmers to change to organic farming.’ The money should instead be spent on plant science research, he said. Tory peer Viscount Ridley said: ‘Study after study has failed to find a significant benefit from organic foods. This latest study, although admirably diligent and a perfectly respectable meta-analysis, is no exception.’ ‘The health benefits of organic food, if they exist at all, are immeasurably small. ‘The science is therefore becoming very clear that many people who buy organic food because they think it is healthier for them must be wasting their money. It would be good if they were informed of that.’ However, the Soil Association said the study in the British Journal of Nutrition showed their were benefits to eating organic. Chief Executive Helen Browning said: ‘We know that people choose organic food because they believe it is better for them, as well as for wildlife, animal welfare and the environment, and this research backs up what people think about organic food. 'In other countries there has long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the benefits of organic food and farming: we hope these findings will bring the UK in line with the rest of Europe, when it comes to both attitudes to organic food and support for organic farming.'","Struggling shoppers told they are better off buying more fruit and veg .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Pressure is mounting on John Bercow over claims he is too biased against the Tories to remain as Commons Speaker. An anonymous Commons motion is already circulating in Parliament demanding he go after failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors. Now outgoing Commons clerk, Sir Robert Rogers, has pointedly highlighted that the 'really remarkable powers' Mr Bercow enjoys depend on him being fair to all political parties. A Commons motion has been drafted accusing John Bercow of failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors, and demanding an immediate search for a replacement . Sir Roberts Rogers is standing down as clerk of the Commons, ending a 42-year Parliamentary career . He added: ‘So this clerk will be sorely missed by . the House and by me. We don’t know why he has chosen to retire early, . though his working environment behind closed doors has not always been . easy, as those in the know have already alluded.’ Criticism of Mr Bercow has mounted in recent weeks, after he has appeared to repeatedly mock David Cameron in the Commons and faced accusations of being rude to staff. Aides to the Speaker were forced to deny claims made in the Commons chamber that part of the reason for Sir Robert's early retirement was he had been told to 'f*** off’ by Mr Bercow. In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Robert refuses to be drawn on the state of strained relations with the Speaker. He said: 'We give advice in confidence, and the other side of that coin is that personal relationships are also in confidence. 'Were that not so, we would start to breakdown the relationship of trust that rightly exists between officers of the house and the MPs. Wherever you start to break that trust down, you do the relationship damage.' But in a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Bercow, amid swirling rumours of plots to oust him being bein too pro-Labour, Sir Robert added:  'All I can say is that historically, the House has given the Speaker, the chair, really remarkable powers and that rests on the tradition of impartiality and being a servant of the house, something which dates back to Arthur Onslow in the 18th century. 'I think I would leave that there as a statement of the relationship between the Speaker and the House.' Senior Tory MPs are privately plotting how to remove Mr Bercow from his post after the next election. Even some Labour frontbenchers are 'fed up' with his patronising manner during debates, and are unhappy at the way he has berated some of their own MPs. The anonymous letter is thought to have been sent to several MPs and journalists in Parliament . One of the most bizarre exchanges came this week, as Mr Cameron took questions during a lengthy sessions on Gaza and the Malaysian Airlines MH17 atrocity. Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘Somebody asked how long the statement would run, but I would just point out, if I may, that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the Prime Minister’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough, I am sure.’ A draft Commons motion, seen by MailOnline, has been circulated in Parliament in an attempt to step up pressure on the 51-year-old to quit. Tory MP Michael Fabricant last week accused Mr Bercow of telling the Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers to 'f*** off' The Early Day Motion criticising Mr Bercow has not been formally tabled, and does not appear to have been signed. It states: ‘This House regrets that the Speaker has failed to live up to the tradition of impartiality established by his predecessors; notes his increasingly erratic behaviour; condemns his systematic bullying and humiliation of staff, which has no place in modern society, and especially not in a Parliament which should set a national example; and therefore resolves to proceed immediately to the election of a new Speaker, in which he shall not be a candidate.’ A similar motion was used by Tory MP Douglas Carswell to help to unseat the last Speaker, Labour MP Michael Martin, in June 2009. Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who denies being behind the letter, said at the weekend: ‘Parliament deserves better than hot-headed, unpredictable and foul-mouthed John Bercow. 'The sooner we get a new Speaker, the better. Bercow should go,’ he wrote in the Mail on Sunday. It followed his claim in the Commons that Mr Bercow swore at Sir Robert. The Speaker immediately denied the allegation about Sir Robert Rogers, saying: ‘I’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong.’ But Mr Fabricant stood by the claim, declaring he does not believe things should be ‘swept under the carpet’. Earlier this year Mr Bercow tried to humiliate Mr Cameron in the Commons by cutting him off mid-sentence. During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs and interrupted by Mr Bercow. As the PM tried to protest that he had not finished, the Speaker hit back: 'He can take it from me that he is finished.' Last year relations reached such a low that MPs designed badges with three bees pictured, to show they were members of the BBB club: ‘Bol****ed By Bercow’.","Letter circulated in Parliament claiming Speaker is not being impartial .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today became the latest politician to be hit by the curse of local radio. The Prime Minister was reprimanded live on air after repeatedly referring to Tyneside while being interviewed on BBC Tees. Broadcasting from London, Mr Cameron admitted he was confused about the area he was speaking to, before hastily trying to change the subject. Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to Pentland Brands Global Headquarters in London today, became confused about where he was broadcasting to while on BBC Radio Tees . With less than a year to go until the general election, all party leaders are desperate to have airtime in every part of the country. But doing a round of back-to-back local radio interviews seems to be most perilous way of trying to reach the electorate. Today Mr Cameron annoyed presenter Lisa McCormick by repeatedly referring to examples of how the economy was flourishing on Tyneside. Eventually she snapped: 'You keep mentioning the River Tyne. That's not our region Prime Minister. I'm sorry, we are the River Tees.' Sounding distinctly flustered, Mr Cameron replied: 'I'm sorry, I thought I was doing....' before going on hastily to point out that the Government was investing £90 million in the Tees Valley. But that did nothing to placate Ms McCormick who pointed out that it was pouring £470 million into Greater Manchester and £440 million into the South East. 'Ninety million pounds seems like a drop in the ocean to me,' she said. The River Tees and the River Tyne are separated by the River Weir in the North East of England . Spot the difference: The Prime Minister referred to the River Tyne (left) while broadcasting on local radio covering the River Tees (right) Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland said Mr Cameron is 'out of touch' and disinterested in Teesside. He said: 'Over the last four years of David Cameron we've had a Tory peer calling the region 'desolate', frequent misspellings of Teesside in official Number 10 letters and now the Prime Minister himself can't even take the basic cue of appearing on BBC Tees to get the hint that our river is the Tees and not the Tyne. 'This just highlights how David Cameron is out of touch with the region and completely disinterested in places like Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar, Hartlepool and East Cleveland.' However, Labour politicians are not immune to the pitfalls of local radio. Earlier this month shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna faced ridicule after mis-pronounced Worcester. As he took to the local airwaves to promote Labour’s latest policy, he bizarrely referred to people on the streets of Wichita, a city in Kansas 4,400 miles away. Before May’s local elections, Labour leader Ed Miliband was also caught out during an interview on BBC Radio Wiltshire. Ben Prater, the interviewer, asked him what he made of ‘Jim Grant’ without saying who he was. Mr Miliband asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no idea who he was talking about, and asked the presenter to ‘enlighten’ him. In a toe-curling exchange, Mr Prater told him Mr Grant was the Labour leader on Swindon council. Mr Miliband then blundered again by referring to Mr Grant as the leader of Swindon council, when in fact the council is controlled by Conservatives. Flailing, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think he is doing a good job for Labour on the council.’","Prime Minister angers BBC presenter with gaff about River Tyne .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . New Tory Cabinet minister Liz Truss has admitted singing anti-Thatcher songs during nuclear protests as a child. The 38-year-old, promoted to Environment Secretary last week, revealed she joined her parents at to CND protests to the sound of chants of 'Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, out, out, out’. The daughter of a left-wing academic dad and a Greenham Common mum joined the Lib Dems before becoming a Tory at university and being elected as an MP in 2010. South West Norfolk Conservative MP Liz Truss has revealed she joined in with anti-Thatcher songs as a child . Miss Truss is seen as one of the rising stars of the Conservative party, tipped by some as a future party leader following in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher. But 30 years ago she was joining in with protests against the Iron Lady. In an interview with The Sun, she said: ‘I probably didn't know what I was saying. I was seven at the time but I definitely remember that is what people were saying, absolutely. ‘We did a number of things like marches, protests. On one occasion when we went down to London in a bus we had made some nuclear bombs made out of carpet rolls — ours didn't quite work because it had floral wallpaper on it.’ Born in Oxford in 1975, her father John was a maths professor and her mother Priscilla was a nurse and a teacher. She grew up in Paisley, Renfrewshire before attending a comprehensive school in Leeds. She added: ‘The teachers at my school were quite often card-carrying members of the Labour Party and it just was not part of the culture to approve of what the government was doing.’ A young Liz Truss (pictured right) poses with a banner for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . David Cameron promoted Miss Truss to Environment Secretary in last week's reshuffle. The pair visited the Royal Welsh Show this week . She joined the Lib Dems but switched to the Conservatives when studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford university. ‘I had never met anyone of my own age that was a Tory, so going to university and seeing people who were Tories and who believed in what I believed in was an eye-opener.’ She was elected MP for South West Norfolk in 2010, and within two years became an education minister. Miss Truss was among several women promoted by David Cameron in last week’s Cabinet reshuffle, taking charge of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Owen Paterson was fired after his disastrous handling of the horsemeat scandal, winter floods and a cull of badgers.","South West Norfolk MP was promoted to Environment Secretary in reshuffle .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Jimmy Wales said a European Court ruling allowing people to have links removed from the search engine's index was 'open-ended' and the law was 'confusing' Web giant Google must not be put in charge of 'censoring history', the founder of Wikipedia warned today. Jimmy Wales said a European Court ruling allowing people to have links removed from the search engine's index was 'open-ended' and the law was 'confusing'. The UK government has insisted it does not amount to a 'right to be forgotten' and likened to ruling to Communist China. The purge of search results ordered by the court applies only to Google's local search pages covering the EU's 28 member nations and four other European countries, encompassing more than 500 million people. But users in Europe who switch to the firm's American domain, Google.com, will find unaltered search results. The 'right to be forgotten' is based on the premise that outdated information about people should be removed from the internet after a certain time. But after links to stories started disappearing, Google performed a u-turn and began reinstating some of them. Google has so far received about 91,000 such requests since the ruling came into force. Mr Wales, who co-founded the free web encyclopaedia Wikipedia in 2001, said: 'The law as it stands right now is quite confusing. We have this one ruling of the ECJ which is very open-ended and very hard to interpret. 'I would say the biggest problem we have is that the law seems to indicate Google needs to censor links to information that is clearly public - links to articles in legally published, truthful news stories,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'That is a very dangerous path to go down, and if we want to go down a path where we are going to be censoring history, there is no way we should leave a private company like Google in charge of making those decisions.' He added: 'I can't speak to the position of the company - I am on an external board advising Google, coming up with recommendations for search engines generally, coming up with recommendations for Parliamentarians as to how to reform the law.' Mr Wales went on: 'There is a sense that one of the big philosophical problems with the approach that has been taken is that the idea of personal data is so broad under European law, almost anything about a person is considered to be personal data - including that the Prime Minister is married; that is personal data about the Prime Minister. 'What we need to do when we talk about protection of consumers... we talk about companies having information and needing to handle it in an appropriate way - we are talking there about private information, your health records, your financial information. That's a completely different category.' Labour MEP Claude Moraes, chairman of the European Parliament civil liberties committee, agreed that the law is 'confused' which is based on 1995 data protection laws. 'That is ancient law as far as technology is concerned - mobiles were around in 1994. That tells you where we were. 'What is currently blocked is the new data protection law which talks not about a right to be forgotten, but a right to erasure. What we need is clarification of the law.' Earlier this month Lib Dem Justice minister Simon Hughes argued that people do not have an ‘unfettered’ right to demand the removal of links to internet articles containing information about them. He added: ‘We have criticised the government of China... for closing down people's right to information. There are other countries with strict information access. ‘It is not a good position for the EU to be in to look as if it is countenancing restrictions in the access of the citizen to access to information because it could be a very bad precedent.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Controversial European court ruling gave people 'right to be forgotten'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Balls today defended his decision to fire the head of the children's services during the Baby P scandal. Sharon Shoesmith has been awarded £679,000 after she claimed for unfair dismissal from her job Haringey's children's services. But Mr Balls, who was Children's Secretary in the Labour government at the time, said the 'payment leaves a bad taste in the mouth for everybody' and insisted he would make the same decision again. Ed Balls defended his decision to remove Sharon Shoesmith, who was given a £679,000 payout by Haringey Council after a judge ruled she had been unfairly dismissed in 2011 . Ms Shoesmith was sacked after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter in 2007 who was subjected to months of abuse. Shoesmith won her unfair dismissal case in October and was awarded the payout, the terms of which Haringey Council kept confidential. Now, the council's accounts reveal she was awarded £679,452 in compensation, according to recently-released figures. Miss Shoesmith was thrown out of her £133,000-a-year job as children’s services chief in the north London borough in 2008 on the instructions of then Labour Children’s Secretary Ed Balls. She had presided over Haringey social workers while they failed to save the life of 17-month-old Peter Connelly. The toddler died in 2007 after suffering months of abuse from his mother, her boyfriend and his brother, even though the family had been seen on 60 occasions by social workers, health workers and others. Today Mr Balls said he was 'frustrated' by the court's ruling, which he said left a 'bad taste in the mouth', but insisted that he would make the same decision again. He told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show: 'I had a duty to children in Haringey and across the country to act. It was my judgment that that was the only way to keep confidence in children's services in Haringey and across the country. 'The Education Act gave me, as the secretary of state, the power to remove somebody from a statutory position if I judged public confidence required that. That was my judgment and I'd make the same decision today. 'Of course this payment leaves a bad taste in the mouth for everybody. I'm afraid that Sharon Shoesmith and her department failed and therefore it's hugely frustrating when somebody receives a payment.' Tracey Connelly (left), the mother of the abused toddler and Steven Barker, her partner at the time of the death . Mr Balls said the courts had ruled that Ms Shoesmith had been unfairly dismissed because he had not met her before removing her from her job. However he said he had been acting on the advice of government lawyers who told him it would have been improper to see her. Baby P suffered more than 50 injuries despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over the final eight months of his life. A series of reviews identified missed opportunities when officials could have saved the toddler's life if they had acted properly on the warning signs in front of them. Ms Shoesmith has said she does not recognise the figure of £680,000 while Haringey Council said it was unable to comment on the terms of the settlement. In a statement, the local authority said: 'Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in favour of Ms Shoesmith, and the court's direction that the parties seek to resolve the issue of compensation, the London Borough of Haringey and Ms Shoesmith have reached a settlement in this case. 'The terms of the settlement are confidential. We are unable to comment further on this matter.' A note in the accounts read: 'The settlement was reached following the decision of the Court of Appeal in favour of former Director of Children’s Services and the Court’s direction that the parties seek to resolve the issue of compensation. 'Payments under the settlement agreement fell into three parts: payments of salary, fees & allowances (£377,266); payments for compensation for loss of office (£217,367) and payments of employer pension contributions (£84,819).'","She was sacked from £133k job after an investigation into the toddler's death .

"Lord West of Spithead, a former first sea lord, complained that too many artworks in the Palace of Westminster appeared to be of French battlefield defeats . Paintings in the corridors of Parliament are 'a little mean' because they all depict victories over France, a former head of the Navy has claimed. Lord West of Spithead, a former first sea lord, complained that too many artworks in the Palace of Westminster appeared to be of French battlefield defeats. He called for the balance to be redressed, including a mural of the First World War to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict this year. There are thousands of paintings, sculpture and murals dotted around the Houses of Parliament which form part of a priceless collection. The Royal Gallery near the House of Lords is dominated by two large 19th century paintings by the Irish artist Daniel Maclise. One fresco, 'The Death of Nelson', depicts the moment Lord Nelson, was shot aboard HMS Victory during France's defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Hanging opposite is 'The Meeting of Wellington and Blucher', which shoes the Duke of Wellington and the Prussian Field Marshall Blycher at the La Belle Alliance inn before defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Speaking in the Lord today, Lord West said there was too much emphasis on Britain's triumphs over its great rival across the Channel. The Labour peer said: 'I have noticed around the Palace of Westminster that nearly all the paintings of battle seem to be us defeating the French, which seems a little mean. 'We fought most nations in the world and I wonder in this centenary of the First World War could we maybe commission a mural representing something like Jutland or the famous battle of Amiens in 1918, in time for that commemoration?' Lord Sewel, chairman of committees, replied: 'Well, I'm certainly going to duck that one. 'Commissioning of works of art is a matter for the Works of Art Committee and fortunately that is one of the few domestic select committees in this House that I don't chair, and I'm very grateful.' After leaving the Royal Navy, Lord West was a security minister in Gordon Brown's government. He raised the issue of the artworks after Conservative peer Baroness Trumpington joked that she would be dead before the Maclise murals were restored. Lord Sewel said the condition of the Waterloo and Trafalgar murals had been investigated during two research projects with the Cologne University of Applied Sciences. He said results of the research showed there was an opportunity of achieving a 'very high level of restoration'. This painting of Wellington and Blucher on the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 by Daniel Maclise hangs in the Royal Gallery in Parliament . Lord Sewel told Lady Trumpington: 'The initial research is now complete and discussions will take place with the university's staff over the summer about the next steps towards restoration. 'The Works of Art Committee will consider a range of possible options in the autumn.' Lady Trumpington replied: 'It's now several years since I asked my original question on this subject, I should be dead before the damn thing is done.' She added: 'Would I be right in assuming that the Royal Gallery is much admired and loved by everybody except possibly the French president (and) also for the fact it does show women on the battlefield and on fighting ships? 'And I would be grateful if some speed can be shown in the reconstruction, if necessary, over painting I would have thought, so that we are even more proud of the Royal Gallery when the work is finished.' Critics warned too many paintings in Parliament were in need of restoration work after several years . Lord Sewel replied: 'I certainly hope it won't be a matter of you looking down kindly on us when the time comes for them to be revealed in their original true glory or as close to their original true glory as we can get it. 'I think the important thing is considering the national and international importance of these murals to get it right rather than to get it soon. 'It's a very challenging task to restore the paintings to as near to their original condition as possible. 'One of the, I think, very heartening results of the research that was carried out was the original pigment beneath the various layers has survived much more successfully in the Royal Gallery than was the case in the robing room. 'So we really do have the opportunity of achieving a very high level of restoration and I think we should make sure we do get it right.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Justine Miliband is to hit the campaign trail without husband Ed today in a move which will dramatically raise her profile. The environmental lawyer will climb aboard Labour’s battlebus in Glasgow to urge voters to reject Scottish independence. In an unusual development, Mr Miliband will not be by her side, in what will be seen as a trial run for his wife to play a central role in next year’s general election campaign. Justine and Ed Miliband were at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games last night, but today she will be campaigning against Scottish independence on her own . Labour strategists believe Mrs Miliband is a major asset to her husband’s chances of becoming Prime Minister next year. The child actress-turned-barrister has made clear her intention to join the political battle, telling a Labour fundraiser recently: ‘I am up for a fight, however nasty, however brutal.’ She has vowed to be ‘on the barricades’, telling activists during last year’s party conference: ‘I am in fact more than a dress.’ The Milibands were in Glasgow last night for the spectacular opening of the Commonwealth Games, and were pictured laughing and applauding during the often-bizarre show. Today Mrs Miliband will focus on the more serious matter of protecting the future of the 300-year-old Union. Amid concern that the No camp in the referendum campaign has been too dour and negative, she will join Labour activists to tour the city on a bus before going door-to-door canvassing. Mrs Miliband has vowed to join the 'barricades' to help her husband win next year's general election, insisting she is 'more than a dress' A Labour source said: ‘She is up in Scotland and wanted to take part in a bit of Better Together campaigning. Like lots of people in Labour, she feels strongly that the UK should stick together. 'It is a big question on the future of our country and she wants to take part in the campaign. First Minister Alex Salmond has broken his promise not to politicise the Commonwealth Games quicker than a Usain Bolt sprint - by declaring Glasgow the 'Freedom City'. As Scotland's athletes prepared for the 11 biggest days of their lives, the First Minister resorted to his well-worn 'Braveheart' rhetoric. He claimed he was confident Glasgow would vote Yes in the referendum - while in the same breath insisting he would not use the Games as a campaigning pawn. However, the intense international focus during the Games and the prospect of Scotland competing directly with England, means that the politics of independence will never be far from the minds of voters. First Minister Alex Salmond has already broken his promise not to use the Commonwealth Games to make political points about independence . Mrs Miliband is no stranger to the cameras. As a teenager, she carved out a career as an actor, starring in the ITV series Dramarama, which ran from 1983 and helped launch the careers of talent including writer Kay Mellor and actor David Tennant. She also appeared in 1987 school-based sitcom Hardwicke House, which was axed after just two episodes after being mauled by critics. Labour advisers were delighted with the reaction to a rare joint public appearance by the Milibands in the run-up to last year’s local elections. The couple embarked on a visit to her old school in Nottingham, where the Labour leader admitted that his ‘troublemaker’ wife would have been ‘too cool’ for him. Meeting staff at pupils at West Bridgford School, it was revealed Mrs Miliband broke the rules numerous times while she was a pupil in the 1980s.","Labour leader's wife climbs aboard battlebus with activists in Glasgow .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A rise in interest rates would make 800,000 families ‘mortgage prisoners’ unable to get a new loan on their home, a new report warns today. The number of households spending more than half of their income paying off debts repayments could also increase from 0.6 million to 1.1 million if rates start to rise, the Resolution Foundation said. It comes as after Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned household debt is a ‘major risk’ to the economy and could tip Britain back into recession when interest rates rise. Around 800,000 families could find themselves trapped on poor tracker deals, unable to refinance their mortgage because rate rises have pushed up bills, the Resolution Foundation warned . The Bank of England’s base rate is expected to rise from historic low of just 0.5 per cent within the next year, possibly before the end of 2014. In a speech yesterday Mr Carney said: ‘The UK economy is starting to head back to normal. As the economy normalises, Bank Rate will need to start to rise.’ But millions of families who took out loans when rates were low could find themselves struggling to make repayments. The Resolution Foundation said people needed to start planning for the base rate to climb to 3 per cent by 2018, in line with market expectations. If this happens, the number of 'highly geared' mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could balloon from 1.1 million currently to 2.3 million by 2018, equating to around one in four households with a mortgage. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said if rates rise too soon, families will cut back on other spending, plunging the economy back into recession . The Resolution Foundation gave indications of how changes in mortgage rates could impact on repayments. A rate of 3.2 per cent, which corresponds with current average mortgage rates, means someone with a 25-year mortgage of £150,000 pays £727 a month. But if this rate increases to 3.7 per cent, the monthly cost is £767, amounting to around £480 a year more. If the rate jumps another percentage point, to 4.7 per cent, the monthly cost is £851 and the mortgage holder pays in the region of £1,488 more a year than they would on a rate of 3.2 per cent. Moving the mortgage rate up to 5.7 per cent means the mortgage holder pays £939 a month, or around £2,544 a year more than on a rate of 3.2 per cent. The report also estimates that around 800,000 'highly geared' borrowers may become mortgage prisoners as interest rates rise. They will struggle to refinance because they do not comply with tougher rules on applying for mortgages introduced in the wake of the financial crash. It means they will have no choice but to stay on their existing lender's standard variable rate (SVR), and their monthly bills will rise with every increase in the base rate. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation and co-author of the Hangove Cure report, said: 'It would be a serious mistake to think that the legacy of problem debt built up in the pre-crisis years will simply evaporate with a return to economic growth. 'The magnitude of the stock of debt is simply too large, given expectations that income growth will be gradual at best. 'And while the mortgage market largely remains competitive, tighter lending criteria means that some highly-stretched borrowers face limited choices. There is a pressing need for regulation to respond to this new context.' The think tank warns country needs 'shaking from its complacency' and lenders should be upping efforts to identify and help people who would be put at risk by a rise in interest rates, including those not yet in arrears. They should be encouraged to undertake a 'financial MoT' and consider how their repayments would go up in the light of different plausible interest rate increases, the report said. This initiative would be similar to that involving home owners on interest-only mortgages who have been contacted by lenders amid fears that many do not have enough money put aside to pay back their loan when it ends. Mr Carney yesterday repeated his message that the central bank plans that any rises in interest rates will be ‘gradual and limited’ to cushion the blow for highly-indebted borrowers. But he warned that if rates rise more quickly than expected it could ‘tip the economy into recession’ because people cut back spending elsewhere to pay their mortgages. ‘It is the prospects for household indebtedness that concern us,’ said Mr Carney. ‘History shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens. ‘If a lot of people are highly indebted, that could tip the economy into recession. Since we start from a vulnerable position we need to be especially careful.’","Resolution Foundation says families must start planning for 3% rates .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Power firms have been ordered to pay another £3.3million for leave families in the dark at Christmas. Regulator Ofgem said SSE and UK Power Networks (UKPN) must pay the extra compensation - taking the total sum to £8million - after a probe into how they handled power cuts during last winter's storms. In a crackdown on firms who are too slow in getting the lights back on, Ofgem also said it was more than doubling the compensation for households left without power for more than 24 hours. Power firms were told to 'learn the lessons' of last winter's devastating storms, which cut of power and left thousands of homes under water . People who are cut off for more than 24 hours will now get £70, instead of £27. Severe weather over Christmas 2013 saw power cuts affect nearly a million homes. Ofgem said SSE and UKPN's power networks bore the brunt of it. Ofgen said the companies 'could have done more to get customers reconnected faster and to keep them better updated on what was happening'. Each had nearly 1,100 incidents, affecting a quarter of a million customers on the networks. Almost 16,000 customers remained affected for more than 48 hours, adding to the misery during the festive period. Ofgem said: 'The companies have recognised that they must improve their procedures for any future major interruption and Ofgem has today put the industry on notice that any repeat of last year's performance issues will trigger further action.' SSE and UK Power Networks have been told to pay a total of £8million for their poor handling of the crisis . The firms had already paid £4.7 million to consumers under current 'guaranteed standards' and in goodwill payments. But the regulator said that in the light of its findings they had agreed to make donations totalling £3.3 million to organisations such as the Red Cross that play a key role helping vulnerable customers during severe weather. Maxine Frerk, Ofgem’s Senior Partner for Distribution said: 'A power cut at Christmas time is the last thing anyone needs. 'While we recognise the hard work of the companies and their staff who were out working to reconnect customers during the severe weather, the companies could have done more to plan for the weather and keep customers informed. 'This is why we have secured an additional £3.3 million, bringing the total payout to £8 million.' Increased compensation will be available in future, to incentivise companies to move faster to get the lights back on. From April next year, the minimum financial payment if customers lose power for 24 hours will rise from £27 to £70. The maximum amount customers can receive will also rise, from from £216 to £700, and the payments should be made automatically without families having to chase them, . Almost 16,000 people were left without power for more than 48 hours during the sever winter storms . Miss Frerk said: 'Ofgem is constantly striving to drive up standards for customers. 'That is why we have more than doubled the payouts that firms will have to pay if customers are without power during severe weather events from £27 to £70. 'Network companies need to learn the lessons of last winter as a repeat performance will trigger further action from Ofgem.' SSE's payout totals £4.6 million, including £2.3 million in guaranteed standards and goodwill payments and £2.3 million to the British Red Cross, Age UK, National Energy Action, Macmillan Cancer Support, and to a new community fund. UKPN's payout totals £3.4 million, including £2.4 million in guaranteed standards and goodwill payments and £1 million to the British Red Cross, the Royal Association for Deaf People, Carer's Trust and Citizens Advice. Ann Robinson, Director of Consumer Policy at uSwitch.com, says: 'This won’t make up for the blackout Christmas suffered by so many last year, but Ofgem’s announcement means that in future consumers should get reconnected faster and kept better informed if they’re plunged into the dark. 'Being without power is particularly hard for more vulnerable households, especially if they are dependent on electricity for heating their homes.'","SSE and UK Power Networks have now been fined a total of £8million .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The growing divide in home ownership was laid bare today, with millions of young people struggling to get on to the property ladder. While three quarters of over-55s home their own home just a third of under-35s have managed to buy a property. Rising house prices and tougher mortgage checks have been blamed for the trend, which means overall levels of home ownership are now at their lowest since the 1980s. The latest English Housing Survey reveals that in 2012-13, there were 22million households in England. Overall, 65.2 per cent were owner occupied, 18 per cent were privately rented and 17 per cent were socially rented. By contrast, at the end of the First World War in 1918, three quarters of households in England were private renters, a quarter were in owner occupation and less than 1 per cent were in social rented accommodation, the EHS said. The boom in people buying their own homes instead of renting came in the 1980s, when the number of families living in a property they had bought increasing from 9.9million in 1981 to 12.2million in 1988. However, the impact recessions in the 1990s and the financial crash in 2007 has made access to mortgages more difficult. The number of owner occupiers has fallen every year since 2006, and in 2012-13 reached its lowest level since the 1980s, (14.3million). However, renting a home costs much more than buying one through a mortgage, the survey revealed. Families in the process of paying off a property spent 20 per cent of their income on their mortgage. But private renters spent 40 per cent and social renters 30 per cent of their income on rent. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said: ‘Renters spend two days every week working to pay off their landlord’s mortgage. ‘This is a financial thumbscrew applied to people who simply have no other choice of tenure and it’s hard to see how this can be characterised as anything other than exploitation. ‘This underlines the urgency of the need for affordable housebuilding and tenancy law reform.’","22million households in England in 2012-13, 65.2% owner-occupied .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron insists he will play a tennis match won in a Tory auction, despite a growing row about the party taking money from wealthy Russians. Boris Johnson signalled he will pull out of the match if it emerges it was won at auction by a ‘crony’ of Vladimir Putin, but later suggested the game will go ahead. Banker Lubov Chernukhin bid £160,000 for the chance to play the ‘ultimate tennis match’ against Mr Johnson and David Cameron. Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to Glasgow University, insisted returning the money would not be the 'right approach' She is married to billionaire oligarch Vladimir Chernukhin, who was Russia’s deputy finance minister during Putin’s first term as Russian President. Mr Cameron has called for tougher sanctions against Moscow in response to the shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by pro-Russian separatists over eastern Ukraine. But the Tories have been embarrassed by the revelation that they have received money from someone who has served in the Putin regime. In an angry statement to MPs on Monday, the Prime Minister said Mr Putin’s ‘cronies’ should be isolated because of their country’s involvement in the Flight MH17 atrocity. But Labour questioned the Prime Minister’s intention to go ahead with a doubles tennis match, auctioned off at a lavish Tory fundraising dinner at London’s Hurlingham Club. With Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson apparently planning to don their whites for the game, Tories’ election strategist Lynton Crosby is said to have agreed to act as a ballboy. London Mayor Boris Johnson sought to distance himself from the row, insisting Tory HQ had 'volunteered me to play tennis with some geezer' London Mayor Boris Johnson sought to distance himself from the row, insisting Tory HQ  had 'volunteered me to play tennis with some geezer' The successful bidder was the wife of Vladimir Chernukhin, who is a former director of Russia’s national airline Aeroflot and a former chairman of the country’s state development bank. He received Russia’s Order of Honour from Mr Putin a decade ago. During a visit to Scotland, Mr Cameron was asked whether he would return Mrs Chernukhin's cash. He replied: 'Well of course I wouldn't accept money from someone who was a Putin crony, but my understanding is this person certainly isn't that and has lived in Britain for many years and is actually now a British citizen, so I don't think that would be the right approach. 'My understanding is they are both British citizens they are not cronies of President Putin, so it would be the wrong thing to do to take a different view.' David Cameron is facing calls to return money bid in an auction to play him and Boris Johnson in a game of tennis, won by Lubov Chernukhin . A Conservative Party source said it was not credible to call Mr Chernukhin an ally of Putin, when he had been dismissed as the head of a state-owned bank in 2004 and had been close to former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who had become a critic of Putin’s style of governing. However, Mr Johnson appeared to suggest the party was still examining Mr Chernukhin’s background. Mr Johnson told Sky News: 'I think you have to do stuff that actually hits Putin and his government where it hurts, make a real difference to their attitude. 'I know about this tennis match – they volunteered me to play tennis with some geezer. It is very, very important that full checks are carried out to make sure that this is not somebody who is an intimate of Putin or a crony. And we are doing that at the moment.' Vladimir Chernukhin, who is a former director of Russia’s national airline Aeroflot and a former chairman of the country’s state development bank, was deputy finance minister during Putin's first term as President . Labour has stepped up calls for the Conservatives to cancel the game and return the money. Labour’s Chris Bryant, vice-chairman of Parliament’s all-party group on Russia, said: ‘The Prime Minister said quite categorically this week that we should be tackling Putin’s cronies. ‘What could be more of a crony than Putin’s former deputy finance minister? ‘Yet it appears that the Prime Minister is not only prepared to take his family’s money, but also play tennis with him – it is two-faced. ‘David Cameron does not seem to realise that you cannot send these kind of mixed messages to Russia – they see it as a sign of weakness. He has to realise that he cannot have his caviar and eat it.’ Fellow Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: ‘People will be surprised at the extent of Russian wealth bankrolling David Cameron’s re-election fund. ‘The Tories need to come clean about all their Russian links. There can be no impression of conflicts of interest or hypocrisy at such an important time.’ Former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft also questioned whether the Conservatives should still be accepting Russian money. In a message on Twitter he said: ‘Should the Tory Party suspend taking donations from companies owned by Russians?’","Prime Minister says returning the cash would be the 'wrong approach'.

Her meeting with the new Pope during her first overseas trip for three years will delight Britain’s four million Roman Catholics. It will also strengthen ties between the Anglican and Catholic churches, both of which appointed new leaders last year. Strengthening ties: The Queen (left) is preparing for a historic visit to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis (right) The new Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has already met Pope Francis at the Vatican. In an extraordinary break with tradition, say Vatican sources, the Pope will not receive the Queen at the Papal state apartments inside the Apostolic Palace. Rather, the Argentina-born Pontiff, who has a habit of dispensing with protocol, wants to keep the visit intimate and informal. He is expected to welcome her to the simple Vatican boarding house which he has made his home and offer her a cup of tea in a small sitting room. The Pope has three rooms inside the Domus Sanctae Marthae, or St Martha’s House, a five-storey hostel run by nuns where he is often seen in the canteen when not cooking his own pasta. The royal visit is expected in April, shortly before the Queen’s 88th birthday, and she will be accompanied by Prince Philip, 92. Contrary to reports that Buckingham . Palace plans to curtail their foreign travel, they will go overseas to . meet three world leaders in as many months. Yesterday . the Palace announced the Queen will make a three-day state visit to . France in June for the D-Day landings 70th anniversary. Meeting: In 1982, the Queen became the first sovereign to welcome a Pope when John Paul II came to London . With Prince Philip, she will undertake engagements in Normandy to mark the British war effort of June 6, 1944. Then, the couple wlll go to Paris to be formally received by President Francois Hollande and attend a series of state events. In Rome, the Queen will also meet Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, a great admirer. The meeting with the Pope will be in striking contrast to the pageantry of 1980 when she became the first British monarch to make a state visit to the Vatican. There was also strict formality in 2000 when the Queen went to the Vatican on a state visit to Italy. This time, the atmosphere will certainly be very different from the security clampdown and media  circus expected a few weeks earlier when Pope Francis entertains  US President Barack Obama. The Queen’s visit will underline her . position as the most Catholic-friendly Supreme Governor of the Church of . England of modern times. In 1982, she became the first sovereign to welcome a Pope when John Paul II came to London. She also gave Pope Benedict XVI a full state welcome when he arrived in Edinburgh in 2010. Only nine months ago, she signed . legislation repealing the 300-year rule excluding royals who married . Catholics from the succession. Four years ago: The Queen gave Pope Benedict XVI a full state welcome when he arrived in Edinburgh in 2010 . Three weeks ago, Pope Francis included Britain’s most senior Catholic, the Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, in his first batch of new cardinals. The visit puts paid to suggestions the Queen is about to hand over most duties to other royals. This will be a long ‘awayday’ to Rome, with no overnight stay, but involves two high-level visits and makes it clear that the Queen and her husband intend to remain active in international public life. It was President Napolitano, rather than Pope Francis, who originally suggested the Vatican visit. Though a member of the Italian communist party for 46 years, he is a great admirer of the Queen and, being nine months her senior, just pips her to the title of Europe’s oldest head of state. The two leaders are said to get on extremely well and Mr and Mrs Napolitano have visited the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace several times. Palace officials declined to comment on whether they expect Mr Hollande, 59, to have a new First Lady at his side. Last month, the French leader split from girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler, 48, after his affair with actress Julie Gayet, 41, was revealed. He has refused to answer questions on the delicate subject.","Queen will meet new Pope during her first overseas trip for three years .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . School leavers should think about starting their own business instead of just planning to go to university, the employment minister has said. Esther McVey said that for many teenagers, being their own boss would be better than embarking on a career with a large firm. She said she wanted to encourage people who have a 'seed' of an idea to pursue it, instead of feeling pressured to follow friends or family into taking a degree. Employment minister Esther McVey, pictured visiting a Brompton bicycle factory last week, said she wanted young people to focus on what was right for them . Miss McVey, who was promoted last week in the Cabinet reshuffle, said the choices made by people to become apprentices or self-employed are 'equal and good and worthwhile' when compared to those who choose to go to university. Ms McVey told the Daily Telegraph that the Conservative party should be supporting people no matter which route they take to employment. 'That is what we should be doing, liberating everyone's potential, whether it's a self-made individual, whether it's someone taking the university route, whether it's the apprenticeship route. 'They are all equal and good and worthwhile. To think that we are all the same and going to follow the same journey, that is wrong.' The minister, whose father was self-employed, said a significant number of those who have claimed a New Enterprise Allowance supporting people on benefits who want to start a new business are aged between 18 and 24. In an interview with MailOnline last week, she urged young people to get their first job 'as soon as possible'. She argues that whether working in a florist, funeral directors or grocers, a first job can provide money, but also friends, skills and insight into jobs they never knew existed. More than 4.5 million people are self-employed, the highest since records began in 1992, after an increase of 404,000 over the past year . Some people might try out a desk job or work in a bank on a Saturday but decide: ‘Actually I don’t like that at all I’m outdoors and people have ended up being gardeners or chartered surveyors. ‘Or sometimes you say what drives my desire to learn is actually a real hands-on practical skill, looking at engineering, manufacturing. ‘It’s that creation of something has then forced their desire to then do more in maths, physics or chemistry which they would not otherwise have had. ‘They said they sat in the school classroom and it just never came to life learning the periodic table but do you know now they are on a factory floor and seeing what they can create.’ Figures last week showed more than 30 million people are in a job, an increase of almost one million over the past year, the best figures since records began in 1971, while unemployment has fallen by 121,000 to 2.12 million, the lowest since the end of 2009. Other figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell last month, the 20th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest total since 2008. More than 4.5 million people were self-employed, the highest since records began in 1992, after an increase of 404,000 over the past year.","Esther McVey says being your own boss is as impressive as a degree .

"By . Robert Hardman . Even the angriest class warrior would be hard-pushed to call it luxurious. With the ambiance of a mid-range provincial hotel circa 1975, it has a homely simplicity, but it is no palace on wheels. Formica panels, Fifties-style G-plan furniture, plastic baths and strip lights (no chandeliers here) would hardly lend themselves to an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit — unless, perhaps, one was filming Murder On The Leyton Orient Express. Royal basics: Prince Charles's sitting room aboard the Royal Train has all  the ambiance of a mid-range provincial hotel circa 1975 . Snug: A single bed offers simple unfussy accommodation for royal travellers . It is also the slowest inter-city rail service in Britain. But there is no other train on the planet that comes close in terms of charm, punctuality and eccentricity — let alone history. That is why rail buffs and trainspotters will not be the only ones dismayed by the news the Royal Train could be heading for the buffers. And none will be sadder than the Queen and her family. This week, Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse — the financial director of the royal household — appeared before the MPs on the Public Accounts Select Committee to discuss the state of the royal finances. While public finances may have ballooned, the Monarchy has managed to halve its costs over the past 20 years. Wash and go: The Queen has a bath in her carriage while Philip prefers a shower . But its admirable policy of ‘make do and mend’ cannot go on indefinitely. At Buckingham Palace, the 60-year-old boilers are pushing up the fuel bills, the wiring hasn’t been touched since George VI was on the throne, bits of masonry are falling off and buckets have to be strategically placed under holes in the roof. With all this alarming news to absorb, the MPs barely noticed Sir Alan’s additional disclosure that the Royal Train is in similar need of repair. In a few years, a ‘major decision’ will be required regarding the Seventies rolling stock. And it will be an expensive one. ‘The figures’, this astute former international financier added, ‘are quite staggering’. There is no question that Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle must be properly restored. They are two of the most famous buildings in the world, national landmarks which belong to the nation, not the Queen. But there will be less sympathy for the Royal Train. And Sir Alan’s reference to the ‘staggering’ cost of a new one suggests that he already knows it’s a non-starter. In which case, the Royal Train seems destined to follow the dear old royal yacht, Britannia, in to retirement. And while that may please modernisers and republicans, royalists like me will regard it as a crying shame. The vast majority of royal rail journeys involve scheduled services. But the Royal Train has its uses. Critics always focus on the headline figure of the train — £1 million a year to run, or £20,000, say, for a trip to Scotland — without acknowledging the advantages of a royal mobile home. It’s extremely secure, it can accommodate all the paraphernalia of a royal tour and, unlike the alternatives, it is virtually foolproof. If a whole county is waiting to see the Queen, then a whole county will be let down if her helicopter is grounded by fog or her car gets stuck in traffic. Thanks to the Royal Train, everyone knows that she will be in Swansea or Lincoln or Ayr to the nearest ten seconds (though Royal Train drivers try to stick to a five-second margin of error). As for the Royal Family themselves, it really is the proverbial home-from-home — familiar staff, a favourite armchair, the same old tea cups. With its distinctive royal claret   coaches, the train attracts an enormous amount of attention wherever it goes . An abiding memory of my only tour inside — during the 2002 Golden Jubilee — are the boxes of Tesco tissues on the royal tables. When not in use, it all sits in a large railway shed at Wolverton, near Milton Keynes, where a skeleton crew keep the nine claret-coloured carriages and their contents in mint condition. Not that they are called carriages. They are ‘saloons’. The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales each have their own saloon while additional wagons, looking much like regular sleepers and First Class carriages, feed and accommodate the staff. There is no permanent royal . locomotive, although the operator, DB Schenker, will only hitch one of . its classier models to the royal rolling stock. And since 2007, the Royal Train is powered by eco-friendly bio-fuel. Royal . passengers sleep in single beds which run lengthways behind a partition . in the centre of the carriage (for optimum stability and a good night’s . sleep). All the other bunks lie across the carriage, as in a . conventional sleeper. The . Queen has a bath in her carriage while the Duke of Edinburgh prefers a . shower — and keeps a blown-up image of his first Senior Citizen’s . Railcard alongside a chunk of Brunel’s original broad gauge. Affairs of state: Queen Elizabeth works at her desk on the Royal Train in May, 2002 . The Queen's bedroom on an earlier, and perhaps slightly more luxurious, incarnation the Royal Train taken in 1946. The current train has been in service since 1977 . Charles . keeps a handmade pot-pourri holder, presented long ago by a girl in . Haverfordwest, next to his bed and a picture of Britannia above it. As . well he might. The similarities with Britannia are . everywhere — from the plain furniture and antiquated telephones to the . absence of double beds (if the Duchess of Cornwall is on board, she has . her own saloon — complete with pink bathroom). As . Brian Hoey points out in his fascinating book, The Royal Train, when . Edward VII became King, he stipulated it should ‘be as much like the royal yacht as possible’. The . current Royal Train dates back to the 1977 Silver Jubilee. Then, it . consisted of 14 carriages for the use of all the senior members of the . family. Sometimes two trains would be in action. On one day in 1986, no . less than three could be seen in different parts of the country. By . the late Nineties, cost-cutting had reduced the number of wagons to . nine and royal use was restricted to the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh . and the Prince of Wales. None . of them has ever been as demanding as the earliest royal passengers. Queen Victoria was the first monarch to board a train when she made the . journey from Slough to Paddington in 1842. Brunel himself was on the . footplate. To general relief, Her Majesty much enjoyed the experience and was soon making her mark on Britain’s rail network. All change: The Queen and her corgis disembark in 1968 . Having decreed she would neither eat nor go to the lavatory on board, lavish ‘refreshment’ buildings were built along the route north to Scotland. Victoria commissioned the wagons which became the first Royal Train. While Prince Albert invented the first train lavatory, George V went one better and was the first person in the world to install a bath on a train. It was 1915, the nation was at war and he wanted to tour Britain without descending on the nearest country house each night and causing mayhem. In time, Queen Mary became a convert to the 55in bath, though she imposed a speed limit of 5mph when sitting in it. A full-size bath was installed in 1941 as George VI and Queen Elizabeth began extended wartime tours of the country by rail. By the end of the war, it was calculated they had travelled 63,000 miles. But distance is only half of the story. Now, as then, royal passengers spend a lot of their time at a standstill. In order to avoid any inconvenience to regular rail services, the train will meander along branch lines and wait until the main services have ceased before taking to the major routes. When it is reasonably near its destination for the following morning, it then parks in a secure siding until dawn. The driver — drawn from a pool of 50 — will then begin a stately progress to the final destination. Drivers pride themselves on a jolt-free ride, just as the on-board chef takes great delight in preparing the scrambled eggs and bacon exactly the way the Queen likes them. Most of us will never even see inside this thing, let alone travel in it. But, as with Britannia, that does not stop us taking great pride in a classic piece of romantic, understated British elegance. But for how much longer? It will certainly be a sad day when there is no longer a claret-coloured saloon carrying the head of state across the nation which invented the train in the first place.","The .

"By . Harriet Arkell . London's property market is a fluid beast, but a few of the capital's streets are so sought after that houses in them hardly ever come on the market. Nestled in a quiet corner of Chelsea, The Boltons is one such street, but if you're a multi-millionaire with your eye on the SW10 postcode, now's your chance. An 18-bedroom mansion, which comes complete with a separate five-bedroom mews house (handy for the staff), has just gone on the market there for £39,500,000. Properties in The Boltons in London's Chelsea don't come on the market very often, so this 18-bedroom house, for sale at £38,500,000, will probably be snapped up . Room for entertaining: The enormous drawing room boasts views over the manicured garden, beyond which is the five-bedroom mews house, included in the price . Some back garden: At the back of the house is a large balustraded terrace, with steps leading down onto the well-kept lawn and the separate mews house . Impressive entrance hall: The house lies in The Boltons, the second most expensive street (average house price £23.4m) in Britain after Kensington Park Gardens (£36m) The house covers nearly 10,000sq ft, making it one of London's largest, and is built on the site of Coleherne House, home to renowned racehorse auctioneer, Edmund Tattersall, in the 19th century. The main house has nine ensuite bedrooms, plus four more bedrooms, and a lift, while the mews house at the end of the perfectly manicured garden has a further five bedrooms. As well as an impressive drawing room and terrace overlooking the garden, which can accommodate 60 guests, the house has not one but two laundry rooms, a silver room where the staff can keep the candlesticks gleaming, and a grand entrance hall with sweeping stone staircase and gilt cornicing. At 2,500sq ft, the mews house is bigger than most family houses in London, and boasts its own drawing room, three bathrooms, and a large garage. Jake Russell, of estate agent Russell Simpson, said: 'This property is the perfect Chelsea home, offering the homebuyer a large mansion in west London. 'Perfect for social events and family gatherings, there are enough bedrooms to accommodate a large family, friends and guests.  Close to Knightsbridge and the West End, residents can be at Harrods in eight minutes and shopping on the King’s Road within four minutes.' The buyer will need even deeper pockets than the price tag suggests, as the stamp duty alone will cost them £2.75million. The Boltons, whose previous residents include Madonna and actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr, is part of an expensive enclave of streets that are home to bankers and oil billionaires as well as the odd footballer - Chelsea's Frank Lampard is close by. The last house sale listed in the street by Zoopla was in 2012, and judging by the sale price of £54, 959,000, whoever snaps this one up might be getting themselves a bargain. Dinner time: The elegant wooden-panelled dining room has full-length windows over the garden, air conditioning, and can easily seat 14 for dinner . Make a statement: No money has been spared in the decorating of this house, which boasts ornately wrought iron bannisters, gilt cornicing and a marble-lined hall floor . The house lies in an exclusive but quiet enclave on the South Kensington/Chelsea border, home to oil billionaires and footballers, but be ready for the £2.75m stamp duty . The house, which lies on the site of the old Coleherne House, boasts not only a silver room where the staff may polish candlesticks, but two laundry rooms and a garage .","House in The Boltons goes on the market for £500,000 shy of £40million - not to mention the £2.75million stamp duty .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A £1.5million house caught fire after the sun's rays bounced off a decorative doorknob and onto a dressing gown. The strong sun was refracted through a crystal doorknob in the house in Clapham, south London, and onto a robe hanging from a wooden door which then caught fire. Two fire engines raced to the scene in the expensive street near Clapham Common after builders working on the house next door heard the smoke alarm going off and dialled 999. Fire broke out in a £1.5million house in south London after the sun was refracted through a crystal doorknob . Result: The bedroom was badly damaged after the fire which started in Clapham early on Monday morning . Fire risk: The doorknob on the other side of the burnt door shows what the original one looked like . The house was empty at the time but the bedroom was left badly damaged by the blaze, sparked early on Monday morning before the sun was even at its peak. Scaffolder Peter Graham, 39, and two other colleagues who were working nearby ran around to the house and attempted to kick the door down after spotting the fire. He said: 'Three of us ran down there and tried to kick the door down.  We also put a ladder up against the house and shouted in to see if we could hear anyone, and told the next door neighbour to get out in case it spread. 'The fire brigade arrived after a couple of minutes.' The female house owner declined to comment, but a spokesman for London Fire Brigade said householders should be aware of the fire risk posed by crystal and glass ornaments and mirrors. Charlie Pugsley from the fire investigation unit said: 'Crystal and glass ornaments and items such as shaving mirrors should be kept out of direct sunlight. 'The homeowners are lucky they had a working smoke alarm which alerted some local builders who quickly called us. 'Part of the bedroom was damaged in the fire, but it could have been much worse.' Earlier this year firefighters were called to a blaze in Romford after sun refracted through a crystal ball set light to curtains. And last summer firefighters tackled a fire in Enfield caused by a vanity mirror which also set fire to curtains. The Fire Brigade said mirrors and crystal or glass objects should be kept away from sunny window sills, while working smoke alarms should be on every floor. What started it: The remains of the crystal doorknob that firefighters say sparked the early morning blaze .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Corinne Budinger, 52, had to bury her baby son Joseph three times after a series of police errors . A grieving mother has told how she had to bury her baby son three times after police twice failed to give her all of his body parts. Corinne Budinger's baby, Joseph Mackin, was six months old when he was shaken to death by registered childminder, Helen Stacey, in 1997. Stacey, a former prostitute, was found guilty of murdering Joseph and sentenced to life in prison. Mrs Budinger, 52, then of North Walsham, Norfolk, had to cope with the horror of Joseph's funeral and burial, and then Stacey's trial, before she moved to Suffolk to start a new life. But in April 2012 the bereaved mother received a surprise visit from officers from Norfolk Police, who told her they had failed to give her all of her son's body parts. Traumatised, Mrs Budinger and her family had to go through a second funeral and burial for her baby son. But some months later, Norfolk Police officers came calling again, saying they still held the baby's liver and some body tissues.  Yet again, Mrs Budinger had to organise a funeral and burial for Joseph. Today she told The Sun: 'No mother should have to bury their baby three times. 'When the officers visited me out of the blue I had to sit down, I felt so ill.  When they turned up again, that was enough to send me over the edge.' Mrs Budinger, who now lives in Ipswich, said she could not believe what police were telling her when they turned up the second time. She said she began suffering panic attacks and had to quit her job as a result. Mrs Budinger sued Norfolk Police and, in January this year, received damages and an apology from Norfolk Deputy Chief Constable, Charlie Hall. Meanwhile in 2001 Stacey, a former prostitute, had her conviction for murder reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and her sentence reduced to seven years. The original trial had heard how Joseph's parents had dropped off their son at the home of Stacey, who had convictions for soliciting and shoplifting, at 7am. Joseph was found 'floppy like a rag doll' after he was left with childminder, Helen Stacey, and died that day . Childminder Helen Stacey, left, was jailed after she was convicted of murdering baby Joseph, right with his sister, Samantha, though her conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal in 2001 . He was found 'floppy like a rag doll' at 5.15pm and died the same day in 1997. The jury at Norwich Crown Court heard that baby Joseph had was shaken by Stacey, now 57, in a fit of temper, suffering a serious brain injury which led to his death. Stacey's murder conviction was quashed and replaced with one for manslaughter after the Court of Appeal heard that Stacey had not intended to do serious harm to the child. Stacey, who had been registered as a childminder by social services even though three of her four children had been taken into care or adopted, was convicted on evidence that she had violently shaken Joseph.","Joseph Mackin was 'floppy like a rag doll' after he was left with childminder .

"By . Harriet Arkell . 'Unexplained death': An array of drug equipment was found near Peaches Geldof's body but Kent Police repeatedly refused to comment on what they found . Police have defended their insistence that Peaches Geldof's death was 'unexplained', despite finding overwhelming evidence of drug use around her body. An inquest into Peaches's death earlier this week heard that police found stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home in Wrotham, Kent. The mother of two's body was found slumped on a bed, covered in needle puncture marks. But for almost a month, Kent Police officers insisted that the celebrity's death was 'unexplained', with no mention of the drugs equipment they found. They repeatedly refused to comment on whether suspicious substances or evidence had been found at her property, or even where Miss Geldof died and who was with her at the time, saying merely that officers were investigating an 'unexplained sudden death'. It was nearly four weeks before the force finally admitted that officers 'did seize drugs paraphernalia', following a frenzy of speculation on social networking sites and media sources. Yesterday, a spokesman for the force said they kept details of the drugs found quiet to protect Miss Geldof's family. He said: 'We had a duty of care to Miss Geldof's family and it would be irresponsible to prematurely release details which may have led to further speculation without having established full circumstances.  The investigation included waiting for toxicology results. Following speculation in the media, Kent Police issued a statement on 2 May with the approval of the coroner clarifying that drugs paraphernalia was found at the home address of Mrs Geldof-Cohen.' Kent Police said the media blackout was justified because their sole duty was to the coroner, once it had been established there was no foul play. They added: 'Although there was a significant appetite from the media for information surrounding Mrs Geldof-Cohen's death, it was important for Kent Police to carry out a thorough and professional investigation, and establish the full circumstances of the death. 'The death was deemed non-suspicious at an early stage, when Kent Police confirmed that an investigation would be carried out on behalf of and for the Coroner. During this investigation Kent Police did not release any detail around what had or what hadn't been located. 'It was important throughout that the integrity and professionalism of the investigation remained intact.' But suspicions remain that Lord Justice Leveson continues to cast a long shadow, encouraging police forces to be more secretive than ever. His Press standards inquiry has called for a clampdown on police/media relations, with records of meetings and tighter curbs on briefings. But the Leveson inquiry completely ignored the value of keeping the public informed of the actions of police as they investigate often controversial events as servants of the Crown. Peaches's husband, musician Thomas Cohen, 25, found her body slumped on a bed at the family home in Kent . Double tragedy: Peaches Geldof and her mother, Paula Yates, (pictured above) both died after taking heroin . The inquest into Miss Geldofs' death earlier this week heard that police found 6.9g (0.24oz) of 'importation quality' heroin in a black cloth bag in a bedroom cupboard with a purity of 61 per cent, worth between £350 and £550. They also discovered a syringe containing residue of heroin inside a sweet box next to the bed, and other drug paraphernalia including burnt spoons, syringes and knotted tights throughout the property. Peaches had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood.  Her mother, Paula Yates, who died of a heroin overdose aged 41 in 2000, had 0.3mg when she died. North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said Miss Geldof's death had been 'drugs-related' and that heroin had played a part. Users of social networking sites criticised Miss Geldof after details of how she died emerged, branding her 'selfish', but her sister, Fifi hit back yesterday via her Instagram account, telling detractors to 'F*** off' and 'You've no idea what you're talking about.'","The 25-year-old was found dead in spare room at home in Wrotham, Kent .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Gordon Higinbotham, 42, says he let escorts work from his Hull council house and took a share of the proceeds in exchange for protecting them . An unemployed father-of-four has admitted helping run an escort agency from his taxpayer-funded house. Tattooed Gordon Higinbotham, 42, who appeared in the controversial TV show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole, says he would provide protection for escort girls as they entertained clients at his council house in Hull, East Yorkshire. Humberside police are now investigating claims he took a quarter of the women's profits in exchange for letting them meet clients at his three-bedroom home while he sat in an adjoining room. Mr Higinbotham, who has a foot-long tattoo of Adolf Hitler on his back and a picture of the Ku Klux Klan on his stomach, told a journalist he housed escorts at his house over a period of several years, despite claiming benefits for most of his adult life. He said: 'The girls used to see clients in my house and I sat next door to make sure they didn't get hurt. 'I did it on and off for a few years and I did the advertising just to help out.  My aim wasn't to make money off it, I wanted to protect the girls. 'If they earned £40, I would receive £10 of that for my protection.' Mr Higinbotham placed advertisements for the escort agency, called Kaz For Others, in his local paper, boasting of services including 'Feet and Secret Fantasies', 'Bi Couple, male and female' and 'Mark, male escort'. The Hull Daily Mail said its records showed an account in his name had placed more than 100 advertisements costing nearly £400 in the paper since August 2011. Mr Higinbotham, who is a grandfather, said he began doing it after he met some escort girls in his local supermarket and they told him they were having problems with clients. He said: 'They were extremely upset - their clients were hurting them - so I decided to let them use my house. 'It just a little bit of money - nothing major.' But he insisted he was no longer involved, and later said he had had 'nothing to do with' the business beyond taking out adverts and providing his house for the escort service to take place in. Mr Higinbotham became notorious after he appeared in the Channel 5 Benefits Britain documentary earlier this month, saying: 'I like anyone as long as they're English.' He was also filmed telling his daughter and her husband he would pay them if they voted for UKIP in May’s European elections. After the show was broadcast he claimed he and his family had been wrongly portrayed as 'racist morons'  - though Channel 5 said Mr Higinbotham's views had been 'faithfully reported' - and said they had received death threats, leaving them frightened to leave the house. In January 2009 the skinhead was given a two-year antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) for distributing material that could incite racial hatred, and he was also banned from showing off his 15 racist tattoos in public. The grandfather says he began helping escort girls after they told him they were being hurt by their clients . Mr Higinbotham, a father of four and grandfather, says he received death threats after he appeared on TV . 'Skinhead': Mr Higinbotham, who has received benefits for most of his adult life, is covered with tattoos . A year earlier, he was caught on CCTV sticking far-right messages on shop windows, blocks of flats and public places. Today, spokesmen for both Hull City Council and Humberside Police said they were investigating allegations Mr Higinbotham had allowed escort services to operate in his home. A spokesman for the police said: 'Humberside Police have been made aware of the issue and will be looking into this.' Phil Webster, cabinet member at Hull City Council, said: 'We will now investigate Gordon Higinbotham and the benefits he has claimed. 'If he is found to have breached his contract with a council-owned house, he could be evicted.'","Gordon Higinbotham, 42, from Hull, appeared on Benefits Britain programme .

"By . Harriet Arkell . It has crafted an image as the most upmarket of the major food stores. But Waitrose’s customers are not above poking fun at the pretentious antics of fellow shoppers, it seems. Some of the outlandish remarks said to have been heard in the aisles have become an internet hit. The Overheard In Waitrose Facebook page has more than 285,000 likes and receives dozens of posts said to be from shoppers and staff. Scroll down for video . Overheard In Waitrose is a collection of unintentionally hilarious remarks made by upmarket customers . One butcher who suggested topside was told: 'Topside for my dog? Anyone would think you wanted to kill her!' Some of the gems are reminiscent of those put on Twitter when Waitrose ran a campaign asking shoppers to tweet why they shopped there, starting with #IshopatWaitrosebecause. The campaign was adopted by jokers, who posted comments such as '#IshopatWaitrosebecause the Asda value peacock feed isn't as nice.' Others are posted by people who say they are staff, or 'partners' at Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis partnership, where employees are known for their courtesy and helpfulness. The new Facebook page includes some astonishing remarks, uttered by customers apparently unaware of how they sound, sent in every day from visitors to Waitrose branches across Britain. Alluding to a life of second homes, yachts, sirloin-fed pets and problems with swans in the garden, they create a joyful picture of life for this particularly British breed. Children in Waitrose clearly have different tastes to those whose parents shop in less exclusive supermarkets . Here are some of the best: . 'Lucas, put that falafel down, you already chose olives with manchego as your treat.' 'Thank you, that will be £428.49' 'It's like the Third World in Tesco: no pine nuts.' Top dog: One Waitrose customer was appalled when the butcher suggested a slightly cheaper cut for her dog . Waitrose's line of foods created by top chef Heston Blumenthal include such essentials as Earl Grey stollen . Nightmare: Waitrose customers can hardly imagine the horror of running out of such culinary essentials . According to the Facebook page, one couple in the Newark branch in Nottinghamshire who spotted another customer with an Asda shopping bag said to each other: 'Should she be walking around in here with that?' And after a Waitrose butcher told a woman they had run out of fillet steak but she could have topside instead, she replied: 'Topside?  Why on earth would we feed Winnie topside? 'Anyone would think you wanted to kill the poor dog.'  (To this, one Facebook user replied: 'You have to work at Waitrose, as I did for 27 years, to know that comments like this are not fictitious.') A customer in the Wilmslow, Cheshire, branch was overheard telling her husband: 'Please don't rummage in the reduced bin, darling, someone from the golf club might see you.' One child following its mother down an aisle asked: 'Mummy, are we doing shopping for the boat as well?' And another mother was overheard saying: 'Lucas put that falafel down, you already chose olives with Manchego for your treat' The shame: Customers in the smart supermarket know they might see friends there, and behave accordingly . Upmarket groceries for an upmarket clientele: Waitrose sells products you are unlikely to find anywhere else . Other comments include: 'The pheasants on our land get so cocky outside the shooting season, I can't wait for October to come round again.' 'Hurry up with the focaccia darling, that man's coming to clean the pool soon', and 'Darling, do we need parmesan for both houses?' One mother ticked her son off, saying: 'Orlando that's enough blueberries, I only need them to go on top of the venison.' While another said: 'Of course she can come and play with us this afternoon, just so long as she is OK with the fact that due to the storm we have no wifi.' One particular gem sent in recounts the instance when a Waitrose customer approached a member of staff to ask where the 'night milk' was. When he asked her what she was referring to, the customer replied: 'You know, the night milk - milked at night from the cows because the vitamins are better in it.' Waitrose has a royal warrant to supply groceries to the Queen, and is known for its particular clientele . One man in his 40s was overheard telling his friend: 'Gosh, its been two days since I last meditated' and apparently appeared shocked by the realisation as he said it out loud. To which his friend replied: 'You must be feeling like a muggle.' One woman in a trouser suit told her friend: 'We've got such a swan problem in the garden this year', while another shopper was heard saying: 'Of course I would buy the smoked salmon, but it makes the Maserati smell like a fishmonger's.' Another comment was: 'Gosh you have to be millionaires to shop here - just as well we are', while one mother said: 'Luciano behave! Children these days... I blame the au pairs.' Meanwhile one poor Waitrose husband was lambasted by his wife: 'Darling...kamalata olives not halkidiki. Seriously darling we're having Châteauneuf du Pape, not Lambrusco.' This morning a spokesman for Waitrose was characterstically understated when asked for a comment on the Facebook page, saying simply: 'It's nice to see people having a bit of fun.'","Overheard In Waitrose is a collection of gems from UK's smartest shoppers .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Effective officer on patrol or laughing stock? Chief Supt Nick Adderley of Greater Manchester Police, pictured, is considering using Segways to patrol the city centre . Police force bosses considering patrolling the streets of Manchester on two-wheeled Segways have been warned it will turn their officers into a 'laughing stock'. Greater Manchester Police bosses are considering buying two of the self-balancing electric vehicles, complete with GMP livery, sirens and blue flashing lights, to help them police the city centre. The vehicles, which have a maximum speed of 12mph, cost around £5,000 each, but the force, which has tested two vehicles loaned from a company in Leeds at the GMP headquarters, is said to be considering a sponsorship deal. Divisional commander Chief Supt Nick Adderley tweeted a picture of himself . riding one of the Segways and said: 'To increase visibility and . accessibility to officers in the city of Manchester, I want to introduce . Segways. Good idea?' He said 'We are looking at the feasibility of how successful they would be. We might rent first and give them a try. 'I . think it is something we can do to increase visibility and . approachability. We are increasing our suite of bicycles anyway but some . areas are not suitable for bikes - like Market Street or the Arndale . Centre . 'A . police officer can cover a greater distance quicker, and officers would . be on a raised platform to improve visibility. 'They are pretty easy to . use once you get used to them and they proved very popular with other . officers when we tested them.' However Twitter users were quick to pour scorn on the idea, with one suggesting bicycles might be 'healthier and more accessible' and another saying: 'Couldn't they just walk?' One Manchester city centre shopkeeper was more forthright, however, calling the plan 'a daft idea'. The man, who asked not to be named, said: 'It will turn the police into a laughing stock. Can you imagine them chasing down the criminals in Manchester on one of those?' He added: 'They will look like that guy in the Hollywood film Paul Blart Mall Cop - the only way they will catch someone is because the offender will fall about laughing. 'Sorry, it might work in America, but it won't work here.' GMP said the plan was under consideration while they considered the practical and legal implications, and no decision had yet been taken. Segways were trialled by police in the south London borough of Sutton in 2007, but Met officials decided not to use them after the trial showed they were rarely used and were also illegal to use on the road. One wag suggested the GMP officers on Segways would resemble Paul Blart in the Mall Cop comedy, pictured . First unveiled in New York in 2001, Segways were invented by Dean Kamen after he designed an all-terrain electric wheelchair called an iBot. Segways operate purely by balance, and riders stand upright and control the vehicle through tall handlebars. Immortalised . in the 2009 hit movie Paul Blart: Mall Cop, they are used across the world at theme parks, tourist attractions, shopping centres and by security . guards on housing estates. Invented in 2001, Segways work using the rider's balance to control speed and direction . In Britain, Segways are illegal to use on pavements . and do not meet regulations designed for electric bikes, so they cannot . be used on roads as motor vehicles either. However adventure companies in the UK advertise Segway 'experience' days for thrill-seekers, usually in forest settings. In 2010 Jimi Heselden, the British multi-millionaire who owned Segway Inc, which makes Segways, died in a freak accident while riding one of his vehicles. Mr Heselden, who was 62, apparently lost control of his Segway while riding it on his estate near Boston Spa, West Yorkshire.  He and his all-terrain Segway were found in the River Wharfe which ran 80ft below a cliff on his estate, leading police to suspect he had been riding the vehicle when he fell off the cliff and into the river below.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Joshua Varey, 24, from Colne, Lancashire, was jailed for 126 days after admitting animal cruelty at Burnley Magistrates' Court . Three thugs who laughed as they set their dogs on other terrified animals so they could make 'trophy' videos for a dog fighting racket were sent to prison today. Joshua Varey, 24, filmed accomplices Shaun Mullens, 22, and Paul Ashworth, 49, all from Colne, Lancashire, climbing up a tree and trying to shake a cat out of its branches so that their dogs could maul it. The younger two men also filmed a horrifying incident in which they used one of their dogs to attack a badger after digging into its sett. Today all three were jailed after pleading guilty to animal cruelty charges at Burnley Magistrates' Court in Lancashire. Magistrates had seen DVD footage in which Varey could be heard laughing as distressed animals yelped in terror.  In one attack, caught on film, a voice was heard saying 'It's dead' before a badly injured badger crawled away. The court had heard that police and RSPCA officers found the DVD during dawn raids at 11 homes across Pendle last summer, in which officers seized three lurchers, two terriers and a lurcher/bull terrier cross, as well as computers, mobile phones, cash and drugs equipment . The operation followed a 12-month evidence gathering operation into badger digging, deer poaching, hare coursing and offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Last October, six cats were killed by lurchers in attacks in Colne over three days. Police said the incidents were known as ‘cat coursing', where dogs were trained to kill domestic pets before going poaching or badger baiting. JPs heard that Varey, who bought and sold dogs for profit, and bred them to fight other animals, had injured and scarred dogs in cages outside at his home and was proud that his animals were 'adept at fighting.' Paul Taylor, prosecuting, said the gang had a shared interest in setting dogs on animals. Phones found at Varey's house contained animal baiting videos, photographs of animals, and messages about 'doing holes', 'going out with the terriers' and 'going digging'. The prosecutor said: ' We suggest that this is talking about about putting dogs down holes to get at animals.' He said there were photographs showing a scarred dog, a dog with blood around its mouth, and a photograph of a fox and fox cub. Mr Taylor said: 'We say this is evidence of Varey's fascination with using dogs to fight and cause injury to other animals.' He said . Varey kept dogs outside in cages and bred them 'to fight other animals . in order to give pleasure to people like these defendants.' He said Varey was in charge and also bred and sold dogs for profit. Shaun Mullens, 22, left, in black top, and Paul Ashworth, 49. right, were also both jailed for animal cruelty . When interviewed, Ashworth claimed he was only doing what he was told when he was shaking the tree a cat had run up the prosecutor said. Mr Taylor said the cat was forced to run quickly up another tree to get away from the dogs, and said the cat would have been terrified. Mr Taylor said when Varey was questioned, he didn't deny any responsibility for the film on his phone but made no comment. Mullens admitted it was his dog in the badger fight video. Defending Varey, Gail Evans said it was his first animal welfare conviction. Nick Cassidy, for Mullens, said the case had been 'a learning curve', and he apologised. And Ashworth's lawyer, John Rusius, said: 'He does not accept being part of any group and does not share any passion for anything.' Animal cruelty: Video stills show Paul Ashworth, left, shaking a tree up which a cat, right, has fled to escape . Animal fights: Magistrates heard that Varey, who was the ringleader, kept and bred dogs for fighting . Varey . and Mullens, who admitted causing an animal fight to take . place, were disqualified from keeping or owning animals for ten years.  Varey was jailed for 126 days, while groundsman Mullens was sentenced to 114 days. Ashworth, who admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal, was sentenced to 76 days in prison. The magistrates said: 'The cat was in fear of its life and you clearly appeared to be enjoying what was taking place.' After the case, RSPCA Inspector Ian Briggs said: 'These men showed absolutely no regard for any of the animals, including their own dogs. 'This was cruelty in its most abhorrent form.'","Joshua Varey, 24, Shaun Mullens, 22, and Paul Ashworth, 49, all jailed today .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Florence Frost, 88, pictured with husband Victor, 90, was sent away from A&E at Queen's Hospital, Romford, despite having a broken neck and spine . Doctors sent home a grandmother who broke her neck and back in a fall in her garden telling her to take painkillers. Florence Frost, 88, went to the A&E department at Queen's Hospital, Romford, after the accident at her home in Dagenham, Essex, which lefter in agony and barely able to move. Her husband Victor Frost, 90, and daughter, Lynne Reynolds, 55, demanded that Mrs Frost be X-rayed, but medics insisted she was just 'badly bruised' and sent the elderly woman home. Two days later the frail pensioner was rushed back to the hospital after her condition deteriorated. She has now been told that she will have to lie, immobile, on a ward for six to eight weeks to limit the damage she's already suffered. Today her daughter spoke of her anger and fear that the original blunder by doctors could leave her mother in pain for the rest of her life. Mrs Reynolds, whose parents live with her and her family in Dagenham, said: 'One false move could have left her paralysed. 'My son and I helped her into bed and to move when she was at home - and we could have done more damage to her as we thought it was just a bruised neck. 'We didn't have a clue it was broken.' She said her distressed mother is 'in a very confused state', adding: 'Mum is constantly crying all day and she more or less can't move an inch.  She's just lying in bed.' Mrs Reynolds added: 'It's very upsetting for me and my dad, who is 90 years old.  They're treating her well in the ward, but when she went to A&E they just sent her home. 'To treat an 88-year-old woman like that is absolutely disgusting.' Angry: Mrs Frost's daughter, Lynne Reynolds, 55, and husband asked A&E staff to X-ray her but claim they were refused. She has complained to the hospital trust . She has . now complained to Dagenham and Rainham MP Jon Cruddas about the . treatment her mother received at A&E and is also writing to the . £200m flagship hospital to make a formal complaint. A .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Parishioners at a small church in Hampshire who were without a vicar for more than a year have had their patience rewarded with two for the price of one. Huband and wife clergy the Reverend Mike and the Reverend Nicky-Sue Terry began their new joint job today as vicars of St Mary's Church in Warsash, near Southampton. They are believed to be one of very few married couples who are both Church of England clergy and who share a job. Married clerics the Rev Mike and the Rev Nicky-Sue Terry begin their job-share at St Mary's Warsash today . Before beginning their new job today, the Terrys, both 52, were to be formally installed as vicars by the Bishop of Portsmouth, Christopher Foster, at a service tonight. Mr Terry said: 'Although married clergy couples are no longer so unusual in the Church of England, what makes our post different is that we will be sharing the responsibilities equally. 'We see it as a kind of job-share for God' The couple met while training for ordination in Cambridge and married five years ago. Mrs Terry said: 'We've fallen in love all over again, this time with the spiritual treasure of St Mary's and the wonderful gem that is Warsash village. 'We're really looking forward to getting to know this area much better, and the people who live here, and believe that we will be able to bring much more to this role than either one of us could individually.' Since their marriage, the Terrys have lived in nearby Fareham, where Mr Terry, a former Commander in the Royal Navy, moved when he worked on HMS Sultan. Previously, his wife worked for the Christian publishing and teaching charity CWR. St Mary's Church in the Hampshire village has been without a permanent priest since May last year . They were ordained together in Portsmouth Cathedral, and went on to work as curates, with Mr Terry based at St John's Church in Fareham and his wife at St Mary's Church in Gosport. Last September, the couple was invited by the Bishop of Portsmouth to take on the job at St Mary's on a temporary basis, and when the permanent job was advertised, they decided to apply. But the couple have been working together at St Mary's Church in Warsash, which hasn't had a permanent priest since last May, after they were invited by the Bishop of Portsmouth on a temporary basis last September. So when the post, which has been without a permanent priest since May last year, was advertised they decided to jointly apply. Mr Terry said: 'We just felt we were called. 'We both fitted here with our different skills and gifts, and felt we both seemed to have something to contribute on an equal basis.'","The Rev Mike Terry and his wife the Rev Nicky-Sue Terry will both be vicars .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Ten years ago, Manchester was in the middle of a decade of gang violence during which 112 people across the city died as a result of gun crime. This September, the city that earned itself the nickname 'Gunchester' hopes to celebrate two years without a fatal shooting - a two-year lull since the shocking murders of two policewomen by gangster Dale Cregan. Today police showed off some of the terrifying cache of guns seized or surrendered in the city in the last two years as they advertised a new gun amnesty in Manchester beginning tomorrow. Looking more appropriate to a Middle Eastern battlefield than the streets of Britain, Greater Manchester Police's array includes a grenade launcher, an assault rifle, an AK-47, a light machine gun, sub-machine gun and am array of revolvers and automatic pistols. Scroll down for video . Deadly firearms: Greater Manchester Police showed off some of the guns seized there in the last two years . Terrifying: This assault rifle is one of many weapons seized by police as they crack down on gun crime . All will be melted down, and GMP officers hope to collect even more firearms and ammunition with their new, two-week amnesty. Between 1999 and 2009, 112 people were shot dead in Greater Manchester, but there hasn't been one fatal shooting there since Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were shot by one-eyed Dale Cregan in September 2012. And there hasn't been a fatal gang-related shotting since May 2009, when 16-year old schoolboy Giuseppe Gregory was shot dead by a 15-year old hitman whilst sitting the back of a car in a pub car park in Stretford. Detective Chief Inspector Debbie Dooley, from the elite Xcalibre Task Force which was formed in 2005 to tackle the gangs said gun crime had fallen in the city year-on-year since the last amnesty in 2008. She said: 'The last fatal gang shooting was Guiseppe Gregory, and the last fatal non-gang shootings were the tragic circumstances surrounding Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone in 2012. 'These deaths, although not recent, are still far too many. We therefore want as many weapons as possible and would encourage people to hand them in.' This Mauser semi-automatic pistol was seized by anti-gun crime officers in Greater Manchester . Dale Cregan, 31, left, was jailed for life after Manchester's most recent fatal shooting in September 2012; right is a mini-Uzi, one of a horde of illegal firearms seized by and soon to be melted down by police in Manchester . Out of action: This orange Glock pistol is one of many that will be melted down by police . Guiseppe's father, James Gregory, 42, now an anti-gun campaigner said: 'I hope this gun amnesty makes a massive difference. 'A lot of children get hold of guns because of their vulnerability - if they are growing up in a house where there is no money or too many other children it can have a grave consequence if there is no father figure. 'That child whose mother is working two or three jobs is not always there to keep an eye on him and if the mum isn't there to keep an eye on him then the streets will keep an eye on him.' He added: 'It's easier for people to join a gang than to leave, and youngsters need an exit strategy to get out of that. 'To a person involved in weapons and guns it can only end two ways: jail or death.' Most recent gun crime victims: Policewomen Fiona Bone, 42, and Nicola Hughes, 23, died in September 2012 . Notorious murders during the height of Manchester's gun problems included the shooting of 15-year-old Jessie James, who was shot and killed on 9 September 2006 as he cycled home from a party with friends. In one incident in 2004 panic broke out at Manchester Royal Infirmary as rival armed gangs spotted each other after a shooting and ran after each other through the hospital corridors. But police cracked down on the gangs, and in 2001 Tommy Pitt, then 28-year-old leader of the Pitt Bull Crew, was given 30 years for murder, and in 2009 Colin Joyce, then 29, and 32-year old Lee Amos were given 35 years for two murders after being convicted of running the Gooch Close Gang. Ian McLeod, then 42, and leader of the Dodington Gang was jailed for 21 years in 2007 for organised a botched hit which saw both his hitmen shot dead. The amnesty begins at 7am tomorrow and will give people the chance to dispose of firearms or ammunition with no questions asked by handing it in at any GMP police station.  They will not face prosecution for illegal possession, and can remain anonymous.","Between 1999-2009, 112 people in Manchester died as a result of gun crime .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A bride-to-be was murdered by her fiance with a 'single devastating punch' during a drunken argument over whether to take a bus or a taxi home after a night out, a court heard today. Caroline Finegan, 29, crumpled to the ground like a 'bag of potatoes' after Ryan Ingham, 26, ran at her at full pelt before striking her in the face, it was alleged. One eye witness claimed Ingham had run at the victim and hit her a 'like car travelling at 40mph' before he started to shake her 'like a rag doll' as she lay on the ground in an act of 'wanton thuggery.' The force of the punch broke Miss Finegan's nose, her eye socket and swiveled her head so violently that it tore blood vessels in her neck. Trial: Ryan Ingham, 26, is accused of murdering his fiancee, Caroline Finegan, 29, with a single punch . But when Ingham rang the emergency services he could be heard telling her to 'get up' and even suggested she was faking her injuries, it was alleged. During a 999 call as Miss Finegan lay dying, Ingham was heard telling her: 'Hello, wakey wakey. Oi monkey, get up, look you bashed your head. What you doing, your belly is showing.' When paramedics arrived at the scene near Shudehill bus station in Manchester city centre at around 1am on January 16 this year, Miss Finegan was not breathing. She was pronounced dead later that day in hospital. Manchester Crown Court was told that the bingo hall worker, who had five children from previous relationships, had met father of six Ingham in August last year, becoming engaged to him three months later. In January they went for a night out together at Churchill's pub in Manchester city centre. CCTV captured the pair as they appeared to be arguing after leaving the pub to make their way home to Stockport. The couple were seen initially heading towards a bus station, before speaking separately to a taxi driver. Eyewitness Anthony O'Connor, who had just left work after a shift at Manchester Cathedral, said he heard a woman shouting and saw a man run past him, towards her. Scene: The couple had been on a night out in Manchester city centre before they rowed, the court heard . He said: 'He ran at her at a really full speed and then came into contact with her and with the punch she completely fell to the ground. 'The one thing that affects me that time - and to this day - is the way she fell to the ground. The only way I can describe it is if you had a bag of potatoes and if you drop them and they crumple. That is how she fell. 'As far as I am aware, the life left her instantly. She completely collapsed into the road. He did not stop running and ran four or five steps after.' He went on: 'It was like someone hitting her in a motor car at about 40mph... 'He came back and immediately picked her up by the arms and that scene was horrific and it disturbed me. He dragged her onto the pavement and as he was dragging her her blouse was pulled up and her skirt was coming down. 'I said to myself ""What a way for a human being to go."" There was total disrespect for human life. It was horrendous. He started to shake her like a rag doll. An eye-witness reported seeing Ingham drag Miss Finegan by the arms onto the pavement after punching her . 'I think it was a total attack of thuggery. He had no respect of human life and not respect for that girl. It was wanton thuggery. There is no excuse for it.' The court heard that Ingham rang 999 claiming he was 'ex-army' and saying he was qualified to carry out first aid on the battlefield. When asked by the operator what caused the fall he said: 'I don't know because we were arguing. 'I ran over to her and next thing I know she was being a mong, lying on the floor, because we were about to get a taxi home. We were arguing about getting a taxi home. It is superficial. I am ex-army. I have got my battlefield first aid.' He told the 999 operator: 'She is in no danger. She is just p*****. I do not know if she is faking it or not.' CT scans later revealed extensive subarachnoid bleeding in Miss Finegan's brain. At 6.19pm on January 16 she was pronounced dead. Francis McEntee, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant got into an argument with Miss Finegan possibly over whether they should take a taxi or bus to get home - the consequence which was to say he ran some distance up the road of Shudehill and struck his girlfriend with a devastating blow which she never recovered from. 'The blow he struck was sufficient to cause a fracture to her right eye socket and break her nose on the right hand side. The examination of these injuries speaks to the force that defendant used.' Ingham of Blackley, Manchester initially said Miss Finegan had passed out and fallen over but later admitted they had been 'bickering' about whether to get a bus or taxi home.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A young mother who was told that her little boy didn't have long to live staged a pretend wedding so her dying son could give her away. Carla Marshall, 19, drew up a bucket list after learning that her two-year-old son, D'Shawn, who has multiple health problems including life-limiting epilepsy, was unlikely to live another six months. Top of the list was her only child giving her away at her wedding, but despite a real wedding to her boyfriend of just one month not being on the horizon, Miss Marshall, from Wolverhampton, decided to hold a mock one. Her boyfriend, Kyle Matthews, 22, agreed to stand in as the groom, local charities rallied round, and donations of wedding cars, clothes and decorations poured in. A mother's love: Carla Marshall, 19, wanted her ill son D'Shawn, two, to give her away at her wedding . Heartbreaking: Miss Marshall said: 'Doctors told me to plan for his funeral, but I can't imagine life without him' 'Everyone was crying': Miss Marshall's boyfriend of one month, Kyle Matthews, 22, stood in as groom . Last Friday, little D'Shawn, who was left severely disabled after suffering a respiratory arrest when he was just two months old, gave his mother away at the staged ceremony at St Michael and All Angels Church in Penkridge, north of Wolverhampton. Miss Marshall said: 'I was so worried that he wouldn't make it as the week before he had been really poorly and in hospital, so I just prayed he didn't have a seizure. 'I know it wasn't real, but it was the only thing I wanted for us to experience together in the little time we have left. 'The highlight of my day was the first dance, which I had with D'Shawn.  He managed to hold his head up and looked straight into my eyes, it was pure love.  There were tears from not just me, but from everyone.' D'Shawn slept on his way to the church but woke up as his mother walked down the aisle and the choir started.' His mother, a former student, said: 'He didn't stop smiling for the whole day.  D'shawn can't communicate well but I know how much he enjoyed it, and two days after the wedding he told me he loved me for the very first time.' Sick: Little D'Shawn suffers from numerous health problems and has spent much of his short life in hospital . Miss Marshall came up with her plan after doctors told her she should start thinking about planning her son's funeral, which she described as 'like a slap in the face.' Her son, who can't walk, talk, hold his head up or eat, suffers from numerous health problems including life-limiting epilepsy, developmental delay, brain damage, partial sight, and microcephaly. She said: 'When he was first diagnosed I didn't really know what to think - half of the things I'd never even heard of. 'Doctors have told me his epilepsy is life-limiting but I never really thought about my life without D'Shawn until recently. 'He has a seizure pretty much ever day, and we feel extremely lucky if he doesn't have one. Church: The service was held at St Michael and All Angels church in Penkridge, north of Wolverhampton . 'In April he had another respiratory arrest and I thought I was going to lose him.  His left lung collapsed and both his kidneys - I was completely heartbroken but D'Shawn pulled through and that's when I decided we needed to make the most of every day we have together.' She told her family of her plans to put on a fake wedding, and says they 'completely understood' and supported her idea. 'He has the cheekiest personality; I can tell by the look in his eyes, they say everything,' Miss Marshall said.  'I can't imagine life without him. 'From the minute he was born he was just perfect, he loves cuddles and his favourite thing is Thomas the Tank Engine.' 'People keep asking me when I'm going to get married now but I'm not in a rush, me and Kyle have only become an item recently so we aren't even thinking about real wedding bells. 'All my love and time is spent with my little precious boy at the moment.' Carla Marshall was helped by DADs charity, which helps fathers who care for children with special needs.","D'Shawn Marshall, two, has many health problems and life-limiting epilepsy .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Shelley Faulkner, 27, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was warned she might be permanently paralysed after a dramatic car crash . An artist who was told she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair after her car flew out of control on an icy road has astonished her doctors by walking just a few months later. Shelley Faulkner, 27, suffered massive spinal injuries and a broken arm when her car skidded and rolled twice before hitting a tree on a frost road near Alcester, Warwickshire, last November. She was told she was lucky to be alive but would probably be permanently paralysed after medics discovered two of her vertebrae had fused together in the 53mph smash. Miss Faulkner's parents started looking into getting 24-hour carers and converting the ground floor of their house in Stratford-upon-Avon into a wheelchair-accessible flat for her. But only a week after the crash, the graduate was sitting up in bed and now, seven months later, she is walking again and starting a new degree. Miss Faulkner, who only spent 11 days in hospital, despite undergoing three operations to put a metal plate into her arm and rods and pins into her neck, said: 'I feel like I'm living a second life. 'I should only have had two options - complete paralysis or death. 'With every step I took, it felt like I was on the road to recovery - each one was a little miracle to me.' She was driving to work at a gallery, taking care not to rush because of the icy conditions, when she lost control changing gears and her car skidded on frozen mud or leaves. Miss Faulkner said: 'My . car spun on its wheels and I ended up in a field after having hit a . tree, killed a pigeon, gone through a ditch, rolled my car and smashed . the driver’s side window with my head.' She put her surprise recovery down to the quick thinking of passers-by, Andy Freke and Lisa Richardson, who called paramedics and helped keep her awake until they arrived. Miss Faulkner said: 'Andy parked his truck across the road and took control of everything.  He rang for the ambulance, made sure I stayed awake and didn't move. 'If you listen to the 999 call in the background you can hear me screaming, but I've been told that's a good thing because if you're screaming you're breathing.' Recovery: Miss Faulkner, an artist, had to have a 'halo' drilled into her head to support her spine as it mended . Crumpled wreck: The mangled remains of her car illustrate the severity of the crash last November . She said: 'When I came to, I tried to get out of my seat but Andy told me to stay still. If he hadn’t have done that, I would have done more damage and it could have killed me.' Firefighters cut her out of the wrecked car and she was rushed to the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, before being transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham in a critical condition. Miss Faulkner said: 'I was told I was very lucky to be alive and would . probably be paralysed.  My step-dad starting looking into turning downstairs into a place for me to live, and was thinking about how they could provide 24-hour care. 'But I was just so determined to try and walk . again.  What the doctors said spurred me on.' She added: 'There was a lot of blood. I have no idea how my mum managed to get it all out of my scarf, but it's blue again now.' Recovery: Miss Faulkner was in hospital for just 11 days, during which time she underwent three operations . Rehabilitation: The artist had to have intense physio and occupational therapy to strengthen her arms . Miss Faulkner had to undergo months of physio and rehab, and it is still ongoing, but she said the idea that she 'should' be dead or paralysed spurred her on. Immediately after the crash, she had to wear a ‘halo’ – which was drilled into her head to support her spine – for seven days and lie perfectly flat to avoid her neck being broken. She through a straw lying down until her neck was strong enough to allow her to sit up in bed, and after she was discharged from hospital she was visited by a physiotherapist every day and ordered to do hours of gruelling exercises. She said: 'It was hell, but I was just grateful to be alive. 'There were times when I felt quite low because my body was a lot weaker than it had been before but I just carried on taking the extra step every day and doing the little exercises to build up my arm and back again. 'The thing that spurred me on was the thought that I had been given a second chance.' Miss Faulkner, left, shortly after her crash and right, before it, says she is grateful for her 'second chance' Keep going: Miss Faulkner now wants to train as an occupational therapist to help others who are injured . During her months of physio and rehab, Miss Faulkner decided to change her career, swapping art for training as an occupational therapist. She said: 'I had to basically train my body to do everything again, even putting on my bra was hard work, but when I managed it for the first time I wanted to celebrate because it meant that my arm was able to bend more than it could before. 'While I was doing that, I thought that I would like to train as an occupational therapist to help other people.' As a result, she will start a university course in occupational therapy in Bristol in September. She said: 'I’ve still got a long way to go until I can go to the gym and swimming again but I’m determined to get stronger, I'm walking again, and I feel stronger each day.' She added: 'I wouldn’t wish the accident itself on anyone but I’ve got so much out of the recovery that in a way, I'm quite grateful for it.'","Shelley Faulkner, 27, lost control of her car on an icy road last November .

"By . Harriet Arkell . and Amanda Williams . Sir Alex Ferguson was awoken from an apparent slumber in the royal box to watch Andy Murray leap into the air in celebration as he earned a place in the Wimbledon quarter finals. The 27-year-old stormed to victory against South African opponent 6ft8in Kevin Anderson, after beating him in three straight sets on Centre Court. The former Manchester United manager had earlier closed his eyes to enjoy a brief snooze as rain halted play in all matches at the All England Club in the early . afternoon, including that between Alize Cornet and Eugenie Bouchard, which was stopped while the retractable roof was brought . out. But he was soon back up on his feet to cheer on his fellow Scotsman, who has won every set he's played at Wimbledon so far this year, as he took the match against the towering 28-year-old from Johannesburg. Scroll down for video . Perfect spot for 40 winks? Sir Alex Ferguson managed to fit a kip in during Alize Cornet's clash with Eugenie Bouchard on Centre Court . Sir Alex did not bother to hide his yawn as he watched fellow Scot andy Murray take on Kevin Anderson on centre court . But as the action hotted up, Sir Alex seemed to grow more interested - even rising to his feet to cheer on Murray . Andy Murray celebrates beating South Africa's Kevin Anderson during day eight of the Wimbledon Championships. The 27-year-old beat his giant  6ft 8ins opponent Anderson, 28, in three straight sets on Centre Court last night . The victory by the reigning Wimbledon champion will fuel hopes of a second consecutive title for Murray, as bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning to 5/2 . Murray, who is fifth in the world, was watched on Centre Court by his coach Amelie Mauresmo, his mother Judy Murray and his girlfriend Kim Sears (pictured) Former England football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, 72, and singer Sir Cliff Richard, 73, were in the royal box to watch Andy Murray defend his Wimbledon title today . Entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, 63, shared a joke with his daughter, Holly, 31, as they sat behind Prince Michael of Kent, 71, in the royal box this afternoon . The Countess of Wessex arrived at the royal box in navy blue, while Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, 26, chose leopard print and a large white tote to cheer him on . The Countess of Wessex wore a navy blue suit with split skirt for her afternoon of tennis, while Sir Cliff wore a striped suit and tie.  Sir Richard, who was accompanied by his daughter, Holly, 31, was joined in the royal box by broadcaster Sir Trevor Macdonald, and former British football manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Sir Alex watched Murray's quarter-final victory last year, and the tennis star described the advice he gave him during a 15-minute chat as 'gold dust'. Murray said after their meeting last year: ‘It's an unbelievable work ethic for such a long period of time. Spending 15 minutes with him, he's a really impressive guy and you can learn a lot from him.' Football Association chairman Greg Dyke was also there, and was expected to be joined by singer Elaine Page, Irish golfer Paul McGinley and ex-cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell. Winning streak? Andy Murray got off to a strong start, winning the first set and starting the second set well against Kevin Anderson in the fourth round . Tense: Judy Murray is, as ever, hooked watching her son play. She famously refuses to talk to anyone during the matches of either Andy or Jamie . Enraptured: Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo looked on open-mouthed during her player's clash with Anderson . Meanwhile Murray's fans were forced to queue for more than 26 hours to get a ticket for today's big match. Just 500 Centre Court seats were available for fans in the famous SW19 queue, and those turning up after the early hours of yesterday morning were left disappointed. A message . on the official Wimbledon website at 8am yesterday read: 'There are more . people in the queue than Centre and No.1 Court tickets for Monday.' Bookmaker Coral has Murray at 20-1 on to beat Anderson, and just 4-11 to win in straight sets. The odds have also shortened from 3-1 to 5-2 on Murray winning the title again. Kitted out: Jimmy Carr and Karoline Copping threw their weight behind Canada's Eugenie Bouchard with a headbands and novelty glasses . Andy Murray, seen left arriving at Wimbledon today, is 6ft 2ins tall - a good six inches shorter than his opponent who reaches 10ft from the tip of his racket to his toes . Rain stopped play: Centre Court has a retractable roof but for spectators in Court One, it was time to put the brollies up when a heavy downpour hit . Support: Fans of Andy Murray arrived with Scrabble-themed signs for support during his clash with South Africa's Kevin Anderson on day seven . Hooked: Jim Parsons, star of American hit TV show The Big Bang Theory, had his eyes glued to the court as Bouchard took on Cornet this afternoon . David Stevens, spokesman for Coral, said: 'As reigning champion, Andy Murray came into this tournament with an even bigger following than 12 months ago. 'That has been reflected in the number of bets we've taken on him, which in turn has forced his odds down to the shortest they have ever been at the start of the second week at SW19.' Murray's hopes may have been boosted by avoiding any hold-ups amid heavy rain on Saturday. Cancellations mean fifth seed Stan Wawrinka could face five matches in seven days to reach his first Wimbledon final. But when Murray was asked if he could stand to benefit from the rejigged schedule, he replied: 'Not really. I've played many grand slams and sometimes the schedule works in your favour and sometimes it doesn't. Sporting tennis fan: Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, 67, was in the royal box with his wife, Sue Howes, for the Murray match . Murray's match was preceded by a women's match featuring Eugenie Bouchard of Canada, pictured, against France's Alize Cornet . Undampened enthusiasm: Fans sheltered under umbrellas on Murray Mount at Wimbledon today during the brief downpour that halted play on all courts . 'At least they'll have had a two-day break so they'll be completely fresh when they start. It's just bad luck. It happens sometimes. 'I've had situations where the schedule hasn't worked out. You just get on with it.' The odds are stacked against Murray's fourth-round opponent, Anderson, but the 28-year-old has been relaxing before the big match by learning to play a musical instrument and enjoying a South African barbecue. 'I've been learning how to play the guitar. That's something I enjoy doing. My mum keeps asking me to play her some tunes, but right now I'm just learning all the different notes. 'I've got a travel electric guitar which I take on the road with me. My acoustic guitar is a bit too big so that's at home,' he told wimbledon.com yesterday. After his third-round victory on Friday, Anderson posted a picture of himself on Twitter enjoying a traditional feast with the caption: 'A proper South African braai to kick off the weekend right!!!' Sir Alex Ferguson (arms crossed) took the opportunity to have a quick snooze as he waited for Murray's match on Centre Court today . What seed are you? This tennis fan had no need for an umbrella as he watched the Centre Court action dressed as a flower . Meanwhile, the Wimbledon steward who reminded Andy Murray to hug his mother after he won the Wimbledon title last year has told how he helped the Scot avoid 'a great British faux pas'. One of the most memorable moments of his victory was when he climbed up to the players' box to celebrate with his team, hugging supporters including his girlfriend, Kim Sears, but forgot to hug his mother and earliest coach. Honorary steward David Spearing - the longest-serving steward at Wimbledon and guardian of the players' box - told how he made sure the new champion thanked his mother, too. He told BBC Radio 5 live: 'It was rather funny because Andy climbed into the box and was high-fiving it with all his team... he started climbing off the box and I suddenly realised that he hadn't greeted his mother at all. 'So I shouted out ""Andy"" and he looked up and I said: ""Your mother"". 'He replied ""Oh"" and climbed back up and embraced her.' Whoever wins this year will not have to climb over the commentary box to get to their supporters as there is now a gate for players to walk through.","Reigning champion Andy Murray, 27, stormed to victory against South Africa's Kevin Anderson, 28, on Centre Court .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The parents of missing Madeleine McCann today hit out angrily at the former Portuguese police chief they are suing after the case was halted when he sacked his lawyer just as they were due to appear in court. Kate and Gerry McCann, who flew from their home in Rothley, Leicestershire, to Lisbon to appear in their libel action against Goncalo Amaral over claims he made in his book about the hunt for their daughter, gave an angry impromptu press conference outside court today. Mrs McCann told reporters: 'It brings us more pain and distress every time we come here.  We just want justice.' She said Amaral could have got rid of his legal team before they left England for Portugal, and when asked if she believed the 11th hour move was part of his strategy, her husband replied: 'Clearly.' Scroll down for videos . Agonised: Kate and Gerry McCann hit out after Goncalo Amaral halted his trial by sacking his legal team today . Mrs McCann said Amaral could have alerted the court to his decision before they left Britain for Portugal . Exit the lawyers: Amaral's lawyer, Victor Santos de Oliveira left court saying he didn't know why he'd been fired.  Later, the McCanns strode out behind their lawyer, Isabel Duarte, to speak to waiting reporters . Mrs McCann added: 'Mr Amaral handed that letter in apparently around nine o'clock this morning - that letter could have been handed in before we left the country. 'And this has happened about four times. This can't be seen an anything but blatant and cynical.' Clearly angry and upset, she went on: 'We need to make it clear to people: we took on this case because of the pain and distress that Mr Amaral has brought to us and our children. She said: 'Mr Amaral is not the victim in this', and detailed all the arrangements she and her husband had had to make to get to Lisbon, saying: 'Every time we come here we have to make arrangements for our children to be looked after, we have to take time off work.' Her husband added: 'We're exasperated that the hearing has been cancelled once again at Mr Amaral's request - this is the fourth time this has happened and we've travelled to Portugal. 'The legal case has been running now for over five years and we want to get justice for Madeleine. 'Today . is a blatant and cynical attempt to wear us down and it's Madeleine who . is suffering.  We're not going to give up - we're going to keep going.' The libel trial against Amaral over unfounded allegations in his book, The Truth Of The Lie, that the McCanns hid their daughter's body after an accident and faked an abduction, has now been postponed to give the defendant time to find a new lawyer. The next hearing has been set for 8 July and Mr McCann said he and his wife would attend then. The McCanns' lawyer, Isabel Duarte, today said: 'No-one imagined that this could happen.' She said delays meant that the book could continue making 'severe damages' against the McCanns. Asked if the latest move by the former detective was a strategic attempt to delay the trial, she said it was 'clear' that if someone wanted to remove their lawyer's powers, they would substitute him in the same day. Earlier today the McCanns arrived at court to tell how accusations in Amaral's book about the hunt for their daughter have affected them. Mr and Mrs McCann were originally told they could not make statements to the long-running trial, but the decision was overturned after an appeal by their lawyer. Arriving earlier: Kate and Gerry McCann were to give evidence in the case against ex police chief, Goncalo Amaral . The parents of Madeleine, left, are suing Mr Amaral, right, over his 2008 book Maddie: The Truth Of The Lie . They were expected to deliver emotional statements at Lisbon's Palace of Justice, describing how the claims by Mr Amaral have caused them unnecessary grief. Their appearance was due to mark the end of the trial, but a final ruling on the case is not expected until later this year. Last week, the couple's spokesman Clarence Mitchell confirmed that they were planning to attend court after the judge decided they could speak at the trial after all. Their daughter Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on 3 May 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. Her parents say that claims in Mr Amaral's 2008 book, including suggestions that they hid Madeleine's body after she died in an accident and faked an abduction, damaged the hunt for their daughter and exacerbated their anguish. In October Mr McCann's sister, Trish Cameron, told the libel trial that the couple's pain over their daughter's disappearance was 'multiplied 100 times' by the book, and they had been left in 'purgatory' by the disappearance of Madeleine, and claims that they were somehow involved. If successful the family stands to gain around £1 million in damages. The McCanns' court appearance comes after they last week said the fact police found no evidence relating to their missing daughter during recent searches in Praia da Luz had reinforced their belief that she could still be alive. Gerry McCann said he would not give up on his quest for justice for his missing daughter . GERRY MCCANN: . 'We're exasperated that the hearing has been cancelled once again at Mr Amaral's request. 'This is the fourth time this has happened and we've travelled to Portugal. 'The legal case has been running now for over five years and we want to get justice for Madeleine. 'Today is a blatant and cynical attempt to wear us down and it's Madeleine who is suffering. 'We're not going to give up - we're going to keep going.' [ON THE RECENT SEARCHES AROUND PRAIA DA LUZ] . 'What is clear is that the searches haven't found any evidence to show that Madeleine has been seriously injured or is dead. 'As . far as we are concerned there is a good chance she is still alive and . we have to keep searching for her - that's why we are here.' Kate McCann said every visit to Portugal brought fresh distress to her and her family . KATE MCCANN . We . need to make it clear to people: we took on this case because of the . pain and distress that Mr Amaral has brought to us and our children. 'And every time he postpones the case like this it brings us more pain and distress. 'Every . time we come here we have to make arrangements for our children to be . looked after, we have to book flights, we have to book hotels, we have . to take time off work to come here. 'And . Mr Amaral handed that letter in apparently around nine o'clock this . morning. That letter could have been handed in before we left the . country. 'And . this has happened about four times. As Gerry said, this can't be seen . as anything but blatant and cynical. We just want justice. This is not . fair.' Mr and Mrs McCann said they were 'very pleased' with the significant activity that had taken place in the Algarve resort and it was 'gratifying' to know that a substantial amount of work will take place over the coming months. During searches of three areas of land over 10 days, detectives found no evidence relating to Madeleine, saying the recent activity was only the first phase of the investigation and more would be carried out 'shortly'. In a statement, the McCanns said: 'We are very pleased that significant activity has taken place in Praia da Luz over the last 10 days with police officers and support teams from the UK working closely with the Policia Judiciaria and the Guarda Nacional Republicana. 'We are further encouraged that despite the intensive searches, no trace of Madeleine has been found and this reinforces our belief that she could still be alive. 'As parents of a missing child, we have always wanted all reasonable lines of inquiry to be followed and it is gratifying to know that a substantial amount of work will take place over the coming months with the close co-operation of the British and Portuguese authorities. 'We would like to thank all those involved for their efforts and the members of the public who have come forward with information.' Searches in the Portuguese resort saw officers from Scotland Yard's Operation Grange working alongside specialists from around the UK, including Sussex Police and South Wales Police, with the Portuguese police. The next stage of the operation will see police question three suspected burglars who were in the Praia da Luz area at the time of the disappearance in 2007 as well as five other men who worked at the Ocean Club where the McCanns. Portuguese police will conduct the interviews, however Metropolitan Police detectives, under Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood will be allowed to sit in the room during questioning. A source in Portugal told The Mirror: 'the questioning will be done by the Portuguese, either at Faro or Portimao police stations. The men will be detained as ""arguidos"" - or formal suspects. 'The British are ready to go at a moment's notice, but the decision on when the questioning begins is for the Portuguese police. It could start as soon as late June. 'The permission has been granted and there is not more legal paperwork to apply for.'","Kate and Gerry McCann rage outside court after trial halted at last minute .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Shoppers have been using foreign coins instead of £2 coins in some self-service tills in Morrisons . A supermarket is refusing to let shoppers pay with £2 coins at self-service tills after discovering that people were paying with similar-sized foreign coins. Bosses at Morrisons say a steep rise in the numbers of shoppers paying with coins from overseas meant they have had to refuse to accept £2 coins at automated check-outs at some of their stores in the West Midlands until they can fix the technology. They say the most common offenders are Iranian 250 rial coins, and Thai ten bath pieces. A spokesman for the supermarket chain said: 'A number of stores have had foreign currency passed off as £2 coins at self-checkouts. 'While we fix the issue, we have temporarily stopped them accepting any £2 coins, although customers are still free to use them at all manned checkouts. 'We apologise for any inconvenience it is causing, but don’t expect the fix to take long.' A spokesman for coin experts, Jewellery Quarter Bullion, said: 'The key with these machines is weight and diameter. A £2 coin weighs 12 grammes. 'It may well be that shoppers are not looking to rip anyone off - in some cases, there is very little difference in currency value. 'They may simply be trying to use change they gathered while holidaying abroad.' It was long believed £2 coins would be too expensive to copy because they are made from two different metal alloys. But last June police found a counterfeit press, producing fake £1 and £2 coins, in an East End warehouse. The lead coins, dubbed crude copies, looked legitimate as they had been sprayed silver and gold, but would not be accepted in vending machines because they were magnetic. A Morrisons spokesman wouldn't be more specific but said a 'number of stores in the West Midlands' were affected . Offenders: The Iranian 250 rial coin, left, and the Thai ten baht coin, right, are commonly used, Morrisons say . The supermarket is now looking to refine its tills' technology so that only the right coins will be accepted . A spokesman for online coin dealer, 24carat.co.uk said: 'We don’t yet fully understand why counterfeiters would be turning to forging £2 coins when we would have thought it would be easier and more worthwhile to focus on £1 coins. 'The only reason we can think of is that it is becoming more widely known that many fake pound coins are in circulation, making them subject to greater scrutiny.'","Shoppers are using Iranian rial coins and Thai baht instead at automated tills .

"By . Harriet Arkell . It is the vital piece of legislation without which two of Stephen Lawrence's killers would have escaped justice. The joint enterprise law, also known as common purpose, enables several people to be prosecuted for the same crime, regardless of who delivered the fatal blow, and is hailed by lawyers as an essential tool to use in the fight against gang crime. Yet the BBC spent licence fee money on commissioning a 90-minute drama railing against what lawyers describe as a 'powerful' and useful piece of legislation designed to stop criminals getting away with it by blaming each other. Scroll down for video . Emotive viewing: But was the BBC One drama Common fair about the joint enterprise law it condemned? Star-studded cast: Michael Gambon played the Royal Court judge who sent the group of youths to jail . Notorious criminals prosecuted under the joint enterpise law include David Norris, left, and Gary Dobson, right, both of whom were convicted of the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence using the common purpose law . Common, screened last night on BBC One, was written by Jimmy McGovern and starred Nico Mirallegro, Michael Gambon and Susan Lynch.  It told the story of a young boy who drove his friends off to get pizza, only to become involved in a murder when they stabbed another youth to death. The boy, Johnjo, played by Mirallegro, was then charged with murder under joint enterprise. Throughout the drama, McGovern's view - that all should go free rather than one semi-innocent participant be jailed along with the murderer - was hammered home, and the drama was followed by footage of three women 'blaming' the joint enterprise law for their relatives being jailed. The film was followed by brief clips of women talking about relatives they believed had been 'wrongly convicted of murder' under the joint enterprise law. Joint enterprise law, which dates back to 1846, was designed to stop criminals evading justice by blaming each other. High profile cases where the law was used included that of David Norris and Gary Dobson, who were convicted under joint enterprise for the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence.  Lawrence was stabbed to death by a gang of youths in a racially-motivated murder at a bus stop in Eltham when he was 18. It was also used in the 2012 case of the murder of Malakai McKenzie, a 19-year-old who was shot dead in a car outside a Nottingham pub in a gang attack. Nico Mirallegro played Johnjo O'Shea, the youth who drove his friends to get pizza but got caught up in a murder . Writer Jimmy McGovern, left, used Common to rant against the law that was used to convict two of the racist youths who murdered 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, right, in south-east London in 1993 . Today Andrew Allison, of pressure group the Freedom Association, which campaigns for greater impartiality from the BBC and against the licence fee, accused the corporation of failing 'to serve the public interest' by commissioning such a 'one-sided film'. He told MailOnline: 'Jimmy McGovern deliberately set out to make a one-sided film, and the scenes at the end left the viewer in no doubt of his intentions. 'The BBC's Royal Charter states the the corporation exists to serve the public interest. It is not in the public interest to broadcast a drama with such obvious political motivations that do not educate, but instead try to rubbish a law that has helped put many violent criminals behind bars. 'If there is a debate to be had about joint enterprise, this is not the way to have it.' And senior lawyer Jeremy Summers, head of business crime at Slater & Gordon, insisted that the joint enterprise law was a good thing, and that its advantages outweighed its disadvantages. He also said the law was becoming even more important as gang crime in Britain is on the increase. 'It's a controversial law, but the benefit of it is that it provides a deterrent and that is particularly the case with gang-related crime,' Mr Summers said. 'The doctrine in short allows someone to . be prosecuted for any offence, though usually it is murder, if they . participated in an activity if they knowingly assisted or encouraged the . crime and agreed to act together. Common, written by Brookside and Cracker author Jimmy McGovern, attacked the fundamental principle of justice known as joint enterprise . 'With murder it may be sufficient that . they set out to cause serious injury but not to kill.' He added: 'It has been used more frequently in recent years with the increase in gang-related crime. 'A study released earlier this year showed that in the last eight years, there were 4,500 prosecutions for murder involving two or more defendants, and just under 2,000 prosecutions for murder involving four or more defendants, and those would have used the joint enterprise provisions. 'It's a powerful tool that can enable the prosecution to get at people where there is no direct evidence that they pulled the trigger or plunged the knife in. 'It was famously used in the Stephen Lawrence case and that of Malakai McKenzie, and that is where it has been deployed to best effect. 'If it can deter young men or women from joining gangs and using knives, then arguably it outweighs the concerns that the law is too draconian in its reach.' A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'The Stephen Lawrence case is perhaps the best known example of the usefulness of joint enterprise to prosecutors. Despite all of the evidence available, we still do not know for certain who exactly stabbed Stephen Lawrence, but the law enabled us to successfully prosecute two men for murder. Common looked at the predicament of a boy, played by Nico Mirallegro, who got caught up in a murder . 'However, our guidance makes clear that prosecutors should give careful consideration to which charges are appropriate and whether a prosecution is in the public interest. The suspect's age and their level of culpability are important factors in these decisions. 'We never prosecute a person just for being present at the scene of a crime. Prosecutors look for evidence that a person could have foreseen what might happen – such as knowledge that a member of their party was armed, for example - and that they took an active role in the offence, either directly or by assisting or encouraging it.' A House of Commons select committee is currently examining the principle of joint enterprise, which will be discussed on Newsnight tomorrow night. A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has a tradition of providing a platform for writers to make dramas about causes they’re passionate about. 'The BBC is exploring all the views surrounding the debate including a documentary tonight at 10.35pm and a Newsnight debate on Tuesday night.' MailOnline contacted a spokesman for Mr McGovern for a comment. Joint enterprise dates back to 1846, when two drunken delivery drivers decided to race their horse-drawn carts along a busy track on the Staffordshire/Derbyshire borders. John Swindall and James Osborne, both of whom were driving carts laden down with heavy items of pottery, egged each other on and hurled abuse at pedestrians who told them to stop as they tore along the country road. Eventually, one of them hit an elderly pedestrian, James Durose, killing him, though there were no witnesses around to say who did it. In court, both defendants blamed each other so the judge, Lord Chief Baron Pollock, decided that while only one of them must have hit the man, both of them had been drunk and reckless, and either could have done it. So he found both of them guilty of manslaughter and jailed them both, establishing a precedent that still stands in law today, and in other legal systems from the U.S. to Australia.","Common, which aired on BBC One last night, focused on joint enterprise law .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A border terrier with a damaged front leg has been given a new lease of life after her owner bought her a state of the art wheelchair. Hope, whose leg was shattered after her mother stood on her when she was just a few weeks old, spent the first seven years of her life hopping around on just three legs. But her owner, Liz Hennel, 58, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, found out about a pet wheelchair specialist based in Massachusetts, and ordered a custom-built set of wheels for the lame dog. After some time getting used to them, Hope realised what the wheels were for, and is now bounding around like a puppy. Scroll down for video . There's no stopping her now: Hope the border terrier has a new lease of life with her custom-made wheels . Devoted owner: Liz Hennel chose Hope because she was disabled and vowed to bring her up like any other dog . Hope is believed to be one of only two dogs in the country to have a wheelchair for the front legs . Mrs Hennel, who works in a rehab home for injured racehorses, said: 'Hope had a damaged leg when we got her - the accident with her leg happened when she was very small and her bones were soft, so there was nothing the breeder could do. 'We picked Hope because of her disability and I made a deal with the breeder that I would raise her as a normal dog. 'She was a beautiful little dog, very confident, and by no means the runt of the litter.' But as the years went by, Mrs Hennel and her husband, Mike, 71, noticed that their pet was having more trouble getting around. Mrs Hennel said: 'She had always been a very active dog, and used to do everything regardless of her disability. 'But if her good leg gave up, she wouldn't be able to get around.  So it was potentially life-limiting for her.' The couple discovered US firm Eddie's Wheels online, and sent them Hope's measurements before paying £360 for a two-wheeled strap-on cart that fitted their beloved pet. In clover: Hope took some getting used to her new wheels but then she realised what they were for . The wheels: Hope's £360 wheelchair is simple to strap her into and supports her chest with the straps . Doggy bag: When the Hennels are in a rush, they strap Hope into a backpack and carry her . It's quite uncommon to have wheels on the front legs - I think she is one of only two dogs in the country to have them,' Mrs Hennel said. But they have worked. 'Hope has had her cart now for five years, and it has enormously improved her life,' she said. 'It has been a learning curve for her and she is still learning new tricks - but once she realised what the wheels were for she was fantastic on them.' Now the couple want to spread the word so that other disabled pets can benefit, too. 'The more people who know about what can be done for disabled animals, the better,' Mrs Hennel said.","Hope the border terrier's front leg was broken when her mother stood on it .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Wen Ruchun, the secretive daughter of former Chinese PM Wen Jiabao, is said to be behind a £3.7m endowment to Cambridge University . One of China's most senior political families is bankrolling a professorship at Cambridge, despite the university denying any link with the country's government, it was claimed today. Wen Ruchun, daughter of China's former prime minister Wen Jiabao, is said to be behind a £3.7million endowment from the secretive Chong Hua Foundation that funded Cambridge University's Professor in Chinese Development. Cambridge has always denied any links between the post and Beijing, saying only that the foundation was set up by two wealthy individuals who wished to remain anonymous. But the university now faces claims that China is buying influence at the world famous university after a new report suggests that the foundation is run by Ms Wen. The new claims come from a previously unpublished interview with Chinese businesswoman Vivien Wang, founder of the EtonKids nursery chain, in which she made a link between Ms Wen and the Chong Hua Foundation. Discussing giving a 29 per cent stake in her business to Miss Wen, the Beijing entrepreneur said: 'We gave the shares to her charity organisation.  The charity Chong Hua owns the shares', the Daily Telegraph reported. If the claims are correct, the suggestion that a powerful political family in China might have bought influence at Cambridge will raise concerns. One academic told the Telegraph that it seemed as if a foreign government had appointed a professor at Cambridge. They said: 'How, . if the foundation's money came from the family of the head of . government of the People's Republic of China for over a decade, and if . the foundation was able to name the first occupant of the chair, can . Cambridge demonstrate academic independence?' The professorship is currently filled by Professor Peter Nolan, who is well-known to the Wen family and who has held the post since it was created in 2012. An international authority on China, Professor Nolan has co-written a book on China with Ms Wen's husband, Liu Chunhang, and is said to have acted as a tutor to Ms Wen.  He is said to have identified the foundation as a possible sponsor for the post. Ms Wen belongs to China's ruling elite, . and her family is known for its wealth and power, though she is so . secretive, she has been described as 'Wen Jiabao's mysterious daughter'. Ruling elite: Ms Wen's father, Wen Jiabao, was China's Prime Minister for a decade and is known for his wealth . She studied at Harvard and the University of Delaware in the United States, before working on New York's Wall Street using the pseudonym, Lily Chang.  She then moved to the UK when her husband began a PhD at the University of Cambridge, where, it is said, she was tutored by Professor Nolan. Her father was China's Prime Minister for a decade until March last year, while her mother, Zhang Peili, is a jewellery expert and leading figure in the lucrative diamond trade. When the professorship was created in January 2012, Cambridge University said that the endowment had come from the Chong Hua Foundation which was registered to a trust in Bermuda. The foundation has no website, and trusts registered in Bermuda are legally able to keep their details private. The new report raises questions over whether China can be accused of trying to buy influence in academia . Today, however, Professor Nolan declined to speak to MailOnline, while his university insisted that the donation - which some suggested might threaten the university's academic independence - was above board. A . Cambridge University spokesman said: 'The donation from the Chong Hua Foundation was fully . verified and approved by the University of Cambridge Advisory Committee . on Benefactions. 'No more details will be released as the donors, as is common practice, have requested complete anonymity.' This afternoon the subject of China's 'intrusions' into English-speaking universities was the subject for discussion at London think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society.","Cambridge's Professorship in Chinese Development is funded by £3.7m gift .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Louis Moore, 28, was found dead in his bedroom by his brother, professional footballer Byron Moore, 25, hours after he signed for Port Vale FC . A footballer has told how he signed a contract with a professional club before going home and finding his brother hanged in his bedroom. Byron Moore, 25, received a text from his brother, Louis, 28, saying 'I want to be alone, it's over' as he signed for Port Vale FC on Thursday. The professional footballer rushed back from the Vale Park stadium to his brother's house in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, with his mother, Jannice Mountford, 50, but it was too late. When Mr Moore didn't answer the door, the pair let themselves in and found the former athletics star hanged in his bedroom. They called emergency services to the house, but nothing could be done to save the promising athlete who'd represented Great Britain as a teenager before finding work as a supervisor at at gift company. Today Mrs Mountford, 50, said: 'It was such a shock.  You don't expect to find your own son like that. 'We eventually got him down but it was too late.' Mrs Mountford, a former Special Constable with Staffordshire Police, said her son had split up from his girlfriend six months ago, since when he had stayed in a lot. She said: 'People can put on a happy face but you never know what they are thinking.  We had been away for a week and he looked after our house. 'He said he had put £5 on the electric so I said I would go round and pay him back.  I got a message saying not to come as he wanted to be alone.' She said a few days later, she and Byron received another text 'that wasn't quite right', so they went to Mr Moore's house. Mrs Mountford said: 'Byron was going in to sign for Vale when he got the text. 'We are just devastated beyond words. He was such a talented and popular man.' Byron Moore, a former Crewe Alexander winger, said his older brother hadn't known he was signing for Port Vale. He said: 'I'm going to dedicate each goal I score to my brother.  I will say a little prayer before the games - it's going to be hard but we have to be strong. Devastated family: Jannice Mountford, 50, and her son Byron Moore, 25, found Louis Moore dead at home . Byron Moore had been signing a contract at Vale Park, home of Port Vale, when his brother sent him a text . 'We were really close - we used to text all the time and I'd go round to his house to play Xbox. He watched me play at Wembley, and cried when I scored.' Louis's father, Dennis Moore, 52, of Meir Hay, Stoke-on-Trent, said: . 'He was a great guy who liked to speak his mind. He always made you . laugh - it's such a shame that he's gone so soon.' And . his grandmother, Norma Mountford, added: 'We used to bring him to . athletics competitions, which he nearly always won. He was a lovely . boy.' Louis joined the City of Stoke Athletics Club before representing England and Great Britain in athletics. Close siblings: Louis Moore, left, and his younger brother, Byron, right, pictured when they were children . He . was part of the under-13s team whose 1997 record for the 4x100m relay . race at Northwood Stadium remains unbeaten.  He also excelled in long . jump, high jump and pentathlon.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Lying six miles off the Suffolk coast, it appears to be an old oil platform to the casual observer. But the Principality of Sealand, as residents call it, claims to be the world’s smallest country, with its own Royal Family, currency, and even postage stamps. The tiny state (though no other country officially recognises it as such) occupies a 5,290sq ft Second World War fort consisting of two concrete towers connected by an iron platform a few miles off Felixstowe, in international waters. But since 1967, Sealand's residents - all 22 of them - have declared themselves independent of Britain. Scroll down for video . Proudly independent: Sealand, which claims to be the world's smallest country, lies just off the Suffolk coast . Sealand residents have their own currency, the Sealand dollar, emblazoned with a picture of 'Princess Joan' Roy Bates, and his wife, Joan, pictured left, shortly before his death in 2012 and right when they claimed Sealand as their own in September 1967, declaring themselves Prince Michael and Princess Joan of Sealand . They produce their own drinkable water, and land their own fish and lobster, but have to import most of their food and other goods from the British mainland.  The micronation even has its own currency, the Sealand Dollar, and its own football team, the Sealand All Stars. Residents make money by selling Sealand mementoes via an online shop, as well as titles: for £199.99 you can buy the title Count or Countess of Sealand, while you can settle for Lord or Lady for just £29.99. Alternatively, you can buy one square foot of the territory for £19.99, a mug or a football shirt. Sealand began on Christmas Eve 1966 after Roy Bates, a former infantry major in the first battalion Royal Fusiliers, took over the fort, then known as HM Roughs. The fort had been built as one of a series of defence forts off the Suffolk coast during World War II before being abandoned in the 1950s. Mr Bates, then 46, was a fisherman turned pirate radio broadcaster, who had fallen foul of British broadcasting laws and wanted to find a new base somewhere outside British jurisdiction. Sealand stamps: The tiny 'micronation' also has its own currency, but largely depends on Britain for imports . The kitchen on Sealand boasts far-reaching sea views but is used by 22 residents so is hard to keep clean . The Bates family designed their own crest, featuring their motto which translates as From The Sea, Liberty . On Christmas Eve 1966, he took over Fort Roughs with his wife, Joan, daughter, Penelope, 16, and son, Michael, 16, and the following September he declared himself Prince of Sealand and his wife, Princess Joan. Thereafter followed a series of challenges, from the British government, who sent delegates to recce Sealand, to a group of German and Dutch 'invaders', but the Bates family - who gave themselves the motto E Mare Libertas (From The Sea, Freedom) - managed to hang on to the windy platform they had made their own. In October 2012, Roy Bates died at the age of 91, and the Sealand crown passed to his son, Michael, 63, who is still said to live on Sealand with his family and friends. The younger Mr Bates, aka His Majesty Prince Michael, has claimed that his micronation has been recognised by Germany and France.  And he said Scottish people wanting to claim independence from the United Kingdom could seek inspiration from his father's struggle. When Sealand's residents are not working on maintenance or the website, they relax in the sitting room . Office: Those who live in Sealand run a website selling titles and other Principality memorabilia . Basic accommodation: The platform, which is now more than 70 years old, is fairly short on modern comforts . He said: 'It hasn’t been easy for us, but the situation is different inasmuch as Scotland is heavily dependent on Britain and vice versa. 'I don’t believe it will ever happen but if it does, they would have our support. The Scots are great and fiercely independent people.' He added: 'We import from the UK and Europe most of our provisions, apart from local produce like fish and lobsters. We make our own water and are 99 percent green energy producing. 'We have something like 30 rooms of various sizes, and most of our days are spent withoffice and IT work these days, processing orders from our online shop, security and maintenance.' The Bates family is are also planning to run tourist trips to their platform later this year.","Tiny state consists of two concrete towers connected by an iron platform .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The boss of one of Britain's 'Big Six' energy firms has been accused of using company money to finance his stand-up comedian wife. EDF Group chief executive Henri Proglio faces an investigation in his native France into whether he funnelled money from the state-owned utility to his actress and comedian wife, Rachida Khalil, or influenced others to do so. The 64-year-old energy chief, whose firm has been accused of 'naked greed' for not passing on falling prices to customers, is under the spotlight over the finances of his wife, 24 years his junior. But he has denied using EDF money to fund his Moroccan born wife, whom he married last year, saying by way of explanation: 'She is an artist and her accounting is a bit artistic, too.' Scroll down for video . Comedian: Ms Khalil, 40, pictured posing at home in Paris, is married to EDF chief executive, Henri Proglio, 64 . EDF Group boss Henri Proglio, 64, is under investigation over whether funds from his company and associated firms were paid to his new wife, stand-up comedian and actress, Rachida Khalil, 40 . Investigators in Paris, who were reportedly tipped off by anti-corruption officials at several banks, are said to be looking at how Ms Khalil managed to earn nearly 1.8million Euros (£1.45m) in a year.  The sum is said to include 100,000 Euros in cash. An article in French news magazine, Le Point, claimed that Mr Proglio's wife received money from EDF's charitable foundation, while some funds were also transferred from contractors working for the energy firm. An official at the Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that Mr Proglio was facing a preliminary investigation into the allegations. But Mr Proglio, whose tenure at EDF is set to expire in November, denied channelling company cash to his wife's account. He told Le Monde newspaper: 'Where EDF is concerned, I have at no point placed pressure, either on the company or on any suppliers or contractors, to finance my wife's performances.' He admitted there had been some confusion over his wife's accounts, saying that while Ms Khalil had declared no income for 2011, tax authorities had established it at 181,122 Euros (£146,000). But Mr Proglio, who wants to continue as head of EDF, which is France's dominant power provider, and parent company to EDF Energy, one of the biggest in the UK, said this was 'ten times less than the 1.8million Euros cited.' EDF is France's dominant power provider and one of the UK's 'Big Six' firms which have been accused of greed . He also said he had repayed a 60,000 Euro sum that Ms Khalil had received from an EDF-backed association, Electra, in September 2012, before the couple were married in March 2013. 'As soon as I saw this, I took out my cheque book and reimbursed the full amount, well before this was mentioned in the Press,' he said. And he described the suggestion of the alleged 100,000 Euro cash payment as 'far-fetched'. News of the scandal came as energy suppliers including EDF Energy, a subsidiary of EDF Group, were told they needed to win back the trust of the British public and explain to customers why bills have not come down when energy prices have fallen. Industry regulator Ofgem said the 'Big Six' firms, which also comprise British Gas, nPower, E.On, Scottish Power and SSE, said customers should be told why their bills have not come down when the price suppliers pay has fallen 'significantly' after one of the mildest winters on record. Ofgem's intervention triggered fresh allegations that power firms are profiteering by raising bills as soon as costs go up, but taking their time to cut them when costs go down. EDF is to build a new nuclear power reactor in Somerset, Hinkley Point C, which it is estimated will produce seven per cent of the UK's power. MailOnline has requested a comment from EDF.","Henri Proglio, 64, under spotlight over how company funds went to his wife .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A youth crime commissioner has been suspended after admitting having a relationship with a married former Tory councillor more than twice her age. Kerry Boyd, 20, now faces being sacked after it was revealed that she had become close to father-of-two and ex Kent county councillor, Robert Burgess, 50. It is just the latest embarrassment for police in Kent:  Miss Boyd was only appointed to the publicly-funded £15,000-a-year role in March, replacing teenager Paris Brown, who was forced out last year after posting a series of offensive tweets. This morning there were calls for Miss Boyd's boss, the already notorious Kent Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), Ann Barnes, to resign. It is the latest fiasco under her watch, and Mrs Barnes herself has been criticised for overspending, behaving 'like a diva', and humiliating herself and the post with a 'toe-curling' appearance in a fly-on-the-wall television documentary. Scroll down for videos . 'Very close': Youth tsar Kerry Boyd, 20, has been suspended over her friendship with Robert Burgess, 50 . It was Mrs Barnes who told Miss Boyd, who lives with her parents in the village of Garlinge, outside Margate, to step aside after the younger woman revealed her close friendship with Mr Burgess. Miss Boyd, whom it was hoped would improve the public image of the post following the Paris Brown fiasco, was interviewed before being appointed, and given a reference by Mr Burgess. But she did not tell police chiefs about her friendship with Mr Burgess. As a result, she was told to step down while the police commissioner looked into the scandal. A spokesman for Mrs Barnes' office said they were supporting Miss Boyd 'at this difficult time' but added: 'We are concerned that Kerry did not feel able to disclose the full extent of her personal circumstances earlier... 'As part of our support for Kerry, she is not undertaking any public engagements for the time being.' As Youth Commissioner for Kent, Miss Boyd's job involved building relationships between young people and the police. Mr Burgess was a Tory councillor in Margate til he lost his seat last May, while Miss Boyd is a former head girl . A former head girl at Hartsdown Academy in Margate, she met Mr Burgess more than two years ago and was pictured with him holding an Olympic torch in 2012. Mr Burgess, who lost his seat as councillor for Margate West, told The Sun: 'I have been very close with Kerry for a period of time, a good few months... 'If she lost her job because of a friendship with me, that would be a shame.' An electronics teacher, he lives with wife Eunice, 49, in a £200,000 house in Ramsgate. Mr Burgess said Miss Boyd was 'quite upset by all the allegations and stuff going on', but said she was refusing to contact him. Today there were calls for Mrs Barnes to resign. Resignation calls: Pressure mounted on Mrs Barnes to resign today after what is the latest fiasco on her watch . Writing on Twitter, Tony Stevens said: 'Just go, Mrs Barnes', while Robert Schifreen wrote: 'It really is time for you to go now. 'It's the right thing, and you need to do it for the sake of Kent Police.' And councillor Tony Martin, of the Kent Police and Crime Panel, which will hear an explanation from Mrs Barnes at a meeting tomorrow, said: 'The general worry I have got is that it's not the first time it has happened with Ann Barnes. 'We were assured last time that this would not happen again.  It's on the back of an unflattering TV documentary last week which is reinforcing the lack of focus and detail in the office. 'That's a worrying trend.' Mr Martin added: 'I think she should be considering her position and I am sure she will be looking at herself very closely.... 'I would expect members to be briefed tomorrow on exactly what has happened.' But a source close to Mrs Barnes said: 'She is not planning to resign', adding that Mrs Barnes would appear before the Kent Police and Crime Panel tomorrow to explain her humiliating performance in last week's Channel 4 documentary. This afternoon Mrs Barnes reiterated her 'support' for Miss Boyd and said she would not say anything more before tomorrow's meeting. Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were brought in to improve relations between public and the police, and restore public faith in police. But they have been blighted by controversy from the start, and nowhere more so than in Kent. Ann Barnes became the highest profile of the country's 41 PCCs a year ago when The Mail On Sunday revealed her £15,000-a-year Youth Commissioner, Paris Brown, had posted a series of racist and homophobic comments online. Kent PCC Ann Barnes, left, and former Youth Commissioner Paris Brown, right, have both attracted criticism . Television embarrassment: The Kent Police and Crime Commissioner tries to explain her 'crime onion' Writing on Twitter shortly before she was appointed, the 17-year-old called homosexuals ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers ‘pikeys’, and said she had ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school. Kent PCC Mrs Barnes tried to save the teenager's job, but Brown was forced to quit. Earlier this year, Mrs Barnes herself was criticised for spending nearly £200,000 on moving her office less than two miles and trying to keep the cost of it hidden at a time when her force was trying to make cuts of £20million a year. The £85,000-a-year crime tsar also spent £7,500 on consultants for  advice on how to improve her 'brand', and was accused of parking her own £15,000 battle bus, which she called 'Ann Force 1', in disabled spots in a police car park. Protest: The Kent PCC was accused of humiliating herself and Kent Police after appearing on television . Then last week, Mrs Barnes was accused of embarrassing Kent Police with her toe-curling performance in a fly-on-the-wall documentary called Meet The Police Commissioner. Despite being advised not to take part, Mrs Barnes did, and was shown struggling to explain what her job was, as well as using incomprehensible management speak.  She was also filmed trying to explain what she called a 'crime onion'. Viewers took to social media, calling her 'David Brent' and saying she was humiliating herself and the police force, while a plane was flown over Maidstone, where she works, trailing a banner saying: '#annbarnesout -resign'.","Kerry Boyd, 20, became £15,000-a-year Kent Youth Commissioner in March .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Yet another violent prisoner is on the run today after escaping from a notorious open jail. Simon Rhodes-Butler, 37, who was jailed for seven years after he and an accomplice attacked a garage owner and stole his Rolex watch, is the second inmate in a matter of weeks to abscond from Ford Open Prison in Arundel, West Sussex. Police have launched a major manhunt and warned the public not to approach Rhodes-Butler, who has now been missing for a week. Today, detectives warned members of the public to call 999 immediately if they spot him. On the run: Convicted robber Simon Rhodes-Butler, 37, escaped from Ford Open Prison in Sussex a week ago . After Rhodes-Butler was convicted of robbery at Croydon Crown Court in 2011, he was transferred to Ford Open Prison, from where he went missing on 22 May. The owner of the garage targetted by Rhodes-Butler and his accomplice, Ilyas Ismail, said at their trial that he feared for his life after the pair walked in and dragged him to the ground before ripping his watch off his wrist. A police spokesman said that Rhodes-Butler, who is originally from Tottenham, north London, has family and friends in the London area and may be there. Sussex Police also appealed for the public’s help in finding violent raider Kevin Brown, 54, who disappeared from Ford Prison last month. He was serving a life sentence imposed at the Old Bailey in 2007 for conspiracy to rob and firearms offences. The manhunt for Rhodes-Butler was launched a day after Michael Wheatley, the serial armed robber known as the skullcracker, admitted holding up the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, four days after absconding from an open prison in Kent. Rhodes-Butler is the second prisoner to walk out of Ford Open Prison, pictured, in recent weeks . Yesterday, Wheatley was handed his 14th life sentence at Guildford Crown Court. PC Steve Reed said: 'We have been looking for Rhodes-Butler for a week but without success so far. 'We need to speak to anyone who might have an idea where he could be or where he has been staying.  If you have any information please contact us.' Last weekend, machete-wielding thug, Lewis Powter, 30, escaped from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk. Powter, who has a tattoo of Dennis the Menace on his right arm, was jailed in 2007 after he used a 3ft knife to slash open the arm of his sister's former boyfriend. He was jailed and given an indeterminate sentence after psychiatric and probation reports concluded that he posed a 'medium to high' risk to the public. Lewis Powter, 30, left, and Paul Oddysses, 49, right, are both on the run from an open prison in Suffolk . He was the second prisoner to go on the run from Hollesley Bay in less than 48 hours. Paul Oddysses, 49, who is serving a life sentence for attempted robbery and robbery with a firearm, absconded last Saturday lunchtime.  He has a scar on the back of his head and tattoos on both arms, and has connections to Hertfordshire and Essex. A third inmate, Wayne McLeod, 36, escaped from Springhill open prison in Buckinghamshire between on Sunday evening. Thames Valley Police did not reveal why he was in jail, but said he may now be in Reading, Berkshire.","Simon Rhodes-Butler, 37, from Tottenham, went missing last Thursday .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Harriet Arkell . A retired British couple who attempted to take their own lives have been extradited to the US to face fraud charges, Scotland Yard said today. Grandparents Paul and Sandra Dunham were handed over to US Marshals at Heathrow Terminal Four by officers from the Metropolitan Police’s Extradition Unit. They left on a flight that departed around 2.15pm, police confirmed. The couple, both 58, were remanded in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday after Senior District Judge Howard Riddle concluded they had take a drugs overdose to avoid or delay their extradition. Charges: Paul and Sandra Dunham, from Northampton, have been extradited to the US, police confirmed . House: The Dunhams were found by police officers at their detached home in Northampton last week . This morning their solicitors, extradition specialists Kaim Todner, confirmed the couple were set to be extradited to Maryland. It is understood Mr Dunham, who is accused of over-claiming £600,000 expenses from an American firm, is in Wandsworth prison, while Mrs Dunham, who is accused of aiding and abetting, is in HMP Holloway. The couple lost a High Court battle last month against extradition to stand trial over fraud charges relating to Mr Dunham’s company, Pace. The failed High Court case heard Mr . Dunham had suffered several mini-strokes and mental health problems, and . Mrs Dunham was suffering from depression. Mr Dunham, who was chief executive, president and a 20 per cent shareholder in the American company, which manufactured soldering irons for the electronics industry, was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland, in December 2011. Mrs Dunham is accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him. The couple deny any wrongdoing. Search: Journalists expecting the Dunhams to give a statement called police when they did not appear . Court: The British couple were rushed to hospital after they were overdosed on medication at home last week . Journalists due to take a statement outside the Dunhams’ property in Northampton last Thursday alerted police when the couple did not answer the door. Officers forced the door open and contacted paramedics, who arrived in two ambulances and took the couple to Northampton General Hospital, where they spent the night. The couple, who have five grandchildren, said they attempted the suicide pact after being told Theresa May had cancelled a planned meeting with their MP Andrea Leadsom. The case has caused anger over the use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for trial for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute. The couple’s solicitor, Karen Todner, said she believed the extradition would happen today, and criticised the British government for allowing it. She added: . 'Mr and Mrs Dunham are a hard-working couple from Northamptonshire who . strenuously deny the allegations against them. Nevertheless, this . country is forcibly sending them to America to face trial in a justice . system where plea arrangements are effectively forced upon people. Controversy: The Dunhams' case has caused anger over the use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for what some say is a civil case . 'I understand David Cameron has recently stated that the Abu Hamza conviction shows that we ought to be extraditing people to America with greater expedition. 'What in fact this case shows is that Mr Abu Hamza should have stood trial in the United Kingdom and faced British justice. 'How many people like Mr and Mrs Dunham have to be extradited before this Government will uphold the promises they made whilst in opposition to change this treaty with America?' Last week, Mr Dunham spoke from his hospital bed of his despair at being taken to America. He said: ‘White collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain, so... somewhere down the line someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain. 'We could easily be in the U.S. for six or eight years, [meaning] we would return to the UK in our mid-sixties, with no money, no jobs and no home.

"By . Harriet Arkell . Alexander Cameron's attempt to halt a fraud trial by saying legal aid cuts meant the defendants wouldn't get a fair trial has failed . A judge's decision to throw out a multimillion-pound fraud trial after defendants said they couldn't afford adequate representation has been overturned by the Court of Appeal. The Prime Minister's barrister brother, Alexander Cameron QC, had successfully argued that the £5million scam case should be thrown out because of legal aid reforms introduced by his sibling's government. He said that controversial Ministry of Justice (MoJ) reforms meant the five defendants could not find barristers of 'sufficient competence', and the case was halted at the beginning of this month. But today three judges quashed the ruling, insisting that the trial go ahead. Their decision came after City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) urged Lord Justice Leveson, Lord Justice Davis, and Lord Justice Treacy to overturn the decision taken by Judge Anthony Leonard at London's Southwark Crown Court on 1 May. The trial, which involves the alleged mis-selling of land to members of the public, is a so-called Very High Cost Case (VHCC).  The government has cut fees for such long and complex cases by 30 per cent for barristers and solicitors. Judge Leonard had said that adjourning the case til next year, as requested by the prosecution, would clog up the courts and would not help the defendants find lawyers to represent them.  As a result, he ruled, they would not be guaranteed a fair trial, and so he ordered that the case be 'stayed'. However the FCA appealed his decision, arguing that the judge 'erred in principle' and 'came to an unreasonable decision'. Today, Sir Brian said he and his fellow judges agreed, saying: 'This ruling does involve errors of law or principle and, in any event, was not reasonable'. If the appeal had failed, the defendants - Scott Crawley, Dale Walker, Daniel Forsyth, Aaron Petrou and Brendan Daley, who are charged with conspiracy to defraud - would have been acquitted. Sir Brian said: 'During the course of the hearing, we . made it clear that the dispute between the Bar and the Lord Chancellor . about the appropriate level of remuneration for VHCCs was not one in . which we could, or should, become involved. The trial, involving an alleged £5million property scam, will now go ahead at London's Southwark Crown Court . Sir Brian Leveson said the original judge's decision to halt the multi-million pound trial was erroneous . 'It involves a commercial negotiation in which, short of legal challenge, the judiciary can play no part.' After the ruling, the FCA said it 'welcomed' the Court of Appeal's decision. Alex . Cameron QC, who is representing seven defendants free of charge, argued . that his legally aided clients could not find barristers 'of sufficient . competence'. The case involves Scott Crawley, . 35, who is said to have masterminded a £5million scam between 2008 and 2011 . through the firms Plott UK, European Property Investments (EPI) and . Stirling Alexander. He is accused alongside Daniel . Forsyth, 30, Ross Peters, 27, Aaron Petrou, 46, Ricky Mitchie, 24, Adam . Hawkins, 28, and Brendan Daley, 38, of conspiracy to defraud. The . eighth defendant, solicitor Dale Walker, 53, is facing fraud charges . and an allegation of money laundering in relation to the case. The . charges arose out of Operation Cotton, a Financial Conduct Authority . investigation into the activities of the land banking firms. Legal aid costs about £2billion a year, half of which goes on criminal defence with the other half going to civil cases including mental health, asylum and family law. Last year, the government cut fees for legal aid in Very High Costs Cases (VHCCs) by 30 per cent, and fees for other Crown Court work by up to 18 per cent. This sparked a series of protests from the legal profession, with opponents arguing that complex cases need experienced lawyers (with fees to match) and saying the cuts will affect defendants' right to a fair trial. Opposition: Cutting the annual £2billion legal aid bill sparked a wave of protests from angry lawyers . However, recent figures released under the Freedom of Information act showed that 20 of the highest-paid legal aid barristers in England and Wales shared nearly £8.5m for defending alleged criminals unable to fund their own defences. The Ministry of Justice has defended its decision to cut costs, saying: 'We have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world. 'We have reduced the cost of a small number of the longest running criminal cases by 30 per cent - just one of these cases recently cost more than £8 million in legal aid. 'We want to ensure the limited money we have for legal aid is concentrated on those cases and people who need it most.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . With his Soviet-style military hat and an assault rifle in his hand, Steve Hedley looks every inch the rightful successor to his firebrand friend, the late RMT boss, Bob Crow. Mr Hedley, who as the union's assistant general secretary is one of five candidates declared so far for his late friend's position in charge of the Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport workers, pulls no punches about his far-left positioning. His Facebook page is filled with status updates glorifying Tube strikes, with one post reading: 'It's taken me three hours to drive eight miles: mission accomplished, gridlock achieved, victory to the RMT.' Gun-toting militant: RMT assistant general secretary, Steve Hedley, is a contender for the union leadership . Strike-happy: Transport chiefs fear London may face further, and worse, strikes if Mr Hedley gets his way . Another post exhorts his 2,000-plus friends not to cross the picket line in last week's Tube strike, saying: 'If you are on our side then respect our picket lines, if you are on the Government's side you will cross the pickets and be remembered as the 21st century UDM scabs and class traitors. 'Support yourself by supporting the RMT strike.  DON'T CROSS PICKET LINES.' And yet another post, which he later took down, read: 'With three different strikes announced today, I think I'll enjoy the Easter weekend.' Further posts glorify striking RMT members, while another attacked 'Dave' [sic] Miliband, saying: 'Wake up and smell the coffee, the Labour Party is well and truly over.  Vote TUSC and build a workers' party.' And in another post, later taken down, Mr Hedley, who is from East Ham, in east London, wrote: 'I've had to move down the carriage to escape a load of middle-class prats and their mockney accents. 'Posh people really shouldn't deliberately drop their H's in an attempt to pretend they are something they clearly are not.' Mr Hedley, left, pictured with the late RMT boss, Bob Crow, is one of five candidates for the job declared so far . Don't you mean Ed?  Mr Hedley's Facebook page tells Labour that the party 'is well and truly over' After the former Israeli leader Ariel Sharon died, Mr Hedley wrote: 'Thatcher will have company in hell tonight as another war criminal snuffs it'. Meanwhile photographs on his Facebook page support the image of him as a hard-left politician. One picture shows him and Mr Crow grinning at the camera, with Mr Hedley raising his clenched fist in the universal symbol of industrial workers, while another shows him smirking in front of the Kremlin, . Transport bosses are said to fear a strike-happy militant like Mr Hedley succeeding in his ambition to lead the RMT into a new era following the death of Mr Crow in March. They believe if the radical unionist becomes the new general secretary of the RMT, it can only mean further disruption for the capital. 'DON'T CROSS PICKET LINES': The union member's Facebook page shows he is a keen supporter of strikes . Last week's 48-hour Tube strike, organised by the RMT, brought chaos to London as trains were cancelled and stations closed. Union . members were complaining about planned closures of ticket office, where . fewer than three per cent of all Tube journeys begin. A . second, three-day strike had been planned for this week, but was called . off at the last minute yesterday after last-ditch talks with the . conciliation service Acas. London . Mayor Boris Johnson, who had damned last week's strike as 'pointless', . described the cancelling of the strike, which was due to take hold . today, as 'a victory for commonsense and for Londoners'. Mr Hedley is one of five RMT members to have put their names forward for the job left vacant by Crow, who has been described as 'moderate by RMT standards'. The others are uncompromising hardliner, John Leach, senior acting general secretary, Mick Cash, former union president Alex Gordon, and the RMT's national organising coordinator, Alan Pottage. Nominations close in July and the result will be announced in September. Grant Shapps, Conservative party chairman said: 'The line-up of challengers for the job of RMT leader is alarming. 'Mick Cash, who is considered to be a 'moderate' when compared with the rest, held commuters to ransom and did untold damage to our economy last week on flimsy grounds. 'Or imagine a world with Stephen Hedley in charge - a man who revels in inconveniencing the British public. 'It's a disgrace, and it's high time Ed Miliband stood up to the union bosses who sponsor several of his own MPs. Today Mr Hedley denied being a 'communist' or anti-middle class, and played down his comment about enjoying the Easter weekend after strikes were announced. He told the Evening Standard: 'I meant nothing by that - I was just looking forward to the Easter weekend when I go to church.' And referring to pictures of him wearing a Soviet-style hat and posing by the Kremlin, he said: 'I am no communist... I dressed up for a laugh.' No-one from the RMT was available for comment.

"By . Harriet Arkell . TV watchdogs have rapped Channel 5 for letting Celebrity Big Brother housemates talk about their sexual experiences and make 'rude food' while children were watching. Housemates were shown discussing their first sexual encounters while Linda Nolan boasted about having 'loads of sex with other men' during an edition of the reality TV show. Made In Chelsea's Ollie Locke and The Apprentice's Luisa Zissman made breasts and penises from dough during the same programme, first screened at 9.45pm on January 18 and then repeated at 11.30am the following day. Scroll down for video . Makers of Celebrity Big Brother were rapped for an episode in which Linda Nolan openly discussed her sex life . 'Mildly risqué: CBB housemates Ollie Locke and Luisa Zissman were shown making rude shapes out of dough . Ofcom found that the programme had breached the rule that children must be protected by appropriate scheduling from unsuitable material. Its ruling said: 'The cumulative effect of the humorous references to a penis and the use of sexual innuendos, together with the frank discussions on the topic of sexual experiences, resulted in an inappropriate, and prominent, sexual theme and adult tone. 'We therefore considered the material was unsuitable for children.' The industry watchdog said viewing figures showed that, from a total audience of 290,000 viewers, 33,500 viewers had been aged 16 or under. This meant that children made up 12 per cent of the audience. Meanwhile the offending show was watched by 8,800 children aged between four and nine. Ofcom said the sexual material was not explicit and it was 'humorous in intent', but added that the content 'required more careful editing before broadcasting at 11.30 on a Sunday morning.' Rude jokes: Ofcom criticised Channel 5 for not warning parents of the episode's unsuitable content . There had been no advance warning to help parents wishing to protect children from unsuitable material, the watchdog's ruling said. It went on: 'We considered that these factors resulted in this material being inconsistent with audience expectations for the content broadcast on this public service channel at 11:30 at a weekend. 'We therefore concluded the material was not appropriately scheduled and the broadcast was in breach of the rule.' A Channel 5 spokesman said that 'Cheeky conversation, rude language and mildly sexually suggestive innuendos' should be expected in pre-watershed broadcasts. The episode had been checked before being broadcast on the Sunday morning after some content had been removed or 'bleeped.' He said the 'rude food' scenes had been only 'mildly risqué,' and the sexual discussions were 'not explicit, highly charged or erotic.' But he said: 'We accept that, in hindsight, it may have been prudent to have ensured that an appropriate flagging was aired prior to the daytime repeat.'","Ofcom said the reality show had breached rule about unsuitable material .

"By . Harriet Arkell . An ancient cottage which is being restored will not be given a traditional thatched roof because of fears it may be attacked by arsonists from a nearby council estate. The Grade II-listed Victoria Cottage in Hull's Lowgate dates back to the late 17th century, when it had a thatched roof, and is currently undergoing a painstaking facelift by the Buildings At Risk Trust. But because it lies just a few streets away from the notorious Bransholme estate, it will be given a new roof of clay tiles rather than flammable thatch because of the trust's fears it might be set alight. Picturesque: Victoria Cottage in Hull is being restored but it won't have a thatch roof because of arsonists . Nearby: The Bransholme Estate covers 80 acres of north-eastern Hull and is home to more than 31,000 people . Too close for comfort: The 17th century Victoria Cottage lies close to the sprawling Bransholme estate . Originally, planning permission was granted to give the brick-built cottage a thatched roof after research showed that's what it had when it was built. But the trust, which hopes to turn the old building into two homes, decided that its proximity to Bransholme, one of the largest housing estates in Europe, ruled out investing in thatch. The trust has submitted a new planning application to Hull City Council seeking permission to re-roof the cottage in clay pantiles instead. They wrote: 'While it is disappointing to have to consider the locality of the Bransholme estate as a factor, it is a concern which many passing local residents have informally discussed during the repair programme.' The application goes on: 'Existing consent has been obtained to re-cover the main property’s roof in thatch... [but] it has become a concern that it may be inappropriate to reinstate this covering, primarily due to fears of an enhanced fire hazard. 'The properties front the road and because the construction is fundamentally single storey, the thatch with its required overhang of the wall plate would be within easy reach of a passer-by. The Buildings At Risk Trust is seeking listed building consent to re-roof it with less flammable clay tiles . Hull was badly damaged by bombs in the Second World War and there was an urgent need to rehome people . The trust fears that arsonists from the nearby estate might be tempted to set fire to the roof if it were thatched . 'It is of considerable concern that this might present an enhanced passive fire hazard, for example from a discarded cigarette, or perhaps of more concern, an allurement to someone to attempt to light the thatch.' The Trust said that if 'In the future, the situation is perceived to have changed', the roof could be recovered in thatch. Built in the 1960s and 1970s, after slum clearance in the bomb-ravaged city, the Bransholme estate covers more than 80 acres on the north-eastern fringes of Hull and is home to more than 31,000 people. Picturesque: Victoria Cottage dates back more than 300 years and originally had a thatched roof . The estate has two secondary schools, several primary schools and two shopping centres, as well as a large cinema, bowling alley and restaurant complex. Last week, police said they were fighting a huge rise in crime on the estate, with overall crime rising more than 14 per cent in the past year.  This included a 51 per cent increase in thefts from cars and a 70 per cent increase in shed and garage burglaries. In 2011, Bransholme residents said they were living in fear after a spate of arson attacks, one of which tore through six homes, forcing 20 residents, including small children, to flee their homes.","Listed Victoria Cottage in Lowgate, Hull, dates back more than 300 years .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Two men convicted of plotting to murder singer Joss Stone, 27, have had their sentences cut after a legal challenge . Two men convicted of plotting to rob and kill international pop star Joss Stone have had their jail terms cut after winning an appeal against the length of their sentences. Junior Bradshaw, 33, had his 18-year sentence cut to ten years by three Court of Appeal judges in London, while Kevin Liverpool, 36, who was originally given life with a minimum term of ten years and eight months, had his minimum reduced to six-and-a-half years. As a result, Bradshaw, who with Liverpool was found guilty of conspiring to murder the 27-year-old singer last year, could be free in as little as five years' time. The pair, of Longsight, Manchester, were convicted of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to rob following a three-week trial at Exeter Crown Court. They drove from Manchester to Miss Stone’s home in mid-Devon with an arsenal of weapons to rob and kill her. When the pair were sentenced, Judge Francis Gilbert, the Recorder of Exeter, branded Liverpool a danger to the public, and said he targeted Miss Stone to get more than £1million from her. He told him: 'You intended to rob her and kill her and dump her body in the river, according to your words, and then leave the country with your accomplice, Junior Bradshaw. 'You had no reason to target her except that she was a wealthy young woman as she was a successful singer.' Liverpool and Bradshaw had scouted Miss Stone’s home and were on their way to attack her armed with a sword, three knives, two hammers, masks, gloves and a hosepipe when they were arrested in Cullompton in June 2011. Suspicious residents had called the police, having spotted their badly-damaged Fiat Punto in the area. The pair told police they were lost and were trying to get to Bristol, but officers became wary and discovered the weapons in the boot. Giving the ruling of the court, Mr Justice Bean said Liverpool’s appealed life sentence still held. Junior Bradshaw, 33, left, and Kevin Liverpool, 36, successfully appealed against the length of their jail terms . Lawyers for the pair had argued that their 'clumsy and badly-planned' conspiracy was not serious enough to qualify Liverpool for a life sentence. But the judges rejected this, saying Liverpool's life sentence 'was justified', and that he 'poses a high risk of serious harm to the public'. Taking into account the 22 months spent in custody before sentencing, Liverpool now becomes eligible to apply for parole in December 2017, but the judges stressed that 'we are not ordering that the appellant be released in December 2017'. Mr Justice Bean said: 'Far from it. The significance of the minimum term is that it specifies that the Parole Board will only be able to consider for the first time in late 2017 whether the appellant can safely be released.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . The average asking price for a property has reached a record high of £272,003 after a hike of nearly nine per cent in the past year . Asking prices went up by £9,409, or 3.6 per cent, between April to May - the biggest ever monthly leap, while the annual rise of 8.9 per cent crept close to the 10.4 per cent seen in October 2007. As ever, London led the way, with a 16.3 per cent year-on-year increase, compared with a more modest 4.9 per cent in the rest of the country.  This suggested that the feared house price bubble had not stretched beyond the capital, Rightmove said. Asking prices have soared nearly nine per cent in a year as demand outstrips supply, according to Rightmove . Average asking price 2014: In the coastal village of Hest Bank, Lancashire, Fisher Wrathall is selling this five-bedroom house for £275,000 - ten years ago, the house next door was sold for £119,000 . The average asking price in London is up by nearly £80,000 so far in 2014, or £4,405 a week, compared with £1,521 a week for the rest of the country. Ten out of 32 London boroughs saw annual rises of more than 20 per cent, with a 43 per cent increase in Tower Hamlets driven by cash buyers and investors in Canary Wharf and neighbouring areas. Rightmove said that across the country demand remained strong, and still outstripped supply. An increase in new sellers earlier in the year was reversed in May as the number of homes being put up for sale fell by one per cent compared with April - a drop most likely explained by bank holidays affecting activity. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said: 'The lack of fresh choice will frustrate buyers and lessen their negotiating power in popular locations as pent-up demand continues to be released.' The figures come after fears of an overheating housing market failed to persuade the Bank of England to raise interest rates, with governor Mark Carney dampening expectations of an early hike. London Property Zone is offering this one-bedroom flat here in Colindale, north west London, for £274,900 . The one-bedroom flat in Colindale is offered at £274,900 - six years ago a similar flat there sold for £244,950 . Policy makers have said they will use other tools first, if needed, to cool the property market, before turning to this 'last line of defence'. Earlier this month, the Bank's deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe warned that surging house prices could pose the biggest danger to the country's financial stability and it was the brightest of the 'blinking warning lights' of risk facing the UK. Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has also recently sounded a warning that action may be needed to cool the market, calling for curbs on the Government's Help to Buy scheme.","Asking prices record biggest ever monthly leap of 3.6 per cent (£9,409)

"By . Harriet Arkell . Wearing a battered denim jacket and with her long hair unbrushed, Cressida Bonas cut a glum figure as she walked through London's West End this morning. Pictured for the first time since news of her split from Prince Harry, her boyfriend of two years, was confirmed, the 25-year-old kept her head down as she bought a takeaway fruit drink. The dancer, who is currently working for a marketing company in Soho after graduating from dance school, is now said to want to concentrate on her career. Scroll down for video . Cressida Bonas looked glum as she walked in London the day after her split from Prince Harry was confirmed . Miss Bonas had rings under her eyes and appeared tired as she walked through central London this morning . Single again: The dancer kept her hands in her pockets as she went to a West End cafe to buy a fruit smoothie . The end of her relationship with the Prince, who will be 30 in September, came after rumours that it has become strained in recent weeks. US magazine People claimed that Miss Bonas had become 'too needy' for the royal, but friends of the couple denied that, saying it was 'very much an amicable' split and that the couple had parted as friends. A friend of theirs told the Mail: 'Cressida has decided she wants to focus on her career and Harry is really keen that she is allowed to get on with her life. ‘He is furious at this suggestion that the split was in any way because she was relying too much on him. Cressida is one of the most independent people he knows.’ Miss Bonas graduated from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich, and is now said to be working out which career path to follow. Wearing a black dress, black tights despite the heat, and a hoodie under her denim jacket, she looked lost in her thoughts this morning. Friends said it was 'very much an amicable split', with both Miss Bonas and Prince Harry keen to stay friends . The famously relaxed dance school graduate wore a denim jacket and messy hair as she visited a London cafe . All over: Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas have broken up after a two-year relationship . Lost in thought: Miss Bonas was introduced to Prince Harry by Princess Eugenie in the summer of 2012 . Another friend said that the couple's split might turn out to be temporary, as happened with Kate  Middleton and Prince William before they got engaged. The friend said: 'Cressie is only 25 and pretty young for her age at that. Prince Harry will be 30 this year and is at a different stage in his life. 'He is incredibly fond of Cressie, and understands that she wants to do something with her life and with her career before she considers settling down. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if they got back together in a few months' time.’ Going it alone: Reports that the couple had split because Miss Bonas was 'too needy' were denied by friends . Hoping for a text?  Miss Bonas kept her iPhone close at hand as she left the central London cafe today . Her ex-boyfriend and Prince William are believed to be heading to Tennessee this weekend to attend the wedding of their close friend, Guy Pelly. He is marrying American-born Lizzy Wilson and is said to have asked the princes to be ushers. Prince Harry and Miss Bonas met in the summer of 2012 after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, and their relationship appeared to have stepped up a gear earlier just a month ago, when they appeared together at a charity engagement in Wembley - the first time Miss Bonas attended an official engagement with the prince. Royal sources quashed speculation of an imminent engagement after the couple were seen embracing at the event. But friends of Miss Bonas suggested that her wealthy family had held a summit to discuss the possibility of a royal wedding. When Prince William and his girlfriend of four years, Kate Middleton, were pictured looking grumpy at the Cheltenham festival in March 2007, it was obvious something was up. A few days later William, then 25, was pictured at a nightclub near his barracks in Bournemouth in a pose that suggested he was groping a young Brazlian clubber, Ana Ferreira. The writing was on the wall, and the prince and his university sweetheart took their last outing together at the end of March, to an Oxfordshire pub with their friends, the Van Cutsems. William and Kate looked glum as they left a nightclub in London in January 2007, weeks before they split . By the time Kate flew out to Dublin with her mother on 3 April, it was all over.  Devastated, she threw herself into the reason for her visit: attending an exhibition with her mother, followed by a tour of the National Gallery of Ireland. Her former boyfriend, however, chose to cope differently.  He went out to Mahiki nightclub where fellow revellers said he jumped onto a table, shouted 'I'm free', and then did a Peter Crouch-style robot dance. News of their split broke the next day. Definitely single: This picture of Prince William and Brazilian reveller Ana Ferreira, left, was taken in Bournemouth nightclub in March 2007 . Determined not to let her heartbreak show, Kate was pictured attending numerous parties, including a roller disco where she was pictured in yellow hotpants.  She was also seen in bunny ears at a DVD launch party. William soon realised where his heart lay, and in June invited Kate to a party at his barracks.  She spent the night with him, and a month later attended the concert in honour of Princess Diana as William's guest. Three years later, during which time Kate was dubbed 'Waity Katey', they got engaged, and they married on 29 April 2011.","Miss Bonas looks solemn as she walks through the West End this morning .

"By . James Chapman . and Matt Chorley . Angela Merkel made a passionate plea for Britain not to quit the EU yesterday but suggested David Cameron can hope to achieve only limited reform before a referendum. The German Chancellor used a visit to London to back the Prime Minister’s calls for a clampdown on EU migrants’ right to claim benefits and indicated the UK and non-eurozone countries could win concessions as the eurozone integrates further. But she warned she would disappoint British calls for her to commit now to fundamental reform of the EU – and dodged any promise of the full-scale treaty changes. Scroll down for video . German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear to David Cameron that British demands for fundamental reform of the EU would not be met . Mr Cameron had seen Mrs Merkel as key ally in his hopes of clawing back powers from Brussels . After a speech, lunch and press conference, Mrs Merkel travelled to Buckingham Palace for a meeting with the Queen . Mrs Merkel claimed she was ‘caught . between the devil and the deep blue sea’, with some countries demanding . massive changes and others insisting Europe must not ‘pay almost any . price’ to keep Britain in the union. But . accommodating Britain’s demands could be done, she said. Mrs Merkel was . treated like a visiting monarch as she called on Mr Cameron in Downing . Street. The . government rolled out the red carpet for Mrs Merkel, whose support is seen as pivotal to Mr Cameron’s hopes . of securing reform of Brussels. She was afforded the . rare honour of making a speech to both Houses of Parliament, gathered . together in the Lords, and later visited the Queen at Buckingham Palace. StarterBeetroot and goat's curd salad with citrus dressing . MainRoast fillet of Newlyn stone bass with potatoes, broccoli and beans; . DessertFruit and ice cream dessert. In her address, she suggested Britain could not expect to be treated as . a special case and warned those expecting her to promise a fundamental . shake-up of the EU at this stage would be disappointed. However, . she was more positive when asked in Downing Street whether she would . support Mr Cameron’s attempts to negotiate a looser, more trade-based . relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum the Tories have . committed to holding in 2017 if they are still in power. ‘I . firmly believe that what we are discussing here is feasible, is . doable,’ she said after a 90-minute meeting over lunch in the Prime . Minister’s Downing Street flat. ‘Where there’s a will there’s a way.’ There was plenty of space between the two leaders as they posed for this photograph, later tweeted by the Prime Minister . German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted Europe does need to reform but she would disappoint many demands from Britain . Mrs Merkel addressed MPs and peers from both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster . British Prime Minister David Cameron: 'We need fundamental, far-reaching change.'(January 2013) Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel: 'I have heard some expect my speech to pave for a fundamental . reform of the European architecture which will satisfy all kinds of . alleged or actual British wishes. I am afraid they are in for a . disappointment.' (February 2014) She . also suggested that she agreed freedom of movement rules should be . amended to restrict rights to claim benefits, saying it was wrong that a . new immigrant could claim the same level of handouts as people who had . paid into the system for several years. ‘That . would not be the interpretation of freedom of movement that I would . have,’ she said. ‘That is just as much of a headache for us in Germany . as it is for the British people.’ She . suggested she was ready to agree reforms that would mean new rights for . countries who are not members of the single currency. ‘If . one wants Britain to remain in the European Union – which is what I . want – if one at the same time wants a competitive union... one can find . common solutions.’ However, Mrs Merkel warned Mr Cameron that it would not be a ‘piece of cake’ for changes to be agreed across the EU. She . also said that Germany was grateful to Britain for placing trust in her . country following the Second World War and ‘the break in civilisation’ represented by the Holocaust. Speaking . in the anniversary year of the outbreak of the First World War, she . said: ‘This is a special year of commemoration for Britain, where you . remember your dead, your losses and the untold suffering that Germany . brought through these wars to you. ‘As German Chancellor, I bow my head before the victims of these horrible wars.’ Prime Minister David Cameron smiled during the speech, but there was little sign of a major breakthrough in his demands for reform. Picture (left to right) Foreign Secretary William Hague, Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley, Labour leader Ed Miliband, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Cameron . Mrs Merkel insisted she wanted Britain to remain in the EU, but would disappoint those wanting fundamental reform . Eurosceptic . Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said: ‘What Angela Merkel said came as . no surprise. She wasn’t going to suddenly offer a whole load of . concessions. ‘What’s . important is how good relations are between David Cameron and Angela . Merkel. He has vetoed a treaty, promised an in/out referendum, cut the . EU budget against everyone’s wishes, and still Angela Merkel comes over . here and is extremely friendly and positive.’ Tory . MP John Baron, another Eurosceptic, was less convinced, saying: ‘She . made it clear the direction of travel is “more Europe” – closer economic . and political integration.’ The lavish reception for Mrs Merkel was in stark contrast to the welcome given to French President Francois Hollande last month. On . a windswept RAF base, Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande publicly disagreed . about the need for EU reform before heading for a low key lunch at a . village pub. Mr Hollande . said giving the British people a say on leaving the European Union was . 'not urgent' and insisted he would do little to assist Mr Cameron's push . for reform. 'We feel that revising the Treaty is not a priority for the time being,’ Mr Hollande added. French President Francois Hollande insisted reforming Europe was 'not urgent' during an awkward meeting with Mr Cameron. The two men later endured a low key pub lunch but the Frenchman appeared to want a . quick getaway . Douglas . Alexander, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman, said: ‘Chancellor . Merkel’s remarks have confirmed that David Cameron’s approach to Europe . just isn’t working.’ But Labour MP Austin Mitchell said Mrs Merkel has also created a big problem for Labour. It . was clear, he said, that the choice for Britain was to ‘join the euro . and central group or be relegated to periphery’. ‘Miliband can’t accept . either,’ he added.","German Chancellor delivers major speech to both Houses of Parliament .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Jack Doyle . and James Slack . Samantha Cameron was named on an application form for her nanny to become a British citizen, Downing Street has revealed. Prime Minister David Cameron had faced questions about his role in the application of Gita Lima, after the new Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire attacked the ‘wealthy metropolitan elite’ who relied cheap labour for help at home. But in a statement Number 10 said the couple wrote no supporting letter for the move to obtain a British passport, and Samantha Cameron alone was named as her employer. Samantha Cameron was named on the application of the Downing Street nanny Gita Lima, it has emerged . The row erupted after the new . immigration minister, James Brokenshire, said uncontrolled immigration . benefited has benefited the middle classes but forced down wages for the . less well-off. Mr Brokenshire's comments backfired after critics pointed out that the Prime . Minister currently employs a nanny from Nepal and previously hired an . Australian. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also admitted hiring a Belgian ‘lady’ as a ‘home help’. Labour MP John Mann demanded that the whole Cabinet come clean on their use of foreign workers. Gita Lima has been nanny for the Prime Minister's children for several years . ‘We need every Cabinet minister to declare what staff they have employed from abroad,’ he said. ‘They should be seeking out British staff. It is total hypocrisy. They need to make up their minds on this.’ Downing Street last night defended his decision not to hire UK-born staff. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We have always said we want people who want to work hard and get on. Do we want the brightest and the best? Yes we do. 'And that would absolutely include, for example, Mr and Mrs Cameron's nanny as someone who wants to work hard and get on. 'As a result of coming to this country and working hard and getting on, she is now a British citizen.' In a statement released tonight, Number 10 made clear that the PM had not written a supporting letter for Miss Lima's application or been involved in any way. A Number 10 spokesman said: “Mr and Mrs Cameron’s nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny’s application for British citizenship. The normal application process was followed throughout. 'As is usual, Mrs Cameron was named on her application as her employer.' In his first speech in the job, Mr . Brokenshire told the Demos think-tank: ‘The immigration system we . inherited was not designed to benefit this country or the people who . live here. ‘For too long, . the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply . of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap . tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of . this country. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg admitted hiring a Belgian 'lady' as a 'home help' ‘Those who tend to lose out most when there is uncontrolled immigration are manual and low-skilled workers who have to compete with an influx of people from poorer countries who are willing to work for less.’ The row erupted after the new immigration minister, James Brokenshire, said uncontrolled immigration benefited only the 'wealthy metropolitan elite' who wanted cheap labour . Downing Street refused to answer any questions about Mr Cameron’s nanny. But it is understood Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha employ a Nepalese woman, Gita Lima. She was recruited from a charity, Kalayaan, which helps immigrants seeking to escape abusive employers. Originally from Nepal, she is now a British national. A second woman, Australian Sammi Strange, has looked after Mr Cameron’s children in the past. Mr Clegg was asked about his arrangements on his regular LBC radio phone-in. He insisted he would not ‘get into’ details of his home life but later told listeners: ‘I have a lady who has a Belgian passport who helps us.’ The Home Office said Mr Brokenshire ‘manages the household with his wife’ and does not employ a nanny or cleaner. In his speech, the Immigration Minister attacked the BBC for giving huge prominence to a report about the impact of mass immigration on the jobs market – without having read it. The BBC’s Newsnight had claimed the study by civil servants would undermine the Tory party’s case for stricter border controls. In fact, when the previously secret report was published yesterday it said that officials found that some British workers had been ‘losers’. The group hardest hit was ‘low-skilled natives’. The study – written jointly by the Home Office and Business Department – said: ‘Overall, our assessment is that there is relatively little evidence that migration has caused statistically significant displacement of UK natives from the labour market in periods when the economy has been strong. ‘However, in line with some recent studies, there is evidence for some labour market displacement in recent years when the economy was in recession.’ Mr Brokenshire said the study vindicated Conservative claims that immigration had damaged the job prospects of unemployed Britons, particularly those looking for low-skilled jobs.","Row erupted after immigration .

"By . Daniel Martin . and Matt Chorley . Theresa May's claims about the effects of immigration have been called into question . Theresa May’s claims about the effects of immigration have been called into question by secret government research, it was reported last night. David Cameron is said to have prevented the publication of an internal report, completed in November, which suggests that the impact of migration on British jobs is 'virtually nil'. The BBC’s Newsnight programme claimed it had not been published because the effect of immigration on unemployment was much smaller than Mrs May has previously claimed. The Home Secretary has in the past cited research by the Migration Advisory Committee, a group of independent academics, as a basis for saying that ‘for every additional 100 immigrants... 23 British workers would not be employed’. But the new analysis by civil servants is understood to show that the impact of so-called ‘displacement’ is much less stark. Internal emails seen by Newsnight showed that one civil servant described the MAC research used by Mrs May was ‘not robust enough given the wider evidence’. One civil servant said in an email that the study should be published - something Mr Cameron has so far refused to do. ‘It would be difficult to keep the report solely for internal use,’ he wrote. Critics say Mr Cameron has blocked the report’s publication because it shows the Home Secretary’s claims to be hollow. But others say it is unsurprising that the displacement rate is now lower than it was in 2012, because last year 87 per cent of new jobs went to British people. The Conservatives were embarrassed last week when figures showed that its pledge to reduce net migration to below 100,000 people a year by 2015 was unlikely to be met. Last night Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert said: ‘It’s obvious that this report should be published as quickly as possible. Critics say Mr Cameron has blocked the report's publication because the Home Secretary's claims are hollow . ‘The best available data shows we benefit very substantially from immigration. The real question is why David Cameron is trying to block this. ‘We have to have the right figures to make the right decisions.’ Tory MP Stephen Barclay said: ‘The data is evolving. It’s basically not true that the impact is minimal. There has been a very heavy localised impact.’ A government spokesman said: ‘Reducing immigration so our economy delivers for people who want to work hard and play by the rules is part of our long-term economic plan. We don’t comment on internal government documents.’ Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip were united in calling for the report to be published. Last night Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron and Theresa May now need to publish this report today. ‘The British people should have information made available to them so they can make a judgement about the impact of immigration on jobs. This should be done on the basis of fact not more empty rhetoric or spin from the Government. ‘The Government’s record on immigration is one of failing to meet their own net migration target and ramping up the rhetoric. Now they want to keep their own research hidden rather than scrutinised. ‘We need an open, calm and fact based debate on the impact of immigration and this should be facilitated by the Government and not made harder.’ Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said the public needed facts not empty rhetoric or spin from the government while  Ukip leader Nigel Farage said there was 'no doubt' Brits had lost work as a result of an influx of labour from overseas . UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'I think there is no doubt that British people have lost their jobs because there is too much labour coming into the market. 'The other factor, which is not in this report but is perhaps even more pertinent, is the effect on wages of people in work. 'We have had wage compression and it has meant lower wages for millions and millions of people.' Liberal Democrat MP Martin Horwood also joined calls for a swift publication: 'Let's put it kindly: it's got stuck in someone's in-tray waiting for the final sign-off, hasn't it? 'It would be very, very helpful if it was now extracted from that in-tray and published. 'It sounds as though this is a very rigorous study ... a very important contribution to the factual debate on immigration which is sorely needed.'","Home Secretary claimed for every 100 immigrants, 23 Brits are jobless .

"By . Laura Clark . and Matt Chorley . Education Secretary Michael Gove is said to be delighted at his daughter securing a place at a state school . Michael Gove has chosen a state secondary school for his daughter. Beatrice, . 10, has secured a place at a popular Church of England girls’ comprehensive at the heart of Westminster - her first choice school. Mr Gove is believed to be the first Conservative education secretary to choose a state secondary for his child. The . minister and his wife, Sarah Vine, a Daily Mail columnist, are said to . be ‘delighted’ their daughter will go to the Grey Coat Hospital School. Founded . in 1698, the school specialises in the teaching of languages and . encourages first year pupils to learn at least two, with the option of . studying Latin and Greek. Judged . ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in 2009, the school, which has strong links . with Westminster Abbey, is typically at least five times oversubscribed . for its 150 places. It places pupils in ability bands to allocate places as well as prioritising church-going families. The uniform at the school includes a grey coat, as the name suggests, costing between £65 and £85. According . to the 2009 report, two-thirds of pupils are from ethnic minority . backgrounds and one third speak English as a second language. Unlike . his predecessors as Education Secretary and several other leading . Tories, Mr Gove was determined to send his children to a state school. Brian . Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College . Leaders, said: 'We would suggest that all cabinet ministers follow Mr . Gove's example and send their children to one of the country's many fine . state schools.' Writing in . her column today, Miss Vine said: 'I want to support the state sector . not just because, as a UK taxpayer and a tight-wad, I would resent . paying twice for my children’s education. 'Or . because, having watched my friends go through the hell of trying to get . their offspring into high-flying private schools, I decided to spare . mine the anguish. “But . mostly because I believe that at state school Beatrice will receive a . far more comprehensive education - in every sense of the phrase - than . at any private establishment.”. In a speech earlier this year at the . London Academy of Excellence, he lauded a ‘renaissance’ in state . education, insisting many schools state schools were as good as, if not . better than, some in the private sector. While the Gove's were successful in securing their first choice school, others were not so lucky. More than four in ten children in some areas were denied their preferred secondary school amid mounting competition for places . Beatrice Gove, daughter of Sarah Vine and Michael Gove, will be attending state school, Grey Coat Hospital . Tens of thousands of ten and . 11-year-olds found they had  missed out as allocations were announced by . councils across the country. Many . areas reported a rise in the number of applicants and a corresponding . decline in the number of pupils being assigned their first choice . schools. The allocations to more than half a million families are likely to see a surge in appeals. Law firm Maxwell Gillott warned the system can be a ‘minefield’ for parents. Research by the Mail shows a booming population in many towns and cities is fuelling rising demand for secondary places. In . London, where the demand for secondary school places rose 5 per cent in . a year, 31 per cent of youngsters were rejected by their first choice . school – up slightly on last year. This rose to 42 per cent in the boroughs of Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham and 41 per cent in Wandsworth. In . Bristol, the population of secondary school age youngsters shot up 8 . per cent, leaving 23 per cent of children without their first choice . school – compared with 18 per cent in 2013. Popular: The Tiffin School in Kingston is an oversubscribed grammar - 1,863 boys applied for just 160 places . ‘The . rise in reception pupil numbers seen in 2007/08 is starting to filter . through to secondary schools. 'There has also been general population . growth in the area,’ said a spokesman. In . Birmingham, where applications also rose, 30 per cent were rejected by . their first choice – up from 26 per cent. Buckinghamshire, meanwhile, . was unable to offer places to 22 per cent. Around one in seven youngsters are expected to miss out on first choice schools. Under . the admissions system, parents list their school  preferences. They are . then allocated places according to the schools’ admissions criteria, . which are mainly based on a family’s proximity. Other . factors can include random lotteries or ability banding – measures . aimed at preventing middle-class parents playing the system by moving . into catchment areas. Banding involves all pupils being tested, with a . set number of bright, average and low ability children admitted. Competition . is particularly intense for places at grammar and faith schools, as . well as flagship free schools and academies, which are funded by the . taxpayer but free from local government interference. Tiffin . School in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, saw 1,863 boys sitting the . 11-plus test, competing for 160 places. The West London Free School, in Hammersmith, had nearly 10 applicants for each of its 120 places . The West London Free School, . founded by journalist Toby Young, had 1,124 applications for 120 places. Matt . Richards, senior director of www.schoolappeals.com, said: ‘Most people . are happy with a good school, they don’t necessarily want an outstanding . school, but if there isn’t one in your area then you have a problem. ‘There are areas where schools are still failing.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Every parent deserves the chance to send their child to a good school. ‘The number of children in failing secondary schools has already fallen by a quarter of a million since 2010.’ Parents . apply to a local authority for a place for their child each year, and . those wanting a place at a secondary school for September 2014 had to . apply by 31 October last year. Depending on where they live, families will either find out today or tomorrow where their child has been allocated a place. The schools set their own admissions criteria and admissions are dealt with by the local authority. For . example, faith schools give preference to children who practise the . religion of the school, while others may prioritise those with siblings . already at the school or those who do well in an entrance exam. For some, study alone will not be enough - and their parents will have to appeal the school's decision (file image) Parents may list up to a . certain number of schools in order of preference on their application . form - in London boroughs with larger numbers of schools that can mean . up to six schools, while in other areas they may be allowed to list a . smaller number - for example, parents in Bristol can list a maximum of . three. Unlike with primary . schools, where catchment areas are all-important and house prices go up . as a result, where you live is not usually as important a factor in most . secondary applications. There . is no guarantee that children will be offered a place at their first or . even third choice school - some will be offered a place at a school . they did not apply to and have no wish to go to. There . is a deadline date of 17 March (in most local authority areas) for . parents to respond to the offer they are given, either to accept the . school place offered or to appeal a decision or place a child on a . waiting list.  Places become available at schools when parents decide to . send their child to a private school, look elsewhere for schools or to . home-educate their children instead. Parents . who have appealed a school's decision not to offer their child a place . will have their appeal heard by an independent panel.  They will first . check your child meets all the school's admissions criteria, and should . come back to you with a decision within a week.","Minister delighted after landing place at Grey Coat Hospital School .

"By . Daniel Martin . and Alan Simpson, Scottish Political Reporter . and Matt Chorley . Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it would be 'bizarre' to put Scottish pensions at risk . Gordon Brown has warned Scots that their country may not be able to afford the state pension if it opts  for independence. The former Prime Minister said a Yes vote for independence would mean the loss of the ‘pooling and sharing’ of resources which help pay for retired people’s benefits. Mr Brown said he did not believe Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s assertions that pensions would continue to be paid, pointing to questions over the value of North Sea oil revenues in the coming years. Speaking in Lochgelly, Fife – at the launch of a campaign group, Keep our British Pensions – Mr Brown said: ‘We know when we look at the figures for pensions, we in Scotland get a higher share of the UK pension money.’ The Kirkcaldy MP added that when benefits such as pensioners’ credit, the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences are added to the state pension, Scots receive around £200 more on average a year than their English counterparts, amounting to £200million for north of the border. Mr Brown said: ‘Why does that  happen? It happens because we pool all of our resources as part of the United Kingdom. We have more needs [in Scotland] and more pensioners, therefore we get more.’ Mr Salmond’s Scottish National Party described Mr Brown’s comments as scaremongering. Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, announced yesterday that Whitehall is granting the Scottish government the power to issue its own bonds. This will broaden the sources of financing available to the Scottish government for capital investment. Mr Alexander said this demonstrates ‘once again how Scotland can grow and prosper within the UK’. Mr Brown said last night: ‘The SNP cannot deny we face a higher bill in an independent Scotland when we lose the pooling and sharing that happens across the UK.’ The SNP has pledged to continue paying the basic state pension at the current rate if there is a Yes vote in September. Ministers would keep the ‘triple-lock’ guarantee to ensure pensions keep pace with earnings and rising costs for at least the first term of an independent parliament . Scots go to the polls to decide the country's future in the UK in September, with the Scottish Government having already suggested independence could mean a reduction in the state pension age north of the border. First minister Alex Salmond is under pressure over pensions, the pound and whether an independent Scotland could join the EU . Mr Brown added: ‘We have polling . evidence that only 15 per cent of pensioners favour independence and . indeed 61 per cent of all Scottish people believe that pensioners north . of the border should be paid from UK and not Scottish taxes. ‘We . must keep the common UK National Insurance fund that we have . contributed to and paid into all of our working lives. We have accrued . rights to our pension from successive UK governments. ‘These have to be honoured and continue to be honoured by the UK. ‘It . is bizarre that we would put Scottish pensions at risk at a time when . pension spending in Scotland is rising faster than in the rest of the . UK.’ He continued: ‘The . number of over 60s in Scotland will grow from the current 22per cent of . the population to 32per cent by the year 2035.’ An expert commission would be established to consider the appropriate age threshold for pensions, with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon having already suggested this could see people in Scotland picking up their state pension earlier than those in the rest of the UK. Mr McClymont said: ‘One fact is . indisputable. The costs of meeting the needs of Scottish pensioners will . be higher in years to come. There is absolutely no doubt we are better . off spreading the risks as part of the Union.’ Mr Salmond's Scottish National Party described Mr Brown's comments as scaremongering . A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ‘The National Institute of Economic Social Research report published last week shows that individual pensions in Scotland would be 6per cent to 8per cent cheaper compared to the rest of the UK. ‘Scotland is better able to afford pension and welfare payments than the rest of the UK. Social protection takes up a smaller share of our national output and our tax revenues than it does in the UK as a whole. ‘The research also makes clear that the lower life expectancy in Scotland means it would be fairer for people here if the increase in the pension age was postponed. Indeed, the paper states that the optimal policy for Scotland would be a state pension age relatively lower than the rest of the UK. ‘In the first year of an independent Scotland, we will establish an independent commission to consider the appropriate pace of further change to the retirement age beyond 66, taking account of Scottish circumstances. ‘The commission would report to the Scottish Parliament within the first two years of independence, allowing us to take decisions which best suit the needs of people in Scotland nearing pensionable age.’","Former Prime Minister launches Keep Our British Pensions campaign .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A chocolate labrador who flies around the UK with her owner in his six-seater Cessna light aircraft has been given a crew card after racking up more than 250 flying hours. Three-year-old Callie, who flies with Graham Mountford, 50, is now able to pass through the Crew Only channels at airports after becoming the only dog in the country to be recognised by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots' Association (AOPA). The pet, who takes to the skies every weekend and has flown more than 50,000 miles, has goggles, a special harness to strap her into the cockpit, and is rewarded with a sausage when she lands. Scroll down for video . Callie, who is three, has clocked up more than 250 flying hours with her pilot owner, Graham Mountford, 50 . The chocolate labrador wears her own goggles, hat and harness - and gets a sausage every time they land . Chocks away! Callie first got in a plane when she was a 12-week-old puppy - now she is an old hand . Mr Mountford, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, has been a private pilot for 13 years and first took Callie, who resembles cartoon flying dog, Muttley, up in the air with him when she was just a three-month-old puppy. She leaps into his Cessna 210 Centurion happily, and has touched won at airports across Britain, including Cornwall, Wales and various far-flung Scottish islands. Mr Mountford said: 'I used to go flying with friends, but when we got Callie three years ago I thought it would be fun to take her up in the plane with me. 'I bought some small ear protectors for her to wear and the first time we just taxied around the airport to make sure she enjoyed it. 'It all went well so we then went on a short flight and she took it all in her stride and seemed very happy.' Now the pair fly most weekends, visiting beaches such as Barra in Scotland, Perranporth in Cornwall and Caernarfon in Wales, where Callie enjoys a run on the sand and a sausage. The labrador, seen here without her Muttley-style goggles, has visited airports right across Great Britain . Needs a pawprint: Callie is the only dog to have an Aircraft Owners' and Pilots' Association crew card . With her goggles and flying hat, Callie looks rather like the cartoon character Muttley, pictured right with Dick Dastardly . VIP access: Now Callie has her card, she can go through special channels at many airports across the UK . Mr Mountford said: 'She usually sits next to me in the front of the plane but if other people come with me she will stretch out on the back seat,' 'I get a lot of comments and smiles when I land at an airport and people realise my co-pilot is a dog.' He added: 'Callie usually wears a fluorescent jacket and as soon as she puts it on, she knows she is going flying. She loves dressing up for the part.' The crew card came about after Mr Mountford visited the AOPA at an exhibition and told them how many flying hours his labrador had. He was told she was eligible for a VIP card, which gives the holder benefits including hotel and hire car discounts, and a card duly arrived in the post soon afterwards. He said: 'I have shown the card, along with mine, at some of the bigger airports and it always causes great amusement. Even the most glum security men break into a smile.' Mr Mountford gave Callie her first taste of flying by simply taxiing around the runway - but she liked it . Man's best friend: Mr Mountford used to go flying with friends, but now he prefers to take Callie in his Cessna . Muttley was the canine sidekick of the hapless baddie, Dick Dastardly, in the Hanna-Barbera Wacky Races and other cartoons. Muttley first appeared in Wacky Races in 1968, but the cartoon's popularity was such that it continued well into the new millennium. Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines was a series of cartoons in which the duo tried to catch Yankee Doodle Pigeon, a carrier pigeon who carried secret messages to their opponents. With the two villains featuring as aviators in the Vulture Squadron, they wore Aviator caps and goggles and tried, but usually failed, to capture their feathered foe. The cartoon series' original run was from 1969-1970, but it garnered such a fanbase that it was syndicated throughout the 1970s and 1980s, before a box-set was released in 2005.","Private pilot Graham Mountford, 50, first took his dog up at three months .

"By . Harriet Arkell . and Matt Chorley . As the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow is used to unruly, screeching crowds. And as these pictures of him in a 1975 episode of the chaotic children's television programme, Crackerjack, show, he started young. The 12-year-old schoolboy looked nervous in his school blazer and tie as he was introduced to an audience of chanting children on the popular show by host Ed Stewart. Scroll down for video . TV debut: The 12-year-old John Bercow appeared on Crackerjack in 1975 but came last in an obstacle race . Host Ed Stewart cheered on 'the lads' (including Bercow, far right) as they tried to hook curtain rings onto broom handles . Stewart told the chanting audience 'Let's meet the lads', before introducing John, right and his competitors . Stewart told the audience: 'Let's meet the lads', before introducing 'John' as one of four schoolboys to take part in a race involving scooping up curtain rings onto broom handles. Bercow managed to scoop up just two of the four rings and finished last in the weekly show, known for its catchphrase 'It's Friday, it's five o'clock, it's Crackerjack!' The long-haired future politician was awarded a Crackerjack pencil for his efforts, and was told by the host: 'I hope you have happy writing days', reported Guido Fawkes in the Sun on Sunday. Crackerjack ran from 1955 to 1984 and was presented by hosts including Eamonn Andrews, Leslie Crowther, Michael Aspel, Ed Stewart, and Stu Francis. Every time the host said the word 'Crackerjack' the children in the audience at the BBC Television Theatre (later the Shepherds Bush Empire) would scream 'CRACKERJACK' back, giving the show its frantic atmosphere. Last week Bercow, now 51 and the Conservative MP for Buckingham, was branded a hypocrite after ordering MPs to cut out 'yobbery and public school twittishness', but using 'bully-boy' tactics himself in the Commons. Long-haired schoolboy: Bercow was awarded a Crackerjack pencil for his efforts on the popular children's show . Dressed in a school blazer and tie, John Bercow, right, looks nervous on his first television appearance . Host: Ed Stewart hosted the popular weekly show from 1975-1979 - he also presented Top of the Pops . The Commons Speaker is leading a new . campaign for them to think about how they appear on TV during Prime . Minister's Questions. But this weekend, Bercow was accused of hypocrisy by the man he branded a 'nutter' in  a Commons debate shortly before becoming Speaker. In April 2009, the MP took  part in a debate led by his friend and fellow Tory MP Julian Lewis which featured a series of highly personal attacks on Terry Scriven, the Liberal Democrat candidate in Mr Lewis’s New Forest seat. After Mr Lewis accused Mr Scriven of being behind efforts to make public the MP’s home address, Bercow intervened to say: ‘He’s a nutter.’ Mr Scriven, who failed to beat Mr Lewis at the 2010 Election, said the experience had led to him giving up ever becoming an MP because of the impact on his family, and said the Speaker should apologise. The son of a taxi driver, John Bercow grew up in . north London, attending Finchley Manorhill comprehensive. He enjoyed his first taste of fame as Britain's top junior . tennis player, but a career in the sport was ended by glandular fever. In 1985 he graduated with a first-class degree in Government from the University of Essex, where he was known as 'very right-wing', 'very bright', and 'quite stroppy'. Order!  The Speaker has recently asked MPs to stop behaving like 'yobs' during debates in the House of Commons . He . became secretary of the notorious Conservative Monday Club, and once . campaigned for 'assisted repatriation' of immigrants. He later described . his membership as 'utter madness'. Bercow . then began a political journey from the hard right to the left. Jobs in . merchant banking and lobbying were followed by a spell as a special . adviser to Tory Cabinet ministers Jonathan Aitken and Victoria . Bottomley. Elected as an MP . in 1997, he served on the Tory frontbench but was sacked after backing . Anne Widdecombe for saying then-leader Michael Howard had 'something of . the night' about him. Campaigning . on gay rights, Burma, international development and special needs . teaching, there were rumours he would defect to Labour. Instead . he quietly manoeuvred to become a frontrunner to become Commons . Speaker, and won the election almost entirely thanks to votes from . Labour MPs. It is thought only three of his Tory colleagues backed him. Family: Bercow is married to Sally, pictured, and they have three children, Oliver, Freddie and Jemima . Since . then Bercow has been repeatedly accused of bias, favouring Labour MPs . while launching verbal assaults on many Tories, including David Cameron. He married Sally in 2002, and they have two sons and one daughter. Despite his early TV exposure, he was said to be furious at his wife for appearing on screen in Celebrity Big Brother. Not . known to use one word when five will do, he was reluctant to get drawn . into commenting after photographs emerged of his wife kissing DJ and personal trainer . Clinton Oliver at a London nightclub. 'People shouldn’t assume that they know what is right or that it is necessary for them to prescribe for others,' he said. 'Sally and I have known each other for a very long time and I think we’re quite capable of looking after ourselves.'","The 12-year-old schoolboy was a contestant on popular children's TV show .

"By . Rebecca English . and Hugo Gye . and Matt Chorley . Princes William and Harry today joined the flood relief effort by helping soldiers to lay sandbags in Datchet. The brothers secretly joined members of Harry's Household Cavalry regiment to shore up the defences just a stone's throw from the Queen's residence, Windsor Castle. Their trip to the front line of the crisis is reportedly the second intervention into the flooding crisis by the Royal Family, after the monarch apparently criticised the Government's response to the disaster. Scroll down for video . To me Harry! Prince William catches a sandbag from his younger brother as the royals help with the flood relief effort in Datchet . Teamwork: Princes William and Harry were knee deep in flood water at one point . Joint effort: The princes joined members of the Household Cavalry who were lending their time to the relief efforts . According to sources, William and Harry had been keen to play a part for some days but did not want to publicise their presence for fear of distracting from the crisis facing householders. They joined military personnel at 6am this morning and had hoped to stay working all day. But by mid morning, word of their presence had already slipped out. Harry was wearing his army fatigues while William was in 'civilian' dress. Pass it on: Princes William and Harry joined soldiers who were transferring sandbags at Eton End school in Datchet . Recovery efforts: The princes were working at a level crossing in Datchet, not far from Windsor Castle . Prince Harry wades through the water in Datchet, United Kingdom. Flood water has remained high in the village and many have had to abandon their homes . Downpour: William was later drenched when it started raining hard over the flood-affected town . A royal aide said: 'This is not something they wanted publicised and it was only decided on Wednesday night. 'They were very keen to help with the flood relief effort and thought that joining the military would be the best way.' A Buckingham Palace spokesman told MailOnline: ‘They joined the Household Cavalry this morning from 6am and they have been helping to build walls of sandbags.’ William and Harry later left the office of Datchet Parish Council and got into a car alongside military personnel to continue the relief effort. Appreciated: Local town leaders praised the contribution made by William and Harry . Experienced: Both princes have previously served in disaster and emergency situations . Meeting: The brothers went to speak to members of the local council at the temporary military base in the Datchet town hall . Parish clerk Graham Leaver said: 'They were very involved and wanting to know what was going on. They have been in Datchet and the area and I think it's gone down very well. That is my assessment. 'They were very natural. To be honest, they could have walked in among people here and nobody would have recognised them looking at the way they were dressed. 'They were particularly interested in talking to the troops. The support we have received from the Army has been absolutely excellent and if they hadn't come into Datchet we as a parish would have been overwhelmed.' While the floodwaters have receded since . their peak earlier this week, 2in of rain was set to fall today with . more tomorrow, raising the possibility of homes and businesses facing . fresh horror over the weekend. The pair joined the Household Cavalry this morning from 6am and they have been helping to build walls of sandbags . A royal aide said the pair did not want their efforts publicised in advance and only decided top pitch in on Wednesday night . When Harry was asked by reporters if he was enjoying helping out, he replied: 'Not really, with you guys around' The princes helped by unloading . sandbags from military trucks onto freight trains which would then take . them to areas where they are most needed. They . are no strangers to working in disaster zones and providing emergency . relief - William has worked as a rescue helicopter pilot, while Harry . has served two tours of duty in Afghanistan. The Queen, William and Harry's . grandmother, has also been lending a hand to flood victims by providing . farmers with a way to look after their livestock during the crisis. A . Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Queen is supporting Somerset . farmers affected by the flooding on the Somerset Levels by contributing . feed and bedding from the royal farms at Windsor.' Barrier: William helps another soldier construct a dam to prevent the weather from causing too much damage in the future . Intrepid: Harry joined other soldiers as they waded through waist-deep water . Defences: A wall of sandbags is erected in Datchet to ward off floodwater which could rise following today's rain . Getting stuck in: The princes and the Household Cavalry were undeterred by the onset of rain later in the day . Also wading in: Prime Minister David Cameron was also treading water today while he had a discussion with farmer Tim Hook in the West Brampton area of Oxfordshire . Wellington boots: Earlier this week, Ed Miliband (left) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (right) donned their wet-weather gear as they walked around communities devastated by the floods . The public statement came as Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg denied a report that the Queen criticised the .

Asked . on LBC radio whether it was true that the Queen had 'waded in' over . flooding, Mr Clegg replied: 'No.' He declined to discuss the content of . their conversations any further. But . the fact that her efforts have been made public will be seen as a coded . rebuke to the Government's reaction to the widespread devastation . caused by the extreme weather. Meanwhile, .

"By . Jason Groves . and Becky Barrow . and Matt Chorley . David Cameron yesterday batted away Tory demands to help middle class families despite increasing pressure to help the 1.4million extra earners dragged into the 40p tax trap since he came to power. There are growing calls for ministers to help middle earners in next week’s budget, thousands of whom have been dragged into paying the 40p rate of tax over the past three years. It is thought the number of higher rate taxpayers could hit nearly five million by next year’s election. Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to the Israeli parliament, played down expectations that he could act to help those caught in the 40p tax band . By freezing or lowering the 40p tax rate, the number of earners caught in the bracket has risen to 4.4million under the coalition . Yesterday a leading Labour peer, Lord McFall, joined the growing furore over a tax which is being paid by people who do not consider themselves wealthy. Lord McFall, the former chairman of the influential Treasury Select Committee, said nearly one in six taxpayers are paying higher rate tax. In 1978, it was just one in 33. He said: ‘I think that that is a big issue. [It is] taxation by stealth - people don’t realise what that is.’ In May 2010, the month that the coalition Government was formed, a worker became a higher rate taxpayer when their salary hit £43,875. But George Osborne has repeatedly lowered, or frozen, the salary level at which a worker starts to pay tax at 40 per cent. Today you are a higher rate taxpayer if you are paid £41,450. To make matters worse, the ‘starting salary’ will barely rise for the next two years, increasing by just one per cent a year to £41,865 next month and £42,285 in April 2015. Traditionally, it would be increased at a far more generous rate, rising in line with the retail prices index measure of inflation, but the Chancellor scrapped this plan. Speaking in Israel, Mr Cameron said the coalition was focusing on increasing the personal tax allowance . Tory MP Dominic Raab (left) said help for the . poor should not be at the expense of the middle classes while Tory MP . Nadhim Zahawi backed the idea of scrapping the 40p rate altogether . The national minimum wage is to increase by 19p an hour to £6.50 later this year, giving more than a million workers a pay rise. The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour - a 2 per cent increase. For 16 and 17-year-olds the statutory rate will rise by 7p to GBP3.79, also 2 per cent. The minimum wage for apprentices will go up by 5p to £2.73 an hour, with all the new rates coming into force in October. The . Government said it had accepted recommendations from the low Pay . Commission, including plans for bigger increases in future than in . recent years. Business . Secretary Vince Cable said: 'The recommendations I have accepted today . mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their . take home pay since 2008. 'This . will benefit over one million workers on national minimum wage and . marks the start of a welcome new phase in minimum wage policy.' Senior Tories are demanding a big increase in the salary threshold at which people start to pay the 40p rate to around £44,000. But Mr Cameron repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the impact of so-called ‘fiscal drag’ yesterday when asked about the growing political controversy. Speaking on a trip to Israel, he said: ‘I am a tax-cutting Conservative - I want to see us relieve people’s tax burden. ‘We have chosen to do that through raising the personal allowance, which helps everyone earning under £100,000.’ Nadhim Zahawi, a Tory MP and a member of the Number 10 policy unit, said: ‘It is right that if there is any money in the kitty, it should go towards those at the lower end of the pay spectrum.’ But he showed his support for a radical proposal from Renewal, a campaign group aiming to broaden the appeal of the Conservative party, to abolish the 40p tax rate. Under its proposals, the 40p tax rate would be scrapped and the 45p tax rate, which is currently paid by people earning more than £150,000, would be lowered to £62,000. David Skelton, a director of Renewal, said: ‘George Osborne should take a major step to unwind the undesirable drift towards an ever higher proportion of the working population paying higher rate tax. ‘In doing so, he could relieve the pressure on the squeezed middle, so many of whom have borne the burden of paying for Labour’s profligacy.’ Speaking at Policy Exchange, David Cameron’s favourite think-tank, Mr Zahawi said: ‘We need our iconic tax policy. ‘I think Dave Skelton’s contribution and his suggestion that we abolish the 40p rate and pay for it by lowering the 45p threshold was a great way of starting the conversation.’ But Mr Cameron’s comments will dismay senior Tories pushing for the 40p threshold to be raised to ease the pain on higher earners, particularly in the South East where high housing costs eat into disposable income. Increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010 . Of the 4.4million higher rate taxpayers, 834,000 live in the South East followed by 817,000 in London, according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs. John Redwood, the former Tory cabinet minister, said there is now a clear case for helping those on ordinary incomes dragged into the 40p rate. He said: ‘It is affecting not just those at the threshold limit, who find that a pay rise disappears, but people further down the income scale with aspirations. ‘We need lower taxes across the board.’ Dominic Raab, a leading Tory MP, said: ‘It is right to ease the tax burden on the lowest paid, but that should not be done at the expense of the middle classes. ‘You should not be robbing middle class Peter to pay for working class Paul. We need to cut taxes across the board.’","Senior Tories demanding increase in threshold to around £44,000 .

Following the break-up however, he decided he needed to leave his hometown of Blacksburg, Virginia, and go travelling. He said: 'I started researching where you could dive with sharks. I assumed I would have to go to Australia but I saw an advert which said I could do it at Isla Guadalupe off the coast of California. Regular trip: The journey has now become an annual pilgrimage for Mr Probst, along with his father and brother who started joining him on the trips after seeing his photographs of the sharks . Mr Probst said: 'It's become a yearly adventure for us. I have been in the water sometimes and there has been seven great white sharks around me. It is an amazing place' Confidence: As he carries out more dives, Mr Probst has become more confident and has started progressing from surface cages attached to a boat to submersible cages, which are lowered 40ft and have openings at the top to allow divers to climb out of . 'The water clarity and visibility there is top notch, so I thought that I would give it a shot.' Mr Probst said despite initially being scared the first time he climbed into a shark cage, his fears disappeared after spending a day in the water. He said: 'You can see that they aren't out to get you. They may swim up close to you because they are curious, but it's not in an aggressive way. 'The sharks are there because Isla Guadalupe has large shoals of yellowfin tuna - they aren't interested in some boney human.' Mr Probst took a basic camera with him on his first dive but started collecting professional equipment as he got more into diving.

Once out of the cage however, Mr Probst has no protection from the sharks. He said: 'Sharks attack large prey from below, so though I'm technically not protected, I know I'm not in trouble. They will swim up to you, but if they became aggressive I could just go down into the cage.' The sharks come up so close to Mr Probst that he can take close-ups of their faces. He said: 'I run a shark news blog and I try to keep abreast of news. It is estimated that up to 72 million sharks are killed every year for the commercial market. 'An average of 10 people are killed by sharks each year - more people are killed by cows or deer. 'They are wild animals and I take precautions because it would be foolish not to, but it's not like they are out to kill us.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A teenage boy has died after stumbling out of bed, falling into a sunbed and severing his jugular vein on one of its glass tubes. Grant Adams, 17, died in hospital last night after the freak accident in which the smashed tubes cut his neck in two places at his home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. Today his mother, Amanda Smedley, 39, described how she found her son - whose girlfriend is due to have their baby in a fortnight - at the bottom of the loft stairs with blood pumping out of his throat. Tragedy: Grant Adams, 17, pictured with pregnant girlfriend, Sharna, died after cutting his throat on a sunbed . She said: 'He stumbled out of bed, tripped, and the bottom of the sunbed tubes went into his neck. 'He's pulled it out of his neck, he's stumbled down the loft stairs, [and] I found him in a pool of blood.' Miss Smedley's boyfriend tried to staunch the blood pouring from Grant's neck while she called for help for her son. Much-loved son: Grant was described by his mother, Amanda Stedley, 39, as 'good at everything he ever did' Paramedics arrived and the young bricklayer was airlifted to hospital and put in an induced coma, but despite medics working on him in theatre for five hours, Grant could not be saved and was pronounced dead last night. His mother said: 'It's his 18th birthday in two weeks' time, he had just bought a car, he has got a baby on the way - he had everything to live for, everything.' She said her son's pregnant girlfriend had left the house shortly before the accident on Sunday, and said she was 'a mess' after learning of the tragedy. Miss Smedley added: 'The only thing I have got left of him is his baby.  That's it. 'He was a happy, go-lucky fun loving lad, and all he did was work, sleep, work, sleep.  He was good at everything he ever did - I cannot believe he is gone.' Grant's aunt, Michelle Kelly, 33, who described him as a 'big healthy lad' who loved cars and motorbikes, told how she rushed to help him from her home nearby. She said: 'I got a knock on the door and I dashed over to help. 'Grant had pulled a bit of the glass tube out of his neck already and I held my hand over his neck to try and stop the flow of blood. 'The ambulance came and took him to hospital where they took him into surgery to close the wounds up and put him into an induced coma as he wasn't able to breathe.' Friends of Grant, a keen amateur boxer, paid tribute to him on Facebook. Grant is said to have accidentally cut his throat on jagged tubes from a sunbed at his home (file picture) One, Danny Lythgoe, wrote: 'Absolutely devastated, man, known you since we were four years old.  Went to nursery with you and had so many memories.

A court in the Polish city of Ilawa heard it was 'a miracle' the baby survived after being left in the field for two days as temperatures rose to over 30C. The child's mother Jolanta Czarnecka, 30, said she had not wanted to be pregnant and had kept it secret by wearing loose fitting dresses and pretending she had put on weight. Scroll down for video . Jolanta Czarnecka, 30, (right) has been accused of attempted murder after she gave birth in a field during her lunch break before leaving the baby and returning to work . After returning to work in the afternoon, her boss noticed blood on her clothing and refused to accept her insistence that she was fine, Central European News has reported. He took her to hospital where doctors discovered she had given birth. Czarnecka however allegedly lied by claiming she had the baby by accident and it had fallen into a toilet. The court was told detectives searched the toilet however and  no traces of the baby were found. Detectives could also find no trace of the woman having given birth. She eventually admitted giving birth in the field after subsequent questioning. The court heard the baby had been abandoned for two days before it was found dehydrated and covered in insects. Doctor Barbara Chomik at the hospital in the northern city of Elblag where the baby was taken after it was discovered said: 'The girl was in serious condition. A court in the Polish city of Ilawa heard it was 'a miracle' the baby survived after being left in the field for two days as temperatures rose to over 30C . 'She had been left alone naked and weighed less than a kilogram in part because she was so severely dehydrated. 'It is a miracle that she survived under those conditions for so long.

"By . James Rush . Genetically pure wild bison could be reintroduced to vast swathes of the American West and allowed to roam in parts of their native habitat once again for the first time in more than 100 years. While once millions of the powerful animals roamed the plains to the west of the Mississippi, their numbers were driven down by hunting to fewer than 50, who discovered refuge in Yellowstone National Park in the early 20th century. Officials at the park have now begun seeking public comment on plans which could see the animal reintroduced to states including Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Nebraska and South Dakota. A herd of bison graze in Lamar Valley in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Officials at the park have begun seeking public comment on plans which could see the animal reintroduced to swathes of the American West . A recent U.S. Interior Department report on bison concluded the animal could potentially be moved back on to public land it owned in such states without it posing a risk to livestock. Concerns have been raised however that bison could bring disease - namely, brucellosis, an infection that causes stillbirths in cows and may have been transmitted to about half the bison in Yellowstone from exposure to cattle. Wildlife managers at the park are now consulting on a plan that would see dozens of bison quarantined for a number of years so they did not contract the disease. Those that are free of the disease could then be considered to be relocated, David Hallac, chief of Yellowstone's science and research branch, has said. Dozens of bison from the heard at Yellowstone have already been relocated to two Montana American Indian reservations in recent years. Park officials, wildlife advocates and Native American groups are now eager to restore wild bison to more of their native habitat. A recent U.S. Interior Department report on bison concluded the animal could potentially be moved back on to public land it owned in such states without it posing a risk to livestock . Members of the public have now been invited to take part in the consultation which started on Wednesday and will go on to shape the final proposal, expected in about a year's time. The public comment period will close in September. Hallac told Reuters establishing genetically pure wild bison across the West would mark a conservation milestone. Ranchers however have raised concerns about the welfare of their cattle and safety of their property if even disease-free bison were reintroduced. Jay Bodner, natural resource director for the Montana Stockgrowers Association, told Reuters: 'We have legitimate concerns about containment and damage to private property and we need to address the impact on ranchers that graze on federal lands.'","Yellowstone National Park officials begin consultation on reintroduction .

"By . James Rush . This is the heartwarming moment a six-year-old boy bursts into laughter after moving his arm for the first time since undergoing brain surgery - as he feeds treats to a lovable black Labrador. Jack Doss was left with limited mobility in his left side after he suffered a stroke during a major operation to remove a brain tumour. To improve the mobility in his arm, Jack is undergoing intense physical therapy exercises, including lifting his hand above his head to feed treats to a dog waiting patiently behind him. Jack Doss, 6, feeds biscuits to a dog waiting patiently behind him as part of his physical therapy exercises following brain surgery. The young boy can be seen bursting into laughter when the dog takes the treat . Jack's father Tyler, 30, who posted a video of the therapy session to Youtube, told MailOnline it was the first time his son had  moved his arm since the operation. The video shows Jack bursting into laughter as the dog, called Tank, takes the biscuit from his hand. Mr Doss, of Orrville, Ohio, said the brain tumour was discovered after Jack started suffering headaches at the beginning of May. He underwent surgery on July 18 when doctors took out 90 to 95 per cent of the tumour. During the operation however, little Jack suffered a stroke. Mr Doss said: 'Our surgeon told us that he could have some left side issues and so his left arm and leg weren't working. 'So he started physical therapy that next Wednesday.' His father Tyler Doss has posted a  video online which shows Jack taking part in the exercise session. In the video, Jack is told if he is able to lift his arm four times to feed treats to the dog then he will get a new bike . Mr Doss said the hospital where Jack is being treated has between 20 and 25 dogs that work with children undergoing physical therapy sessions. He said: 'That video was the first time he had moved his arm. I got home from work and my wife showed me that, so I was pretty happy.' Mr Doss said his son enjoys working with the dogs as he goes through the exercise sessions. He said: 'His favourite thing is animals - he loves animals. They make things a lot better for him during therapy.'","Jack Doss left with limited mobility in his left side following brain surgery .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Smartwatches have barely been on sale for six months yet that hasn’t stopped engineers moving onto the next level of wearable high-tech devices - the smart ring. Called Smarty Ring, the stainless steel gadget connects to smartphones via Bluetooth using a dedicated app. Its LED screen lights up each time the wearer gets an email, text message, Facebook and Twitter notifications and phone calls, and the ring can also be used as a remote control. Scroll down for video . While the abacus ring may not be able to make phone calls, it proves that wearable smart rings such as the one pictured might not be as radical a concept as some people think . Flexible battery: 22 mAH battery with 24-hour running life guaranteed . Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0 . Dimensions: 0.5"" wide, 0.1"" thick . Materials: Stainless steel body, LED display . Features: LED screen shows incoming and outgoing call notifications. Alerts for text and e-mail messages and real-time updates from Facebook,Twitter, Hangout and Skype. Smarty Ring is the brainchild of Chennai-based engineer Ashok Kumar. Kumar recently set up an Indiegogo campaign to raise $40,000 (£24,000) funding for the high-tech gadget and has already smashed this goal by achieving in excess of $300,000 (£182,000). The ring is fitted with a Bluetooth 4.0 sensor that connects to any Android or iOS device through the dedicated Smarty Ring app. The app lets uses change the Smarty Ring's profile, set time zones and adjust the clock and set up speed dials. When there are no notifications to display, the ring shows the time, pictured. The ring connects to any Android or iOS device through the dedicated Smarty Ring app . When there are no notifications to display, the ring shows the time. When a call is received on the paired smartphone, wearers can choose to answer or reject the call using buttons on the side of the ring. Calls can also be placed using pre-programmed speed dials, although the calls themselves are made through the handset. These buttons also double up as a remote control to play or stop music on the phone and open the smartphone’s camera.

The most notable component is the flexible battery, seen as the grid on the far right of the ring. Kumar claims the ring will last for 24 hours 'guaranteed.' This battery is then charged on a wireless charging pad . Various icons light up to indicate when the wearer receives a text, email, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ message, Google Hangout alert and Skype call. There is additionally a stopwatch, countdown timer and alarm built in. As an extra feature, the ring will also sound an alarm if the phone is taken more than 30 feet away to alert to potential thefts. However, the alarm will only sound if the owner is wearing the cyber jewellery. Finally, the Smarty Ring is waterproof, according to the Indiegogo campaign: 'The exterior of the Smarty Ring is not only fashionable - but waterproof. The ring battery is charged on a wireless charging pad, pictured, that can also be used to charge a smartphone. The ring is expected to retail at $275 (£167) when it goes on sale from April next year and this includes the charging pad .

According to the campaign, the ring will retail at $275 (£167) when it goes on sale from April next year. While people who back the campaign can get a Smarty Ring for a discounted $175 (£106). Elsewhere, Kumar claims the ring will have a flexible 22mAh battery that will last for 24 hours ‘guaranteed.’ This battery is then charged on a wireless charging pad. The ring can be ordered to size, too, using a printout of a paper ruler supplied by the company. In September, designer Gusztav Szikszai unveiled a similar device called the Ring Clock - a ring that tells users the time when they twist it on their finger. Made of stainless steel, the timepiece was developed by the 26-year-old Hungarian as an alternative watch for people who do not like wearing anything around their wrists. However, the Ring Clock does not have any smart features.","Called Smarty Ring, the device connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth .

Mr Brown, of Columbus, Ohio, has been . creating 'stretch goals' as the money continued to pour in after the page was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter. The initial request for $10 came with the simple pitch of: 'Basically I'm just making potato salad. I haven't decided what kind yet.' He soon amended his goals to include a pizza party for $75 and two different potato salads at $100. The latest stretch goal however, which again has been easily smashed, was to organise a potato salad party for the 'whole internet' if the project managed to raise $3,000. Mr Brown has been adding 'stretch goals' as the amount of money raised continued to rise after the page was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter . $1 - A 'thank you' posted to the website and Mr Brown will say your name while making the potato salad . $2 - A photo of Mr Brown making the potato salad . $3 - A bite of the potato salad . $5 - Choose a potato salad-appropriate ingredient . $10 - Hang out in the kitchen while the potato salad is made . $20 - A potato salad-themed haiku, your name carved into a potato used in the salad, a signed jar of mayonnaise and the potato salad recipe . $25 - A potato salad-themed hat . $35 - A limited edition t-shirt . $50- A Potato Salads Of The World recipe book . Mr Brown told MailOnline he was looking to use the money raised 'to do the most good possible'. Asked . why he thought people had been so keen to get involved in the project, . he said: 'It's fun and it's creating a fun community. Potato salad has . brought us together. 'People are offering to write potato salad themed songs and make potato salad themed iPhone apps.' In the latest update to the page, Mr Brown has posted a video in which he thanks all of those who have pledged money. He said: 'This is amazing. When I started this campaign my secret goal was that we could make $60 and in three days we have made 1,000 per cent of that - $5,000 dollars. 'Thank you so much.' Mr Brown has also decided to give a little something back to all those who have pledged support with a series of 'gifts', depending on the amount pledged. Those who pledge $3 will receive a bite of the potato salad, for $5 there is the chance to choose an ingredient and those who pledge $25 will receive a potato-salad themed hat. Meanwhile, a pledge of $35 receives a t-shirt and those who pledge $50 or more will receive a Potato Salads Of The World recipe book. Q: What are you going to do with the money? A: I'm looking to do the most good possible with this opportunity. Have you had any weird ingredient suggestions? Marshmallows!! Where the did the idea come from? It's potato salad season over here in the States so everyone is talking about it! Why do you think people are so keen to get involved? It's fun and it's creating a fun community.

Oklahoma farmer Kevin Whitney beams with pride as he walks his daughter down the aisle on her wedding day, in a treasured photo he thought he lost forever when he accidentally dropped his iPhone in a grain elevator last October. But that picture and other precious family photos are now safely home after his cellphone was miraculously found seven months later, more than 6,000 miles away in Japan. Whitney's phone started it's long journey across the globe back in October 2013, when the farmer accidentally lost the phone in a grain pit on his Chickasha farm. 'I had it in my pocket and I bent over to work on a copper bottom door and it fell out of my pocket into my grain pit and went up the elevator,' he told KFOR. 'I thought ""I'll never see that phone again,""' Whitney also said. Whitney went out and got a new phone the next day, while his bin of 280,000 pounds of grain was moved to another Oklahoma grain facility, down the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers and then to a Louisiana depot where it was loaded on a ship bound for Japan's Hokkaido island. It was at the Zen-Noh Grain Corporation processing facility in Japan that that mill worker found the phone and sent it back to America. Father of the bride: On the lost phone were treasured photos of a recent vacation and daughter Katie Whitney's wedding, which took place in College Station, Texas in March 2013 .

James Malott and his friends found the 112-year-old 'ghost ship' anchored in a small creek and took pictures of the rusting yacht with a colorful past. According to Queen City Discovery, a Cincinnati blog, the 186-foot yacht was last owned by a Lawrenceburg, Kentucky local named Robert Miller who bought it in the late 80s. However, the ship's past goes all the way back to 1902, when it was first named The Celt and owned by a rich railroad executive. Scroll down for video . Resting place: An 112-year-old ship has been rusting away in the Ohio River for the past 30 years . Glory days: The 186-foot steam-engine yacht for was first commissioned for a rich railroad executive and launched in 1902. Above, the boat when it was known as The Celt . The boat then went on to aid in the two World Wars, transport scientist Thomas Edison and even appear in  Madonna music video before finding its way to the creek in Kentucky where it has been anchored for the last 30 years. The Celt left the hands of its first owner in 1917, when the US Navy started renting small, fast boats to outmaneuver German U-Boats to supply Great Britain during World War I. The boat was renamed the Sachem and was outfitted with depth charges to sink U-boats and machine guns to defend against torpedoes. What happened: The boat was most recently owned by a Cincinnati resident named Robert Miller, who parked it in the creek in the late 80s. He reportedly bought boat to restore it for a museum . New Yorker: The boat was last used by the Circle Line Company to ferry tourists around Manhattan. During its time with the tourist company, the boat was named the 'Sightseer' before being called the 'Circle Line V' - still visible on the side of the boat . Light bulb inventor: Thomas Edison used the boat during World War I to transport government-funded experiments . It was during World War I that the Sachem was used by scientist Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb. Edison used the boat in government-funded experiments conducted in New York Harbor, before he sailed the ship down to Key West, Florida. At the end of the war in November 1918, the ship was returned back to its original owner but it soon was sold again, eventually ending in the hands of Captain Jacob 'Jake' Martin of Brooklyn, New York. Captain Martin bought the boat in 1932, taking advantage of its low price during the Great Depression. The Brooklyn native used the ship as a fishing vessel and ran a business charging anyone who wanted to board $2 entry. Some boarded the boat for fun, while others used it to catch fish for their family.

Wartime helper: During World War II, the boat was used to train soldiers learning how to use sonar equipment . When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, the boat returned to the Navy where it was renamed the USS Phenakite and used this time to train soldiers learning to use sonar equipment in Key West Harbor. It was eventually assigned to patrol Long Island Sound, were it spent the rest of the war before being returned to Captain Martin. After the war, the boat was used to ferry tourists around Manhattan for the Circle Line Company. It was first named the 'Sightseer' and later became the 'Circle V', which is the name still seen painted on the side. Protector: Renamed the USS Phenakite, the boat spent the remainder of World War II patrolling Long Island Sound . Today: Robert Miller bought the boat for $7,500 in 1986 and sailed it to his property on the Ohio River where it has remained for the last 30 years . In the 1980s, when demand for the boats grew, the Circle V was retired and parked on the New Jersey side of New York harbor. In 1986, a Cincinnati local named Robert Miller purchased the ship for the low price of $7,500 and spent 10 days restoring the yacht so it could make the journey to the Midwest. While working on the boat one day, a limousine pulled up to the dock and representative for Madonna asked if they could use the ship in an upcoming music video. Miller agreed and the boat can briefly be seen in the video for single 'Papa Don't Preach'. Before leaving New York Harbor, the boat was used in Madonna's Papa Don't Preach music video.

"By . Larisa Brown . and Lucy Crossley . and Wills Robinson . A male teacher and an 18-year-old pupil who 'formed a relationship' have been pictured for the first time after a police investigation prompted him to step down. Daniel McQuoid, 24, resigned from his position at Emmanuel College in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, after becoming 'romantically-involved' with Jayne Louise Emmett. Parents at the top Christian school, which educates around 1,200 pupils aged between 11 and 19, received a letter from principal Jonathan Winch informing them that the member of staff had left. Relationship: Jayne Louise Emmett (left) was said to have been 'romantically involved' with teacher Daniel McQuoid (right). He has resigned from Emmanuel College in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear . Probe: Police have begun an investigation into the pair's relationship at the top Christian school . The student, aged 18, recently left the college after completing her A levels. A spokesman for the school, which was ranked 'Outstanding' in all five Ofsted inspections to date, said the 'friendship' was conducted with approval of the student's parents but it breached the college's staff professional code of conduct. 'A male teacher has resigned from the college after forming a friendship with a female student,' she said. 'The student, aged 18, recently left college having completed her A levels. 'The friendship was conducted with the knowledge and approval of the student's parents but breached the college's Staff Professional Code of Conduct.' Founder: Emmanuel College was set up by businessman and philanthropist Sir Peter Vardy in 1988 as one of the country's first city technology colleges . Police confirmed that an investigation into the allegations was underway. 'Inquiries are being carried out after police were informed about concerns about a relationship between a teacher and a student,' said a Northumbria Police spokesman. Earlier this year the school was recognised as one of the best in the country when it comes to students' progression. Emmanuel College was described as 'leading the field' in improving outcomes for students and congratulated for its 'exceptional achievement'. Success levels at GCSE show the college is among the top 20 per cent of schools in England for the value it adds to enable students to progress and for students' high attainment. Its overall pass rate for the benchmark five GCSEs at grade C or better was 99.5 per cent and 91 per cent including English and mathematics. Emmanuel College was founded by businessman and philanthropist Sir Peter Vardy in 1988 as one of the country's first city technology colleges under the then Thatcher Government. The school, which takes children from across Gateshead and the West End of Newcastle, has had consistently high exam results. However, it has often courted controversy because of accusations - always denied by Sir Peter - that his strong Christian beliefs led to the teaching of creationism in the school. His foundation also set up city academies in Middlesbrough and Doncaster, and the all-age Bede Academy in Blyth, taking both primary and secondary school children. But some local authorities in the North East were resistant to setting up academies with Sir Peter, whose father founded the Reg Vardy car dealership, because of the Christian ethos he insisted on at his schools.","Daniel McQuoid, 24, and Jayne Louise Emmett were 'romantically involved'

"By . Lucy Crossley . Nature lovers, gardeners and landowners have been warned against a toxic weed, nicknamed 'Taliban', which can burn and blister the skin of anyone who touches it. Giant hogweed, which can reach . 23ft high, originates from Afghanistan and Iraq and was shipped into the . UK by Victorian plant hunters in the 19th century. However, . the Triffid-like plant spread out of gardens and . private collections and across the countryside, while its sap can burn and blister the skin of anyone . who touches it. Warning: Nature lovers, gardeners and landowners have been warned against toxic giant hogweed, the sap of which can cause skin to blister . Hastily-introduced rules mean it is now illegal to plant hogweed in the wild - but nature experts say the ruling has come too late. And because its stems are hollow, children playing in the countryside this summer are at risk if they pick them up to use as pretend telescopes or peashooters. Giant hogweed has taken hold in many areas of the UK and the latest to be hit is the Avon Valley in Hampshire, where landowners are joining forces with the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust to stop it spreading further. 'We have fought against the giant hogweed since 2010 but more money is urgently required if we are to continue the battle effectively this year,' said Catherine Chatters, the trust's New Forest non-native plants officer. The giant hogweed thrives on moist ground and once a river bank has become dominated by it, the plant blots out the sunlight and kills off rivals. Origins: Giant hogweed, which can reach 23ft high, originates from Afghanistan and Iraq and was shipped into the UK by Victorian plant hunters in the 19th century . Eventually it becomes so dominant that it is virtually impossible to manage. For the past few years the New Forest Non-Native Plants Project has funded treatment by professional contractors using approved herbicide along the banks of the Avon. However, because of cutbacks to public funding, other sources of money now need to be foundto head off the risk of the hogweed invading waterside gardens. 'Each giant hogweed plant is capable of producing 50,000 seeds so it is vitally important the control work continues,' said Ms Chatters. 'If we stop now and allow the hogweed plants to produce seed, we could be back at square one in no time at all.' The Royal Horticultural Society advises gardeners wanting to destroy invasive clumps of giant hogweed to first consider whether this can be done using non-chemical means such as digging out or suppressing with mulch, before using weedkillers. Pull up young hogweeds by hand when . the soil is moist - do this in May when the giant hogweed has reached a . reasonable height, but before it has produced its flowering spike. For . larger plants it might be necessary to loosen the roots with a fork . first. Never let hogweed . set seed, but allow the flower spike to form and then remove it before . the flowers fade. At this stage, the plant is less likely to survive . trimming than earlier in the year. Protect . yourself from any skin contact with the sap, especially your face, when . cutting stems, and carry out control measures in overcast weather . avoiding sunny periods. Wash off any sap as soon as possible. Chemicals . in the sap can cause photodermatitis or photosensitivity, where the . skin becomes very sensitive to sunlight and may suffer blistering, . pigmentation and long-lasting scars. Where these methods are not feasible, chemical controls may need to be used . Choose a weedkiller that is appropriate for purpose by reading the label carefully before buying or using. Particular care must be taken when using residual weedkillers. When . controlling giant hogweed always wear gloves, cover your arms and legs, . and ideally wear a face mask when working on or near it. Cut plant debris, contaminated clothing and tools are potentially hazardous too. Wash any skin that comes in contact with the plant immediately. Where there are many plants, try applying a tough weedkiller containing glyphosate. Ideally, spray the foliage early in the summer and the plants should be re-treated in August or September, if necessary. Alternatively, cut back flowering plants and then spray any young foliage that re-grows in August and September. Mature plants are likely to need more than one treatment to kill them.","Giant Hogweed can reach 23ft high and originates from Afghanistan and Iraq .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Instead of counting calories, those seeking to stay slim are better off enjoying a protein rich diet and eating fish, eggs and meat, scientists have found. Because of the way the human body prioritises protein over carbohydrates and fat, those with a diet low in protein are likely to gorge on these other food groups to reach the target protein level. Over the past 60 years the proportion of protein in Western diets has dropped, and researchers suggest this could account for soaring levels of obesity. Scroll down for video . Losing weight: Instead of counting calories, those seeking to stay slim are better off enjoying a protein rich diet and eating eggs and meat such as chicken breasts, scientists have found . Weighty issue: Over the past 60 years the proportion of protein in Western diets has dropped, and researchers suggest this could account for soaring levels of obesity . 'We can use this information to help manage and prevent obesity, . through ensuring that the diets we eat have a sufficient level of . protein to satisfy our appetite,' said nutritional ecologist Professor David Raubenheimer, of the University of Sydney. Professor Raubenheimer is set to present his findings today at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Experimental Biology in Manchester, and says they may explain why high protein diets such as the Atkins Diet can help people to lose weight. However, he warned such diets could lead to further health issues, as it was more important to achieve the correct nutritional balance. Best avoided: Professor Raubenheimer says our bodies are not adapted to biscuits, cakes, pizzas and sugary drinks . 'We also need to get the balance . of fats to carbs right,' he said. 'High protein diets might help us to lose weight, but . if they involve other imbalances then other health problems will be . introduced.' As well as being a good source of energy, protein is essential for the healthy growth and repair of body tissues, such as muscles including the heart, internal organs and skin.

Professor Raubenheimer's team studied . baboons living on the edge of human settlements, and found that despite . eating different combinations of foods every day the apes achieved a . consistent balance where 20 per cent of their energy needs came from . protein. Other studies found that spider monkeys and . orang-utans, too, foraged for a balanced diet. But when seasonal . availability of some foods prevented them from getting a balanced diet, . they prioritised getting the right amount of protein even if this meant . eating too much or too little fats and carbohydrates. The researchers concluded that measuring a food's nutritional content by its calorie count was too simplistic, and that overall achieving the correct nutritional balance of proteins, carbohydrates and fats was more important. When foods are nutritionally balanced, there is no competition . between these appetite systems, and when one nutrient requirement is . satisfied, so too are the others. Many foods however, are unbalanced and . have a higher or lower proportion of protein to carbohydrate than is required. Therefore, to obtain the right amount of protein it may be necessary to over or under-eat fats and carbohydrates. The researchers are currently investigating how the balance . of carbohydrates and fats affects the health of laboratory mice. Professor Raubenheimer concluded with his own advice for dietary . health. 'A simple rule for healthy eating is to avoid processed foods – . the closer to real foods the better,' he said. 'Whilst it is clear that humans are . generalist feeders, no human population has until recently encountered . ""ultra-processed foods"" – made from industrially extracted sugars, . starches and salt.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A frail 97-year-old care patient had human excrement smeared on his nose by a nurse who scolded him for being incontinent, a jury was told. Care home worker Barbara Kowalska is accused of ranting at elderly cancer patient Albert Inggall, calling him 'dirty and filthy' before shouting at him: 'If you do this again you’ll be eating s*** cake.' The 34-year-old nurse, who was working at the BUPA-run Donnington Care Home, in Donnington, near Newbury, Berkshire denies a single count of the neglect of a person with mental incapacity. Accusation: Barbara Kowalska, a nurse at the BUPA-run Donnington Care Home, near Newbury, is accused of smearing human excrement on an elderly patient's nose . The jury at Reading Crown Court heard that Kowalska had got the human excrement on her gloves as she helped clean up dementia sufferer Mr Inggall, who had no control over his bowel and bladder and also needed help to get around, eat and dress himself. She then deliberately rubbed her faeces-covered finger on his nose, the jury was told. The registered nurse had been called to help care assistant Tina Braybrooke clean up the elderly man, who had been living at the care home for more than two years. Because of his failing state of mind Mr Inggall had been made subject under the Mental Capacity Act as having no ability to decide his own care. Michael Williams, prosecuting, told the jury that the incident happened between August 24 and 28 2012. Evidence: The jury at Reading Crown Court (pictured) heard that Kowalska had got the human excrement on her gloves as she helped clean up dementia sufferer Mr Inggall, who had no control over his bowel and bladder . 'Tina Braybrooke recalls her coming into the room and ranting that Mr Inggall was dirty and filthy,' he said. 'She told Mr Inggall who was sitting in his chair ""if you do this again you’ll be eating s*** cake"". 'She said she was upset that he was spoken to in this way but felt to scared to say anything to Miss Kowalska.' As the pair began cleaning up Mr Inggall and got him onto a commode before putting him back to bed, Kowalska made the indignant act. 'During the cleaning up Miss Kowalska had got faeces on her glove and Tina Braybrooke describes her using her finger to smear faeces on Mr Inggall’s nose,' said the prosecuter. Miss Braybrooke reported the incident to another colleague and the matter was then reported to police by the home’s general manager. After her arrest, Kowalska, formerly of Newbury, told police she had held up a pan of faeces to Mr Inggall’s face because he was asking about what was going on. She said was not aware anything had got onto his nose. The trial continues.

"By . Ashley Collman . The American couple who were rescued at sea earlier this year in order to get medical attention for their sick baby, have come forward to address critics who have called them bad parents. Eric and Charlotte Kaufman were on a sailing trip from Mexico to New Zealand last April with their two young daughters when their 1-year-old Lyra got sick. When Lyra's condition deteriorated, and their satellite phone failed, the couple was forced to activate their boat's emergency beacon, triggering an expensive Coast Guard rescue. Many have criticized the Kaufmans for bringing such young children along on a long sailing trip, but now the couple are speaking up, saying they did everything right and it was the satellite phone company that is to blame. Scroll down for video . We're good parents: Charlotte and Eric Kaufman have defended their decision to bring their young daughters on a sailing trip earlier this year. The family had to be rescued in April when 1-year-old daughter Lyra needed medical attention . 'We’re both experienced sailors,' Mrs Kaufman told ABC News. 'We’ve raised our daughters on a sailboat.' 'We were very prepared,' she added. 'We knew what we were doing.' The couple say they now plan to sue the satellite cellphone company - Whenever Communications, LLC - for abruptly deactivating their phone while they were 1,000 miles from shore. While the phone worked when the initially called a doctor about Lyra's condition, service stopped after the Kaufmans communicated with the Coast Guard and expected to receive a call back. Not our fault: The Kaufmans are blaming their satellite cellphone company for deactivating their phone. If it had been working, they say they wouldn't have needed to turn on their emergency beacon, triggering an expensive Coast Guard rescue . Homeless: The 36-foot sailboat named the Rebel Heart had to be sunk after their rescue. It was their home for the previous eight years . They tried turning the phone off and on but couldn't get through. Eventually they made the decision to activate their emergency beacon so that Lyra could get the medical attention she needed. The cellphone company has since issued a statement saying there was a billing problem with the Kaufman's account. 'I think the evidence clearly represents that they did what they did and that was the action that ultimately started a chain of events,' Eric Kaufman told 10 News. The couple and daughters Lyra and Cora, 3, were rescued from their 36-foot sailboat named the Rebel Heart 12 hours after activating the beacon. Adventure: The Kaufmans pictured above returning to dry land with their two little girls. They hope to buy another sailboat and continue their journeys . The Rebel Heart was the Kaufman's home for the previous eight years and had to be sunk once they abandoned it. The family was taken to the USS Vandegrift where little Lyra was treated with more antibiotics. Doctors believe she may have had typhoid of salmonella. The Kaufmans plan to file a civil suit against Whenever Communications later this week, asking for compensation for the loss of their sailboat and money to cover the cost of the expensive military rescue paid by taxpayers. If they win the case, they plan to buy a new sailboat and continue their around-the-world adventures. 'I can't wait to get back,' said Charlotte. 'It's an amazing lifestyle.'","Eric and Charlotte Kaufman took their daughters Lyra, 1, and Cora, 3, on a sailing trip from Mexico to New Zealand last April .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Decay: Pope Francis has attacked Rome's 'moral decay', citing child prostitutes and busy soup kitchens in his adopted home city as examples of society's downfall . Pope Francis has attacked Rome's 'moral decay', citing child prostitutes and busy soup kitchens in his adopted home city as examples of society's downfall. The 77-year-old Pontiff spoke of the 'tremendous pain' he felt over the darker side of the city in an interview to mark the feasts of Saints Peter and Paul. He also hit out at economic struggles, unemployment and Italy's falling birth rate, as well as expressing the view that communists had 'stolen' the flag of Christianity. Describing the exploitation of children as something that makes him 'suffer', the Pope told Rome-based newspaper Il Messaggero that he had been sickened to learn that in his native Buenos Aires there were girls as young as 12 working as prostitutes. 'It made me sick. But even more so to see the powerful cars driven by old men pull up,' he told the newspaper's Vatican correspondent Franca Giansoldati. 'They could have been their grandfathers. The little girl would be made up and the men would pay 15 pesos which would go towards buying drugs. 'For me, the people who do this to girls are are paedophiles. 'It also happens in Rome. The Eternal City, which should be a beacon in the world, is a mirror of society's moral decay.' Asked whether he was more afraid of the moral degradation, or the material poverty of a city, Francis said that both made him 'afraid', adding that people were having to turn to soup kitchens in Rome in order to feed their families. 'An auxiliary bishop of Rome told me that many people go to the soup kitchen and in secret, full of shame, take home food,' he said. The Pope also blamed Europe's economic struggles for a falling birth rate, both in Italy and other European countries as people worried they could not afford to start a family. 'People are afraid of losing their jobs or not being able to pay the rent,' he said. Scroll down for video . Meeting: Pope Francis poses during his meeting with President of Madagascar Hery Rajaonarimampianina at the Vatican on Saturday . 'Social policy does not help. Italy has a very low birth rate, and in Spain it is the same. France is a bit better, but it is also low. 'It is as if Europe has grown tired of being a mother, and would instead prefer to be a grandmother. 'Much of this is caused by the economic crisis, not just from a cultural shift marked by selfishness and hedonism.' But the Pontiff did have some positive marks for his new home, saying he found the people of Rome 'really likeable'. 'I wish for them not to lose their joy, hope, and faith, despite the difficulties,' he said. Pope Francis was also asked about a blog post in the Economist magazine, which described him as sounding like a Leninist due to his criticism of capitalism and calls for economic reform. Children: Pope Francis, who hugged a group of children during his audience in St Peter's Square last week, blamed Europe's economic struggles for Italy's falling birth rate . 'I can only say that the communists have . stolen our flag. The flag of the poor is Christian. Poverty is at the . centre of the Gospel,' he said, citing Biblical passages about the need . to help the poor, the sick and the needy. 'Communists say that all this is communism. Sure, twenty centuries later. So when they speak, one can say to them: ""but then you are Christian"",' he said. Since his election in March 2013, Francis has often attacked the global economic system as being insensitive to the poor and not doing enough to share wealth with those who need it most. On Sunday Francis led his first major public ceremony since health problems forced a spate of cancelled appointments, and appeared to hold up well during the 90-minute Mass in St Peter's Basilica to honour Saints Peter and Paul. The Vatican has played down the cancellations, including one at the last minute on Friday, attributing them without elaboration to some mild health problem. Concerns: Since his election in March 2013, Francis has often attacked the global economic system as being insensitive to the poor and not doing enough to share wealth with those who need it most . Francis chatted with each of 24 archbishops kneeling before him to receive a white woollen band symbolising shared episcopal power. He later addressed the faithful gathered in St Peter's Square and appealed for Iraq's leaders to save the nation from further warfare. Francis then did what he has started doing recently when greeting the public - asking for prayers for him, too. 'Please don't forget to pray for me,' he said. These requests for prayers, combined with his recent quip that a pope's job could be unhealthy and the cancellation of several appointments in the last few weeks, fuelled concern that perhaps Francis was seriously ill. The Vatican insisted on Friday 'there are no reasons to worry about the pope's health'.","Pontiff, 77, speaks out about his 'tremendous pain' over darker side of Rome .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Australian investigators have discovered evidence of a mysterious power cut during the early part of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight. The findings by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau raises questions over whether the plane's cockpit equipment had been tampered with, possibly in an attempt to avoid being picked up by radar. In the report, crash investigators reveal that the missing Boeing 777's satellite data unit had unexpectedly tried to log on to a satellite, around an hour and a half after the flight left from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. Scroll down for video . Investigation: A US naval vessel searches for missing flight MH370. Australian investigators have discovered evidence of a mysterious power cut during the early part of the plane's journey . This request, known as a 'handshake', was likely to have been caused by a power failure on board, the 55-page report says. 'A log-on request in the middle of a flight is not common and can occur for only a few reasons,' the report states. 'These include a power interruption to the aircraft satellite data unit (SDU), a software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. 'An analysis was performed which determined that the characteristics and timing of the logon requests were best matched as resulting from power interruption to the SDU.' Hunt: The new phase of the search could take more than a year and involves mapping 23,000 square miles of ocean, while the previous search area was only 330 square miles . Aviation safety expert David Gleave from . Loughborough University says the power interruption could have been . caused by someone in the cockpit trying to turn off the plane's . communications systems to avoid being picked up by radar. 'It could be a deliberate act to switch off both engines for some time,' he told the Telegraph. 'By messing about within the cockpit you could switch off the power temporarily and switch it on again when you need the other systems to fly the aeroplane.' He added: 'There are credible mechanical failures that could cause it. But you would not then fly along for hundreds of miles and disappear in the Indian Ocean.' British satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat has confirmed there was a power outage on the plane, but has been unable to say why this happened. Investigation: Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss shows the new search area in the Indian Ocean for the missing aircraft last week . According to crash investigators who . compiled the report, the plane had tried a further six times to log-on . to satellites, including once at 2.25am, just three minutes after it was . picked up by Malaysian radar as it flew north of the island of Sumatra, . having diverted from its planned course to Beijing. The final attempt at a handshake is believed to have been caused by the plane crashing into the Indian Ocean. Details of the report, released last Thursday, also suggest that the passengers and crew are most likely to have died from suffocation as the plane coasted into the ocean on autopilot. Investigators arrived at the conclusion after comparing conditions on the flight with previous disasters. Last week it was announced the Australian-led search will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the Indian Ocean, as the report had narrowed down the possible final resting place from thousands of possible routes, while noting the absence of communications, the steady flight path and a number of other key abnormalities in the course of the ill-fated flight. Mystery: Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard. Pictured is another Malaysia Airlines plane at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, five days after MH370 disappeared . 'Given these observations, the final . stages of the unresponsive crew/hypoxia event type appeared to best fit . the available evidence for the final period of MH370's flight when it . was heading in a generally southerly direction,' the ATSB report said. Officials said this suggested the plane was most likely to have crashed further south than previously thought. They . said they are confident the Boeing 777, carrying 239 people, was set to . autopilot several hours before its demise into desolate and unmapped . waters. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said: 'It is highly, highly likely that the aircraft was on autopilot otherwise it could not have followed the orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings.' Suspect: Malaysian police have named pilot Zaharie Shah, 53, as the prime suspect behind the plane's disappearance . Investigators . say what little evidence they have to work with suggests the plane was . deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route . before eventually plunging into the Indian Ocean. The . search was narrowed in April after a series of acoustic pings thought . to be from the plane's black box recorders were heard along a final arc . where analysis of satellite data put its last location. But a month later, officials conceded the wreckage was not in that concentrated area, some 1,000 miles off the northwest coast of Australia, and the search area would have to be expanded. The next phase of the search is expected to start in August and take a year, covering some 60,000 sq km at a cost of A$60 million ($56 million) or more. The search is already the most expensive in aviation history. The new priority search area is around 2,000km west of Perth, a stretch of isolated ocean frequently lashed by storm force winds and massive swells. Two vessels, one Chinese and one from Dutch engineering company Fugro, are currently mapping the sea floor along the arc, where depths exceed 5,000 metres in parts. A tender to find a commercial operator to conduct the sea floor search closes today. Malaysian police have named pilot Zaharie Shah, 53, as the prime suspect behind the plane's disappearance after officers discovered files on his home flight simulator showing he practiced landing on small airfields, including several in the Indian Ocean. The files had been deleted from the computer before officials seized it, but have since been recovered by detectives. The criminal inquiry completed intelligence checks on all of the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur, but the only individual arousing suspicion was Captain Zaharie.","Missing plane's satellite data unit tried to log-on to a satellite, report reveals .

"By . Lucy Crossley . France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, has agreed to pay around £5.2 billion in compensation to resolve criminal allegations that it breached U.S. trade sanctions against blacklisted countries. After months of negotiations the bank admitted violating sanctions by processing billions of dollars in illegal transactions on behalf of clients in Sudan, Cuba and Iran. The transactions, which prosecutors say . were processed through BNP's New York branch office between 2004 and 2012, were handled at the same time as human rights abuses - . including the genocide in Sudan - were occurring in those countries. Scroll down for video . Compensation: France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, has agreed to pay around £5.2 billion to resolve criminal allegations that it breached U.S. trade sanctions against blacklisted countries . Sanctions had been imposed on the countries by the U.S. in order to block . their participation in the global financial system. The U.S. Justice Department announced yesterday that the bank had admitted state charges in New York, and it is understood to be planning a further guilty . plea in federal court next month. 'Sanctions are a key tool in protecting U.S. national security interests, but they only work if they are strictly enforced,' said Attorney General Eric Holder. 'If sanctions are to have teeth, violations must be strictly punished.' The aim of such sanctions is to cut off an enemy nation's access to banks and other sources of capital, limiting its economic growth and ability to buy weapons, food and other items available through global trade. The restrictions on dealings with sanctioned countries generally apply to U.S. banks and foreign banks with U.S. operations. Court date: BNP Paribas lawyers Georges Dirani and Karen Patton Seymour, leave the New York state Supreme Court after the bank pleaded guilty and agreed to pay the sum . Sum: The deal, worth around $8.9 billion, or £5.2 billion, is the largest sanctions case brought by the Justice Department and the largest penalty in any criminal case involving a bank . The deal, worth around $8.9 billion, or £5.2 billion, is the largest sanctions case brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the largest penalty in any criminal case involving a bank. Prosecutors say the penalty was necessary not only because of the sheer volume of the illicit transactions but also because of the bank's efforts to hide them and executives' lack of cooperation with the Justice Department. In recent weeks, as the BNP deal inched closer, French officials had expressed deep concern about the punishment. They lobbied for White House intervention and warned that a large penalty could affect the entire European economy and hold up a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement. The French economy minister last week asked the Justice Department to be 'fair and proportionate' when deciding on the potential penalty. President Francois Hollande wrote to the Obama administration in April asking for a 'reasonable' solution, but the US President deflected calls to get involved in the dispute. Request: President Hollande (left) wrote to the Obama administration in April asking for a 'reasonable' solution, but the US President (right) deflected calls to get involved in the dispute . Purpose: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured) said that sanctions were a 'key tool in protecting U.S. national security interests', and needed to be enforced . On . Monday, Paris-based BNP entered a guilty plea in state court in New . York City to falsifying business records. The bank is expected to plead . guilty in federal court on July 9 for conspiring to violate the . International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading With the . Enemy Act. It has also agreed to fire multiple senior executives and will lose its ability to process certain transactions in U.S. dollars for one year. No individual BNP executives were charged. 'We deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement,' Jean-Laurent Bonnafe, CEO of BNP, said in a statement. Probe: Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said the investigation into BNP started with a tip off to his office . 'The failures that have come to light . in the course of this investigation run contrary to the principles on . which BNP Paribas has always sought to operate.' The . bank said in addition to provisions it has already taken, it will book a . charge of 5.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion, or £4.6 billion) in the . second quarter of this financial year. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said the investigation into BNP started with a tip off to his office. 'It is not hyperbole to say that the most important values in the international community — respect for human rights, peaceful coexistence, and a world free of terrorism — depend in large part on the effectiveness of these sanctions,' he added. In recent years, U.S. authorities have pursued other large foreign banks for sanctions violations, though those matters have been resolved for smaller cash sums. HSBC, Europe's largest bank, agreed to a $1.9 billion, or £1.1 billion, settlement with U.S. and New York authorities in connection with the transfer of billions of dollars on behalf of Iran, Cuba, Libya, Sudan and Myanmar. Standard Chartered paid $340 million (£199 million) in a settlement with New York state regulators, who accused the bank of scheming with the Iranian government to launder billions of dollars. The bank also paid $327 million (£191 million) to settle U.S. and New York charges related to currency transactions for Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan and Burmese entities, that were said to have been concealed from regulators. In two separate similar investigations in France, authorities are also looking at Credit Agricole and Societe Generale, according to those involved in the probe. Together with BNP Paribas, they constitute France's top three banks. The BNP announcement comes weeks after Credit Suisse struck a $2.6 billion (£1.5 billion) plea deal with the Justice Department for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes. Shortly before that case was brought, Mr Holder — whose Justice Department has been accused of not being aggressive enough in confronting bank misconduct — issued a video message declaring that no bank was too large to prosecute.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A new royal portrait of the Duke of Cambridge, inspired by the second-in-line to the throne's role as a father is due to be unveiled today. The oil-on-canvas piece, entitled Fatherhood, will be revealed this afternoon at the . Wales Office in Whitehall to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the . outbreak of the First World War. Measuring 3ft by 2ft, the painting depicts the Duke - who became a father to .

Inspired: This new portrait of the Duke of Cambridge, inspired by his role as a father is due to be unveiled today . It was painted by Welsh artist Dan . Llywelyn Hall, whose portrait of the Queen last year was criticised as . looking like a Spitting Image puppet. The work is based on a meeting at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff when William viewed Mr Hall's portrait of the Queen called Icon, commissioned by the Welsh Rugby Union. 'Fatherhood is a portrait about a universal theme: the concerns, hopes and aspirations of a family man,' said Mr Hall. New role: The Duke became a father to Prince George last year. The pair are pictured during the recent royal tour of Australia . Happy family: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their baby son, and the couple's dog Lupo . 'On the centenary of the Somme where such horror consumed the lives of over a million people it seems appropriate to support two charities that uphold the memory and acknowledge the legacy of our forefathers.' The portrait will be put up for auction at the First World War centenary sale at Bonhams on October 1, with all proceeds going to The Victoria Cross Trust and War Memorials Trust. Frances Moreton, director of the War Memorials Trust, said: 'As we approach the centenary of the First World War up to 10 per cent of war memorials may be in need of careful repair and conservation. 'Donations such as this will enable the charity to help many more local communities appropriately cherish our shared national war memorial heritage.' Tender: Painter Dan Llywelyn Hall said his portrait was intended to capture the homes, concerns and aspirations of a family man . Cardiff-born Mr Hall, 33, graduated from art school in 2003 before being awarded The Sunday Times Young Artist of the Year. His portraits of First World War veterans Henry Allingham and Harry Patch were displayed at Windsor Castle and The National Portrait Gallery and are now a permanent feature in the Royal Collection and the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath. He is also the youngest person ever to paint the Queen, though his interpretation of the monarch last year prompted a mixed reaction. Asked to respond to the criticisms made against his work, Hall replied: 'Well I'm with Oscar Wilde on this, I would say it's the role of the artist to educate the critic and the role of the critic to educate the public. 'So for me it's just a matter of rolling with the punches.'","Oil-on-canvas painting will be revealed at the Wales Office in Whitehall today .

"By . Tamara Abraham . A crisp white shirt is a wardrobe essential, but its pale color means that one must typically wear a frumpy nude bra beneath. That's not the only option, though, argue the experts at lingerie boutique Intimacy. In fact, one can wear a racy red bra under a white shirt or tee, and no-one will be any the wiser. Nicole Willis, bra fit stylist at the store on Madison Avenue in New York, tells MailOnline that the hue works well with many skin tones - but the darker one's skin, the better it works. Ladies in red: The staff at the Intimacy boutique on New York's Madison Avenue demonstrate how scarlet bras look invisible under white shirts . 'It's really a fun way to get you out of . the routine of wearing boring, nude bras and incorporate some colors . back into your wardrobe to wear on a more regular basis,' she said. Staff at the chain, which is affiliated . with the UK's venerable Rigby & Peller, swear by the idea - to the . degree that they posed for a photo to prove it. As promised, the only glimpses of red seen are the straps the ladies chose to expose. Ms Willis also shared her words of wisdom on the bras that every woman should own. Of the four styles that she most recommends, she says that a plunge bra is vital for when one is wearing V-necks and wrap dresses. A lace bra, she continues, boasts form and function as it is best for centering and lifting the breasts under fitted garments like button-down shirts and tailored dresses. Other essentials include a perfectly-fitting strapless bra and the all-important sports bra. 'Women should have the most breast . support while working out and should never have to wear two bras to get . it,' Ms Willis said.","Nicole Willis, a bra fit stylist for Intimacy in New York, says the hue works .

"By . Zoe Nauman . Seven's Sunrise team has hit back at reports co-host David Koch was in the firing line to get axed from the show. A story which ran in The Australian and was then repeated again on Channel Nine's A Current Affair suggested the presenter was about to get the boot in a line up change back in 2011. However the story was rubbished by the Sunrise breakfast team on Tuesday as a 'big steaming pile of poo.' Scroll down for video . Setting the story straight: David Koch hit back at claims on Sunrise on Tuesday he had faced the axe on the Channel Seven show . The war of words started with an article in The Australian on Monday, which detailed an email sent by the former executive producer of Sunrise Adam Boland while he was still working at the Seven network three years ago. He advised getting rid of 'Kochie' and said reinvigorating the morning line up would potentially help ratings. After the story ran on A Current Affair on Monday night, Koch, 58, was barraged by worried viewers, thinking he was about to get the boot from Sunrise. Cruel comments: Kochie's use of the word 'sane' when trying to defend himself was seen by some viewers as a dig at Adam Boland's mental health issues . He addressed the rumours on the breakfast show on Tuesday saying: 'Well no. That (the email) was in 2011 from a bloke who had moved on and saner heads prevailed.' Samantha Armytage added: 'Of course they were sane,' with the team laughing in unison. Co-host Natalie Barr then got involved in the conversation saying: 'Brilliant minds stepped in.' Koch said: 'He wasn't looking at anything because [Boland] wasn't in charge of this show at the time. 'He was simply sending an email with his thoughts. Thoughts that were rejected by those actually running the joint.' But not all of the Sunrise team seemed to be happy to take the story so calmly, with his co hosts appearing exasperated. On the defence: The Sunrise team laughed at the story of line up changes, with Samantha Armytage saying it was a 'pile of poo' Armytage, 36, who replaced Melissa Doyle, 44,  earlier this year, rolled her eyes saying: 'I cannot believe that we have given this (claim) more airtime. It's such a big steaming pile of poo.' However Koch's remarks were taken by some as a dig at Boland's issues with mental illness - he has struggled with bi-polar for a number of years. The presenter used the word 'sane' and was seen to be mocking the former Sunrise executive producer. He took to twitter to defend himself saying: 'In defending the ACA story I innocently used a common turn of phrase which has caused offense to some. I am sorry. That wasn't my intension.' Armytage also posted an apology saying: Apologies to all about this morning's poor choice of words. My grandfather was bipolar. I would NEVER make light of it.' The Australian initally ran the story regarding Boland on Monday - saying it had been given access to an email sent from Boland to Seven's then head of news and current ­affairs, Peter Meakin, and chief executive David Leckie, with a couple of other executives. He outlined his ideas to reinvigorate the show saying: 'Sydney and Melbourne are already gone and we’re on the verge of losing Brisbane. We can’t be a show held up by Adelaide and Perth!' New show: Boland was behind Channel Tens new morning show Wake Up - presented by Natarsha Belling and James Mathison . Boland, 36, was at this point in a senior role at the network and said the line-up change should be in place for the first day of non-ratings with 'new hosts, new set and new format.' He said: 'It is my view the hosts should be Matt White and Kylie Gillies. I think Kylie has ­proven her star ability on TMS (The Morning Show). It’s unfair to judge her alongside Kochie. 'Kochie could arrange a breakfast radio shift for next year if we give him enough notice.' The story broke on the same day ABC ran its Australian story profile on Boland - where he revealed he had considered committing suicide due to his mental illness issues. The former TV wunderkind jumped ship from Seven to Channel Ten in March 2013 and was employed to revive the networks breakfast format. Boland has struggled for years to cope with his bipolar disorder, a condition which sees sufferers experience extreme highs and lows. Tv wunderkind: He also came up with the format for Studio 10 alongside Rob McKnight - it's presented by Ita Buttrose Jessica Rowe Joe Hildebrand and Sarah Harris . In the program he revealed he had a mental breakdown just days after the Channel Ten launched its new morning line up - which includes Wake Up and Studio 10. Boland revealed he briefly contemplated suicide while in his apartment: 'I walked around the bedroom and I looked at the balcony and I thought: ""Yeah, you know, here's a way.""' Instead he woke his partner Kenny Ang and told him he needed to go to hospital. Following the breakdown Boland started taking medication for his illness and returned to work, but by January this year he decided he could not go on. He told Australian story: 'It finally struck me, I wasn't trapped by Channel Seven, I was trapped by television.' Boland's new focus is to find an identity beyond television and advocate on behalf of those with mental illness: There is a stigma and I think the media has a duty to help smash that,' he said. 'Mental illness is as valid as any other illness.' Boland was in New York with his partner when the documentary aired. He tweeted his thanks for the support he has received saying: 'Wow. Really appreciate all of the kind messages. And a special thanks to #australianstory for putting up with me. I hope it helped others.' Partners: Boland with his boyfriend Kenny Ang .","Channel Seven presenters say 'Kochie' was never facing the boot .

"By . Claudia Connell . With their sky-high prices, uni-formed doormen and super-chic staff, it’s not surprising that I had never plucked up the courage to set my decidedly non-designer-shod foot in a designer fashion store. On behalf of ordinary women everywhere, I decided it was time to steel myself and visit some of our poshest shops, to discover just how high-end brands treat a High Street size 12-14 like me. Armed with some questions that should suggest I’m not quite as well-heeled as their usual customer, I set off to measure my reception on a scale from friendly to frosty. The list was simple: do they stock a size 16? What is their cheapest item? And do they, ahem, offer discounts? Just for fun, I threw in a few extra requests: would they take a photo of me wearing one of their outfits? Could I use their loo? And where is the nearest Primark store? The results were hilarious, surprising and rather illuminating in equal measure... Scroll down or video . Claudia Connell could fit into a size 12 at Alexander McQueen . Claudia said that the staff at Mulberry were 'snooty and unhelpful' Alexander McQueen . The British brand chosen to make Kate Middleton’s beautiful wedding dress, Alexander McQueen is known for its high-end and edgy street fashion. Their shop is smaller than the others and decked out in neutral shades, and the staff are smiley and chatty. One assistant tells me that, sadly, 14 is their biggest size, but reassures me by saying: ‘Don’t worry, we cut much more generously than the French labels.’ I ask to try on a £620 red wool dress and am shown to a small but luxurious changing room with thick pile carpets. The assistant tells me that I will absolutely fit into a size 12, and she’s right. She even brings me some gorgeous black stilettos to try on with the dress. While taking my photo, she even tells me how  to pose. The dress looks amazing and I’m tempted to splurge, but it’s only £100 less than my monthly mortgage. Their cheapest items are T-shirts or leggings for £395 each, which  I’m assured are  ‘amazing quality’. I’m politely refused a discount (‘Gosh, no, I really wish I could’), but they’re happy for me to use the staff loo. And, after directing me to the nearest Primark, she tells me not to go at lunchtime when ‘it’s murder’. Frost Factor: 0 . Mulberry . Mulberry staff are famed on online forums for being snooty and unhelpful, and I understand why as soon as I walk through the door when a male assistant looks at me as though I’ve just trodden in dog mess. Inside, everyone is fussing around a group of Chinese customers who appear to be buying by the rail. I, meanwhile, am ignored. While the website claims clothes come in sizes small, medium and large, the small looks as though it might fit a Barbie doll, medium a Barbie that’s let herself go, and there are no large sizes on display at all. No wonder the unfriendly male assistant looks aghast when I ask for a 16. Their biggest size, he says, is a 12-14 and even that, apparently, comes up small. When I say nothing will probably fit me, he agrees bluntly: ‘No, probably not.’ Nevertheless, I ask to try on a £1,900 cream raincoat that’s far too tight for me. He refuses to take my photo in the article (‘we don’t allow photography’, so my picture here is taken outside the shop) or give me a discount, and my request to use the lavatory is declined as, apparently, it’s mysteriously ‘not available at this time’. I don’t hold out much hope when I ask for the nearest Primark and, sure enough, the sales assistant has ‘absolutely no idea’, even though we’re only a five-minute stroll  from one of the UK’s biggest branches. Frost Factor: 10 . The cheapest item in YSL was a £290 plain white top . Claudia was ignored by the staff in Prada . YSL . Known for its chic, classic styles, French designer store YSL is decked out in black with soft lighting and stripped floorboards. A young male assistant tells me size 12 is their largest and ‘that’s probably more like a ten’. When I ask what the size 16 people are supposed to wear, he just shrugs and says: ‘They don’t tend to come in, to be honest.’ You don’t say. I ask to try a £1,960 jacket in a size 12 that I am a good two inches away from being able to button up. Unbelievably, the assistant pushes the sale, saying: ‘I don’t think this is a style that necessarily needs to fasten.’ He may not, but for two grand I expect my clothes to fit. Not even the cheapest item in the shop — a £290 plain white cotton top — looks as if it would do the honours. As he takes a photo, I hint that a reduction might persuade me to buy, but he says it’s company policy not to offer discounts. Though I’m escorted to the staff loo — behind a scruffy stockroom piled high with boxes of shoes and handbags — I suspect this is more about making sure I don’t pinch anything than making it easy for me. When I ask about Primark, I swear he shakes his head in a ‘Well, if that’s where you usually shop, what the hell are you doing in here?’ kind of way. But, to his credit, he does give me directions. Frost Factor: 5 . Prada . Even though there are few customers, I’m ignored by the staff in this huge Italian store. The rails are heaving with the sort of bejewelled dresses that I can only imagine Ivana Trump wearing, and the cheapest item is an ordinary-looking striped T-shirt for £530. There’s no size 16. In fact, I’m told abruptly the biggest size is a 12, because ‘our customers are very petite’. To make matters worse, when I ask for anything that will fit me, I’m told: ‘We’ve got stretchy dresses; one of those might.’ I try on one costing £1,130 in a small changing room that is a bit dirty. There’s a tissue on the floor and the mirror is smeared with hand prints. I’m not offered champagne. Worse, the dress strains across my bust — posh designers really seem to have it in for women with breasts. As the sales girl takes a photo, I tell her there’s a mark on the dress and ask for a discount. She tells me she’ll fetch another, but when I say I’d prefer money off, she’s perplexed: ‘Why would you want a dirty dress when  you can have a  clean one?’ They let me use their loo, which is in the basement, but by the time I start quizzing them about Primark, it’s obvious I’m not buying. The sales assistant claims ignorance before rushing off to serve someone else. Frost Factor: 7 . Chanel stock both a size 16 and a size 18 dress size . The staff at Gucci were all keen to tell Claudia how great she looked . Chanel . Coco CHANEL famously said a woman can never be too thin or too rich. I can safely say  I’m the only person in this shop who is neither. I head up a huge, sweeping marble staircase, where I’m met by a friendly sales assistant who tells me they do, indeed, stock size 16, as well as 18. Most of the items don’t carry price tags and I sense the typical customer doesn’t ask how much things cost. Even the staff aren’t sure what their cheapest item is, but think it might be a shirt for £600. Asking to try on a metallic leather skirt for £1,140, I’m directed to a huge changing room — bigger than my living room — decorated with modern art, and offered a glass of champagne on a silver tray. I’m delighted when I just about get a size 12 buttoned up and the assistant is more than happy to take a snap on my phone. There’s no joy on my request for a discount, but they show me to the lovely customer toilets. As for Primark, the assistant hasn’t a clue and asks a colleague who, in turn, asks another. I wonder if this is the first time the word ‘Primark’ has been uttered on the floor of Chanel. Frost Factor: 4 . Gucci . Peering through the glass, I see staff who look as though they should be modelling the designer  clothes rather than selling them. As with every store I have visited, only the smallest sizes are on display, the bigger ones in purdah out the back. The friendly Italian assistant informs me that 14 is their biggest size, but she thinks they will introduce size 16 soon ‘because people keep asking’. The cheapest thing I can buy is a T-shirt for £295. I ask to try on an over-the-top shiny pink suit. I’m offered a refreshment and as it’s early I forgo the champers on offer for orange juice, which is brought on a wooden tray along with a single flower in a vase. The £815 size 12 trousers fit around the waist but are about a foot too long. The only £1,440 jacket they have is a size ten, and it’s far too tight. I rather like a terracotta silk shirt but at £410 it’s out of my price range. The whole ensemble makes me look like a reject from Saturday Night Fever, but the staff all gather to tell me how fantastic I look. When I ask about a discount, the assistant says: ‘If you bought the entire outfit I could probably get you something off.’ No chance! There’s a customer toilet and everyone is happy to direct me  to Primark. Frost Factor: 0 .","Claudia Connell has a real-woman body shape and is a high street 12-14 dress size .

Mealtime favourite HP Sauce has beaten products including Marmite and tomato ketchup to be named the bran that Britons have the greatest 'emotional connection' with, according to a new study. The nation has a greater affinity to the famous brown sauce than anything else bought from supermarket shelves. Marmite, Heinz Tomato Ketchup and treats . such as Jaffa Cakes and Ribena also made the top ten in a list compiled . from a survey of 5,000 shoppers. Best of British: HP Sauce has beaten products including Marmite and tomato ketchup to be named the bran that Britons have the greatest 'emotional connection' with . Instead of simply asking which products they bought, advertising agency Leo Burnett asked shoppers about brands they had an affinity to, trusted the most and felt an emotional connection with. HP, the brown sauce with the familiar picture of the Palace of Westminster on the label, topped the list. It was first made in Nottingham by  grocer Frederick Gibson Garton in the late 19th century using a combination of malt vinegar, spices and dates as a spicy accessory to meals. The HP name was registered in 1895. Love it or hate it: More people are fans of Marmite than not, as the condiment came second in the list of brands .

Ribena juice drink . 5. Jaffa Cakes . 6. Ben & Jerry's ice cream . 7. Cadbury's Dairy Milk . 8. Schweppes . 9. Heinz Salad Cream . 10. Lurpak . Mr Garton called his new sauce HP because he had heard that a restaurant in the Houses of Parliament had begun serving it. Now owned by Heinz, the sauce is a favourite with fried breakfasts, bacon butties and sausage rolls though, like Marmite in second place on the list, often divides opinion. Leo Burnett head of insights Mike Treharne said Britons felt a 'brand empathy' to the product but also appreciated its taste - the feelings are more than loyalty for loyalty's sake. 'Popular brands have a DNA which, if decoded, can be identifed, replicated and accelerated,' he said. 'Affinity is measured by customer responses such as trust, having an emotional connection, brand empathy and appreciation of quality.' Giles Jepson, VP marketing for Heinz Europe, added: 'The Heinz brand has meaning beyond the product. 'Trust and being 'in touch with what I want' are both key elements that support its popularity. 'We know that our brand has a trong consumer reputation which we continue to build on via communications by deepening our emotional connections, reflecting how we are part of the fabric of people's lives.'","5,000 shoppers quizzed by advertising agency on their favourite food brands .

"By . Erin Clements . American Eagle Outfitters has been accused of using a street artist's designs without permission. Miami, Florida-based David Anasagasti filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that his signature eyeball images appeared in the store' s spring campaign - including its advertising, billboards, store displays, social media and website - without any credit or compensation. Mr Anasagasti, also known by the moniker AholSniffsGlue, is seeking actual damages, infringement-related profits and an injunction prohibiting further use of the artwork in question. Eyes wide open: American Eagle Outfitters is accused of using a motif designed by Miami street artist David Anasagasti in its spring 2014 advertising (pictured) Artist's statement: Mr Anasagasti, pictured, is 'not painting for a corporation. He's painting because he loves it,' says his agent . 'Given that he hails from the . counter-culture world of underground street artists, Mr. Anasagasti's . reputation as an artist has been founded, in part, on a public . perception that (he) doesn’t ""sell out"" to large corporate interests,' the lawsuit stated. MailOnline contacted American Eagle, and a spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit. Mr . Anasagasti's murals depicting rows of sleepy eyes can be seen in . Miami's Wynwood Arts District, where American Eagle's promotional images . were allegedly shot. One of his works appears in the above portrait of the artist, shot by Giulio Sciorio. One billboard shows a male model leaping over a fire hydrant in front of what appears to be Mr Anasagasti's  Ocean Grown mural, commissioned by Miami's Ocean Grown Glass Gallery. 'Ahol is not painting for a corporation. He’s painting because he loves it,' his agent, Gregg Shienbaum, told Reuters, adding that the trademark eyeballs were particularly inappropriate for retail marketing. 'They represent the working class, who struggle and are good people. They may look a little droopy, a little sad, but it's his way of saying, ""You may be down today, but you've got to keep going,""' he said. In your eyes: Two of Mr Anasagasti's works from 2013, Untitled (Table Top) and Untitled (Faces), illustrate his aesthetic . Anti-corporate: The lawsuit states that artist Mr Anasagasti's reputation was founded on a public perception that he doesn't 'sell out' Mr Shienbaum told Miami New Times: 'People from all over the world who visit Wynwood see his mural on 27th Street, then come to the gallery to see his works. I have serious collectors from France, a TV producer from Los Angeles, and a businessman mentioned on Forbes' list of the world's wealthiest people who have seen that mural and been inspired by it to come in and buy one of Ahol's iconic works.' A brief bio on Mr Anasagasti's website reads: 'Ahol, whose raw yet instantly recognizable street murals evaporate the divide between high and low art, often jumbles disparate themes from mass media, popular culture and marginalized pockets of society.' 'He often draws inspiration from the urban environment and systems of society which dehumanize its inhabitants. Ahol’s deceptively simple, yet complex renderings both portray the veneer of our everyday surroundings and the dull, job-related conflicts often encountered in a dysfunctional workplace.' A court date for the lawsuit has not yet been set.","The lawsuit says artist David Anasagasti’s reputation is partly founded on the perception that he doesn't 'sell out'

Maggie Kudirka, a 23-year-old dancer at New York's Joffrey Ballet School, received the devastating diagnosis on June 19 after discovering a large lump at the top of her left breast.

Leap of faith: Maggie Kudirka, a 23-year-old dancer with Stage 4 cancer, launched a social media campaign to help raise funds for her medical treatments . 'Bald Ballerina': Miss Kudirka trains at New York's prestigious Joffrey Ballet School . Miss Kudirka created the Bald Ballerina Facebook page to update family and friends on her condition, and raise awareness for the disease. She subsequently started a fundraising page on Youcaring.com to help pay for medical expenses. 'I want to make people aware that breast cancer can strike anyone, at any age. No one is immune, no one is too young, no one is too fit,' she told Today.com. She uses Facebook to share personal anecdotes and inform friends of her symptoms. Earlier this week, she wrote: 'My dad took me to the gym to work out with personal trainer Diana. It was a great workout, but after about 40 minutes, I got dizzy and light-headed and had to stop.

"By . Candace Sutton . and Jessica Satherley . Olympic swimming champion Grant Hackett is on his way to the United States to enter rehab over his addiction to the prescription drug Stilnox, Mail Online can exclusively reveal. Hackett left Australia on Tuesday afternoon for America to undergo a treatment program for his addiction, following a bizarre incident in which he was filmed half-naked in an Australian hotel foyer. The 33-year-old triple gold medal winning Olympian boarded the flight after a crisis meeting with his family on the Gold Coast. Family support: Grant Hackett (pictured today with his mother, Margaret) flew home to the Gold Coast to see his parents before flying to the US . The Australian flew to his parents, Margaret and Neill's Miami Beach home following the incident. A spokesman for Hackett told Mail Online he was 'taking steps to seek help for a problem he has with Stilnox'. 'His family and friends are enormously proud of his courage in pursuing this course of action,' the spokesman said in a statement for Hackett . This is not the first time Hackett has battled an addiction to the prescription sleeping pill Stilnox and he had a 'heavy reliance' on the drug towards the end of his swimming career, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported in 2012. Hackett told the paper that he was first given the sleeping pills by swimming officials but overused them. 'At one point they scared me. They're evil', Hackett said in 2012. Fellow Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, also admitted in the past to using Stilnox throughout his career and is popular with sporting professionals due to it's 'no hangover effect'. Stilnox, a Zolpiem drug, is also used for anxiety but can be highly addictive if overused. Side effects from the drug have been linked to strange behaviour, hallucinations, impaired judgement and delusions. Seeking treatment: Grant Hackett pictured on Tuesday in the Gold Coast before flying to the US to seek treatment for prescription drug addiction . Stilnox is a Zolpidem drug, that is also sold under the brand name Ambien in the US. It is a prescription anti-anxiety drug and sleeping pill that is given to patients to treat insomnia and anxiety. Side effect can include hallucinations and amnesia. There are more than 13 generic versions of Zolpidem, such as Ambien, Stilnox, Sublinox, Hypnogen and Zolsana. In 2013 the FDA required the manufacturer of Ambien and Zolpimist to half the recommended dosage for women after studies linked it to car accidents from patients being too drowsy and next-morning impairments after taking the drug. Hackett had also been taking Stilnox in 2011 and in 2012 to help him sleep while recovering from a shoulder injury at the time - the same year that he and his then-wife Candice Alley split . The couple separated in an ugly split which followed Hackett's trashing of their luxury  apartment  during Melbourne's 2011 Spring racing carnival in a wild drunken rampage which ended when eight police cars were called to the home. Coupled with Hackett's confessions of a Stilnox addiction and alleged boozy behaviour at a television awards party, Hackett's behaviour has caused concern for the welfare of the dual Olympic gold medal winner. Last month, it was revealed Hackett has found new love with Sydney model, Tahlia Giumelli, a onetime Miss Teen Australia who is 13 years his junior . Hackett has taken leave from his role as a relationships banker with Westpac Australia to seek treatment in the US for addiction and also visited his mother on the Gold Coast and aid with his father's post-operative recovery before his flight Stateside. Panicked search: Grant Hackett searches for his four-year-old son Jagger in foyer of Crown Casino, Melbourne . Recovering from surgery: Grant Hackett's father, Neville, pictured (above, centre) with the swim star's mother, Margaret arriving at Hackett 2007 Melbourne wedding to Candice Alley, is being treated following surgery on a blocked carotid surgery which put the retired policeman at risk of having a stroke . Following Hackett's apartment trashing incident three years ago, Neville Hackett said of his son, 'he's a dickhead, but I love him'. At the time Hackett Sr dismissed reports his son had thrown Candice Alley against a window during the rampage. 'He may have wrecked the joint but he didn't harm anyone,' Neville Hackett said. Hackett Sr is undergoing treatment following surgery to clear a blocked carotid artery, which put the retired policeman at risk of a stroke. Grant, his manager Chris White, his brother Craig and Craig's wife Nicole gathered around Margaret on the Gold Coast yesterday for a family meeting. This follows the latest bizarre incident involving the former swimmer and banking executive. Happier times: Grant Hackett and former wife Candice Alley holiday with their twins, Jagger and Charlize . Marriage breakdown: Grant Hackett with ex-wife Candice Alley in November, 2010, at Melbourne Cup Day before splitting in April, 2012 . Swimming star: Grant Hackett competed in the 1500m freestyle final at the 2008 Beijing Olympics . Moved on: Hackett has found new love with Sydney model, Tahlia Giumelli (pictured, above with Hackett) The Olympian was photographed wandering in the Crown casino foyer wearing a singlet over his underpants. Hackett reportedly wasn't thinking straight as he searched for his four-year-old son, Jagger, who had disappeared from their hotel room. Hackett was driven by fear and panic when he realised his son had vanished. The incident began in the early hours of Saturday morning, when Hackett was staying in a room at the casino with his twins, Jagger and Charlize. In the middle of the night, Hackett was woken by a noise, which may have been the doorbell to his hotel room. Daughter Charlize was beside him, but Jagger was nowhere to be seen. Panicked, and dressed only in underpants and singlet, Hackett removed his singlet, draped it around his underpants and grabbed Charlize under his right arm. The pair took the elevator down to the foyer, which is where they were captured on the casino's CCTV security footage. Unable to find Jagger, Hackett sought assistance from the night desk. The boy was eventually located, unharmed on another floor of the hotel. Hackett regularly stays at the casino while visiting Melbourne for access visits to his children by estranged wife, Candice Alley. Crown Casino has been contacted for comment over the foyer incident.","Former Olympic swimming champion Grant Hackett is battling an addiction to prescription drug Stilnox .

"By . Erin Clements . If you thought the Mocha Frappuccino was the most creative item Starbucks had to offer, then think again. A group of Starbucks baristas in Santa Ana, California, have come up with a decadent new array of beverages, all created using in-store ingredients. The challenge, set by Foodbeast, saw competitors blend frappucinos with baked goods, fresh fruit and of course plenty of coffee. LA Smog: Inspired by the Los Angeles sky, this drink contains green tea frappuccino, a pump of mocha, java chips, espresso, Italian drizzle and espresso whip . Half baked: The Blueberry Breakfast Shake and the Strawberry Shortbread Crumble feature muffins and cookies . One, named LA Smog, combines a green tea Frappuccino with a pump of mocha, java chips, espresso, Italian drizzle and espresso whip to create a murky visual effect. And for those who like to drink their breakfast, the Blueberry Breakfast Shake is topped with a muffin crumble and fresh blueberries. It is a creation tasters were particularly impressed by: 'It tastes as amazing as it sounds and actually didn’t feel too heavy.’ Revisiting the classics: The Neapolitan Frap and Orange County Dream feature time-tested flavor combinations . Shake it up: The Mexican Flag Frap and Apple Pie Frap round out the list of decadent drinks . Unfortunately we’re unlikely to see the Blueberry Breakfast Shake on official Starbucks menus anytime soon - Foodbeast notes that baristas aren't actually permitted to blend baked goods. Another forbidden concoction is the Strawberry Shortbread Crumble, which adds shortbread cookies to the mix – and it’s not the only play on a classic dessert. The strawberry, chocolate and vanilla Neapolitan Frap references 1980s ice cream tubs, while the Orange County Dream gets its creamsicle flavor from the combination of a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino and a Valencia Orange Refresher. The sites notes that there's no guarantee your local Starbucks will attempt to make any of these decadent drinks - though if you get lucky, they will likely cost between $4.25 and $6.75. In May, a Dallas, Texas, man named Andrew Chifari claimed to have created the world's most expensive Starbucks drink, which he called the Sexagintuple Vanilla Bean Mocha Frappuccino. It included 60 shots and was valued at $54.75. MailOnline estimated how many calories each grande-size drink might contain... LA SMOG - 390 calories .

"By . Erin Clements . Despite efforts to stay relevant, Barbie's popularity is on the decline: Mattel has reported a 15per cent drop in sales for the blonde doll in the latest quarter. However, the company saw a 6per cent increase in sales of its American Girl line and also found success with toys associated with Disney's Frozen. While Mattel has attempted to keep the brand up to date with the recent launch of Entrepreneur Barbie - a tech-savvy doll that comes armed with a tiny smartphone and tablet, and even boasts a LinkedIn profile - experts say that Barbie doesn't have a strong enough narrative to capture kids' imaginations. Image problem: Barbie's sales have declined due to competitors with more engaging story lines . American Girl, for example, features 'historical character' dolls accompanied by books that tell of the characters' adventures. Jim Silver, editor of TTPM.com (formerly Time to Play Magazine), says that competitors such as Mattel's Monster High dolls do a better job of engaging children with more complex story lines. 'With Monster High, you have Draculaura, Lagoona Blue, Clawdia Wolf, and they keep developing more characters and more backstories. Barbie is a superstar, but she’s just one character,' he told the New York Daily News. Pure heroine: Elsa, from Disney's beloved animated hit Frozen, has become an increasingly popular doll . A doll's life: American Girl characters, such as Josefina (pictured), feature engaging backstories . He adds: 'Kids are growing up fast, and lines like Monster High are much edgier than Barbie. Girls 3 to 9 used to play with Barbie. Now it’s down to girls 3 to 6. The kids have grown up faster. They’re on iPads. Their fashion is different.' And having turned 55 years old this year, Barbie may have a harder time being viewed as edgy by children whose parents grew up with the doll. Ghoul talk: Monster High dolls are seen as 'edgier' than Barbie, and more appealing to older children . 'Barbie is a very nice girl, very pretty, very clean cut, very Caucasian. But girls very often are not as nice as their mothers would want them to be,' Lutz Muller, owner of toy intelligence firm Klosters Trading Corp. in Williston Hills, Vermont, told Canada's Financial Post, adding: 'What girls are waiting for is another icon, one which is different from the idealized Barbie … which the mothers and grandmothers of current girls played with.' And, of course, it's difficult to compete with Elsa, the heroine of Disney's wildly popular hit Frozen, which has become the highest-grossing animated film of all time since its 2013 release. 'We’re working very hard to literally chase demand' for dolls based on Frozen characters, Mattel CEO Brian Stockton told the New York Post. 'It gets greater and greater every week.'",Experts say Barbie doesn't have a rich enough story line to engage kids as much as competing dolls .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Two University of New Mexico footballers accused of raping a girl in a moving car have been cleared of all charges, it is claimed. Footballers Crusoe . Gongbay, 20, and SaQwan Edwards, 21, along with former student Ryan Ruff, were arrested in April on suspicion of kidnapping and raping the female student in a BMW. But just two months later, the District Attorney's Office has reportedly dismissed the charges against the trio as it does not have enough evidence to indict them. 'Cleared of all charges': University of New Mexico footballers Crusoe Gongbay (right) and SaQwan Edwards (left), along with former student Ryan Ruff, were arrested in April on suspicion of kidnapping and raping a girl . The charges for running back Gongbay . and Ruff were dropped yesterday, while the charges for the UNM Lobo's . cornerback Edwards will reportedly be dismissed later this week, . according to KRQE News 13. However, as authorities are continuing to investigate the case, the situation could yet change. It comes as the trio's lawyers have claimed the alleged victim's story is riddled with holes and the case should be dropped altogether. 'The story that was given by the individual was not truthful. It’s that simple,' said Gongbay's attorney, Robert Cooper. Meanwhile, . Ruff's lawyer, George Anthony Bleus, said he would rather the case went . to trial than be dragged out, saying: 'There will always be those citizens . out there that will say, did they do this?' The . female student contacted campus police at around 3am on April 13 saying . she had been raped by the three men, according to a criminal complaint . cited by Reuters. University: The trio were accused of picking up the girl at the University of New Mexico, before driving off and raping her in a BMW. But two months later, the District Attorney's Office has reportedly dismissed the charges . She . claimed Gongbay, Edwards and Ruff had spotted her outside a house . party, before Ruff 'put his arms around [her] and stated, ""No, she is . coming with us""'. The group . then allegedly drove off together and the two footballers took turns . raping the girl, before Ruff took her to the university campus, where he . reportedly held her at gunpoint and raped her. Gongbay . and Ruff were arrested, followed by Edwards several days later, and the . footballers were swiftly suspended from the UNM's team. Gongbay, a junior at the university, and Ruff were charged with two counts . of second-degree criminal sexual penetration, one count of kidnapping . and one count of conspiracy, police said at the time. On the field: The charges for running back Gongbay (right) and Ruff were dropped yesterday, while the charges for Lobo's cornerback Edwards (left, number 15 in October 2012) will reportedly be dismissed later this week . Meanwhile, Edwards, a senior, was accused of two counts of sexual assault and kidnapping, according to Lieutenant Tim Stump of the University of New Mexico Police Department. Gongbay, who is 6ft, 205lbs and comes from from Rockville, Maryland, was recruited to UNM by former coach Mike Locksley in 2011. After . leading the Lobos in rushing that season, Gongbay intended to follow . Locksley to Maryland but his plans fell through so he asked the new . coach, Bob Davie, if he could return to UNM. Mr Davie . said he was impressed by Gongbay's good academic standing and knew his . teammates liked him so welcomed him back in August 2012. He has played . effectively as a backup running back the past two seasons. In a . statement in April, Davie said he was aware of the allegations and due to . the serious nature of the charges he had had suspended the junior . indefinitely. 'Once this process is complete and all the details have emerged, we will handle the outcome appropriately,' Davie added. It is unclear whether Gongbay and Edwards will now be allowed to rejoin the UNM's team.","Crusoe Gongbay, 20, and SaQwan Edwards, 21, along with former student Ryan Ruff, were arrested in April on suspicion of raping girl in New Mexico .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The diaries of war poet Siegfried Sassoon, stained with mud from the bloody killing fields of the Somme, will be placed online for the first time by Cambridge University today. His collection of 23 journals and two notebooks of poetry from its £1.25million Sassoon Archive include his account of the horrifying slaughter of the first day of the battle. They are recorded in his compact, neat handwriting - and describe 'a sunlit picture of hell'. The diaries of war poet Siegfried Sassoon (left) including the Soldier's Declaration which was later read out in Parliament (right) are to be displayed on the Cambridge University website for the first time . A collection of 23 of Sassoon's journals along with two notebooks, which describe the horror of conflict in vivid detail, were bought by the university for £1.25million . Sassoon's notes on the conflict are often accompanied with drawings, some practical sketches of battlefield, and others distorted sketches showing his state of mind . And in one tiny black notebook he wrote his 'Soldier's Declaration', a damning criticism of the mindless slaughter of the First World War, later read out in Parliament. Cambridge University Librarian Anne Jarvis said: 'The war diaries Sassoon kept on the Western Front and in Palestine are of the greatest significance, both nationally and internationally, and we are honoured to be able to make them available to everyone, anywhere in the world, on the 100th anniversary of the First World War. 'The Sassoon archive is a collection of towering importance, not just to historians, but to anyone seeking to understand the horror, bravery and futility of the First World War as experienced by those on the front lines and in the trenches.' Materials bought by the university in 2009 after fundraising from Sassoon biographer Max Egremont, Sir Andrew Motion, Michael Morpurgo and Sebastian Faulks . While Sassoon's notes begin optimistically, as the war progressed his work became increasingly dark and disturbed as he became disillusioned with the conflict . Around the edges of the notebooks Sassoon carried with him mud from the trenches is still encrusted on to the bindings . The newly published work includes 23 of Sassoon's journals from the years 1915-27 and 1931-32, as well as two poetry notebooks from 1916-18 containing rough drafts and fair copies of some of his best-known war poems. The diaries recall the moment he was shot by a sniper at the Battle of Arras and also include haunting sketches and drawings. The materials were bought by the university in 2009 following a fundraising campaign spearheaded by Sassoon's official biographer Max Egremont, and supported by Sir Andrew Motion, Michael Morpurgo and Sebastian Faulks. The archive can be accessed from today through the Cambridge University digital library at: cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk . The notes are being released on the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Sassoon himself imagined what life would be like 100 years after the war (left). He also used his notes to craft his poetry, such as one entitled 'They' (right) Sasoon's Military Cross, the ribbon of which he threw into the River Mersey . Siegfried Sassoon was born on 8 September 1886 in Kent. His father was part of a Jewish merchant family, originally from Iran and India, and his mother part of the artistic Thorneycroft family. Sassoon studied at Cambridge University but left without a degree. He then lived the life of a country gentleman, hunting and playing cricket while also publishing small volumes of poetry. Motivated by patriotism and a desire to do his duty, Siegfried Sassoon joined the British Army just as the First World War broke out in 1914, and by May the next year was on his way to fight in France with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. In battle he was an inspiring presence, driven to acts of almost suicidal bravery in the face of danger. During one attack on the Hindenburg Line, Sassoon single-handedly captured an enemy trench, earning him the nickname 'Mad Jack'. On 27 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, he was awarded the Military Cross for helping gather dead and wounded soldiers from an enemy trench for an hour and a half despite being constantly shot at and bombed. However, as the war wore on Sassoon became increasingly disillusioned with the conflict. During the Battle of Arras in 1917 he was hit by a sniper's bullet and had to be sent away from the trenches to recover. Once his wounds had healed, Sassoon took the extraordinary step of refusing to return to service. He threw the ribbon of his medal into the River Mersey, and penned his Soldier's Declaration - a powerful statement against the war which was reprinted in a national newspaper and read out in Parliament on 30 July, 1917, by sympathetic MP Hastings Lees Smith. Being both a decorated war hero and a published poet, the move caused public outcry. Only the actions of fellow poet Robert Graves stopped him from being court-martialled and he was transferred to Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh where he was officially treated for shell shock. There he met another great war poet, Wilfred Owen. Once recovered the pair were moved back into action in 1918, where Owen was killed. Sassoon served for a time in Europe before being moved to Palestine. On his return to France he was again wounded, and spent the rest of the war in England. After the war Sassoon spent some time travelling the US, before writing autobiographical novel Memoirs Of A Fox-Hunting Man which was published in 1928 and became an instant success. Memoirs Of An Infantry Officer'  followed in 1930 and Sherston's Progress  was printed in 1936. He later married Hester Gatty and the couple  had a son, George. In 1957, Sassoon was received into the Catholic church and he died on 1 September 1967.","Siegfried Sassoon chronicled experiences of First World War in detailed diaries and notebooks .

"By . Erin Clements . Mischa Barton's enviable wardrobe on The O.C. was a prime reason to tune in throughout the Fox drama's four seasons, and now the actress says her connections were responsible for the designer items seen on the show. In a new interview with Elle, the 28-year-old, who played affluent teen Marissa Cooper, credits her New York upbringing with her fashion savvy from a young age. 'Coming from New York, I was friends with a lot of the fashion designers. I grew up in a world around models and supermodels and designers and fashion. In LA, they were very much like, ""What is that? I don't really know what that is,""' she says. Small-screen style: Mischa Barton (pictured wearing a Teca By Helo Rocha dress in April 2014) takes credit for her character's impeccable wardrobe on The O.C., in a new interview with Elle . She added: 'I was like, if there was one benefit to having a character like Marissa Cooper [it] is that she has access to things. It's that kind of access that made her fascinating to watch. Watching people in the bubble is what people get so fascinated by. I mean that is fully what The O.C. was about: There's the people in the bubble, and then there's the regular, old people around them. Marissa was definitely in the bubble.' Miss Barton reveals that she had trouble getting into character, but found a connection to Marissa when she wore her impeccable ensembles - many of which she chose. Fashion heavyweight: Miss Barton said she began asking Chanel to send items, such as this dress Marissa wore to the prom in a 2006 episode . Well connected: 'Coming from New York, I was friends with a lot of the fashion designers,' Miss Barton (pictured here wearing a Marc by Marc Jacobs dress in a 2003 episode of The O.C.) said . 'The costume designer went out and got all that stuff and we built it, but it was definitely something I pushed. I would pick the outfits and then go to great lengths for it,' she says. In fact, she says the says the show's young cast would have looked quite different if she hadn't gotten involved. 'I started getting Chanel to send stuff. I started having these designers send stuff over because I saw the merit in getting that kind of stuff on television,' she said. 'If I had those connections in the fashion world, why not? [The wardrobe department] would totally have been happy just dressing us as regular teenagers, to be honest. Not in a bad way, we would have looked adorable, but we would have been just your average Orange County teenagers. But with my wiling and conniving I was like, ""You know what would be super great is if we could get this Chanel dress for this [prom] episode,"" and it kind of all came together.' Not your average teens: Miss Barton (seen here in a 2005 promo shot for The O.C.) says without her influence, the costume designers would have dressed the cast as regular high schoolers . In 2008, Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld presented Miss Barton with the InStyle Germany VIPer award, proclaiming, 'So many girls want to look like Mischa Barton. She is a fashion role model for an entire generation.' Miss Barton has maintained ties with the fashion industry since The O.C. ended in 2007. In 2008, she launched a line of handbags, and in 2012, she opened her own boutique in London, called Mischa's Place. Last year, she opened up about her personal style in an interview with PopSugar, saying, 'I stick to the designers that I love. So, Chloe and Helmut Lang. I've been wearing a lot of the new Lagerfeld stuff.'","The now 28-year-old actress played affluent teen Marissa Cooper on the hit show, which ended in 2007 ."
"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A . couple who allegedly left their nine-month-old baby to drown in the bath wept in court yesterday as they were accused of failing in the 'most basic of . parental responsibilities'. Emma Oliver, 22, was washing her daughter Daisy Anderson in a small tub placed in the bath at home in New Moston, Manchester, when she decided to go round to a neighbour's for a chat. She reportedly left Daisy's father Dale Anderson, 25, to take care of the baby as she walked round to the terraced house next door to theirs. Tragic: Daisy Anderson drowned after being left alone in the bath at her home in Manchester, a court heard . Standing trial: Emma Oliver (left), 22, was washing her daughter in the bath on September 24, 2012. She then reportedly decided to round to a neighbour's house for a chat, leaving Dale Anderson (right), 25, in charge . But minutes after he began bathing his daughter, Anderson allegedly realised there were no clean nappies or towels in the bathroom, so he left the room and started searching downstairs. However, when he returned, he discovered the baby was lying face-down in the water and not breathing, the court heard. In desperation, Anderson is believed to have placed Daisy on a bed of teddy bears, before performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on her. Meanwhile, Oliver, who had returned to the house, reportedly ran back to her neighbour's to call an ambulance. Couple: After he began bathing his daughter, Anderson allegedly realised there were no clean nappies in the bathroom, so he started searching downstairs. Above, the couple are pictured together before the incident . But despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Daisy was pronounced dead in hospital later that day. Now, Anderson and Oliver have appeared at Manchester Crown Court charged with child neglect. Yesterday, . the court heard that Anderson had been left alone with Daisy while . Oliver chatted to their neighbour about schools on the morning of . September 24, 2012. The couple are alleged to have crossed each other . on the stairs as Oliver left the bathroom to walk next door, leaving their daughter unattended for the first time that day. Arriving at court: But when Anderson returned, he discovered his baby daughter was lying face-down in the water and not breathing, the court heard. Above, Oliver and Anderson are pictured arriving at court yesterday . Parents: Anderson attempts to shield Oliver's face as they arrive at court with an unnamed male companion . Paramedics . were alerted to Daisy's fate at around 10.40am and arrived at the house . within two minutes of the call, where they reported that the baby was . not breathing. They took the baby to North Manchester Children’s Hospital, where doctors tried desperately to revive her. However, she had already gone into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead two hours later. David Temkin, prosecuting, told the jury at Manchester Crown Court: 'There is no doubt that this case is extremely sad. 'Nobody . in this room could fail to be moved by hearing about the death of a . baby. You must try your very best to deal with this case as coolly and . calmly as you can. 'The prosecution’s case is that each of these defendants failed in their duties as parents towards this young girl. 'The . first and most devastating way was that they each left the child . unattended in the bath. Not for long, but long enough for tragedy to . strike. 'The second way is that these defendants failed in their parental duties because of the state of their home. 'The prosecution’s case is that they failed to ensure that the home was safe enough, clean enough and hygienic enough to be suitable for bringing up a child.' The court . heard that police had started investigating Oliver and Anderson for . child neglect after officers noticed the 'dirty and unhygenic' state of their house while Daisy and her parents were in hospital. Neighbours . had been so worried about the state of the couple’s home that they had . started hoovering and tidying up the mess before the police arrived, the jury heard. Tributes: David Temkin, prosecuting, told the jury at Manchester Crown Court: 'There is no doubt that this case is extremely sad'. Above, teddies and floral tributes are left outside Oliver and Anderson's home in Manchester . But police officers quickly halted the clean-up operation and . noted the house had dirty nappies lying around, food on a high chair, . dirty dishes covered in congealed food, damp clothing on the floor and . dirty bed clothes on the cot. In an interview with officers, Oliver and Anderson were asked whether an 'accident' had occurred, to which they reportedly replied that Daisy had just ‘stopped breathing’ moments earlier - . making no reference to the bath. Mr Temkin said it was ‘perfectly clear’ each of the defendants had ‘loved and cherished’ Daisy, and felt ‘deep sadness at their loss’. Denial: Anderson and Oliver (pictured) have appeared at Manchester Crown Court charged with child neglect. They deny the charges . But he added: 'It’s not a case about intentional cruelty - it’s a case about serious failings in the most basic of parental responsibility.' Mr Temkin told the court that Anderson had known that his partner had left the house to chat with a neighbour that morning. 'Mr Anderson went into the bathroom and carried on bathing her but after a time realised there was no towels or nappies in the room,' he said. 'He went out of the bathroom and left the child unattended. 'He went downstairs to get what was needed. It is not precisely clear how long he was out for but when he got back he saw Daisy was lying down facing the water. He took her out and tried to revive her with mouth to mouth. As he was doing that Miss Oliver returned. 'She knocked on the front door to be let in. Mr Anderson left the child again to let her in. He told her what had happened.' '[Oliver] was at the house for about 20 minutes because I was just doing general cleaning. It was general chitchat - we were all going to put the kids names down at school local to us,' she said. 'She didn’t mention where Daisy was and I didn’t have any concerns. 'She had one back to get her coat to go the school and I was washing the pots when I saw her run passed the kitchen window. She came into my house and said Daisy’s not breathing. She said ""phone an ambulance"". She was panicking and my first instinct was to follow her out.' She added: 'I saw Dale trying to resuscitate the baby and I rang for an ambulance. Emma moved Daisy into the kitchen and I told her to put her down flat. She put her down in the living room. Dale punched the wall and another neighbour tried to help.' Miss Sutton said a 999 operator had given her CPR instructions as both parents tried to revive her and neighbours gathered. 'Everybody was just in panic mode - we all had the same interest at heart, to help Daisy,' she said. 'The paramedic arrived and said I had done amazing and that’s when I filled up and got as lump in my throat because it all hit home and the reality sunk in. She added: 'Emma was a good mum - she looked after her daughter. Daisy was always dressed nicely and Emma put her first. She would go without for Daisy.' Paramedic Philip Ogden told the jury: 'When I arrived at the house, I noticed the hallway was very messy, clothes and toys were scatted and I had to step over things. 'I walked into the living room and there was quite a few people there. I saw the baby girl was undressed and appeared to be dry. 'Her father appeared to be doing CPR. I asked what had happened and was told she had just stopped breathing a few minutes before the call was made. I asked if there had been any untoward incident at all. They said there hadn’t. ‘I asked a couple of times if there had been any illnesses or accidents that would explain the situation. But I was told she had just stopped breathing moments earlier.' Oliver eventually told nursing staff at the hospital what had happened, the court heard. Oliver and Anderson deny two counts of child neglect. The trial continues.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This is the moment a man discovered a swarm of 15,000 bees were using his boiler as their hive. Colin Burbridge, 45, called a local workman when his central heating system stopped working just five months after being installed at his company's office in Littleport, Cambridgeshire. But after opening up the boiler, the pair were stunned to find it was infested with thousands of bees. Hive: Colin Burbridge, 45, was shocked to discover a swarm of 15,000 bees were using his boiler as their hive . Mr Burbridge, who immediately fled the office after being stung, was forced to call on local beekeeper Stuart Palmer, 41, and his 39-year-old wife, Carol, to tackle the infestation. Donning protective white suits and parcel tape around their wrists and ankles, the couple managed to safely remove the colony by encouraging them into a nucleus box. Today, Mr Burbridge, who runs the heating engineering firm M8trix, said he had not noticed the bees' buzzing because the boiler in his office's kitchen area had 'sealed in' the noise. 'I was standing next to the boiler when it was opened,' he said. 'I got stung straight away and just fled the building. Infestation: Mr Burbridge called a local workman when his central heating system at his company's office stopped working. But after opening up the boiler, the pair were stunned to find it was infested with bees . Removal: Local beekeeper Stuart Palmer, 41, and his wife, Carol, 39 were called upon to remove the insects . 'It is a new boiler and all the noise is sealed in so I didn't hear any buzzing or anything like that. 'We are an engineering firm as well so you can imagine there is a lot of noise.' Mr Burbridge added that the swarm of insects had destroyed his £2,000 boiler, which he might have to pay for out of his own pocket. 'We are not covered by our insurers on this because it is an ""insect infestation"",' he said. 'It was a new boiler and cost about £2,000 but hopefully we won't have to pay that out again.' Office: Mr Burbridge, who runs the heating engineering firm M8trix (pictured) in Littleport, Cambridgeshire, said he had not noticed the bees' buzzing because the boiler in his office's kitchen area had 'sealed in' the noise . Taking them away: Mr Palmer tips some of the insects into a box, while hundreds of others are on the floor . Mrs Palmer who had passed a beekeeping course just a week before the infestation was discovered, said the swarm of bees had likely entered the boiler through an outside vent. 'There is a vent at the back of the boiler that goes outside and that must be how they managed to get in,' she said. 'I asked for a bit of advice from more experienced beekeepers. They advised that we cut out the comb from inside the boiler and encourage the bees to move away. 'Fortunately, we were able to attract the vast majority into a nucleus box and they are now sitting happily in our garden waiting to be transferred to their new hive. 'They had basically made their own hive. They were happy there until we came and got them out. 'Having a suit on and parcel tape around my ankles and wrists gives you that little sense of bravery.' She added that after she and her husband had left M8trix, staff had been left with a huge clean-up job on their hands. 'There was a lot of honey in there so it was a bit of a sticky job,' she said.","Colin Burbridge, 45, was puzzled when central heating stopped working .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A man has been arrested after allegedly impersonating Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza and making threatening phone calls to locals in the aftermath of the shooting, authorities have said. Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 30, reportedly made 96 calls to residents in Newtown, Connecticut, just two days after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012. In one call, he allegedly said: 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead.' Arrest: Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman (left) reportedly made 96 calls to residents in Newtown, Connecticut, just two days after Adam Lanza (right) shot to death 20 children and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School . Meanwhile, in another, he bragged: 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. With my machine gun. You're dead,' according to federal prosecutors. The calls were reportedly made on December 16 - just 48 hours after 20-year-old Lanza killed his mother at their Newtown home, before shooting to death 20 children, six staff and himself at the school. Hoffman, from El Hatillo, Venezuela, was arrested on Saturday at Miami International Airport while traveling to Mexico from Venezuela, the U.S. Attorney's office said. His arrest comes a year and a half after he was charged in a criminal complaint with transmitting threats to injure a person. It remains unclear why he was only arrested 18 months on. Killer: In one call, Hoffman allegedly said: 'This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead.' Above, 20-year-old Lanza carried out the horrific massacre in December 2012 . Shocking: Police lead children away from Sandy Hook Elementary School following the attack on December 14 . The complaint against Hoffman, filed in May 2013, was partially unsealed yesterday. 'This complaint charges that Cardenas Hoffman made dozens of threatening telephone calls to residents of Newtown when they were suffering from one of the worst tragedies in our nation's history,' U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly said. 'Threatening such vulnerable people is reprehensible and inhuman criminal conduct. Further, it inappropriately stressed law enforcement resources at a critically demanding time.'

His options were: a) it could generate electricity for . heating, b) you could use it to boil food, c) it could also be used as a . vacuum cleaner, or d) it received radio signals from West Germany.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . For those of you who have dogs that stress out when you leave home without them, you may feel you've tried everything to comfort them. But have you tried lulling them into submission, say, with a song written by a Grammy-award winning pop star; conceived specifically for canine ears? Andrew Dost, a member of FUN, the fizzy pop-rock band behind We Are Young, was asked to write the pet-soothing music by DOGTV, a popular multimedia network intended to 'relax' and 'stimulate' dogs when they are home alone. 'I approached this composition project differently than I would for human ears,' Mr Dost said in a statement, leading FEMAIL to test this curious concept on Pringle, the highly-spirited chihuahua. Scroll down for video . Calm down: Andrew Dost, a band member of FUN and a Grammy-award winner no less, has composed a piece of music intended to soothe anxious dogs, which we tested on Pringle (pictured) Usually, Pringle, who I've had for seven years, is about as charming and laid back as a chihuahua can possibly be. That is, until any of her favorite people leave our apartment, at which point she throws herself at their ankles like a rabid squirrel and barks consistently for a solid five minutes, before trotting off to her bed without a care in the world, and settling down for a nice long nap. I've tried various methods to ease her temporary distress, all without success; so even though I laughed out loud when news first broke of Mr Dost's concept, curiosity won me over. I did ponder, too, whether Mr Dost was inspired to write this music as an ode to his band mate Jack Antonoff, who was recently bitten by his girlfriend Lena Dunham's over-anxious dog, Lamby. Ms Dunham subsequently had Lamby put on Prozac to calm him down, and we can only guess whether she has experimented with this song too. Back to Pringle, and a few minutes before my roommate left for work this morning, I switched on the mellifluous tones of Mr Dost's song. The music, for my ears at least, was lovely. Smooth electronic notes punctuated with harps, and the sounds of scuffling and whispering wind. 'I made sure the range of frequencies and instrumentation were tailored to a dog's unique sense of hearing,' explains Mr Dost. Star power: Mr Dost (right) wrote the tune for DOGTV, a multimedia network designed to keep dogs company when they're alone, and says he approached this project 'differently than [he] would for human ears' Inspiration? Mr Dost's band mate, Jack Antonoff (previous photo, left), was recently nipped by his girlfriend Lena Dunham's dog Lamby (pictured), who was struggling with some anxiety issues . Pringle, however, couldn't have been less phased. I eagerly trailed behind her, speakers held aloft as she ran chaotically from room to room, but to no avail. At one point, while she was taking a quick breather from her personal tragedy, the sound of gentle panting appeared in the song, and she turned her head towards the source of the sound quizzically, before letting out an almighty yawn. 'I made sure the range of frequencies and instrumentation were tailored to a dog's unique sense of hearing' I took this to signal progress, and played the highly enjoyable music a few more times for both of us. Since the yawn though, Pringle had forgotten that she was supposed to be upset, and had taken herself off for her morning nap. The five minutes were up, and I doubt the music had much to do with it. I remain intrigued, however, by the concept of DOGTV, on which this sort of music plays on loop all day. Cured? Pleasant as the song was, it did very little to interrupt Pringle's daily separation-anxiety-induced meltdown . The network claims to have done their homework on lonely dogs, stating on their website: 'Through years of research with some of the world’s top pet experts, special content was created to meet specific attributes of a dog’s sense of vision and hearing and supports their natural behavior patterns. 'The result: a confident, happy dog, who’s less likely to develop stress, separation anxiety or other related problems.' At $4.99 a month for DirectTV subscribers, and $9.99 for its online streaming service, I imagine this material would, at the very least, soothe an owner's separation-anxiety as they guiltily leave their homes every day. Indeed, there is a small part of me that feels warm in the knowledge that it's possible for Pringle to kick back with some good music while I'm gone, whether she notices or not. Mr Dost is donating his fee to A Rejoyceful Animal Rescue, a shelter in his hometown of Detroit.","The piece of music was composed by FUN band member Andrew Dost, and incorporates gentle panting sounds ."
"By . Travelmail Reporter . A British Airways advert has been banned for being 'misleading' after passengers booking direct flights found there was a stopover on the journey they had chosen. Advertising watchdogs said the airline must make sure that, if a direct flight included stops, passengers should be given 'clear and prominent' information. Two travellers complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about an advert on the firm's website regarding a return trip from London to Sri Lanka. Travellers complained to the ASA about an advert on the British Airways website which was ruled 'misleading' Headings said: 'Outbound direct flights' and 'Outbound connecting flight options.' After booking under the first heading, they discovered a stop was actually scheduled, however it was allowed to be classed as a 'direct' flight as the passengers wouldn't disembark. The ASA said it was accepted by airlines . that a 'direct' flight might include stops, while a 'non-stop' flight . meant no landings during the journey. In a ruling which is also likely to apply to other airlines, the industry watchdog said the advert breached rules that marketing material should not mislead customers and should state significant limitations. 'We considered that the existence and number of en-route stops during a flight would impact upon travel time, convenience and, in some cases, comfort,' said an ASA statement. 'It was therefore likely to be a significant factor influencing a consumer's response to a marketing claim.' Flights to Sri Lanka were advertised as 'direct' which the ASA ruled misleading . 'We considered that, where a flight was described as 'direct' but included intermediate landings, that claim should be accompanied by clear and prominent information as to the number and location of en-route stops,' the ASA said. 'Further information should be given where it was the case that passengers would be required to disembark the aircraft. 'In the absence of clear and prominent information about the en-route stop, we considered that the use of the claim 'Outbound direct flights' to describe a flight from London to Sri Lanka that included an intermediate landing point was likely to mislead consumers and was in breach of the code.' It said the advert should not appear again in its current form. British Airways had been able to class the route to Sri Lanka as 'direct' as passengers didn't disembark from the plane during the stop . 'We told British Airways plc to ensure that the term ""direct"" when used in reference to flights that included en-route stops, was accompanied by clear and prominent information about the number and location of those stops,' the ASA said. 'And, where relevant, the fact that travellers would be required to disembark the aircraft.' A British Airways spokesman said that in the aviation business a 'direct' flight might involve a stop, but would not involve passengers having to change aircraft. He claimed flight times and duration were clearly displayed and therefore did not believe the phrase 'Outbound direct flights' was misleading. Information about the single stop did appear in a box when customers clicked on the flight number, he pointed out.","Travellers complained about British Airways advert for flight to Sri Lanka .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Moderate consumption of wine or spirits increases the risk of the heart condition atrial fibrillation . Drinking just one glass of wine a day could trigger a stroke, heart failure or dementia, researchers have warned. Moderate consumption of wine or spirits - defined as between one and three drinks a day - increased the risk of an irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation (AF). The condition is one of the most common heart rhythm problems and significantly raises the risk of stroke. This is because when the upper chambers of the heart do not pump efficiently, as in atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of blood clots forming. In extreme cases, AF can cause heart failure and has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease by reducing blood flow to the brain. The researchers say that while many . studies have shown that light to moderate drinking can reduce the risk . of heart disease and stroke, it is important to balance these benefits . against the potential risk of developing AF. The study, of almost 80,000 people in Sweden,  found those who indulged in moderate consumption of wine and liquor, were more likely to develop the condition. However the research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, did not identify a similar association beer - even when people binged on it. Researcher Professor Susanna Larsson, of the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, said: 'We have no explanation for the lack of association with beer consumption. 'It is likely beer is consumed more regularly during the week, whereas wine and liquor are more often consumed only at the weekend.' She added it might be possible to reverse the damage by spreading out alcohol consumption over the week, rather than drinking a lot in one go. The study, which tracked the food and alcohol consumption of middle-aged and elderly people over 12 years, found the more people drank on a single occasion, the higher the risk of AF. Atrial fibrillation causes a fast and irregular heartbeat, usually over 100 beats a minute. Other symptoms include dizziness, breathlessness and tiredness . Previous research has also shown a link between heavy drinking and abnormal heart patterns. An international study carried out over 12 years tested nearly 37,000 women and found that those who drank the equivalent of 14 alcoholic units a week - the maximum intake for women according to UK Government guidelines - were 60 per cent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation. The most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation is becoming aware of a fast and irregular heartbeat (palpitations), usually over 100 beats a minute. Other symptoms include dizziness, breathlessness, chest pain (angina) and tiredness.","Moderate consumption of wine or spirits increases risk of irregular heartbeat .

Affecting . just 200 people in the UK, Ms Harper claims . the condition leaves her looking . like a body builder - and she cannot get medical help until her symptoms . get worse. The condition has caused her such misery that when she became pregnant, she was desperate not to have a daughter who may inherit it. To her relief, she had a baby boy, Isaak, now eight months old. She has two other sons - Oskar, five, and Jake, three. Ms Harper, 30, said: 'I was desperate not to have a baby girl. My dad also suffers from the disease. 'I have to wear fake hips and two bras when I go on nights out because I want to look more feminine. 'I did have a husband, but we have separated and I don’t think I’ll find anyone else. I’m too self-conscious of the way I look.' Ms Harper does no exercise - but is constantly asked how often she goes to the gym, even by strangers . Her father and two aunts also suffer from lipodystrophy, as well as members of the family from previous generations. The condition cause heart attacks due to the build-up of fat around the heart muscle and also results in high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Ms Harper's father suffered a heart attack aged 50. Lipodsytrophy is where the fat is stored under the muscles, rather than the other way round. The condition cause heart attacks due to the build-up of fat around the heart muscle and also results in high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Those suffering from it are also at risk of early onset of diabetes, liver problems and heart disease. Ms Harper said: 'It’s very frustrating because I can’t have treatment until the problem becomes more severe - so until my blood pressure and cholesterol are higher.' She first noticed she was different from other girls when she was aged just 16. 'I was wearing a bra in the changing rooms for PE and one of the other girls pointed out that I had fat spilling out under the strap, but I was really skinny. Since then it has only got worse. 'Now people stop me in the street or in restaurants to ask where I go to the gym or how often I work out. 'It’s not their fault they don’t know about the condition - they think they’re being nice and complimentary - but it’s really upsetting.' She takes some comfort in the fact that if her sons do inherit the condition, they will not suffer the same torment she did. 'It's OK for a man to look muscular, but women are supposed to look feminine,' she said. Ms Harper is so desperate to look more feminine that she wears two bras and hip padding (pictured) when she goes on nights out . 'If I'd had a girl and she had it I never would have forgiven myself. I know how it feels and I would hated her to have to go through this.' Professor Fredrik Karpe, professor of metabolic medicine at Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, said: 'There may be many people in the UK suffering from lipodystrophy who just don’t know about it. 'It is a severe disorder that for the person affected is very disfiguring. It’s very traumatic, especially for young women. 'The disease can lead to health problems, such as early onset of diabetes, liver problems and heart disease. It essentially leads to an early death.'","Full-time mother Vicky Harper, 30, suffers from lipodsytrophy .

The IT consultant lost an incredible 14st 7lb through dieting and exercise - abandoning his daily sausage roll for breakfast - and says he now has a 'new lease of life'. After 18 months, he now weighs just 11st 7lb and can fit into a 32-inch waist band. He said: 'The old me compared to the man I am today is like comparing chalk and cheese. It hasn’t been an easy couple of years but I feel as though I’ve come through the worst of it and I’m finally back in control.' Mr Bennett saw his weight pile on as work commitments pushed him towards junk food and left him with little time to take exercise. He said: 'I used to work in a warehouse 20 years ago, and the physical activity kept me slim. Then I got a promotion and began sitting behind a desk every day. That’s when things began to change. 'The weight gain crept up on me until I reached the 26 stone mark, at which point I started getting medical issues like shooting pains in my back and numbness down my leg. It was quite worrying and debilitating. My leg would go so numb I felt as if I was carrying a dead weight around with me. 'I . became depressed and food became a crutch. I would think nothing of . eating a giant sausage roll for breakfast and eating a double portion of . takeaway in the evening.' BEFORE: . Breakfast: 2 pain au chocolates or a jumbo sausage roll . Lunch: Burger, chips and a large cola . Dinner: Double helping of spaghetti bolognese with cheese . Snacks: Chocolate . AFTER . Breakfast: Porridge with a banana and cranberries . Lunch: Pita filled with turkey and salad with carrot sticks on the side . Dinner: Home-made chicken curry for an evening meal . Snacks: Grain bars . As his weight increased, his crippling anxiety and depression put a strain on his marriage. He . said: 'I didn’t want to go anywhere or do anything. Everything was an . effort. I would get upset and angry if I had to do anything I wasn’t . comfortable with. 'I didn’t want to go on family . holidays - I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to fit into the plane . seat. I was embarrassed by my poor health and fitness and the anxiety . fed off itself. 'All those things had an effect on my marriage. It wasn’t the cause of the marriage breakdown, but it didn’t help.' When . Mr Bennett and his ex-wife separated in July 2012, his thoughts began . to turn towards making a lasting change for the better. He . said: 'I wanted nothing more than to have a measure of control over . something. I felt as if the separation was beyond my control, but at . least with my health I could influence it directly.' Mr Bennett embarked on the Cambridge Weight Plan, which comprises calorie-controlled meals. Before making the switch, he typically ate up to 5,000 calories a day - twice the recommended daily intake for an adult male. Mr Bennett lost the weight by slashing his calorie intake by 70 per cent to just 2,000 calories a day . Breakfast would be two pain auchocolates or a jumbo sausage roll, followed by a burger with chips and a large cola for lunch, with a double helping of spaghetti bolognese with cheese for dinner. He also snacked on chocolate throughout the day. Today, Mr Bennett has slashed his calorie intake by 70 per cent, currently consuming around 2,000 calories a day. He eats porridge with a banana and cranberries for breakfast, followed by a pita filled with turkey and salad with carrot sticks on the side for lunch. Dinner is typically a home-made chicken curry and snacks are grain bars. As his weight fell away, Mr Bennett, who has a 17-year-old daughter Chloe, was able to start exercising, taking up cycling again for the first time in years. He said: 'I'm the fittest I’ve ever been in my life now. I think nothing of cycling 40 miles and enjoying it. 'It feels wonderful to have more energy to be a dad. 'My weight loss has affected my whole life and one of the plus points is that I’m able to get up and go shopping with Chloe - all the fun things that I wouldn’t have been able to do before.'","Lee Bennett, 42, saw his weight creep up to 26st due to a poor diet .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Carly Swann suffers from a condition which means she cannot raise a full smile or even blink on the right side . A woman struck by a syndrome that deformed her face has now been the victim of botched surgery - which means she will never smile again. Carly Swann, 32, was just 14 when her face became paralysed, meaning she cannot raise a full smile or even blink on the right side. The mother-of-two suffers from a condition called cholesteatoma - an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear which apart from . hearing loss, can also lead to facial nerve damage resulting in a . weakness to half the face. For half her life, Ms Swann, from Sheffield, . avoided looking in mirrors because she was ‘too . repulsed’ by her own reflection. In total, she has had 16 operations for her condition. In 2007, the mother-of-two had an operation at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, using muscle taken from her left thigh and put into her cheek. The operation was a success and she regained control and movement in her face, allowing her to smile again - and for two years she lived a ‘happy’ life. But when an infection meant her face would need to be operated on again, the outcome left her devastated. Surgeons at The Royal Hallamshire Hospital interfered with the muscle holding the sling to correct her smile  - which caused it to disappear. Ms Swann later discovered that her operation notes from 2007 were not requested from the hospital who had corrected her smile and restored her confidence. She was awarded a substantial sum in compensation from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after they admitted clinical negligence. Ms Swann, who works as a PA, said: 'It was the worst point in my entire life when I saw what they had done - my face was ruined. 'They had completely destroyed my chances of smiling again. I physically hated the way my face looked and just wanted to shut the entire world out. 'What was hardest was that for two years I had finally been happy with the way I looked. 'I could go out with my friends and actually be happy and feel comfortable with my face. 'After the surgery I couldn’t bear to look at myself again and it was the lowest I had ever felt. The two hospitals that did the operations just hadn’t communicated with each other at all. 'If they had read the notes sent over to them they would have known not to remove the muscle and my face would still be fine. 'I’ve had 16 operations in total including having a scar created to look like a laughing line on my right hand side. But I’m not having any more now - I’m done.' Ms Swann aged 8 (left) and 13 (right). She was just 14 when her face became paralysed . In total, she has endured 16 operations to relieve her condition - but botched surgery means she is still unhappy with her appearance . Ms Swann was just 14 when she began experiencing problems. Friends spotted her drooping face at school after a PE lesson and a GP confirmed she had Bell’s Palsy - a form of facial paralysis - but claimed she should recover in two to three months. But with no signs of improvement, she was sent for MRI scans which concluded she in fact had cholesteatoma. And when she returned to school, she was bullied by her classmates who teased her about her skewed appearance and mocked her by saying she looked like she’d had a stroke. In the years that followed, she became a recluse who was too embarrassed to go out in fear of seeing her reflection in shop windows. People would tell her to ‘cheer up’ and she took to covering her face with her hands. She added: 'I found it really hard to meet new people, and would always angle my face away from them so they could only see my left side. 'I would never eat out at restaurants because I’m not able to chew my food properly because of the paralysis. “The worst thing about it is when I’ve put it to the back of my mind and don’t think about it. Ms Swan with her children, Ashon and Madalyn. She said she avoided looking in mirrors for half of her life because she was 'too repulsed' by her own reflection . Ms Swann with her daughter Madalyn. She said it is only in the last six months that she has got her confidence back since the botched operation . 'Then I hear someone saying, ""what’s wrong with her face"", or, ""why does she look like that""? Then it all comes flooding back to me.' Despite her struggle, Ms Swann, a single mother of two girls - Ashon, six and Madalyn, 11 - has only recently been able to come to terms with her appearance. She said: 'It’s only in the last six months that I have got my confidence back since the operation. 'I’ve started to go to a charity called Changing Faces which if I’d been aware of when my facial palsy started, things could have been very different. 'I had been searching for 18 years for someone to talk to and eventually I am now learning to be happy with how I look.' David Throssell, Medical Director at Sheffield Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'After suffering from facial palsy, Ms Swann had a successful operation at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals which restored some of her facial movements, including the ability to smile. 'We are therefore extremely sorry that a further procedure some years later to prevent a potential serious infection from occurring meant that some benefits of the previous procedure were lost. 'We can only imagine how devastating this must be for her and her family and a full review of Miss Swann’s care has been undertaken as a consequence, and we would like to offer our apologies for this.'","Carly Swann, 32, was just 14 when her face became paralysed .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . For many people diagnosed with cancer, losing their hair is one of their biggest fears and often one of the most upsetting parts of the illness. And for Laura Price, who lost her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes after chemotherapy, it was no less painful. Diagnosed with breast cancer at just 29 and determined to stay positive, she decided to turn the experience into a project to track her hair growing back. Scroll down for video . Laura Price was diagnosed with breast cancer at just 29 and required chemotherapy, which caused her hair to fall out. She is pictured right just after she shaved her head and before her eyebrows fell out . Every day for the last 18 months, she has taken a photo of herself using an app to track her hair growth. Beginning . three months after chemotherapy finished, she went make-up free in each . one to assess the progress of her eyelashes and eyebrows. Now, . two years to the week of her diagnosis, she has created a timelapse . video of the pictures, charting her progression from looking like a . 'baby chick' to sporting a pixie crop. It . is a far cry from the long, brown hair she used to have. But cancer, . she says, 'forces you to get used to a new normal where image is . secondary'. 'That’s not to say that my vanity has gone out the window, but it does mean I’m delighted with my new pixie-do, even though I have a bald patch,' she said. 'As much as I envy women with beautiful, long hair, I’m just grateful to have my health.' Writing on her blog, she said: 'Being bald hasn't exactly been the best thing to ever happen to me, but . it certainly is liberating. 'You can take your wig off when you get too . hot, you can have a totally different look every single day, and you . save a fortune on shampoo and conditioner (though it doesn't quite . offset the money doled out on expensive wigs...). Every day for the last 18 months, she has taken a photo of herself using an app to track her hair growth . 'The slight bald patch on the top of my head might never go away, but I'm content with what I've got.' Miss Price, a journalist, was diagnosed with cancer in June 2012, a month before her 29th birthday. 'I discovered the lump in February while on holiday in Brazil and as soon as I got to Argentina, I had a . mammogram and ultrasound,' she said. 'Doctors . determined it was a . fibroadenoma – a harmless lump with smooth edges that moves around. 'They . told me it was nothing to be concerned about, but I could . get it double checked when I got home. 'The lump was an inch big and felt like a small golf . ball, but it never caused me any pain or discomfort.' But four . months later, having moved to Ireland, an ultrasound detected something . unusual and she was sent for further tests, including another mammogram, . ultrasound and biopsy, where a needle . was inserted to take a tissue sample. Days later she received the devastating news the lump was cancer. She said: 'As much as I envy women with beautiful, long hair, I’m just grateful to have my health' Within a month, she had undergone life-saving surgery to completely remove the tumour from her left breast. But she still required six months of chemotherapy and two of radiation - with the first meaning she would lose her hair. 'The truth is that losing your hair to chemotherapy is entirely different to shaving it off à la Brit popstar Jessie J,' she said recently. Some people having cancer treatment find that it doesn’t affect their . hair at all. But patients having chemotherapy often experience hair thinning or lose it completely. Hair . follicles are normally destroyed during chemotherapy because like . cancer tumours, they are made up of rapidly growing cells. This is why . chemotherapy can lead to hair loss, although it is almost temporary . Radiotherapy to the head always causes some hair loss. 'For almost a year after my first chemo treatment, I had to get . used to the double takes and pitying glances. 'Despite the occasional . ignorant remark – like the man who shouted 'chemo!' at me while I was . walking down the street – people were kind and reassuring about my . baldness. 'Firstly, . you have the emotionally painful experience of waiting for your hair to . fall out. 'Secondly, it stops growing from below the root, so you end up . with a polished egg look, rather than a stubbly rock chick one. 'The . worst thing, though, is losing your eyebrows – often the defining part . of a face and the slowest thing to grow back. 'A year after finishing . chemo, mine are still a shadow of their former bushy, caterpillar-like . selves.' But she says the fear of losing her hair again never leaves her - and she constantly touches her head to check it is still there. She admits she looks 'completely different' to 18 months ago - but is unphased by it. 'As much as I envy women with beautiful, long hair, I’m just grateful to have my health. 'My haircut isn’t a fashion statement or a choice. It’s a side effect of the treatment that saved my life.'","Laura Price was diagnosed with the disease in June 2012, aged just 29 .

Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has formally renounced his Canadian citizenship - clearing his path for a potential presidential run in 2016. The 43-year-old vowed to give up his dual Canadian-U.S. citizenship after discovering his status on his birth certificate last August. Now, 10 months later, he has finally fulfilled his promise, according to his spokesman, Catherine Frazier. Ms Frazier said Mr Cruz's action became official on May 14, but he only received written confirmation at his house in Houston yesterday. She added that the Texas Senator 'is pleased to have the process finalised'. 'Being a U.S. Senator representing Texas, it makes sense he should be only an American citizen,' she said via email. It comes amid speculation that Mr Cruz could make run at the White House in 2016. However, the Republican, . who has made frequent trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, . the first three states to hold presidential contests, has refused to say . if he plans to run for president. Mr Cruz was born as 'Rafael Edward Cruz' in Calgary, Alberta, in 1970, where his parents were . working in the oil business. His mother, Eleanor, is from the . U.S., while his father, Rafael, is a Cuban who did not become an American citizen until 2005. Although he has been in office only around 18 months, Mr Cruz helped lead last . year's partial government shutdown and has become a conservative . grass-roots champion. The Senator discovered his dual citizenship after releasing his birth certificate to the Dallas Morning News last August amid questions about his eligibility to be president should he decide to run. At the time, he said he was surprised to learn he was a Canadian-U.S. citizen. He promised to formally give up the citizenship, but months passed before he eventually hired an immigration attorney to help him with the process.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Anyone born after the year 2000 should be banned from ever buying cigarettes, leading doctors Ssid today. The idea is to stop young people from ever starting to smoke - and the move could create the first 'smoke free generation', medics said. Those at the British Medical Association's annual representative meeting voted 'overwhelmingly' in favour for a campaign to 'enforce the move. The proposed move would 'ban forever the sale of cigarettes to any individual born after the year 2000'. Eighty per cent of smokers start as teenagers as a result of intense peer pressure . This would 'ban forever the sale of . cigarettes to any individual born after the year 2000', they said. Presenting the motion Dr Tim Crocker-Buque said: 'The level of harm caused by smoking is unconscionable. 'Smoking is a choice made by adolescents that results in an adulthood of addiction and an early death. 'By banning the sale of cigarettes to people born after 2000, we begin to create the first tobacco free generation.' He added: 'Smoking is not a rational, informed choice of adulthood, Eighty per cent of smokers start as teenagers as a result of intense peer pressure. 'This proposal would gradually phase out the sale of cigarettes to the next generation, with no impact on current smokers. 'As this generation reach 18 in 2018 they would be prevented from buying cigarettes for their lifetime in a move that would progressively phase out cigarette sales. 'It is not expected that this policy . will instantly prevent people from smoking. Instead it aims to . progressively de-normalise cigarette smoking.' The idea is to stop young people from ever starting to smoke - and help create the first 'smoke free generation' Speaking against the motion, Dr Yohanna Takwoingi said the idea was 'idiotic' adding: 'There is nothing as attractive to a young person as the command ""don't"".' Dr Iain Kennedy, from the BMA's junior doctors conference, added: 'Figures show that 19 per cent of smokers are managerial or professional versus 33 per cent in manual classes. 'I am not convinced that we as a trade union should be supporting policy which demonises and criminalises the activity of working people.' He added the prospect would be 'unworkable'.Pro-smoking group Forest also spoke out against the motion. 'Prohibition doesn't work,' said the group's director Simon Clark. 'It will create a huge black market in cigarettes and drive generations of adult smokers into the hands of illicit traders. 'Criminalising adults for buying tobacco is illiberal and impractical.' Another motion was tabled calling on the BMA to to promote the legalisation of cannabis - but this was voted against. Geoffrey Lewis, a retired consultant from Leicester, said: 'Cannabis use should be treated primarily as a health issue, not a criminal justice issue. 'Too often the focus on drug use and addiction is from a . criminal justice rather than a public health point of view. 'Doctors . see first hand the damaging effects of a system which seeks to . criminalise drug users rather than a treat their addiction.' He added that existing . drug policy is 'contradictory and ineffective'. T . The number of drug users . has soared in then lat 30 years, despite the introduction of . tougher drug laws. Dr Lewis added: 'Our policy makers aren't prepared to have . a sensible, rational, evidence-based debate on drugs. 'That's not to . say that cannabis use isn't dangerous. It is. But the current law isn't . working and only by adopting a different approach can we regulate, . educate and exert a level of quality control.'","Idea was presented today at British Medical Association's annual meeting .
