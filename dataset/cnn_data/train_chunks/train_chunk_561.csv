The family of a British schoolgirl who died in a skiing accident in the Austrian Alps have spoken of how she 'lived every day as if it might be her last'. Mourners will gather for the funeral today of 10-year-old Jemima Prees, who was killed when she hit a tree at high speed on February 10 while on a half-term holiday with her family. The schoolgirl, who was wearing a helmet, appeared to lose control and skied into the wooded off-piste area at the Mayrhofen resort near Tyrol, an Austrian police spokesman said. Jemima Prees, whose funeral takes place today in her home village in Wilstshire, was 'wise beyond her years' Order of service at the funeral of Jemima Prees (left) and right, Jemima, who was said to have a smile for everybody . Tim Prees carries the coffin of his daughter Jemima Prees into the church for her funeral . 'She was lovely, she was gorgeous, she was very active': Jemima's family paid tribute to the lovely little girl . Jemima's father described her as 'a real ray of sunshine' after the schoolgirl died on a family holiday . Her brother and father rushed to her side to give first aid before she was airlifted to hospital in Innsbruck, but she died the following day. Her funeral will be held this afternoon at the Church of St John The Baptist, in Colerne near Chippenham in Wiltshire. Speaking on the eve of the service, Jemima's parents, Tim and Karen, told of the mature attitude to life which belied the girl's tender years. Jemima 'lived every day as if there might be no tomorrow' In an interview with ITV, Mrs Prees said: 'She was lovely, she was gorgeous, she was very active. She loved life. She lived every day as if it might be her last. 'Sometimes she used to say 'today might be the last day, we must all tell each other that we love each other because we may not come back this evening'. 'She was very wise, wise beyond her years. She had things sewn up that some people never seem to grasp.' Jemima's father described her as 'a real ray of sunshine'. 'She just had the knack of making everybody feel as if they were really important to her,' he told the broadcaster. 'And she had a smile for everybody. And I think she genuinely cared about other people, it wasn't just a surface smile.' Police in Mayrhofen - an hour away from Innsbruck and popular with British skiers - said the Prees family were on the last run of the day when Jemima careered into woodland and was knocked unconscious. Her father and her brother Barnaby, a university student known as Barney, both witnessed the accident which happened at about 4.30pm. It was reported that Jemima's mother had returned to the bottom of the mountain prior to the incident. Recalling the incident, Mr Prees said how Barney spent 40 minutes trying to revive his sister, despite the fact she was 'fairly clearly dead'. His actions drew praise from emergency services who arrived at the scene. The coffin of Jemima Prees is carried into The Church of St. John The Baptist, Colerne, Wiltshire .

They are famous for going mad in March – but it seems this pair of mountain hares simply could not wait the extra two weeks. The animals were photographed tussling in the Cairngorms in Scotland, and despite still being in their white winter coats their antics are a sign that spring is finally on its way. While it is often thought that boxing takes place solely between males vying for dominance, this particular battle involved an angry female fighting of unwanted male attention. Springing into action: These two hares were spotted sparring in the Cairngorms, Scotland, by photographer Andy Howard . Angry: The female (pictured on the right of the pair) appears unhappy with the attention shown by the male hare . Glutton for punishment: The determined male continues to try his luck before giving up and running back down the hill to work his charms on a different female . The pictures were taken by photographer Andy Howard, 42, who lives near Inverness. He said: ‘Boxing hares are an early indication that spring is just around the corner. 'I was out looking for mountain hares in . the snow when I happened to spot this pair looking very alert and . experience told me that their behaviour was a little bit different to . normal. 'I sat and watched them for about 20 . minutes before the action began, the male hare (the Jack) began by . running around the female (the Jill) in a tight circle before he made . his move.' 'She was having none if it and proceeded . to repel his advances with a series of high leaps and what looked like . kick boxing moves.' Mr Howard said this happened twice before the male shot off down the slope to work his charms on another female who was sitting close by. Sign: The mountain hares are still wearing their winter white coats - but their sparring shows spring is in the air . Unusual: Fights between hares usually involve two males battling for the chance to mate with a female . The male is the one on the left, rearing up and running in circles,' said Mr Howard, 'the female is the one on the right doing the ninja moves and dishing out the punishment. Love was in the air but not for him.' The mountain hare differs from the more common brown hare by getting a white coat for the winter. They go through three changes during the . year, from October to January they change from brown with a greyish . blue twinge to almost full white. From February until May their coats . become a mottled brown and white before reverting back to the full . summer brown with a white tail. In 1906 Scottish Mountain Hares were given a separate subspecies of Lepus timidus scoticus. Mr Howard said: 'Looking for white hares in snow is by no means an easy task. From my own experiences finding . mountain hares, let alone photographing them does take research, a lot . of time and bags of effort.'","Angry female pictured fighting off a male in the Cairngorms mountains .

A mother who underwent gastric bypass surgery has won a £35,000 payout after she claimed surgeons botched the operation. Rachel Benefer, 28, weighed 23 stone, and resorted to surgery after struggling to lose weight because of health problems. But following her keyhole surgery, doctors realised something was wrong, and she was rushed into intensive care before being placed in an induced coma. Rachel Benefer, 28, won a £35,000 payout after a gastric bypass operation left her in a coma . It was claimed the surgeon had failed to close a small incision properly, and the mother-of-two spent five weeks in hospital, before undergoing a further two operations. Mrs Benefer, from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, said: 'When I came out of the coma I couldn't walk, I was confused, I didn't know who anyone was and I was hallucinating. 'I kept asking my family what had happened and my memory is very patchy.' Mrs Benefer had struggled to lose weight due to a back injury and being diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, which affects the hormones and can cause weight gain. After researching gastric bypass surgery she was turned down for funding and had to see a dietitian and psychologist for a year before she was allowed to have the operation. She was referred to a surgeon at Hull Royal Infirmary and the operation was eventually funded by the NHS, but carried out at Hull and East Riding Classic Hospital. Mrs Benefer with her husband Chris, and sons Jacob, 2, and newborn Aidan. She claims the surgeon failed to close a small incision properly after gastric bypass surgery, which resulted in her being admitted to intensive care . The procedure reduced the size of her stomach and meant she could eat only small portions of food. It initially appeared to have gone well. 'Everything seemed fine and I was discharged,' she said. 'But a few days later I was being sick and I was in agony. 'I was rushed to hospital and ended up in intensive care for two weeks and was later placed in an induced coma.' It had been claimed the surgeon failed to suture one of the port entry sites used to insert the surgical instruments. Rachel developed a hernia obstructing her small bowel, causing pressure which 'blew out' the stomach bypass. She then had acute peritonitis, an inflammation of the membrane which lines the inside of the abdomen and all of the internal organs. She needed two further operations. 'I spent a total of 11 days on a ventilator and also underwent a tracheotomy,' she said. This where a hole is surgically created through the front of the neck and into the windpipe (trachea). Mrs Benefer said: 'People think having a gastric bypass is an easy way out, but I had thought about it and had tried everything to lose weight, including hypnotherapy. She said: 'People think having a gastric bypass is an easy way out, but I had tried everything to lose weight, including hypnotherapy' 'When I was at 23 stone I was just a mess, I was depressed and also stopped working as a carer because I couldn't get about, I became a recluse. 'Before I hit puberty I was extremely thin but then the weight just piled on, even though I often only ate one meal a day. 'I didn't eat a lot of chocolate, sweets or crisps, I ate normal meals. 'My husband Chris has been by my side the whole time, we have been married for eight years and he loves me, no matter how much I weigh.' She claims she has been left with a number of problems since the operation in 2007. 'I can't move my big toe on my left foot and often fall over,' she said. 'I have to use plastic plates because my hands seize up and I drop things, I'm even scared to be alone with my children.' She has sons, Jacob, two, and Aidan, who is just over a week old. 'At one point I went down to seven stones and after having another baby I now weigh about ten stones ten pounds,' she said. 'People need to realise there can be complications, they need to research having a bypass and understand the risks involved.' Danielle Barney, a lawyer at Bridge McFarland, said: 'This was a very painful experience for her and one that left her unable to work for a time and with an increased risk of serious long-term health problems.' A spokesman for Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'I can confirm that we reached a settlement with this patient. 'They have previously lodged a formal complaint with the trust and we responded to them directly.'","23 stone Rachel Benefer struggled to lose weight due to health problems .

Suspect: Kenneth Gillespie who is linked to a raid on a McDonalds in Ipswich could not be charged despite having £5,500 in cash on him . When robbers snatched £17,000 from a security guard outside a McDonald’s, police had a pretty good idea who might have done it. A short distance away, three criminals – including two robbers – were employed on day release from prison. One was found with more than £5,500 in cash in his pocket and a nearby shed, and refused to say where it came from. Another matched the description of a one-legged man acting suspiciously in the restaurant. But extraordinarily, none will face charges because the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence. Despite this, the money has been confiscated after magistrates decided that, on the balance of probability, it had been taken in the raid. And Kenneth Gillespie, 59, the man found with the cash, is now on the run after absconding from another open prison. The astonishing story began when a security guard was collecting takings from the McDonald’s in Ipswich on November 7, 2011, and was approached by two able-bodied men. They shoved her to the ground as they snatched a case she was carrying and ran away. Within hours Suffolk Police had arrested Gillespie and two unnamed men aged 36 and 44. One was a one-legged man who was shown on CCTV hobbling into the restaurant on crutches. It is understood he later confirmed he had been there – but only to get food. Accomplice: A man pictured on CCTV believed to be linked to the robbery at McDonald's in Ipswich, Suffolk, in November 2011 . Crime scene: The McDonald's in Ipswich, Suffolk, where a G4S security guard was pushed to the ground and £17,000 was stolen in November 2011 . All three were on a work placement a . mile away at Ipswich Town Football Club after being allowed out of . Hollesley Bay open prison, near Woodbridge. Police found £5,513 in Gillespie’s . pocket and a paint shed at the football ground, to which he held a key. None of the rest of the stolen cash has been recovered. During a hearing under the Proceeds . of Crime Act at South East Suffolk Magistrates’ Court, Suffolk Police’s . Andrew Morrison said: ‘Mr Gillespie was identified as being a possible . suspect and the key being found in his possession that would open the . paint store would lend itself [to believing] that the money was involved . in that robbery.’ But prosecutor Karly McGuire said the . case had not met the burden of proof required to bring charges. She . also revealed Gillespie had absconded from another open prison, North . Sea Camp in Boston, Lincolnshire. Employer: Mr Gillespie was on day release working at Ipswich Town Football Club, pictured, when the robbery took place . Open prison: Kenneth Gillespie had been serving a life sentence at Hollesley Bay in Woodbridge, Suffolk . He has been at large since failing to return from day release on January 23. Gillespie was given six life . sentences at the Old Bailey in 2000 for carrying out a series  of armed . robberies at betting shops before escaping on  a bicycle. The career criminal, who has . convictions dating back to the 1970s, was on licence at the time after . being sentenced to nine years for a robbery plot. A CPS spokesman said: ‘We have made . the decision not to charge in this case due to the lack of essential . forensic evidence. It would be difficult to prove a link between the . defendant and the alleged offence. ‘The defendant could not be identified by independent witnesses. If any new evidence comes to light, the case can be reviewed.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Kenneth Gillespie was on day release from Hollesley Bay open prison .

Problem: Dr David Haslam, head of the National Obesity Forum, said gastric bypass surgery should be considered for obese children as it can increase life expectancy . Fat children should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS to help them manage their weight, a leading professor has argued. Dr David Haslam, head of the National Obesity Forum, said that not enough young people are offered surgery because NICE commissioning guidelines advise against it. He said the treatment, which is normally reserved for over 16s, should not be seen as a quick fix because it can have a long term impact on health and increase life expectancy by decades. Dr Haslam made the remarks in response to suggestions that fizzy drinks should be heavily taxed and the numbers of fast food takeaways limited. The Academy of Royal Medical Colleges - which represents 220,000 doctors - warned that tougher measures are needed to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis. At present nearly two thirds of adults and one in three children are too fat, according to NHS data. But Dr Haslam said the proposed measures to tackle the obesity epidemic were not enough. Speaking to Channel 4 news, he said: ‘Obesity is a massive problem, it’s a major concern both in adults and in children. ‘In my 25 years as a GP I’ve seen the . problem escalate to dramatic proportions and I’m seeing more and more . obese and overweight kids. ‘Radical measures are necessary if we are to start saving lives because for some obese children it is a desperate situation. Figures also show that the health service is spending £5.1billion a year treating illnesses linked to obesity such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. According to the academy, obesity represents the ‘greatest public health crisis’ facing Britain. Dr Haslam added: ‘The problem with obesity in children is that it leads to problems such as diabetes, which is alarming. Measures needed: Dr Haslam said 'radical measures' were needed to deal with obesity, which he described as a 'massive problem' (pictures posed by models) ‘This used to be a problem seen in the over-50s and seeing it in children is frankly shocking. ‘There is also high blood pressure, asthma and joint pains and it is getting worse.’ Currently guidelines advice overweight youngsters to use diet and exercise to manage their conditions. Surgery is used only as a last resort and is offered only to those aged 16 and over.","National Obesity Forum head Dr David Haslam talked of 'massive problem'

But now the vivacious blonde presenter has revealed some surprising highs in her romantic life and some unsuspected celebrity connections. The bubbly Dubliner, 36, has admitted to snogging famous actor Jared Leto and spending a night in the arms of Hollywood star Mel Gibson – though the latter encounter happened in the Wicklow mountains for a film. ‘I certainly don’t think I’m really wild but there definitely is a fun side to me that people don’t give me credit for,’ Nuala said. ‘It’s because of the job I do, it’s a serious job. I have to be professional, it’s only appropriate.’ In an interview with Suburbia magazine, the popular meteorologist says her career took an unexpected twist, developing from a passion for acting. ‘My life took a different turn than I expected because I was actually offered a place in Trinity College for their drama course,’ she said. ‘I turned it down so I made the decision to change my direction. I was afraid that I would be limiting myself. You could be the best actress in the world and still not be getting work. I was worried about that.’ She still dabbled in acting, however – working on Braveheart with international star Mel Gibson. ‘I did extra work for years. I worked as a body double on the film Braveheart. I spent a whole Friday night with Mel Gibson holding me in his arms in the woods in Glendalough and there were paparazzi hiding in the woods. Nuala Carey as viewers see her as a weather girl on RTÉ . ‘I was covered in fake tan because I was at a Debs the night before and they were trying to wipe me down. Mel was a lovely man but he was a flirt,’ she said. ‘It sounds amazing until I tell you that I was a corpse. You really don’t want to meet Mel Gibson when you’re wearing a long black wig, white make-up all over your face. It wasn’t as glamorous as it sounds but it was amazing to meet someone like him. ‘He was a real character, really charismatic and really chatty.’ Nuala shared a kiss with Jared leto, left, and said Mel Gibson, right, was 'very chatty and a flirt' But Gibson wasn’t the only star she had the good fortune to encounter; in fact, one of her friends is Love/Hate and Titanic actor Jason Barry and he introduced her to another global superstar. ‘I ended up in a hotel room with Jared Leto,’ Nuala said. ‘We didn’t do anything funny but I did have a little kiss with Jared. It was before he was with Cameron Diaz,’ she said. Nuala said having a high profile could sometimes complicate her own love life. ‘People think you have a great life but sure everybody has problems,’ she said. ‘When I broke up with my boyfriend after seven years, I still had to go to work with a smile on my face.

Norman Hendrickson, 94, died suddenly en route to his 89-year-old wife Gwendoline's funeral on February 16. The couple had been married for 66 years. In the midst of their grief, the couple's daughters knew that there was only one thing to do - hold a joint service for their parents who had been inseparable throughout their lives. Mr Hendrickson, a World War II veteran, was mourned at the same New York funeral home where his wife Gwen's funeral was already scheduled last Saturday. Forever love: Gwendoline Hendrickson and husband Norman in their backyard in Cambridge, New York. Mr Hendrickson, 94, died while en route to his wife's funeral last Saturday. Gwendoline, 89, died on February 8 . Mrs Hendrickson was 89 when she died on February 8. Her husband died just steps from the funeral home where he had planned to say goodbye to his wife. The couple's two daughters Norman and Merrilyne said it was a fitting way . to say goodbye to a couple who had been together since meeting in Britain . during World War II. Norman was overseas with the U.S. Army . when he met Gwen, who was serving in the British Royal Air Force. She . immigrated to America and they were married in May 1947. Norma Howland told the Post-Star of Glens Falls: 'After we had a little time to process the shock and horror, we felt we couldn't have written a more perfect script. 'My sister said the only thing he didn't do was fall into the casket.' Mr Hendrickson, a former assistant postmaster in Cambridge, was being driven in a limousine to the Ackley and Ross Funeral Home for his wife's service when he stopped breathing. After the limo pulled up, funeral director Jim Gariepy, who is also the local coroner, and funeral home owner Elizabeth Nichols-Ross helped move Norman to the sidewalk outside the business. Gariepy began CPR while Ms Nichols-Ross and one Norman's sons-in-law raced across town to retrieve his do-not-resuscitate orders from the Hendricksons' refrigerator door. Together at the end: The Hendricksons had been married for 66 years and mourners said goodbye to them both on Saturday at the Ackley and Ross Funeral Home in Cambridge . Once the orders were in hand, an emergency crew that had arrived ceased attempts to revive Norman. He died on the sidewalk. Nichols-Ross said daughter Merrilyne Hendrickson then requested that her father's body be put into a casket and placed in the viewing room with her mother's cremated remains, which had been placed in an urn. Mourners who started arriving soon after for Gwen's funeral were greeted by a note Merrilyne posted at the entrance: 'Surprise - It's a double header - Gwen and Norman Hendrickson - February 16, 2013.' Ms Nichols-Ross said she didn't charge the family for Norman's wake. On his prayer card, she jokingly wrote that Mr Hendrickson got the idea to die in the limo headed to the funeral so he could get 'a buy-one-get-one-free deal'. 'If it had happened with somebody else like this it would have been sad, but with Norm it wasn't,' Nichols-Ross said. 'It was just so much like Norm.' Norman was overseas with the U.S. Army when he met Gwen, who was serving in the British Royal Air Force. She immigrated to the U.S. and they were married in May 1947. Mrs Howland said her parents had jokingly promised to never leave one spouse behind. After her mother died, Howland said she overheard her father say aloud: 'We have had a good long life together.

Police in Kansas City say they’ve stopped a potential serial killer after a man was arrested and charged with the murder of two prostitutes whose bodies were found exposed on the side of rural Missouri roads nearly a year apart. At a news conference Saturday night, authorities said Derek Richardson, 27, had confessed to the murders of Tamara Sparks and Nicoleone Reed. Sparks, 40, was found dead Oct. 4, 2011 and Reed, 24, was found Aug. 21. Both bodies were in spots where they could easily be seen, with their pants pulled down and shirts pulled up. Bleach had been poured over their bodies as well. Kansas City police say Derek Richardson, 27, has confessed to the murder of two prostitutes whose bodies were found exposed on the side of rural Missouri roads nearly a year apart . The bodies of the two victims were in spots where they could easily be seen, with their pants pulled down and shirts pulled up . Police say Richardson described in detail what he did to the women and that he strangled them to death while wearing white gloves. 'We absolutely stopped a person who was going to kill again,' said Kansas City police Sgt. Doug Niemeier, adding that authorities will search across the United States to ensure there weren't other victims. 'We do know that he had travels elsewhere,' Niemeier said, 'so we will be contacting those states just to make sure.' Law enforcement officials say two tips . led them to Richardson, after their plea to the public last week for . help. One tipster told them Richardson had told the informant about the . killings. A crucial piece of evidence in the case was a size 11 crocs loafer which was left at the Sparks crime scene . Police also say one crucial piece of evidence stood out – a size 11 crocs loafer which was left at the Sparks crime scene. Another tipster told police that the shoe belonged to Richardson. Police say the tipster’s DNA was on the shoe. 'That shoe made a huge difference.  It did seem to be a small item, but you never know in a homicide or any other case what price of evidence, no matter how big or how small may solve your case,' said Niemeier. Police say they believe Richardson was targeting these women, because he felt they were lesser than him. He has been charged with two counts of . first-degree murder and two counts of abandonment of a corpse and his . bail was set at $2 million. Cops believe that Sparks was murdered at this duplex which Richardson had lived at with his wife and child until a month ago . Richardson’s neighbour Matt Elwonger told FOX 4 News that he was cordial, but was recently evicted about a month ago.  He says the suspect lived at the duplex for about two years with a wife and child. “It’s so surprising to me that it was literally right next door like it was happening a wall away and we didn’t hear anything or know anything was going on,” Elwonger told FOX 4 News. Clay County authorities say they’re still looking into whether a third women who was attacked and found alive in Caldwell County is connected to Richardson. 'We have a tremendous amount of follow-up to do now that we have answered some of our own questions,' Niemeier said, adding that it 'feels good when you can tell a victim's family that their case has been resolved.'

An American tycoon who branded French workers lazy has now accused a government minister of being ‘an imbecile’. Maurice Taylor took his war of words with the French government into a third day with a second stinging letter to the country’s industry minister. In it, he told Arnaud Montebourg that his country has ‘beautiful women and fantastic wine’ but ‘no idea how to run a business’. And he branded the minister ‘an imbecile who is disconnected from reality’. Scroll down for video . Row: Maurice Taylor (left) sent a letter to Arnaud Montebourg (right) branding the French workforce as lazy but the industry minister has hit back today saying Mr Maurice has displayed 'perfect ignorance' His latest attack came two days after he called French workers ‘lazy and overpaid’ and said they ‘talk too much’. The initial outburst came after he . had been approached by the French government to take over an Amiens tyre . factory to save 1,200 jobs. He refused to do so and told Mr . Montebourg he could ‘keep his so-called workers’, who ‘get one hour for . breaks and lunch, talk for three and work for three’. It prompted an angry riposte from the . French government, with Mr Montebourg accusing the head of Titan . International of ‘perfect ignorance’. 'Lazy': Workers leaving the doomed Goodyear tire plant in Amiens, northern France, which Mr Taylor has refused to rescue as Goodyear announces a 39 per cent cut to their French workforce . Mr Montebourg went on to say America . is the top foreign investor in France, with 4,200 US companies employing . nearly half a million people within the country. There was also a veiled threat, as he . said the French government would look into Mr Taylor’s company’s . finances with ‘redoubled zeal’. Now Mr Taylor has written to Mr . Montebourg again, saying: ‘Your letter shows the extent to which your . political class is disconnected from the real world. ‘You call me an extremist, but most . businessmen would agree that I would be mad to spend millions buying up a . French tyre factory only to pay some of the highest salaries in the . world. Blunt: The Titan International boss was scathing in his assessment of the work ethic of staff at the Goodyear factory in Amiens . ‘Your letter did not mention why the . French government has not stepped in to rescue this Goodyear tyre . factory. The extremists are in your government, who have no idea how to . build a business. 'I never said I would lower French . salaries. I only said that if I am paying people to do seven hours work, . I expect them to do at least six hours.’ But he added: ‘France does have . beautiful women and great wine. Also my grandmother named my father . after French entertainer Maurice Chevalier, and I inherited the name.’ Mr Taylor then let rip again on . France’s Europe 1 radio yesterday morning, telling the presenter: ‘Is . Montebourg stupid, or what? ‘You want to talk about the Goodyear factory, so why are you talking  to me? You should be talking to  that imbecile.’ 'The French way': Mr Taylor wrote to the French . industry minister Arnaud Montebourg (left) saying that French workers . are 'lazy'. He said he visited the factory in Amiens (right) several . times where the 'workforce gets paid high wages but works only three . hours' Mr Taylor’s tirades have sparked . outrage in France’s socialist media, but they prompted Right-wing daily . paper Le Monde to suggest: ‘Perhaps he’s right?’ The row comes as France teeters on . the brink of recession and unemployment has hit three million – the . highest level of joblessness in 15 years. A report by Swiss bank UBS found the . French graft for just 1,480 hours a year, with 27 days annual holiday – . meaning they have more free time than any other nation on the planet. Britons work 1,782 hours a year – 301 . more than the French – and have 20 days’ holiday a year, making us the . world’s 36th most lazy nation, it was found.","Chairman of U.S. tyre giant Maurice Taylor said French workforce is 'lazy'

Beating: Ahmad Holt, 22, pictured, is the alleged ringleader in the disturbing beating . Three men have been arrested in connection with a horrific video showing a Newark, New Jersey, 21-year-old being stripped and beaten with a belt because of a $20 debt. Ahmad Holt, 22, Raheem Clark, 31, and 23-year-old Jamaar Gray have been charged with robbery and aggravated assault after the August 2012 attack, which Mayor Cory Booker declared a 'human tragedy' at a press conference today. According to police, Holt administered the beating, using a belt provided by Clark, while Gray was the alleged cameraman. The haunting 2 1/2-minute video, shot on a hot summer night, starts with the young man being ordered to strip naked as he is berated by a group of thugs. One person squirts his body with water while another demands money but when he refuses to hand over the cash the . beating starts. As the naked 21-year-old, who hasn't been named, is lashed repeatedly, those surrounding . him laugh above the crack of a belt hitting his skin. City Police Director Samuel DeMaio said all three suspects have gang affiliations and criminal histories. Impassioned, Booker labelled the violence 'heinous, vicious, cruel' at today's briefing. 'This is the kind of violence and . brutality that we've seen rear its ugly head in Newark, around the . nation, around the globe, that allows one human being to assault the . dignity, to demean and to viciously attack another,' he said. 'And I . believe, for one, that this is unacceptable behavior. I know the . standards in the community are the same.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Charged: Raheem Clark, 31, left, is believed to have supplied the belt while Jamaar Gray, 23, pictured right, is the accused cameraman . He added: 'This is not who we are. We are Newark, . New Jersey. We do not tolerate this level of cruelty, of callous . disregard for the dignity of humanity.' DeMaio said the video didn't come to . the attention of police until February 8. It is unclear when it was . posted on the Internet, and has since been removed from YouTube but . garnered some 40,000 views beforehand. Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray said her office's cybercrimes unit is investigating the upload of the video. The victim, now 21, 'reluctantly' cooperated with police to identify the suspects, DeMaio said. He has since moved out of the neighborhood where the beating took place out of fear of retaliation. Attack: The young man, left, is verbally abused by another male, right, who makes him strip off his clothes as punishment for a debt of $20 his father owed . Humiliation: The 21-year-old stands naked in the streets of Newark and then is set upon by the male with a belt . The victim's father apparently owed someone $20, prompting the beating, and the group took $10 from the young man, DeMaio said. He suffered welts and abrasions from the lashing but did not require hospitalization, DeMaio said. The video incensed community members . and law enforcement in this city, which has long grappled with violent . crime and recorded 88 murders last year. 'It shows there is a brutal culture . in this community,' Booker said. 'It's not the city's culture. But it is . a subculture of violence and crime that we have to address. It's not . just here in Newark.' Booker and DeMaio said they were disturbed that no one reported the beating back in August. 'When you witness something like this, stand up and speak up,' Booker said. 'That's what allows violence in the city to go on.' Beating: The horrific beating continues for over a minute and leaves the man howling in pain . Holt was already in custody in . Trenton on unrelated charges, DeMaio said. Clark was arrested and Gray . turned himself in with an attorney on Tuesday night, DeMaio said. The 25-year-old girlfriend of one of the suspects also was arrested for heroin possession. Police launched an investigation into the brutal beating last week after the footage was posted online. On Tuesday, DeMaio, clearly moved, vowed to catch the thugs behind the 'sickening' video. 'You don't know how bad I want to see the kid who did that taken into custody,' DeMaio told NewJersey.Com. In the disturbing video, the group continues to laugh at the victim as he is being whipped by a belt wielding member of the gang and they demand that the boy tell the camera it's a 'dog eat dog world.' Heinous: Newark Mayor Cory Booker, pictured, labelled the violence 'heinous, vicious, cruel' at a press conference on Wednesday . The video sparked widespread outrage and got the back up of Newark City Council President Anibal Ramos. 'The perpetrator as well as those who . stood idly by laughing and videotaping this act of savage brutality . should be brought to justice,' he said on Tuesday. DeMaio . said their investigations led them to a Twitter account of a potential . person of interest but it is unclear if that was one of those arrested . today. Dozens of . furious tweets linking to the video identify someone owning the Twitter . handles @440BoyRiqBubz - an account which has been deactivated. 'To see him stripped down naked and taken advantage of and abused like that, it was sickening to me,' DeMaio said on Tuesday. 'I pictured somebody doing that to my son … the people that did that need to be brought to justice for sure.'","Ahmad Holt, 22, Raheem Clark, 31, and 23-year-old Jamaar Gray have been charged with robbery and aggravated assault after the attack .

The Alabama boy held hostage for almost a week by crazed survivalist Jimmy Lee Dykes celebrated his sixth birthday on Wednesday with a homecoming party attended by the SWAT team, FBI agents and hostage negotiators who had carried out his dramatic rescue just hours before. The boy, identified only as Ethan, was kidnapped from his school bus by 65-year-old Dyke and held hostage in a nearly week-long standoff near Midland City, Alabama. The FBI hostage team rushed the booby-trapped underground bunker where Ethan was being held on Monday afternoon after they became increasingly concerned for his safety. Home safe: Ethan celebrated his sixth birthday with a party on Wednesday which was even attended by his rescuers . A sign in front of the Midland City Town Hall welcomes Ethan back home . A dramatic gunfight ensued in which Dykes, who fired . the first shot, was killed. Ethan was physically unharmed during the ordeal. On Wednesday, Ethan celebrated his sixth birthday at a local church filled with family and friends as well his rescuers. The party, which doubled as a homecoming celebration, had 'Welcome home Ethan' signs hanging on the walls. Young Ethan, who showed no visible signs of his traumatic ordeal just days earlier, looked to be having fun as he smiled for photos and played with toy cars at the party. His adult brother Camren Kirkland has revealed that during the boy’s time in captivity the family received regular text messages from the hostage negotiators updating on Ethan's well-being. 'We did know when, at times, he was asleep and that was normally around nine o'clock at night,' Kirkland told ABC News. Ethan pictured happy and smiling at his birthday party on Wednesday just two days after his dramatic rescue . Dead: Jimmy Lee Dykes was killed by members of the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team after they blew open the doors of his bunker and went inside . He said the updates provided the family with a lot of comfort during the ordeal. 'I could actually go lay my head down,' he said. He also revealed that the whole family was together when they received a phone call from the FBI agents to informed them that Ethan had been rescued and was coming home. On Monday afternoon, authorities executed their meticulous plan with military precision after learning the underground bunker was rigged with explosives which they believed Dykes was preparing to detonate. The hostage team seized their chance when the Vietnam veteran climbed an eight-foot ladder to get supplies and as he reached up, he became off balance and vulnerable. With Ethan away from the ladder and safe, agents dropped two stun grenades into the hole to disorientate Dykes and within seconds they had stormed the bunker. A firefight ensued and the survivalist fired the first shot. After the raid, the FBI found two . explosive devices - one which was lodged in the PVC pipe used to lower . supplies to the underground bunker which have now been safely detonated. Neighbors said they heard what sounded like explosions and gunshots, though the FBI and local authorities didn't say how many shots were fired and by whom. No officers or agents were injured, Pack said. MailOnline was the first to report . that security forces had altered their plans to use the PVC pipe as a . route for a hidden camera after discovering that it was wired with . explosives. According to the FBI . initial investigations suggest that, 'The subject reinforced the bunker . against any attempted entry by law enforcement.' The FBI special agent running the rescue raid has revealed that Dykes left . behind written notes and  had become . more and more agitated the longer that he was in the bunker. 'At the end of the day, the responsibility is mine,' he said. 'I thought the child was going to die.' Camren Kirkland has revealed that during his brother's time in captivity the family received regular text messages from the hostage negotiators updating on Ethan's well-being . Authorities continue their investigation on Friday at the site where Ethan was held hostage in an underground bunker before being rescued Monday . The bunker where Jimmy Lee Dykes held Ethan hostage for seven days. Police used the PVC pipe to communicate with Dykes, who was three feet underground . For days, officers passed food, medicine, toys and other items into the bunker, which was similar to a tornado shelter and apparently had running water, heat and cable television. After her son's rescue, Ethan's mother said: 'For the first time in almost a week, . I woke up this morning to the most beautiful sight - my sweet boy. 'I . can't describe how incredible it is to hold him again. Ethan is safe . and back in my arms - and I owe it all to some of the most . compassionate people on Earth.' The . mother, who has yet to be identified, has asked that the family's privacy . be respected in order to give them time to heal, move forward and 'put . the nightmare behind them'. Ethan's grandmother has also spoke to the media to say that though Ethan is OK physically, the ordeal could . stay with him the rest of his life. 'We know he's OK physically, but we don't know how he is mentally,' said Betty Jean Ransbottom, the boy's grandmother. She added that she feared the ordeal would stay with the child the rest of his life. Ransbottom said she cried herself to sleep every night while the boy was being held hostage, and didn't sleep much while she awaited for news. 'It was horrible. I never went through anything so horrible,' she said. Ethan pictured with his older brother Camren Kirkland . She said an FBI agent . stayed with the family the entire time the boy was being held hostage by . Jimmy Lee Dykes, but officials are not giving the family much . information because of the ongoing investigation. They learned of his rescue when an FBI agent at the scene called the agent staying with the family. Debra . Cook, Ransbottom's sister, said the family was grateful for the . community's prayers and support. Fliers around town asked people to pray . for the boy, and others gathered at nightly vigils to pray for his safe . return. 'He has gone through a terrible ordeal, and I don't know if he will ever get over it,' Cook said. 'I just want him to be all right.' Details of the rescue operation emerged today after it was revealed an elite team of FBI agents built a mock bunker and inserted a spy camera into the lair to rescue Ethan after a week of meticulous and secretive planning. Cleared: The aerial shot of Dykes' property shows how he cleared away most of the trees so that he could see anyone approaching his home . Ethan was rescued from the underground bunker after a week of meticulous and secretive planning . The FBI Hostage Rescue Team blew the doors off the bunker and shot dead the survivalist during the daring raid on Monday afternoon after footage from a secret hi-tech camera showed the boy’s life was in ‘imminent danger’. Agents became increasingly concerned the 65-year-old's behavior would turn violent after their negotiations with him 'deteriorated' in the final 24 hours. FBI Special Agent Steve Richardson said: 'Dykes was observed holding a gun. 'At this point, . the FBI agents, fearing the child was in imminent danger, entered the . bunker and rescued the child.' Special agent Richardson said: 'I've been to the hospital. I visited with Ethan. He is doing fine. 'He's . laughing, joking, playing, eating, the things that you would expect a . normal five-to-six-year-old young man to do. He's very brave, he's very . lucky, and the success story is that he's out safe and doing great.' Happy: Ethan's great aunt Debra Cook, right, and uncle, Berlin Enfinger, spoke to ABC of the family's relief that he is safe and well . It was also revealed today that Ethan's mother asked the FBI not to kill Dykes, a Vietnam war veteran, if they could help it because she believed he was not a well man. State Sen Harri Anne Smith revealed: 'She put her hand on the officer's heart and said, ""Sir, don't hurt him. He's sick"".' The boy's great aunt and uncle have also spoken out about the family's relief that Ethan is back and safe. Debra Cook said: 'If I could, I would do cartwheels all the way down the road. I was ecstatic. Everything just seemed like it was so much clearer. 'You know, we had all been walking around in a fog and everyone was just excited. There's no words to put how we felt and how relieved we were. Ethan was physically unharmed during the ordeal, but his family have some concerns about how it may impact him mentally in the years to come . 'He is so happy to be home, we all are, and he looks great. His mom said everything is fine.' She said her nephew is the kind of boy who lights up a room whenever he enters it and is always going 90mph. As for Dykes, the family did not know him personally but believed he was well-known in the community for having many issues. Speaking . last night Sheriff Wally Olson, who has been on the site almost . constantly since Ethan's abduction and the shooting of school bus driver . Mr Charles 'Chuck' Poland, said: 'He's a very special child who's . endured a lot and by the grace of God he's okay.' Video: Rescued Alabama hostage Ethan celebrates birthday .

Now the worst excesses of snowstorm Nemo have descended, the fun can begin. The blizzard caused havoc by dropping up to three feet of snow on the north-eastern U.S. But the recovery has now started in earnest. Many residents are releasing their tension through snowball fights and playing in the powder. Across the region, families and friends threw snow at each other, went sledding and built igloos. There is plenty of the white stuff remaining. On Sunday, some residents were just starting to dig themselves out of their inundated homes. And there is still a long way to go to return to normality. Massachusetts Institute of Technology student Erica Simmoms is covered in snow during a snow ball fight between MIT and Harvard University students in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Sunday . The thaw has begun but there's lots of snow left. These cars remain buried in Hamden, Connecticut on Sunday . Emergency crews and residents began to clear roadways and sidewalks after the storm that rampaged through the Northeast. Municipal . workers from New York to Boston labored through the weekend in . snow-bound communities, where some motorists had to be rescued after . spending hours stuck in their cars. President Barack Obama declared a state . of emergency for Connecticut, allowing federal aid to be used in . recovery, and utilities in some hard-hit New England states predicted . that the storm could leave some customers in the dark for days. About 345,000 homes and businesses were without power Sunday morning, down from a peak of about 650,000. 'We've never seen anything like this,' said county official Steven Bellone of New York's Long Island, which got . more than 2 1/2 feet of snow. Some school districts announced they'd be closed Monday, complicating parents' back to work schedules but giving kids another day for frolicking. At least 11 deaths in the U.S. were blamed on the snowstorm, including an 11-year-old boy in Boston who was overcome by carbon monoxide as he sat in a running car to keep warm while his father shoveled Saturday morning. That death and the illnesses of several others exposed to carbon monoxide set off a flurry of safety warnings from public officials. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University students have a snow ball fight following a winter blizzard which dumped up to 40 inches of snow with hurricane force winds across the northeast . Winter Fun: MIT and Harvard students enjoy the snow - which tragically left at least 11 people dead across the Tri-State and New England region . Residents of Hamden, Connecticut, dig out in front of their snow-covered home following the huge blizzard . Roads across the Northeast were impassable and cars were entombed by snow drifts on Saturday. Some people found the snow packed so high against their homes they couldn't get their doors open. 'It's like lifting cement. They say it's 2 feet, but I think it's more like 3 feet,' said Michael Levesque, who was shoveling snow in Quincy, Massachusetts, for a landscaping company. In Providence, where the drifts were 5 feet high and telephone lines encrusted with ice and snow drooped under the weight, Jason Harrison labored for nearly three hours to clear his blocked driveway and front walk and still had more work to do. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee cautioned that while the snow had stopped, the danger hadn't passed: 'People need to take this storm seriously, even after it's over. If you have any kind of heart condition, be careful with the shoveling.' Blowing with hurricane-force winds of more than 80 mph in places, the storm hit hard along the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor between New York City and Maine. Milford, Connecticut, got 38 inches of snow, and Portland, Maine, recorded 31.9, shattering a 1979 record. Several communities in New York and across New England got more than 2 feet.

Rescued at last: A car in a Hamden, Connecticut, parking lot is dug out of the snow in the aftermath of a storm that hit Connecticut and much of the New England states . Still, the storm was not as bad as some of the forecasts led many to fear, and not as dire as the Blizzard of '78, used by longtime New Englanders as the benchmark by which all other winter storms are measured. 'Considering the severity, of the storm, the amount of snow and the wind, we've come though this pretty well,' Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation.' Boston got up to 2 feet of snow, according to the National Weather Service. The 14.8 inches that fell Saturday alone broke the city's record for of 12.4 inches in a single day, set in 1994. Bradley Airport near Hartford, Conn., got 22 inches, for the No. 2 spot in the record books there. Concord, New Hampshire, got 24 inches of snow, the second-highest amount on record and a few inches short of the reading from the great Blizzard of 1888.

In Rhode Island, a high of around 180,000 customers lost power, or about one-third of the state. Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island imposed travel bans to keep cars off the road and let plows do their work, and the National Guard helped clear highways in Connecticut, where more than 240 accidents were reported. The Guardsmen rescued about 90 people, including a few who had hypothermia and were taken to hospitals. On Long Island, hundreds of drivers spent a cold and scary night stuck on the highways. Even snowplows got bogged down or were blocked by stuck cars, so emergency workers used snowmobiles to try to reach motorists, many of whom were still waiting to be rescued hours after the snow had stopped.

At 8 a.m., when it was light out, he walked home. 'I could run my car and keep the heat on and listen to the radio a little bit,' he said. 'It was very icy under my car. That's why my car is still there.' Local police said Sunday that all known abandoned cars were searched and no one needing medical help was found.

Across much of New England, streets were empty of cars and dotted instead with children who had never seen so much snow and were jumping into snow banks and making forts. Snow was waist-high in the streets of Boston. Plows made some thoroughfares passable but piled even more snow on cars parked on the city's narrow streets. Boston's Logan Airport resumed operations Saturday, and limited train and bus service in the metro area was set to resume Sunday afternoon. Authorities hoped to restore most service for Monday.

'I have always wanted a snowstorm for my wedding, and my wish has come true to the max,' she said. Some spots in Massachusetts had to be evacuated because of coastal flooding, including Salisbury Beach, where around 40 people were ordered out. One concern going forward was a forecast for rain Monday in New England. While warmer temperatures might begin melting snow, the rain on top of snow already piled up on roofs could pose a danger of collapse. 'We are encouraging people as they can do so safely to use snow rakes and so forth to move the snow off of their roofs,' Patrick said.","Tri-State area and New England begin to recover from storm which dumped up to three-feet of snow over Saturday night .

The state of Georgia is attempting to fast track the executions of death row prisoners before its supply of the drug it uses in lethal injections expires. Yesterday the southern state administered a lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital to Andrew Allen Cook, 38, who had confessed to the killing of two college students to his FBI agent father. They are now trying to rush through the execution of mentally disabled Warren Lee Hill who beat death of a fellow inmate to death in 1999 while serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend. Drug shortage: The death chamber at the state prison in Jackson, Georgia. The state's entire supply of lethal injection drugs will expire on March 1 . Georgia's entire supply of pentobarbital will expire on March 1, at which point they will have no way of executing the 94 prisoners they have on death row. With some drug companies going out of business and others unwilling to become accomplices in executions, U.S. states which practise the death penalty are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain supplies of lethal-injection drugs. Hurry: The attorney general is now trying to push through the execution of inmate Warren Hill despite claims he is mentally disabled . This has reportedly led to a marked . decrease in the number of executions in recent years with some states . now looking to India to source the drugs. In . 1999, the European commission imposed restrictions on the export of . medicines to all US corrections departments following unilateral action . by the UK. Danish firm Lundbeck, One of the leading manufacturers of pentobarbital, has introduced tough new measures to stop the drug falling into the hands of U.S. executioners. Last year, several U.S. states including Georgia were found to have been buying lethal injection drugs through a shady unlicensed company in London that was being run from the back of a driving school. Cook's was Georgia's first execution since the state switched its procedure from using a three-drug combination to a single dose of pentobarbital. They had been forced to make the change after Hospira, the only US manufacturer of sodium thiopental - a key ingredient of the lethal cocktail, ceased production in 2011. Hill's death warrant runs until 26 February, but he was granted a stay of execution after the courts discovered pentobarbital was being ordered by the corrections department without a doctor's prescription. Now Georgia's attorney general is scrambling to have the stay of execution overturned so sentence can be carried out before the warrant expires. But his hands are further tied by the fact widespread condemnation of Hill's sentence due to his mental disability, which resulted in a federal appeal court blocking the execution to allow time to consider the issue. Georgia appealed to the US Supreme Court to overturn the decision but was denied. Desperate: Several U.S. states including Georgia were found to have been buying lethal injection drugs through a shady unlicensed company in London that was being run from the back of a driving school . Anti-death penalty campaigners have condemned the apparent hurry to administer the punishments before the drugs expire. Sara Totonchi, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights told the Guardian:'This highlights the nastiness of the process that the AG should be racing to kill prisoners ahead of an expiration date.' The state of Georgia confirmed to the Guardian newspaper that its entire supply of pentobarbital expires on 1 March. However a spokesman for the department of corrections said they were confident of being 'able to obtain sufficient supplies of the drugs necessary to carry out the court ordered lethal injection process'.","Georgia's entire supply of pentobarbital will expire on March 1 .

A Philadelphia woman who stripped naked along with three of her children outside a high school has blamed the psychotic episode on an adverse reaction to medication she was taking. Sara Butler's lawyer said conflicting medications for lupus led the 44-year-old mother to think the world was ending. On the morning of March 16, Butler drove to Upper Darby High School with her two adult daughters, Joanne, 23, and Bessie, 22, plus a 14-year-old son. Bizarre scene: Sara Butler and her family are dragged naked from a car, where they had been chanting 'Jesus is Lord' Mugshots: Sara Butler, left, and daughter Joanne, right, pleaded guilty to indecent exposure and disorderly conduct . She had wanted to pick up another child, but the student wasn't released because - although Butler was the child’s biological mother - she was not the custodial parent. 'During this psychotic episode, Miss Butler thought that basically the world was coming to an end, so she - caring for her family - decided to bring all of her children together,' said her attorney Sharmil McKee. School district security ordered the family off the property, but they returned three more times, reports Delco Times. The last came at about 1 p.m., when they arrived in a van and stripped between two parked vehicles in the parking lot. 'In order to please the Lord, Miss Butler felt that she needed to exit the world in the same manner that Adam and Eve entered the world, and to do so she needed to be naked,' said McKee. 'When police got there, they were in a van and locked their arms in defiant protest,' said Upper Darby police Superintendent Michael Chitwood. Arrested: The family members were held by police for stripping outside the high school . Upper Darby High School in Philadelphia . 'They were chanting, ""Jesus is Lord."" When we got them back to the police station we gave them their clothes and the mom refused to put her clothes on.' Sara Butler does not have any underlying psychological problems and has never been in trouble with the law before, said McKee. She is currently seeing a therapist, who has discontinued the medication that triggered the episode. McKee said the family had never seen their mother act that way before, but is now familiar with what a psychotic break looks like. All three women apologized and promised that the episode will not be repeated. 'I regret what happened that day and it will never happen again,' Sara Butler said. Butler and her adult daughters pleaded guilty to indecent exposure and disorderly conduct, for which they each received one year of probation and were ordered to stay away from the high school. Sara Butler also entered an open plea to simple assault and corrupting the morals of a minor, for which she was given a concurrent probationary sentence and ordered to pay a $500 fine.","Sara Butler blames her psychotic episode on an adverse reaction to lupus medication .

Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan were the second-largest philanthropists in the country last year as they gave away nearly half a billion dollars. The Facebook founder and his pediatrician wife donated a total of $498.8million to charitable causes in 2012, putting them in line after billionaire Warren Buffett. Mr Buffet gave more than six-times more than his younger counterparts, giving away $3.1billion to various causes, but it was the rapid ascent of the Zuckerbergs in the ranks of the country's philanthropists that comes as more of a surprise. Power couple: Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan were listed as the second-largest donors in the country in 2012 after giving away $498.8million . Mr Zuckerberg, 28, made his first massive donation two years earlier when he announced that he was pledging $100million to the Newark school system in New Jersey. Low key: The couple are notoriously private but Mr Zuckerberg has been public with his donations in the past . That donation was tainted with cynicism as it came around the same time as the film The Social Network which portrayed him in a somewhat negative light. The spending spree didn't stop there, however, as The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported that he donated 18 million shares of Facebook stock to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2012. The shares are valued at about $498.8million and he directed it towards the local group. Education and health programs are two of the many ways that the non-profit directs their funds. 'Together, . we will look for areas in education and health to focus on next. I'm . hopeful we'll be able to have as positive an impact in our next set of . projects,' Mr Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook page at the time of his . December donation. Aside from the donation to the Newark . education system and the latest boost to the Silicon Valley fund, Mr . Zuckerberg has used tools other than his deep pockets. In . May of last year, Mr Zuckerberg said announced that he integrated a way . for Facebook users to publicize their role as organ donors in an effort . to connect those in need with people willing to help. This was one of the clearest ways that his wife's interests influenced his charitable efforts. First big donation: Mr Zuckerberg gave $100million to the Newark school system in 2010 and announced the move on Oprah Winfrey's talk show alongside New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Newark mayor Cory Booker . Other ways to help: Zuckerberg also used Facebook as a way to do charitable work as he incorporated an organ donation function into the social networking site in May 2012 . As his then-girlfriend was studying pediatrics- and just months after it was revealed that Apple founder Steve Jobs underwent a liver transplant before he died- Mr Zuckerberg told how he felt the social network could help. 'She's in medical school now so our . dinner conversations- she's going to be a pediatrian- are often about . Facebook and kids and the kids that she's meeting. She has these stories . about she spends a lot of time with the patients she's treating she'll . spend weeks with someone and getting to know them and see them getting . sicker as they don't have the organ that they need,' he told ABC's Robin . Roberts.

Honoured guests included Nathaniel and Cleopatra Pendelton, left, and Dr. Jill Biden, right, with Apple CEO Tim Smith, third left, top row . Honored guests: The first three rows near the First Lady were chocked-full of individuals who represent various parts of the President's policy initiatives . 1. Sergeant Sheena Adams is a decorated veteran who earned the Combat Action Ribbon and Navy and Marine Corp Achievement Medal. Given the recent decision to lift the ban against women serving in combat roles, her long service in the military gave a pointed message. 2. and 3. The parents of Hadiya Pendleton are the guests of Michelle Obama. The First Lady got to know Nathaniel and Cleopatra Pendleton when she traveled to Chicago to attend the 15-year-old girl's funeral. First Lady Michelle Obama enthusiastically greeted those sitting around her before being serious throughout the speech, which went on for more than an hour. Emotional: Sandy Hook teacher Kaitlin Roig was seated next to Dr Jill Biden and rose to her feet during a portion where the President spoke about gun control . 4. Menchu de Luna Lopez is . a nurse at New York University Hospital who helped save 20 babies when . the power went out in the hospital following a power outage from . Hurricane Sandy. The superstorm came up early in the speech, as the . President directly attributed the devastating storm to global warming. 5. Dr Jill Biden sat two seats over from the First Lady, and her husband Vice President Hoe Biden was seated behind the President at the front of the room. 6. A key spot was given to Sandy Hook teacher Kaitlin Roig who saved the lives of her students by hiding them in a closet for the remainder of the massacre. The 29-year-old teacher spoke publicly after the incident about how she tried to keep them quiet and was reticent to open the door to emergency responders for fear that it was a trick by the shooter.7. Alan Aleman's inclusion appears to be a pure policy move as he was one of the first people in Nevada who were able to legally remain in the country following the passage of the President's immigration reform for the children of illegal immigrants. Adding to his attractiveness for the cause is the fact that he is a college student seeking a degree in biology and hopes to be a doctor. Second row: Economic themes and personal perseverance were present in the stories of these guests . 8. Small business owner Deb Carey represents an economic success story as she and her husband created the New Glarus Brewing Company in Wisconsin. They sold their home and rallied outside support to raise seed money and they now employ 50 full-time employees. 9. Apple CEO Tim Cook was invited by the First Lady and though he was never pointed out by name, his role in the national economy makes him a major player. The biggest allusion to his presence was Mr Obama's reference to the threat posed by cyber attacks. 10. President Obama frequently references his two daughters when talking about equal-pay policies. Tonight, however, he used Amanda McMillan, a woman who has filed a fair-pay suit against her former employers in Mississippi after she was not promoted for a higher paying job. Third row: Some of the causes that the First Lady has worked on throughout the first term- like support for military families and healthy eating initiatives- were highlighted by these guests . 15. Tracey Hepner is a co-founder of Military Partners and Families Coalition and her presence comes just days after the Pentagon announced extended benefits for the spouses of military members. Ms Hepner is married to Army Birgadier General Tammy Smith. Injured: U.S. Marine Sergeant Carlos Evans is a double amputee after losing both of his legs and a hand during his four deployments . 16, One of the youngest attendees was 12-year-old Haile Thomas, . who was invited because she helped start an organization that promotes . healthy cooking tutorials. Mrs Obama has largely based her agenda on . health initiatives like Let's Move, so the fact that she would include . someone related to the cause. 17. Energy independence is an item that the President has listed towards the top of his agenda, and Lee Maxwell represented the cause as he works as a wind energy technician. When he was called by the white House about the event, he was told that they were looking for middle class citizens influenced by the President's policies. 18. Another one of the First Lady's causes has been the support of military veterans, and Sergeant Carlos Evans (right) was invited accordingly. The U.S. Marine is a double amputee after losing both of his legs and a hand during his four deployments. 19. Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett is the rare political aide who made the cut and was able to sit within the prized three rows during the speech. 20. Though he looked bored at many points during the speech, Jack Andraka's mind is at work outside of the Capitol. The 16-year-old won $75,000 after inventing a test that detects the early stages of pancreatic cancer. Faces in the crowd: Michelle Obama and Dr Jill Biden were surrounded by the noted guests . Other special guests who were scattered throughout the audience: . In a similar vein, the NASA engineer who . became famous for his distinguishable mohawk during the Mars landing . will also be seated near the First Lady. Bobak Ferdowsi (below left) become . something of an internet sensation following the August landing and his . notoriety will lend credence to any space program mentions that Mr . Obama chooses to include. One of the oldest attendees is Desiline Victor . (below right), an 102-year-old woman who has a cause celebre since waiting in . line for three hours to vote. She has become somewhat of a symbol for . the movement and her attendance is clear that the issue will be . addressed. Happy to be there: NASA flight director Bobak Ferdowsi (left)was in the first row and 102-year-old Desiline Victor, who was made to wait for two hours to vote, was in the fourth (right) Guests related to the push for gun control measures: . Carlos Soto Jr., the younger brother of slain Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Vicky Soto, is the guest of Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro who represents a district in Connecticut near the site of the December massacre. Newtown chief administrator Pat Llodra was the public face of the aftermath from the shooting, and she is the guest of Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal. Two local police detectives- Jason Frank and Dan McAnaspie- were invited by the state’s other Senator Chris Murphy. They were among the first responders at the tragic scene following the December 14 shooting. Teresa Hoover, a mother whose son A.J. Boik died in the Aurora movie theater shooting, is the guest of Colorado Congressman Ed Perlmutter. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and . her husband astronaut Mark Kelly are the guests of Democratic . Congressman Ron Barber and Republican Senator John McCain. Familiar faces: Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband astronaut Mark Kelly wore green ribbons in honor of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting . Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi brought in an unidentified fourth grader who attends a different Newtown school. The child wrote a letter pushing for stricter gun control following the shooting. Though members of Congress and the . Senate are automatically invited, governors are not typically on the . guest list. Mrs Pelosi made a point to invite Maryland's Democratic . Governor Martin O'Malley since he has enacted strict laws against guns in his state. Singer Tony Bennett (below) attended the speech as a guest of Mrs Pelosi. Though his name is clearly more recognizable than a number of the others connected to the push for stricter gun control, the Grammy winner was featured in an ad supporting the cause. Singing his tune: Tony Bennett was a guest of Nancy Pelosi because he starred in an ad advocating for stronger gun control laws . Republican politicians bring some famous faces to the crowd: . Singer Ted Nugent (below) was a controversial invite since he has long-been critical of the Obama administration, regularly threatening the President in public statements. He is the guest of Congressman Steve Stockman from Texas, and as he is a prominent gun enthusiast, he will be a clear contrast to the many guest who are relatives to victims of gun violence who are pushing for controls. Notably, he chose to wear jeans to the ceremony. Unexpected: Singer Ted Nugent, who has been a long-time critic of President Obama was invited to the speech from a pro-gun Congressman from Texas . House Speaker John Boehner picked more crowd-pleasing guests, including Gail McGovern, the president of the American Red Cross, and Arthur Mola, the principal of the bilingual Sacred Heart School in Washington, D.C. Mr Mola will be sitting alongside two fourth graders- Laci Joseph and Henry Joseph III- who attend nearby St. Anthony’s Catholic School. Mr Boehner’s connection to the children is unclear. Paying tribute to his home state, Mr Boehner invited Ted Kremer, a former batboy for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team who has Downs syndrome. In an unexpected move, he also invited Jason Barlow who heads a local branch of the United Auto Workers union. Republicans have blasted unions and many gained points among voters by standing against the groups, as was seen in Wisconsin.","A wide selection of citizens who represent the President's policies were invited to be honored guests of First Lady Michelle Obama .

Victim: Natalie Egleston, 48, was pronounced dead from a traumatic brain injury after another female skier collided with her on Aspen Mountain . A woman enjoying a ski vacation at the upscale Aspen resort was killed Monday when another skier collided with her on the mountain. Pitkin County coroner's officials said Tuesday that 48-year-old Natalie Egleston, of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, died at a hospital of a traumatic brain injury. According to Aspen Skiing Co. officials, Egleston was unconscious after the collision with another female skier. Resort officials said the other skier, a woman from New York City, sustained minor injuries. Both skiers were wearing helmets. In a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday, Ski Patrol Director . Jeff Lumsden identified the other skier as Virginia Chen. Sheriff Joe DiSalvo told The Aspen Times it appeared Egleston may have stopped to clean her goggles when the other woman slammed into her. Resort officials say the tragic accident happened at around 3:45pm on Spar Gulch, just below where an expert run called Jackpot exits. Egleston was wearing dark or gray clothes and may have been standing in a shadow at the time, Pitkin County Sheriff DiSalvo told Aspen Daily News. She was skiing that day with her boyfriend, identified by MailOnline Thursday as Ron Konsza, of Pennsylvania. By the time Ski Patrol got the call about and accident and arrived on the scene, the 48-year-old woman was unresponsive. She was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital and pronounced dead from a traumatic brain injury. County deputy coroner Eric Hansen said Egleston’s fatal injury resulted from her head hitting the snow. She also suffered cracked ribs from the impact. According to Jeff Lumsden, Egleston's 'brain stem snapped' as a result of the crash. Crash site: The collision took place on the Spar Gulch run under expert terrain called Jackpot . Trip gone awry: Egleston, pictured left and right, was skiing with a male friend when officials say she stopped to clean out her goggles . Sheriff's officials are still trying to determine how fast the other skier was going down the run at the time of the crash, but a preliminary investigation has shown that her speed did not appear to be excessive, suggesting that there was no criminal negligence on her part. According to the Colorado Skier Safety Act, the person higher up on the hill has the responsibility to avoid people below. Aspen Ski Patrol said the woman obeyed the Skier Safety Act by staying at the scene of the collision and immediately coming to Egleston's aid. Chen could face a citation, which comes with a $1,000 fine, but officials said the skier could also be subject to a major civil lawsuit, CBS Denver reported. Egleston, a graduate of the . prestigious Cornell University, served as president of IndoorDirect, a . marketing company that produces entertainment for restaurants. She . had previously worked as chief strategy officer and executive vice . president at Premier Retail Networks (PRN), a San-Francisco based . company specializing in digital out-of-home advertising. According to an industry blog DailyDOOH, Egleston had 24 years of experience in the field of marketing and was only recently named president of IndoorDirect. Successful: Egleston, a graduate of Cornell University, was the president of a marketing company producing TV content for restaurants . Egleston's former colleagues at PRN told the blog: 'Natalie was one of the really good ones.' Several commenters who worked with Egleston eulogized her online Thursday. 'It is so sad to learn of Natalie’s death,' wrote Mike DiFranza. 'Our industry has lost one of it’s most passionate proponents.' David Goldstein, who had worked with Egleston at PRN, said in a post: 'Her insights on the industry and the passion to achieve success, along with her openess [sic] to new ideas, made her a great leader. Here laughter, compassion and smile, made her a great friend.' Her brother, Brian, told the blog Denver Westword she recently returned to the Philadelphia area after living in San Francisco. In an email message to MailOnline, Egleston’s friend Elizabeth Winchcombe pointed out that the 48-year-old woman was ‘an expert skier, and knew the Aspen resort extremely well.’ Reporting by MailOnline has revealed Thursday that Egleston had been in a relationship with a man by the name Ron Konsza. It is believed that Egleston was on the slopes with Konsza when the crash happened. Konsza, 55, works as an aeronautical engineer at Lockheed Martin based in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. According to his Facebook page, the two met in 2010. According to online records, in his free time, Konsza is involved in competitive ski racing. He has been part of the Nature Valley NASTAR, the largest public ski race program in the world with more than 95,000 members, according to its website. Konsza has been competing since 1997 and was awarded a gold medal and the top ranking after racing to victory in Pennsylvania's Bear Creek resort in January. About a week before the tragedy in Aspen, Konsza raced to two platinum and silver medals in two races at Roundtop Mountain Resort in Pennsylvania. Egleston’s death marks the third fatality on the local ski runs so far this winter. Four days earlier, champion X Games snowmobiler Caleb Moore passed away from a fatal injury which he suffered when his machine flipped over on top of him. Tragic accident: Snomobiler Caleb Moore suffered a fatal accident during the Winter X Games in Aspen late last month . Ski Patrol officer Patsy Hileman died December 30 after an avalanche swept her over a cliff at the Snowmass Ski Area.

"By . Louise Boyle and Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 15:11 EST, 11 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 12 February 2013 . Jodi Arias told the court today that months before she stabbed him to death, she caught her boyfriend Travis Alexander pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys. That admission came nearly a year after he had given her a packet of boy’s Spiderman underwear for Valentine's Day, saying that he found it 'hot' when she wore them during sex. Monday was one of the most explosive days of testimony in her ongoing murder trial, as she told the jury in the Phoenix, Arizona courtroom about how she discovered his ‘deviant’ sexual interest a long time after they had started their sexual relationship. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Telling her story: Jodi Arias appears on the stand on Monday in Phoenix, Arizona where she told the jury that Travis Alexander 'pleasured himself to pictures of young boys' 'Confused': Arias could not offer an explanation as too why Alexander wanted her to wear boy's Spiderman underwear while they had sex (stock picture) The most gripping moment came when she . recounted how she went over to his house after work on January 21, 2008 . and helped him move some boxes up to the attic. He then gave her a . porcelain angel figurine, calling her ‘his angel’. Later after leaving the house, she realized she forgot the figurine and she turned her car around to go back to get it. When she went back into the house, she . did not see or hear Alexander until she walked into his bedroom and . found him pleasuring himself on the bed. ‘I got really embarrassed, even though we'd been intimate more times than I can count,’ she told the courtroom. He then allegedly tried to collect the . pieces of paper that were surrounding him on the bed before she could . see what they were, but one fell at her feet and she saw that it was a . picture of a young boy in his underwear. She did not recognize the boy, and only said that he looked to be about five or six years old. ‘I was frozen there for a minute- . well, maybe not a whole minute- I didn't know how to react,’ she said, . going on to say that she ran out of the house and into her car. Once she arrived home, she rushed to the bathroom and threw up. But she also claimed that they had sexual . relations that night because she thought that it would ‘help’ him. Choked up: Arias told the court that she saw Travis Alexander pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys in their underwear . Throughout the day’s testimony, her . defense attorney continually asked why various incidents during her . relationship with Alexander did not prompt her to cut ties with him all . together. Since Arias, 32, has claimed that she . killed the then-30-year-old man in self defense, the attorney is likely . using her time on the stand to paint a picture of a battered woman who . felt compelled to return to a complex relationship. One of those points, addressed earlier in the day, was when she alleged that he had sex with her while she was sleeping. Another was on February 14, 2007, when . she received a box of Valentine's Day presents from Alexander which . included chocolates, a T-shirt and panties with his name on it, and a . packet of Spiderman underwear. She claimed her later discovery of him with the pictures of young boys helped her understand why he thought it was ‘hot’ for her to wear the children’s . underwear. She added that she was forced to alter the . underwear because the leg holes were too tight and that she had been . 'confused' by Alexander's request. Alexander repeatedly had anal sex with her while she was wearing the children's underwear, Arias said. Stares: The sisters of victim Travis Alexander have been present each day of trial and have rolled their eyes and looked away as Arias testifies . Disbelief: Travis' sisters and his friend looked incredulous as Arias told the court about his alleged 'deviant' interests . ‘He preferred sex with women, it made him feel normal, more normal,’ she told the court. ‘It's hard to describe this. It’s very . embarrassing. He seemed very ashamed with himself and he didn’t want to . be that way it was something he struggled with. It’s not who he wanted . to be its not who he wanted to be in the future... when he had sex with . women he felt more normal and it was preferable to his other deviant . urges, I guess you could say.’ Arias also testified on Monday about . the first time she had sex with Alexander in May 2007. She said that she . had been asleep and awoke to him having vaginal sex with her. Throughout the trial, Arias has . differentiated between vaginal and anal sex, because she believed that . vaginal sex went against her Mormon vow of chastity before marriage, . while anal and oral sex qualified as a ‘grey area.’ She said that during the May 2007 . tryst, he forced her to perform oral sex on him but at no point did she . tell him to stop because 'she loved him.' Arias also told the packed court room . that Alexander had a violent temper. On Monday she specified that he had . been physically violent with her on at least four different occasions, . either grabbing her wrists or slamming her onto the bed during an . argument. Damage: Arias held up her finger to show the courtroom what happened after Alexander allegedly kicked her in the finger and the rib during an altercation . The most extreme of those cases ended with her on the floor as he allegedly kicked her in the ribs and hurt her finger. She said that rather than seek medical treatment for the finger, which she believes was broken, they made a makeshift splint. In court, she held up her hand to show how it is scarred bent even today. ‘I would have never called the police . on Travis,’ she said while talking about the incident when he kicked her . in the ribs and hand. ‘I couldn’t imagine doing something like that. ‘It would have felt like treachery, I wouldn't have betrayed him. I was loyal to him.’ Emotional: Arias wept in court on Monday as she was shown photographs of her with Alexander on trips and at parties . Earlier in the day, she said that . their relationship showed strains in the beginning, as she confronted . him after finding text messages from other women just a few months after . they began dating. Several months later in 2007, Arias . moved to Mesa and although the couple remained broken up, they continued . to have a clandestine relationship. Around this time, Alexander paid Arias . to clean his house because she had money troubles. She claimed he . wanted sex while she cleaned and would suggest she wear a French maid's . costume. The murder suspect also described the fantasies that Alexander would act out upon her. She told the jury on Monday that on . several occasions, he drove up to her house and ejaculated on her face . while she was on the porch of her home. She said that on one occasion, . he threw a Toblerone candy bar at her after he did so. Anger: Taylor Searle (pictured right), a friend of murder victim Travis Alexander, has said that she believes Arias is lying on the stand . 'I couldn't help feeling I was kind of like a prostitute,' she added. 'But I chalked it up to one of his little antics.' She said that around this time, the number of their sexual 'antics' increased. Arias also said that during their casual relationship, they had sex on the freeway while he was driving. Travis Alexander's sisters sat in the front row of the gallery today and glared at Arias on the stand throughout her testimony, repeatedly rolling their eyes when she made allegations against their dead brother. Arias's mother was in court today as she has been throughout the lengthy trial along with her father who was sitting in for the first time. Jodi's brother Joseph was also seen but appeared to have left the room during his sister's testimony. Friends of murder victim Travis Alexander have spoken of their anguish following Arias' testimony last week. Strain: Jodi Arias' mother appeared in court today with her father - he sat in for the first time (right) Support: Jodi Arias's mother leans on her younger brother Joseph as they appear her murder trial in Arizona today . A close friend of the late Mr Alexander, Taylor Searle, told RadarOnline: . 'She is scary because you know she is lying about something, but you . almost think she believes her own lies because she is selling it so . effectively.' Ms Searle added: 'He . always told me she was a nymphomaniac and super sex-crazed, so I am . assuming what ever happened it wasn’t all him – but that is assuming . what she says actually happened!' Arias and her defense team have sought to paint Alexander as a manipulative and controlling sexual deviant. Arias admits she killed Alexander, whom she had dated for about five months in 2007, at his Mesa home in June 2008. The prosecution claims she carried out a pre-planned attack as she was jealous of his relationships with other women. Happier times: Arias is accused of stabbing and shooting Travis Alexander in his Mesa home in 2008 . She initially claimed she had nothing to do with the attack, before changing her story to say she watched two people kill Alexander before finally settling on self defense. She told the court last week how she was abused by her parents as a child, and how Alexander failed to acknowledge their relationship or touch her in public. She claimed that behind closed doors it was the opposite; despite his position as a Mormon elder who baptized her, he forced her into unwanted anal sex, claiming that vaginal sex was 'not allowed'. After the incident and other earlier . unwanted sexual encounters, she felt 'kind of stupid', 'bummed out' and . 'like a prostitute, sort of'. If she is convicted, she faces the death penalty.","Arias, 32, has admitted stabbing Travis Alexander 27 times and shooting him in the head but claims it was in self-defense .

The trial of a boy who killed his high school girlfriend rages on as prosecutors allege that he brutally strangled and slit the neck of his girlfriend because he was humiliated by their break up. Nathan Fujita, who is now 20 years old, is on trial for the murder of Lauren Astley in July of 2011, just weeks after she graduated Wayland High School in Woburn, Massachusetts. His defense attorney is arguing that he suffered a psychotic break but the assistant district attorney argues that he planned the attack and took a number of steps to purposefully try to cover up the murder. 'Evidence will show you that the man you just heard sworn before you, Nathaniel Fujita, a man Lauren Astley had known and cared for, a man she had gone out with in high school for three years, coldly, cruelly killed her, because she wounded his ego,' assistant district attorney Lisa McGovern said. Fatal: Nathanial Fujita (right) killed his girlfriend Lauren Astley (left) just months after they ended their three-year relationship . 'This defendant attacked Lauren to get her back to hurt her, and to nullify her in a purposeful and deliberate way, calculated not only to inflict pain but to end her life and also to cover up what he was doing,’ Ms McGovern said according to The Boston Globe. The teenage relationship ended a few weeks before Lauren's badly beaten body was found in marshland, with a gaping hole in her neck, in July 2011. Authorities claim the former high school football player was despondent over the couple’s April breakup, saying Fujita’s mother secretly met with Astley out of concern for her son’s well-being. 'She decided she should reach out to him and make sure he was doing OK,' Ms McGovern said. 'The defendant reciprocated that act of friendship by killing her.' Fujita, who was then 18, is accused of strangling Miss Astley so forcefully that her eyes, neck, face and gums hemorrhaged. Hiding evidence: The prosecutor said Nathanial had a Google search asking 'does water erase fingerprints' Prosecutors believe Fujita - who is the son of a Berklee College of Music professor - cut his ex-girlfriend's throat, strangled her with a bungee cord and dumped her body in a swamp. 'Her death came in minutes, not in seconds,' Ms McGovern said in court. Victim: Phone records show that 18-year-old Lauren talked to Nathanial several times before going to meet him after she finished work at the local mall . One of the biggest points of argument is whether or not the murder was premeditated; the prosecution argues that he actively planned the killing and tried to cover it up afterwards, while the defense argues that he snapped. Prosecutors believe Fujita took Astley’s Jeep Grand Cherokee from his home and drove it to the Wayland Town Beach parking lot, then dumped the keys in a storm drain. Phone records show that as she finished up her shift at a local store on the final day of her life, Fujita and Lauren had a number of conversations and she told co-workers that she was going to meet him after she left the mall. Her parents reported her missing shortly after she failed to return home from work that day. Fujita was arrested after a search of his family's home found blood in the garage and his clothing - which was stained with blood - stashed in the attic. Fujita was spotted driving shirtless, car windows down and music blaring, mere moments after allegedly dumping the 18-year-old's body, according to the filings. The papers allege Fujita drove from the marsh to his parents’ home the night of July 3, then called and asked them to come home so the family could watch a film together. Two sides: Prosecutor Lisa McGovern (left) argues that he planned the murder and tried to hide it, while defense attorney William Sullivan (right) says it was a mental episode . Evidence: Fujita, seen at the first day of the trial on Wednesday, looks at a picture of his girlfriend's car . Prosecutors believe Fujita, killed his . college-bound ex-girlfriend at his parents’ house. He allegedly loaded . her 5-foot, 100-pound body into his Honda. Prosecutors allege Fujita made an . elaborate but failed attempt to cover up; police found bloody clothing . and sneakers in the Fujita home, in addition to a second pair of wet . sneakers and a sweatshirt with mud in the pockets. His internet records show that at 12.58am on the evening of the murder, he did a search on Google asking: 'Does water erase fingerprints?' The woman who found Astley’s body . testified in court on Wednesday, saying that at first she was hesitant . to go over to the lake where she thought she spotted a pair of knees. Priscilla Antion, who discovered the . body while out on a bird-watching bike ride, but rather than spotting . the blue heron that she had hoped for, she saw what looked like a . disposed body. ‘I almost talked myself out of it. I said, I’m gonna leave, this isn’t real,’ she said in court. Murder trial: Nathanial Fujita and his ex girlfriend Lauren Astley both went to the same high school . Suspect: Prosecutors believe Fujita cut his ex-girlfriend's throat, strangled her with a bungee cord and dumped her body in a swamp . Distraught: Lauren's father Malcolm Astley (left) and Nathaniel's parents Tomo and Beth Fujita . ‘And then I thought somewhere, if this . is real, there’s somebody who is waiting for someone to call or someone . to walk through that door, and their loved one’s not there. I had to . make sure.’ Fujita’s lawyer William Sullivan is . planning to approach the case by saying that his client had a mental . episode, which he deems possible given his family history of mental . illness and his prior recorded instances of depression. If convicted, he will be sentenced to . life in prison without the possibility of parole. If the jury argues . that he committed the murder but did not do so with criminal intent- . effectively agreeing with the mental instability argument- then he will . be committed indefinitely.",First day of murder trial as Nathanial Fujita killed his ex-girlfriend Lauren Astley in July 2011 .

Hillary Clinton's will rake in hefty paychecks from a well-paying talent agency after stepping down as Secretary of State. Mrs Clinton is now represented by the Harry Walker Agency which is known for getting famous politicians and newsmakers six-figure sums on the lecture circuit.

Next gig: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has signed up with a talent agency and will likely begin commanding six-figure fees on the lecture circuit . Her decision to attach her name to his . particular New York-based agency comes as little surprise since her . husband former President Bill Clinton has long been represented by the . group since he left office in 2000.

With any and all positions that she . decides to take, she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look . appropriate for a presidential candidate. That said, another concern is shoring . up a steady income, because it doesn't come cheap to live like the . Clintons and six-figure speaking fees will certainly help.

Jodi Arias read a number of sexual texts that she and her murdered ex Travis Alexander exchanged in the months before she killed him. It came one day after the Phoenix, Arizona court heard a half-hour recording of the suspect having phone sex with Alexander. Arias, 32, has admitted stabbing her on-off boyfriend 27 times before slitting his throat and shooting him in the head at his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008. She claims that she did so in self-defense. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT Scroll down for video . Cowed: Jodi Airas appeared in court on Wednesday following her phone sex tape revelations . Focused: Arias studies some information before the trial began today in Phoenix, Arizona . Defense attorneys moved to have proceedings declared a mistrial or remove the death penalty this morning in Phoenix because of 'prosecutorial misconduct' by Juan Martinez. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said that Martinez was getting texts from possible witnesses and friends of Alexander's who were watching the trial at home and then texting Martinez about contradictions in Arias's story.  Though Martinez did not deny that he is receiving help from potential witnesses, the judge denied the request to throw out the case. Arias then took the stand and resumed where she had left off in the trial on Tuesday by explaining that in April 2008, she moved away from Mesa and back in with her grandparents, thousands of miles from Alexander in Yreka, California. She describes arguing with Travis before she moved away, that he gave her two middle fingers and she drove away crying. She told the court that she soon found out Alexander was seeing other girls at the same time as her. Arias claims that her time in Mesa she felt suicidal and Alexander had so badly damaged her confidence that she would 'shake like a Chihuahua'. Grueling: Samantha and Tanisha Alexander were in court once again today and physically showed the strain of the picture the defense had painted of their brother . Dressed in a black striped shirt, Arias told the court that the couple would fight via phone and text message. Alexander threatened to tell Arias's family about all the 'psycho things that she done' which made her feel like he 'could reach through the phone and grab her'. Arias responded by telling Alexander that she would tell 'the fact you're a pedophile with a past'. Despite the fights, Arias said that she wished to remain friends with Alexander - and that their phone conversations would turn sexual. She said: 'I liked it...he was very nice to me, it wasn't about the sex. They [the conversations] were explicit but still nice. I craved the nice from him.' The defense returned to the sexual side of Arias and Alexander's relationship, focusing on text messages where he reiterated a fantasy where he wanted to zip-tie his ex-girlfriend to a tree dressed as Little Red Riding Hood and shoot amateur porn shots. Arias read a . number of explicit text messages that Alexander sent her when they . carried out their secret sexual relationship. Sexual encounters: The couple can be heard having graphic phone sex in the recording that Arias made . 'You are the ultimate slut in bed,' he wrote in one instance. 'You will feel like you are being raped and enjoy every minute of it. 'You'll rejoice in being a whore, have animalistic sex with me and pleasing me in any way I desire.' The couple's sexual history has played a pivotal role in the trial, and on Tuesday a 30-mintue recording of a phone sex conversation was played publicly. 'Confused': Arias could not offer an explanation as too why Alexander wanted her to wear boy's Spiderman underwear while they had sex (stock picture) On . the recording from May 2008, Arias can be heard breathing deeply, . moaning and discussing how she loves that Alexander is 'hairless and . smooth all over'. The . couple discuss previous times they had sex and graphic activities where . they would experiment with Pop Rocks and Tootsie Rolls. The pair also encourage each . other to pleasure themselves, discuss oral sex and talk about having sex in bubble baths. During the 30-minute conversation, . On the tape, Alexander says that Arias introduced him to lubricants and talks about her bikini waxes. At one point, Alexander said that he wanted to 'zip tie her to a tree' before performing anal sex and videotaping the experience. She told the court that she thought . he was referencing an explicit scene in the film Me, Myself and Irene, . and that even though she found the idea to be degrading, she did not . want Alexander to think that she was criticizing his sexual fantasies. She responds: 'It is so debasing... I like it.' Arias . later told the court that he wanted her to dress up like Little Red . Riding Hood while she was tied to the tree, and she connected that to . his sexual attraction to young boys and girls which she revealed in . court on Monday. On the tape, Arias calls Alexander . 'superhuman' and compliments his stamina and genitals. Her lawyer later . asked her why she made the comments and she said that it was because . 'Travis thrived on compliments'. Shame: Jodi Arias lowered her head as she took the stand on Tuesday while the court were played a cellphone conversation of her and Travis Alexander having phone sex . Cringing: Arias covered up her face as her family and the relatives of Travis Alexander listened to the phone call which lasted more than 30 minutes . She went on to say that she faked an . orgasm during the phone conversation- again, a move she said was . intended to please him and keep him from switching into 'Mr Hyde'. Throughout the trial, she claimed that he was temperamental and had . extreme mood swings. She also talked at length about how she . had to buy KY lubricant so that they could use it during 'all kinds of . sex except oral' since he ran out of the previous brand that he used. She said she was unhappy with his decision to use Vaseline when they ran . out and that he refused to buy more 'because he refused to be seen in . public using personal lubricant'. Travis . Alexander's sisters and brother, who have regularly appeared in court, . grimaced but remained expressionless as the lengthy recording played. The . explosive developments on Tuesday came after Arias told the court the . day before that months before she stabbed him to death, she caught her . boyfriend Travis Alexander pleasuring himself while looking at pictures . of young boys. That . admission came nearly a year after he had given her a packet of boy’s . Spiderman underwear for Valentine's Day, saying that he found it 'hot' when she wore them during anal sex. Happier times: Arias is accused of stabbing and shooting Travis Alexander in his Mesa home in 2008 . Harrowing: The siblings of Travis Alexander listen in court as they hear their late brother's voice on tape . Disbelief: Travis' sisters and his friend looked incredulous as Arias told the court about his alleged 'deviant' interests . ‘He preferred sex with women, it made him feel normal, more normal,’ she told the court. ‘It's hard to describe this. It’s very . embarrassing. He seemed very ashamed with himself and he didn’t want to . be that way it was something he struggled with. It’s not who he wanted . to be its not who he wanted to be in the future... when he had sex with . women he felt more normal and it was preferable to his other deviant . urges, I guess you could say.’ Since Arias has claimed that she . killed the then-30-year-old man in self defense, the attorney is likely . using her time on the stand to paint a picture of a battered woman who . felt compelled to return to a complex relationship. The prosecution claims she carried out a pre-planned attack as she was jealous of his relationships with other women. If she is convicted, she faces the death penalty. She initially claimed she had nothing to . do with the attack, before changing her story to say she watched two . people kill Alexander before finally settling on self defense. Change in demeanor: Arias folded her arms and appeared visibly upset as the jurors entered on Tuesday as she awaits her phone sex tape being played (left) and wept while looking at pictures on Monday (right) Strain: Jodi Arias' mother and father have been in court throughout the trial . Throughout the trial, Arias has . differentiated between vaginal and anal sex, because she believed that . vaginal sex went against her Mormon vow of chastity before marriage, . while anal and oral sex qualified as a ‘grey area.’ Arias also told the packed court room . that Alexander had a violent temper. On Monday she specified that he had . been physically violent with her on at least four different occasions, . either grabbing her wrists or slamming her onto the bed during an . argument. The most extreme of those cases ended . with her on the floor as he allegedly kicked her in the ribs and hurt . her finger. She said that rather than seek medical treatment for the . finger, which she believes was broken, they made a makeshift splint. In . court, she held up her hand to show how it is bent even today.

Southern Methodist University has temporarily suspended the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house after reports that a male student was 'held against his will' in a possible hazing incident on Saturday night. The case is listed by SMU police as aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, personal hazing offense and unlawful restraint. These allegations come just months after . a member of the same house was arrested for allegedly forcing . another student to perform oral sex on him. 'Virtue is the moral essence of the Fraternity': The homepage of the troubled Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house which has been suspended by SMU amid reports of another suspected hazing incident . SMU released a statement that campus . police are 'vigorously investigating this case' but that as the case is still an active . investigation, 'no other information is available at this time.' The Dallas Observer reported . on a tweet by SMU student that read 'Woo hoo SMU frat party, wazzzzam.' It isn't yet known whether this party was at Sigma Phi Epsilon. In November an SMU sophomore was . indicted for allegedly forcing a classmate to perform sexual acts on him . in September, according to court records. Serious charges: John David Mahaffey, 19, was indicted for allegedly forcing a fellow SMU student to perform oral sex on him twice in September . John David 'J.D.' Mahaffey, 19, is . facing sexual assault charges stemming from two incidents in which the . Southern Methodist University student allegedly attacked another young . man. His trial is pending in Dallas County. On September 23, Mahaffey allegedly . forced the other student to perform oral sex on him first in a campus . parking garage, and then outside the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at . 3050 SMU Boulevard, where Mahaffey is a member. According to an affidavit made public in September, the alleged victim told Mahaffey 'no' and 'stop' several times, but feared that the 19-year-old would get violent. The document states that after the acts, Mahaffey, a fourth-generation SMU finance sophomore, told the young man, 'You better not tell a soul,' according to the Dallas Morning Star. The following day, the alleged victim met with SMU police and agreed to record a phone conversation with his assailant. During the call, the SMU student told Mahaffey, 'You know I did not want to do that?' to which the 19-year-old reportedly responded, 'I know you didn't, but we have to say it was consensual or lawyers, parent and the school will get involved.' Impressive resume: Mahaffey, right, pictured here with President George W. Bush, left, was a Hunt scholar and student senator . Legacy: Mahaffey is a fourth-generation SMU student whose great-great grandfather was among the college's founders and its first professors . Mahaffey was arrested on September 25 and charged with second-degree felony sexual assault. He was released from jail after posting a $25,000 bond. In the aftermath of the incident, Mahaffey was suspended from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and temporarily banned from SMU campus pending an investigation. Mahaffey had a prominent status on campus, NBC DFW reported. The Springfield, Missouri, native was a Hunt scholar, a student senator, a scholarship committee chairman and an officer on SMU's inter-fraternity council, according to the university website. Abuse: An affidavit released in September revealed that Mahaffey allegedly forced a male student to perform sexual acts and then tried to cover it up . According to a 2011 article in SMU's student newspaper, the Daily Campus, his great-great grandfather was a co-founder of the school and one of its first professors. Mahaffey is a second SMU student to be arrested and indicted on sexual assault charges this fall. Precedent: In September, Donald Cuba, 20, was indicted on sexual assault charges for allegedly raping a female SMU student in February . In September, Donald Cuba, a 20-year-old junior, was indicted on sexual assault charges related to the February 10, 2012, on-campus rape of a female SMU student. Cuba is set to go on trial March 25, 2013. Cuba's was the first case where a grand jury has charged a SMU student for sexually assaulting another student, reported the Fort Worth Weekly. The university has traditionally relied on a system of secret hearings for students suspected of sexual assault. Over the past 25 years, more than 100 SMU students have reported being sexually assaulted. Yet in only one case - the three men who raped Monika Korra in 2009 - were the suspects successfully prosecuted and they were not SMU students. SMU officials say the system - where all records are kept secret - works well. 'The university is confident in the integrity of its process and its procedures,' said SMU spokesperson Kent Best. Serious questions have been raised in the past about the fairness of the university’s approach. In 1990, a secret panel found an SMU student guilty of sexually assaulting another SMU student only to have a second panel overrule that decision in 1991, a decision upheld by then-President A. Kenneth Pye.","Southern Methodist University fraternity house temporarily shut down after reports of student assault in another suspected hazing incident .

Senate Republicans blocked the confirmation of former Senator Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense, making it the first time that such a nominee has been temporarily barred from their intended post. Though Hagel was approved on Tuesday as a suitable nominee by the Senate Armed Services Committee, GOP Senators voted against his nomination. In order to be approved as Secretary of Defense- to take over from outgoing Secretary Leon Panetta- he needed to get 60 votes in the Democrat-heavy caucus. He only garnered 58, with 40 votes against. Conservatives cite their longstanding objections to their former colleague's policy views on Israel and Iran in their debates, but really they blame the Obama administration's reticence to reveal more information about the attacks on the American consulate in Libya in which four were killed, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Weary: Though he is a Republican, Chuck Hagel took a beating in Senate Armed Services Committee hearings for his views that the U.S. should engage in direct talks with Iran and Israel . 'There are still questions outstanding,' Senator John McCain said on the floor Thursday. McCain was one of the Republicans, along with Senator Lindsey Graham, who led the charge against Hagel's approval. Hagel, a former two term Republican Senator, was nominated by President Obama on January 7 to replace Panetta. Though once a member of their ranks, Republicans in the Senate have fiercely criticized the Nebraska native for his views that the U.S. should engage in direct talks with Iran and Hamas. Now his vote is being held up using the organizational wrangling of a filibuster, though the changes will not hold. In a purely logistical move, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid voted against Hagel so that he is able to bring  up the vote on his confirmation at a later date. Happy with the result: Republican Senators John McCain and Kelly Ayotte did not want Hagel to be approved and they were some of the most critical questioners during his confirmation hearing . Nay: Senate Republicans Lindsey Graham (S.C.), left, and Jim Inhofe (Okla.), right, have threatened to delay the full Senate confirmation vote on Hagel, scheduled for Friday . 'Chuck Hagel had nothing to do with . the attack on Bengahzi. There are serious consequences to this delay,' Reid said in response on Thursday. With the vote where it was, Hagel . would have been passed a majority measure, but he needed 60 votes in . order to comply with the regulations. When his appointment is brought up . again- which will likely take place next week- he will only need a . majority in order to be approved. He was also forced to apologize for . his statement in a 2006 interview in which he said, 'The Jewish lobby . intimidates a lot of people up here…. I’m not an Israeli senator. I’m a . United States senator.' Additionally, . Republicans have expressed deep concerns about Hagel's earnings once he . retired from the Senate in 2008 and moved into the private sector. They . have asked for details of his compensation as a consultant and his time . on the lecture circuit, to prove that he didn't take money from . countries hostile to America. Tough crowd: The Senate confirmation hearing to review Obama's nomination of Chuck Hagel kicked off on Jan. 31 and was met with opposition from Republicans . The Senate Armed Services . Committee hearings on Hagel's nomination kicked off on January 31, . starting an ugly, partisan back and forth. Despite opposition from conservatives, the committee approved Hagel as their nominee on February 12. Now the decision goes to the Senate floor for a vote. Senator . Reid filed a motion on Wednesday to limit debate and force a vote by . the end of the week but Republicans are saying, 'Not so fast.' Though . Republicans are in the minority in the upper chamber, 45 to 55 . Democratic members, they are aggressively working to form a 60-vote . margin that would filibuster the vote. Though this maneuver is a filibuster by definition, Republicans are avoiding the label. 'We're going to require a 60-vote threshold,' Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, the ranking . member of the Armed Services Committee, told Foreign Policy blog, The Cable. 'It's not a filibuster. I don't want to use that word,' he said. Plotting ahead: Democratic Senate Majority leader Harry Reid voted against Hagel purely for logistics so that he is allowed to call another vote for the prospective nominee later on, which will likely take place next week . Inhofe also told the National Review this . week that he would work to foil Mr Obama's plans. 'It's going to be a long, long time before he hits the floor,' he said about trying to delay a Senate vote on Hagel. 'The . anti-Israel history of Chuck Hagel is real. We can’t have someone at . the Pentagon who has made these kind of statements,' Inhofe added. Several others in the party are also said to have joined Inhofe's cause. Republican Senator Graham from South Carolina- who is also a member of the Senate Armed Services . Committee- said earlier this month that Mr Obama should reconsider . Hagel's nomination. Graham is among the Republicans who voted against ending . debate on Hagel's nomination. He . has joined with fellow committee members McCain and . Senator Kelly Ayotte to call on Mr Obama to clarify his administration's precise actions in the hours leading up to the September 11 attack on . the U.S. Mission in Benghazi. Outta here: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, on Feb. 13, left the CIA to head up the DOD in July 2011 . 'The debate on Chuck Hagel is not over,' Graham said. 'It . has not been serious. We don't have the information we need. And I'm . going to fight the idea of jamming somebody through until we get answers . about what the president did personally when it came to the Benghazi . debacle.' This . week McCain slammed Hagel for his 'disappointing' performance answering questions, adding 'his . often adversarial attitude toward legitimate questions from Committee . members was troubling.' Committee . chair Democratic Senator Carl Levin has expressed his confidence in the . Obama administration's desire to be forthcoming on the Benghazi attack. Other . Democrats have praised Hagel for his military service during the . Vietnam War, for which he earned two purple hearts, and his Congressional career.","Senator Chuck Hagel was nominated by President Obama to take over as Secretary of Defense after Leon Panetta steps down .

"By . Alex Gore . PUBLISHED: . 08:53 EST, 2 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:58 EST, 11 January 2013 . Lothario: Former Greater Manchester Police chief Michael Todd had a string of affairs . Police officials are examining new claims of financial malpractice against a senior officer exposed as a love cheat who also made sexually explicit videos of his mistresses. Greater Manchester's new Police Commissioner has appealed for information about Michael Todd, former chief constable of the force, who had 'liasions' with 38 women in six years. The claims centre on Todd's role in drawing up unique contracts that allowed some staff to get enormous payoffs when they left the force. Married father-of-three Todd, 50, was found dead in mysterious circumstances on Mount Snowdon in 2008 after taking a cocktail of drink and sleeping tablets. An inquest ruled that he did not commit suicide but died of exposure while his mind was in turmoil. An inquiry questioned his 'judgment and integrity' and revealed he was linked to at least five women in the force - but said his private life did not affect his duties. It also cleared him of any misdemeanour in promotion of staff, and of inappropriate behaviour regarding expenses, hospitality, accommodation. But now Tony Lloyd, a former Labour Foreign Office minister who has just been elected Police Commissioner for the force, is to be handed a report into allegations of possible financial malpractice, including 'golden goodbye' redundancy packages of up to £300,000. According to The Sunday Telegraph, the West Midlands Inquiry into Todd failed to make crucial evidence public. The report contained details of Todd's computer, which contained sexually . explicit videos of his lovers, some of who were Greater Manchester police staff. A separate inquiry is now examining claims that the late police chief helped several employees - with whom he was romantically linked - to gain promotions or pay offs. These payoffs were then hidden in the force's accounts, The Sunday Telegraph reports. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing against those who received the payments. Supt Alan Greene, head of the Great . Manchester branch of the Superintendents' Association, told the newspaper: 'These concerns were dismissed. 'Spending such monies, way in . excess of any normal redundancy certainly needs to be scrutinised and . its right that the police authority is doing so.' At the time of his death Todd - who was married to wife Carolyn - believed that his three-year affair with Angie Robinson, the head of Manchester Chamber of Commerce, was about to be exposed. Love rat: Todd had been cheating on his wife Carolyn, right, with Angie Robinson, left, for three years . As well as impacting on his family, this would have revealed his failure to adhere to police vetting procedures requiring him to disclose changes in his circumstances to prevent blackmail. Commissioner Tony Lloyd, a former Labour . minister, is awaiting a report on the allegations, and said: 'If . police officers or anyone else have evidence of criminal offences I . would urge them to come forward.' Greater Manchester Police has so far failed to return calls to MailOnline. Exposure: Todd died on Snowdon amid fears his affair was going to be made public . The redundancy packages said to be under examination include those given to Cathy Butterworth, 53, and Christine Brereton - although there is no suggestion of wrongdoing or that either were ever romantically involved with Todd. Ms Butterworth, who went from being a clerk at Rochdale police station to director of development earning £87,000 a year under Todd's leadership, apparently received a £117,000 pay off. The Sunday Telegraph quoted sources who claimed the total package was worth around £300,000. Ms Brereton, who was head of human resources and earned a £87,000 salary, received a £105,000 deal. Both packages were described as 'termination payments' and are much larger than the 'redundancy payments' given to others. These include the force's IT director, who earned £85,00 annually but got a pay out of £40,030, and the director of diversity, who was on £74,000-a-year but received £10,210.","New claims of malpractice against Manchester Police chief Michael Todd .

Guatemala's immigration authorities had been holding McAfee since he was arrested last Wednesday for illegally entering the country with his 20-year-old Belizean girlfriend. The eccentric tech pioneer, who made his fortune from the anti-virus software bearing his name, has been chronicling life on the run in a blog, www.whoismcafee.com. He said he had no immediate plans after reaching Florida. 'I'm just going to hang in Miami for a while. I like Miami,' he told Reuters by telephone just before his plane left.

Residents of the Belizean island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived for about four years, said McAfee and Faull, 52, had quarreled at times, including over McAfee's unruly dogs. McAfee says Belize authorities will kill him if he turns himself in for questioning. He has said he was being persecuted by Belize's ruling party for refusing to pay some $2 million in bribes. Belize's prime minister has rejected the allegations, calling McAfee paranoid and 'bonkers.' Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said the country still wanted to question McAfee about the Faull case. 'He will be just under the goodwill of the United States of America. He is still a person of interest, but a U.S. national has been killed and he has been somewhat implicated in that murder. People want him to answer some questions,"" he said. Martinez noted that Belize's extradition treaty with the United States extended only to suspected criminals, a designation that did not currently apply to McAfee. 'Right now, we don't have enough information to change his status from person of interest to suspect,' he said. Tearful goodbye: McAfee left Guatemala on Wednesday, and left an emotional Vanegas behind .

True love: Collette Boyd suffered TWO strokes by the age of 30, but says her ordeal helped her meet her husband Pete . A woman who suffered two strokes before the age of 30 - defying odds of a billion to one - has finally found love thanks to her illness. Colette Boyd had suffered the first at 28 and doctors had said the chances of her suffering a repeat stroke were about a billion to one - but she was hit again. Being unable to work because of the effects of the strokes, Colette's confidence was at rock bottom. She was a sociable 28-year-old working for a travel firm in Glasgow and travelling all over the world when her own world was turned upside down. Missing the buzz of the office, she logged on to an internet chatroom and began a conversation with a man over their shared love of football and rock music. They arranged to meet for a cinema date and just 10 months later Colette and Pete got engaged and the pair are now husband and wife. Colette, now 37, says she is finally returning to her old self, thanks to Pete, 46. She said: 'He is all my good luck rolled into one.' 'I was having breakfast with my friends and my arm felt a bit strange, but I thought I had just slept on it in a funny way. 'I remember I couldn't open the butter sachet, but I didn't think much of it. 'But when I went to work, a couple of people asked if I had done something to my arm. 'After lunch I had dribbled down the side of my mouth. So I did what every sensible girl does - I called my mum. She told me to go straight to the doctor. Colette was immediately sent to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow and only discovered what had happened when she looked up and saw a sign for 'stroke' on the hospital unit. The then 28-year-old had suffered a haemorrhagic stroke, which results from a weakened vessel that ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain. It accounts for about 13 per cent of stroke cases. She said: 'When you are 28 you don't think it is going to happen. They said the chances of it happening again were a billion to one.' However, almost exactly a year later, . she suffered a second stroke. It was caused by scar tissue coming off . the original tear that cause the first stroke. Almost exactly a year after her first stroke, Colette suffered a second attack . She said: 'The second stroke affected my voice, although only people who knew me before would notice. I believe it is the tone that has changed. 'I no longer sing in the church group I was once part of and sometimes when I say something meant as a joke the tone doesn't change and what I said can be taken the wrong way. 'I have a general weakness down my left side and walk with a slight limp. I also can't really use my left arm at all now.' It was after suffering the second stroke, Colette turned to an internet chatroom for company and struck up her friendship with Pete, which eventually blossomed into love. The couple are now happily married, living in Rutherglen, near Glasgow, and hoping for a family. Colette said: 'Pete wasn't fazed by my condition. He does so much for me, helping me cook and dress. 'When we got engaged I wanted to share my exciting news and show off my ring but I had to use my right hand to lift up my left hand to show the ring, which kind of spoiled the moment. 'Before I had the strokes I was a completely different person. Thanks to Pete I'm now finally getting back to that.' Colette's new-found confidence will be tested next month when she takes part in a terrifying charity challenge. She has bravely agreed to take part in the Stroke Association's Big Swing event on March 23, which will see participants 'swing' off the 150ft Titan Crane, Clydebank, and out over the River Clyde. Colette aims to raise hundreds of pounds for the charity. For more information: www.stroke.org.uk .","Colette Boyd, from Glasgow, suffered her first stroke aged just 28 .

With Wintour, the couple helped bring in millions of dollars for President Obama's re-election war chest last year. But despite raising money for Mr Obama it was revealed that Mr Bryan has owed money to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since 2006, according to court filings obtained by The Daily Telegraph. He was in the process of paying back $1.6million in property taxes due in Harris County, Texas, and has since paid . back about $400,000, according to the report. In 2010 Mr Bryan was also pursued for about $20,000 in overdue property taxes, records show.

Mr Bryan had $30million after divorcing his second . wife Katherine in 1999 to pursue a relationship with Ms Wintour. But he lost a great deal of his fortune during the recession. Mr Bryan told the Telegraph: 'I've paid Harris County so much money in so many taxes, and that's the only time it went awry. 'I mean it was my fault, you know people in the office weren't doing their job - but it was kind of an exceptional situation.' He claimed he was 'on schedule' with his payments to the IRS and hadn't paid the full bill immediately, because he 'didn't have the cash'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:03 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:48 EST, 6 February 2013 . A federal prison guard allegedly had an affair with an inmate convicted in one of New York's most notorious police killings and became pregnant with his child in an attempt to save him from the death penalty. Nancy Gonzalez, 29, was arrested Tuesday on charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, according to court papers. Wilson was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry. Illegal liaison: Federal prison guard Nancy Gonzalez, left, was arrested after police say she had an illicit affair with convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson, right, and became pregnant with his baby to save him from execution . Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope' ‘I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ Gonzalez said, according to court papers. Wilson was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals court. A new jury must decide his fate. But replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty because he is mentally disabled. On Tuesday, Gonzales, who is eight months pregnant, was taken into custody at her Long Island home, New York Daily News reported. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted. According to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants. According to one inmate, he witnessed the 29-year-old female guard moving away from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down. Victims: Detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right, were gunned down by Wilson during a drug bust gone awry in Staten Island in 2003 . Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer . The complaint made public Tuesday and cited by CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen. The corrections officer came clean about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving time in a state prison. Gonzalez allegedly said she 'kind of got sucked into his world' and 'why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope. 'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy?' It remains unknown what effect the uncovered plot will have on Wilson's mental retardation claim. He still faces life in prison or death by lethal injection. 'If this was done by design, it's not the actions of a person who is mentally retarded,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association. 'It's a devious plot to avoid the death penalty.' Insanity claim: Wilson's defense attorney argued that he cannot be executed because he is mentally handicapped . Wilson was found guilty in December 2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island. The following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954. However, an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to be a villain. Raymond Patterson, a noted psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the prosecution, told the New York Post that while Wilson suffers from anti-social personality disorder, he is not mentally handicapped.","Ronell Wilson convicted in 2007 of shooting dead detectives James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews in 2003 .

That little boy, Austin Leclaire, 13, is stricken with an illness that, in time, will choke his breath and stop his heart - and for which there is no marketable cure. Now compound Austin's heartbreak, as he must watch as his brother, Max, who has the same rare form of muscular dystrophy, grows stronger each day from a clinical trial for which the maker of the drug says he is ineligible. Two brothers, one illness: Vermont boys Austin and Max Leclaire are both stricken with a rare, congenital form of muscular dystrophy . Every day, as Austin's life slowly slips away, Max's life slowly returns. 'My brother says he's doing (the clinical trial) for me, that he's trying really hard,' Austin courageously told ABCNews.com in a recent interview. 'That's why he wanted to do it.' As for Sarepta Therapeutics, and official with the company told ABCNews.com that getting Austin treatment represents a maze of regulatory and financial obstacles. Austin was reportedly initially barred from the trial because he can no longer walk. 'This remains a priority for us,' Dr. Edward M. Kaye, Sarepta's chief medical officer, reportedly wrote. But, Kaye added, 'This is a challenging request since it involves complex regulatory, political, manufacturing, and fiscal issues."" 'This remains a priority for us. This is a challenging request since it involves complex . regulatory, political, manufacturing, and fiscal issues."" The Leclaire brothers were both born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which reportedly affects one in 3,500 male births. About 20,000 children in the U.S. and 300,000 worldwide develop the illness, ABCNews.com quoted Cure Duchenne as saying. The organization is one of three that have funded Sarepta's clinical trial. The disease strikes between the ages of 3 and 5, ABCNews.com wrote. Affected boys slowly lose the ability to walk. In time, they need a wheelchair and, like Austin, cannot even raise their arms high enough to place food in their mouth, according to the site. Later, patients' require tracheotomies and other forms of respiratory assistance. Eventually, the heart and lungs fail. Max was cleared for the clinical trial of an experimental drug, while his older brother, Austin, was deemed ineligible because he could no longer walk . 'This can happen in any family,' said Jenn Mcnary, the boys 32-year-old stepmother, reportedly said, adding of her efforts to implore Sarepta to grant Austin the same wonder drug that has helped Max, 'I have been getting very vague answers. I keep getting the same answer. They tell me to be patient.' Doctors diagnosed Austin with Duchenne muscular dystrophy at 3 years old, when Max was already 3 months old, according to ABCNews.com. While Max has slowly improved through participation in the clinical trial, Austin, pictured in his wheelchair, is slowly wasting away. However, for the last year, Max has received the drug, eteplirsen, whereas Austin has not. Max's condition has slowly improved. He can now climb a hill in the family's Saxtons River, Vt. backyard. Austin, meanwhile, can no longer feed himself. 'I am clearly happy for Max because he is doing so well and exceeding our expectations,' Jenn Mcnary reportedly said. 'But it's taking much longer than we ever thought for the drug company to at least grant access to his brother [Austin] who is sitting home watching his brother get treatment.' A genetic mutation is responsible for the terminal - and congenital - illness, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, which strikes 1-in-3,500 males . Once researchers realized that the drug's efficacy, they put all 12 of the study's subjects on the treatment. Some had previously been given a placebo. The children on the highest dose of the drug have made great strides, Mcnary told ABCNews.com. Meanwhile, Sarepta Therapeutics, for its part, reportedly wrote in a statement, it '... understands the urgent need of boys with DMD and their families,' but cannot publicly speak about patients in its clinical trials. 'We have aligned with the DMD community in the fight against this disease for many years...,' the statement reportedly said. 'Our priority is to gather and analyze the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase IIb study, which will form the basis of discussions with the FDA to determine the most appropriate path for eteplirsen.' Austin can no longer lift a glass of milk, or drag his weary body from bed to wheelchair. Mcnary and her husband, Craig, who runs a Roto-Rooter franchise, have been talking to whomever will listen, ABCNews.com wrote. For the past six months, they have been emailing Sarepta's executives on Austin's behalf. 'I am like a broken record,' Mcnary told the website. 'I congratulate the drug company who are now public and doing well. Their stocks are going up. We are not just looking out for Austin. 'We have a lot of friends in the (muscular dystrophy) community. People are losing their upper body strength just waiting for this. This is urgent right now.' Deadly disease: DMD patients slowly lose the ability to walk, as well as upper body strength.

Adrift on the high seas without food or water for a month, the bodies of scores of starved asylum seekers who had been trying to reach Australia were thrown overboard from a ‘ship from hell'. Their starving and dehydrated companions, almost too weak to lift the dead from the disabled vessel as it drifted in the Indian Ocean, were rescued by the Sri Lanka navy – but several were today struggling for life after being brought ashore. Only 32 of the original 130 Burmese on board were alive when naval ships reached them, many of the emaciated passengers too weak to stand. Emaciated: Starving and dehydrated passengers have been rescued from the ship which drifted in the Indian Ocean . Describing the vessel as a ‘ship from hell’, a Sri Lankan government spokesman said the group had set out from Burma two months ago to sail to Indonesia and then on to Australia, where they planned to ask for asylum. But a few days later the vessel broke down and began what for most of those on board was to prove to be a fatal drift with the ocean currents. They had set out with enough food and water to last for a month, but when no rescue came and their supplies ran out, the passengers began to collapse with hunger and dehydration as the days and weeks went by. When they began dying and the stifling conditions under the tropical sun made living with the dead intolerable, their fitter companions had no other choice but to throw the bodies overboard. The survivors told the Sri Lankan authorities, who found the boat drifting 380 miles off the country’s eastern coast, that they were Muslims from a border village lying between Burma and Bangladesh. ‘Their captain and 97 others have died due to deydration and starvation,’ said Sri Lankan police spokesman Mr Prishantha Jayakody. ‘They said they had thrown the dead bodies into the sea.’ Australia’s Immigration Minister, Brendan O’Connor, who has received a briefing from the Sri Lankan authorities, said the tragedy underlined the danger of getting on people smugglers’ boats and making the perilous journey to Australia. ‘It is the people smugglers who have lured people onto unseaworthy vessels,’ he told Fairfax Radio today. ‘It’s the people smugglers who peddle lies to these people, take their life savings, sometimes sadly take their lives. That’s where I target the blame.’ Mr O’Connor, who took the immigration role only earlier this month, added: ‘A lot of people are just disappearing, out of sight, out of mind. Boats disappearing – it’s very hard to put a number on it. Too many.’ Mr O’Connor said stopping boats carrying desperate asylum seekers could not be done quickly. Under the previous Liberal government of John Howard the number of boats heading to Australia was just a trickle because word had got out among people smugglers that the vessels would be turned away from Australian waters and those on board would be sent to other nations for processing. But under the Labour government, elected in November 2007 and headed today by British-born Prime Minister Julia Gillard, more than 33,000 people have arrived by boat on Australia’s outlying islands. Mr O’Connor said boat arrivals were a ‘constant pressure’ for successive governments. ‘This cannot be done overnight. It can only be done over time,’ he said.","Passengers trying to reach Australia had no food or water for a month .

Mystery surrounds the nicotine-addicted rock, which was put on show by collector Luo Yuanshui, from Longyan in southeast China's Fujian Province. Astonishingly, this Chinese rock can smoke a cigarette in under five minutes, according to its rock collector owner . Cigarettes, with variations for length and brand, take around six minutes to burn down naturally if left unsmoked. Mr Luo says his puffing pebble knocks an incredible minute off that time, somehow. One of the pictures shows a male and female staring at the rock in utter amazement. He said he found the 2.2kg rock in the mountains of Shangyou. Naturally, his first instinct was to find a hole and pop one of his cigarettes in to see if it would smoke it. He was amazed to discover it did.

Switzerland's last wild bear has been shot and killed after fears it posed a threat to humans. The brown bear, affectionately known as Mike, had started to follow people during the day looking for food and was seen regularly near a school, the Swiss Federal Environment Office said. Sightings, including the time he was hit by a train on the local Rhaetian Railway, meant Mike became a regular fixture in the Swiss tabloids and there was even a Twitter account set up in his name. Shot dead: Mike the brown bear was killed in the mountainous border region of Switzerland after several run-ins with locals . But Swiss federal authorities confirmed the bear had been shot by gamekeepers on Tuesday in Poschiavo Valley, in The Alps, near the Italian border. Problems began at the end of last year when Mike, whose official name was M13, broke into a home in Graubuenden. He was fitted with a radio collar and monitored daily. But recently the bear had begun to show little fear of humans again after waking up from hibernation. The Swiss environment office released a statement yesterday which read: 'The bear M13 had certainly never showed any aggression toward man, but the risk that an accident might happen and that people might be badly injured or killed had become intolerable. 'In order to give the bear population a chance to reestablish itself in Switzerland, circumstances sometimes arise when unfortunately an individual must be killed.' Danger: In recent days Mike had begun to show little fear of humans again after waking up from hibernation . However, M13 supporters have taken to social network sites, Facebook and Twitter, to express their grief and outrage at the shooting. Some believe the bear should have been relocated or placed in a zoo rather than shot. According to the Swiss Federal Environment Office, M13 was one of about 40 bears which originated in the Trentin area of Italy. It is believed it had wandered over the Italian border. But the Swiss-based World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) condemned the shooting, saying wardens should have instead intensified efforts to frighten the animal away from populated areas. The mountain region of Poschiavo Valley, in The Alps, near the Italian border, where the bear was shot dead . Several brown bears, including two called M12 and M14 who had been identified as Mike's brothers, have also been known to roam between Switzerland, Austria and Italy. M14 died last year when he was hit by a car. The Swiss authorities were keen to see the return of the bear, hunted to extinction along with wolves and lynxes in the Alps in the 19th century. In 2005 they to set aside land in the south-east of the country, in the hope it might offer a corridor for bears to spread from northern Italy. But farmers saw the return as a threat to their livestock. The Swiss capital, Bern, is named after a bear - although its medieval founder was inspired by the first animal he killed during a day out hunting.","The bear was shot by gamekeepers after it had shown little fear of humans .

But her calf will certainly not be suggesting that she needs to have her pearly whites looked at, or joking that she is long in the tooth, having had a close up view of the powerful gnashers. The enormous hippopotamus is considered to be one of the world's most dangerous mammals and after catching sight of these terrifying teeth, it is easy to understand why. Long in the tooth: A five-tonne hippo at Valencia Zoo in Spain shows she would certainly benefit from a trip to the dentist in this jaw-dropping photograph . Hungry hippos: The enormous mammal playfully pretends that she is about to bite her offspring before giving the young animal a gentle nudge with her nose . But in this stunning series of photographs, the mother shows that hippos also have a gentle side, as she playfully splashes around while her offspring . explores the world around them. Amateur British wildlife photographer Philip Cousins managed to take the shots of the hippos in conservation, at Valencia Zoo, Spain, while the beasts swam alongisde a glass wall, enabling the world to see the touching exchange. The patient hippo put up with the calf - which was only a few months old - nipping at her and climbing all over her back, just like a boisterous toddler. And although the mother teased the calf, opening her mouth wide as though she was going to bite him, she did nothing more than give him a gentle nudge with her nose. Powerful: Hippos are considered to be the world's most dangerous mammal and after seeing such terrifying teeth on display, it is easy to understand why . Philip, who now lives in the Spanish . city, said: 'The hippos are kept in a large enclosure, with a glass wall . at the zoo, and always seem very happy. 'It was the first time I had seen the calf there, but I believe he was about five or six months old. It was quite fascinating, the baby and mum were actually playing the whole time - something you don't expect hippos to do. 'The . calf was swimming all round mum and occasionally nipping at her or . standing on her back and mum would pretend she was going to bite the . baby which is why her mouth was open.

Gentle giant: The hippo might be the world's most dangerous mammal, but this mother shows she has a gentle side as she splashes around with he calf . The hippo is the third largest land mammal after the elephant and the rhinoceros and is native to Africa, where it stays cool during the day by remaining in mud or water before emerging in the evenings to graze on grass. They are under threat, however, from poachers because of their ivory teeth, and also through a loss of habitat. The animals can grow to be as heavy as nine tonnes but can still easily outrun humans. Hippos are also very aggressive and ill-tempered, particularly when it comes to defending their territory and their young. Such characteristics mean few predators - apart from humans - dare to target them.","The jaw-dropping moment was captured by an amateur British photographer on a trip to Valencia Zoo in Spain .

Pub regulars have celebrated saving their beloved local from being turned into a Tesco after a 16 month campaign. The retail giant planned a new Tesco Express store on the site of the Victoria and Albert pub in Seaton Delaval, Northumberland. But the scheme was rebuffed by planners and villagers, who waged a bitter battle against the grocery chain's plans to extend and convert the pub. The pub was the latest in a long list proposed to be converted into outlets for supermarket chains. Regulars including Stephen Keir (front) celebrate outside the Victoria and Albert pub in Seaton Delaval, North Tyneside, after successfully fighting off plans for supermarket giants Tesco to take over the pub . There have been with more than 200 conversions in Britain since 2010. Villagers accused Tesco of 'sheer arrogance' as they repeatedly applied for planning permission to convert the pub. But councillors and residents have refused to let the multi-million pound supermarket chain 'grind them down' and vowed to save their local pub. Councillors had been a shown letter from the pub's owners Punch Taverns, which backs the convenience store plans and said the pub would have shut anyway. The company said: 'Tenants have been unable to derive any sustainable profit due to the very low levels of trade and high outgoings. 'And for Punch the inevitable alternative may be to close and board the property.' But current manager Marshall Dunn rejected the claims, agreeing that when Tesco first looked to take over the Victoria and Albert it had been struggling, but in recent months business was booming. 'Before we took over, the pub was, as Tesco say, not a going concern,' he said. 'But trade has more than trebled in the last 16 to 17 months and it's now a real amenity for the village.' But at a boisterous meeting of the south east area planning committee of  Northumberland County Council on Tuesday night, councillors voiced their concerns that allowing the conversion would ultimately lead to a death on the road outside. The pub is situated on a notorious blind bend in the village, prompting safety fears. The retail giant planned a new Tesco Express store on the site but the scheme was rebuffed by planners and villagers, who waged a bitter battle against the grocery chain's plans to extend and convert the pub . Councillor Tom Brechany said that the idea of delivery lorries having to pull into and out of the proposed loading area outside the store was 'a recipe for disaster,'  while fellow councillor Wayne Daley said he and his members had a 'duty of care' to the people of Northumberland. 'I find it really offensive to see Tesco coming to us yet again in the hope it grinds us down,'  he said. 'It seems they hope we will get bored and let it through, but I'm not going to let that happen.' An application for a 108 square metre extension to the pub was rejected on the grounds of road safety. A separate application for two air conditioning units and a condenser was rejected on the grounds it could be an eyesore and create a noise nuisance for nearby homes. A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We are disappointed by the decision, especially as the applications had a positive recommendation from the council's own officers. 'We will now consider our options and decide on the way forward.' But villager Stephen Keir, who has led the campaign to save the pub, said he hoped this might finally be the end of the saga. He said: 'Hopefully we've now seen the back of this application that is clearly lacking any credibility.' Last year, a Co-operative supermarket was given the go-ahead, which could create up to 60 jobs, at a different site in the village.","The retail giant planned a new Tesco Express store on the site of the Victoria and Albert pub in Seaton Delaval, Northumberland .

Mr Edwards initially thought that the device was a large stone. Lucky escape: Six-month-old Pomeranian Bibi, pictured with owner Jason Edwards, found a 70-year-old World War Two grenade on the beach at Canford Cliffs in Poole, Dorset . Dangerous: The rusty World War two grenade was probably left behind following a D-Day training exercise whoch took place just up the shore at Studland, Dorset . Disarmed: A bomb disposal crew took the grenade to a secluded part of the beach and carried out a controlled explosion on it . But fortunately he soon realised that six-month-old Bibi had found a 70-year-old grenade and grabbed his dog to pull her to safety. The beach had to be evacuated and bomb disposal experts had to be called in to carry out a controlled explosion.

Mr Edwards, from Poole, remained at the scene until police arrived to warn other people about the grenade yesterday morning.

A Royal Navy bomb squad from Plymouth, Devon, arrived in the afternoon, moved the grenade to an isolated part of the beach and blew it up. A Dorset police spokesman said the grenade was 'very old and heavily corroded'. It is likely it originated from a huge D-Day training exercise that took part in April 1944 two miles away on the shoreline at Studland, Dorset.","Six-month-old Pomeranian Bibi found the device in Poole, Dorset .

Illegal: Some of Lord Leveson's plans for Press regulation breach European human rights laws, accroding to top lawyers . A key plank of Lord Justice Leveson’s plans for Press regulation breaches European human rights laws, leading barristers have warned. The joint opinion by three QCs concludes the judge’s proposal to punish newspapers that refuse to join a new Press regulator with exemplary damages would violate Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of expression. Lord Pannick, Desmond Browne and Antony White found that the proposals would have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech which was ‘obvious and unjustifiable’. The breach is so ‘striking’ ministers would be unable to sign off legislation that incorporates the proposal as being compatible with human rights laws, the QCs say. Lord Justice Leveson recommended the threat of exemplary damages as a way of providing an incentive for newspapers to voluntarily come within the remit of the new regulator. The proposal is included in a draft Bill published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and is taken even further in controversial plans for an arbitration system that have recently been inserted into the Defamation Bill by the Labour peer Lord Puttnam. The new opinion, which was commissioned by the newspaper industry, warns the proposals are ‘objectionable in principle due to their arbitrary extension of what is widely regarded as an anomalous feature of English law’. It also said the proposals single out a particular category of defendant rather than a particular kind of conduct. ‘To punish the Press for what others may do without punishment is inconsistent with the special importance that domestic and Strasbourg jurisprudence attach to freedom of the Press,’ the lawyers said. Their opinion was challenged by Hugh Tomlinson QC, chairman of the Hacked Off campaign, who said it was ‘misconceived’. Conflicting views: Hugh Tomlinson QC, left, chairman of the Hacked Off campaign, said the lawyers' warning is 'misconceived', while Lord Lester, right,  believes that changing defamation laws would curb the Press in a way 'never seen in any democratic country' The revelation came as ministers brace themselves for a showdown with peers over the Puttnam amendment to the Defamation Bill. The amendment introduces a Leveson-style arbitration backed by law. But, in a further controversial step, it also threatens ruinous damages against papers that fail to get prior approval for publishing contentious stories. The eminent QC Lord Lester, architect of the Defamation Bill which is designed to reform Britain’s notorious libel laws, said the Puttnam proposals would curb the Press in a way ‘never seen in any democratic country’. Downing Street has made it clear that the Prime Minister will not allow the Puttnam proposal to become law, even if it means the entire Defamation Bill has to be scrapped to prevent it.","Top lawyers say regulations would be 'unjustifiable' and law breach 'obvious'

'Devil's work': Killer Andrew Allen Cook, 38, was executed by lethal injection in Georgia last night despite claims that he was mentally ill . A 'senseless' killer who shot dead two university students in 1995 was executed in the United States last night despite claims he was mentally ill. Andrew Allen Cook, an inmate in the U.S. state of Georgia, apologised to his victims' families as he was injected with the sedative pentobarbital. He shot Mercer University students Grant Patrick Hendrickson, 22, and Michele Lee Cartagena, 19, several times as they sat in a car in Lake Juliette, around 75 miles from Atalanta. Cook's lawyers had appealed the death sentence, arguing that the 38-year-old inmate, who was being treated for depression at the time of his death, was mentally ill. He was pronounced dead at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison at 11.22pm, around 14 minutes after he was injected. Mary Hendrickson, mother of one of . the victims, told television station WMAZ-TV that she had been waiting 18 years for justice. She added: 'I think that's what it was: the devil's work. When all that . is going on, I was just thinking to myself, 'Well, the devil is not . going to win. He's not going to win over my heart. He is not going to . win.'' Cook, who has described what he did as senseless, is the first inmate to be executed since the state changed it procedure in July from a three-drug combination to a single dose. As he was strapped to a gurney in the death chamber he used his last words to say: 'I'm sorry. I'm not going to ask you to forgive me. I can't even do it myself.' He thanked his family for 'their support' and for being with him, and added: 'I'm sorry I took so much from you all.' The Georgia Appeals Court stayed Cook's execution on Wednesday to consider a challenge to the state's lethal injection procedure. Lethal injection: A gurney used in the execution of inmates at the state prison in Jackson, Georgia . But the Georgia Supreme Court lifted the stay yesterday, with all other appeals being exhausted. The injection was given at 11:08pm, with Cook blinking a few times before his eyes became heavy. His chest was heaving for about two or three minutes as his eyes closed. Soon after, doctors examined him and . nodded for Carl Humphrey, warden of the state prison in Jackson, to . announce the time of death. Corrections . officials said family visited Cook earlier in the day and that he had . eaten his requested last meal of steak, a baked potato, potato wedges, . fried shrimp, lemon meringue pie and soda. Cook, who had been sentenced to death by a jury, was not charged until two years after the murders. He had confessed to his father, John, an FBI agent who ended up testifying at his son's trial. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) had earlier reached out to Mr Cook in December 1995 because they were interested in speaking to his son. Death row: Cook was pronounced dead at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison at 11.22pm . He called Cook, then 22, to tell him the GBI wanted to talk to him. Mr Cook told the court in 1998: 'I said, 'Andy, the GBI is looking for you concerning the Lake Juilette homicide. Do you know anything about it?' He said, 'Daddy, I can't tell you. You're one of them ... You're a cop.'' Eventually, Cook told his father that he knew about the slayings, that he was there and that he knew who shot the couple, the court was told. Mr Cook recalled: 'I just felt like the world was crashing in on me. But I felt maybe he was there and just saw what happened,' he said. 'I then asked, 'Did you shoot them?' 'After a pause on the phone, he said, 'Yes.'' The father called his supervisor who contacted the Monroe County sheriff and Cook was arrested. During the trial, a distraught Mr Cook mouthed 'I'm sorry' to the victims' families as he walked away from the witness stand. Several of the relatives acknowledged his apology.","Inmate Andrew Allen Cook, 38, was injected with the sedative pentobarbital .

Britain could be forced to accept a flood of young asylum seekers who are allowed to 'shop around' for the best nation to settle in. A key adviser to Europe's most powerful judges believes that the UK should lose its current right to send refugees back to the EU country they first arrived in. Luxembourg's Advocate General Cruz ­Villalon said yesterday that asylum seekers under the age of 18 should not be sent back to where they first landed if they are on their own. The Spanish-born lawyer admits that it could lead to the 'undesired effect' of allowing youngsters the chance to pick and choose where they want to go in the European Union. Rules: Young asylum seekers should be given the chance to 'choose' Britain even if they have arrived in other EU countries, an influential lawyer has said . 'Asylum seekers may be tempted...to choose the member state where the law which is most advantageous to them will be applied,' he said, but maintained it would be for the best. It has caused fury among politicians who accused the EU of trying to force the UK to bend over its own sensible rules. Row: Tory MP Dominic Raab has said it is another example of Brussels trying to force Britain to change their rules . 'This is a classic example of ­Brussels seeking to expand rules that democratic governments have signed up to,' Tory MP Dominic Raab said. 'It creates a real risk that Britain will be caught up in a swath of new EU human rights rules that its elected representatives have had no say in – with far-reaching consequences for UK border ­controls and democratic accountability.' Cruz Villalon was giving his view based on an immigration case involving Britain. Two Eritrean minors and one Iraqi Kurd have applied for asylum in the UK, but it then emerged that they had previously tried the same in Italy and the Netherlands before making their way to the British border. All three, who were aged between 15 and 17, arrived alone between 2008 and 2009. The UK uses the Dublin treaty to send people back in many cases like these. One of the ayslum seekers has been deported and the other two have their cases pending. The UK High Court sent their paperwork to Luxembourg for clarification, on which Mr Villalon has produced a legal paper. There are deep concerns about the consequences of his argument. UKIP Gerard Batten said: 'This document gives ­people the right to shop around for asylum and hedge their bets on getting into one country or another. “If they are genuine asylum seekers, the Netherlands would be as good as the UK.“It’s obvious they think they can get the most out of the UK and that is why they came here.” The Home Office declined to comment as some of the cases are ongoing.","The UK can send away refugees if they arrived elsewhere in the EU first .

The European Commission has reversed its prediction for an end to recession this year and is now predicting the eurozone will not return to growth until 2014, with a lack of bank lending and record joblessness to blame. The 17-nation bloc's economy, which generates nearly a fifth of global output, will shrink 0.3 per cent in 2013, the Commission said, meaning the euro zone will remain in its second recession since 2009 for a year longer than originally foreseen. The Commission, the EU executive, late last year forecast 0.1 per cent growth in the euro zone's economy for 2012, but now says tight lending conditions for companies and households, job cuts and frozen investment have delayed an expected recovery. Gloomy forecasts: European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said several eurozone countries are likely to miss deficit cutting targets because of a weak economy . The Commission sees the euro zone economy growing 1.4 per cent in 2014, with a figure of -0.6 percent for 2012. 'The improved financial market situation contrasts with the absence of credit growth and the weakness of the near-term outlook for economic activity,' said Marco Buti, the commission's director-general for economic and monetary affairs. 'The labour market... is a serious concern,' he said, in a preamble to the Commission's latest forecasts. The European Central Bank's promise last year to do what it takes to defend its common currency has removed the risk of a break-up of the euro zone, and member countries' borrowing costs have come down from unsustainable levels. But the damage from the 2008/2009 global financial crisis and the ensuing euro zone debt crisis has been greater than expected on the real economy, with global demand for euro zone exports one of the few saviours in terms of generating growth. Joblessness in the euro zone is set to peak at 12.2 percent, or more than 19 million people, in 2013, the Commission said, and both private and public consumption will not make any contribution to improving output, instead dragging on the economy. Recession: The Eurozone bloc - the combined economies of 17 nations - is predicted to shrink 0.3 percent in 2013 . The outlook raises the prospect of further interest rate cuts by the ECB to jump-start the economy by reducing the cost of lending for companies and families, although with banks reluctant to lend, any impact may be muted. Consumer inflation is forecast by the Commission to be 1.8 percent for 2013, and with such pressures contained the ECB may feel more comfortable cutting rates to below the current 0.75 percent level. 'A cut in the main refinancing rate is not the most powerful measure the ECB could implement, but it is a step in the right direction,"" investment bank JP Morgan wrote in a note this week. The Commission's overall view is a touch more pessimistic than that of the International Monetary Fund, which sees a 0.2 percent euro zone contraction this year. The ECB previously cut its estimate of euro zone gross domestic product (GDP) for next year to between a fall of 0.9 percent and growth of just 0.3 percent. 'A weaker-than-expected final quarter of 2012 is set to shift the inception of the recovery towards mid-2013,"" the Commission said.","EU executive forecasts Eurozone economy will shrink 0.3% in 2013 .

The signed book is one of only 13 of Richard III's books that is known to still exist. It is especially valuable as he has signed it 'R Gloucester' as he was only the Duke of Gloucester as a young man. The rare book was rediscovered in a library at Longleat House in Wiltshire. Scroll down for video . Rare manuscript: Richard III's book contains tales of chivalry, classical history, and two of the less bawdy Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer . King Richard III: A hand-written book, believed to be made in York in the 15th century, has been uncovered at Longleat House in Wiltshire . It features a signature by Richard, . whose remains were found in a car park in Leicester last year, . 527 years after his death. Books like this containing chivalric tales were given to nobles as part of their education. Above his signature in the book he wrote the words 'Tant le desieree', which means 'So much desired'. Historians say the motto was a chivalristic code the young duke might have adopted for tournaments. Richard, who was the Duke of Gloucester at the time, would have been received it in his early teens. As the fourth son of the Duke of . York, he received the education of a future cleric and was more . competent in Latin than most of his peers. The . book has been at Longleat since Thomas Thynne, the First Viscount . Weymouth, bought it in 1709 along with several other medieval . manuscripts. Signed by Richard III as a teenager: One of only 13 surviving books personally owned by Richard III, which he signed 'R Gloucester' in his role as Duke of Gloucester . Dr Kate Harris, curator at Longleat . House, said: 'It is a fascinating piece of history. His handwriting is . extremely competent, which shows he was highly educated.' 'Within the book are tales of derring-do, as well as classical Greek and Rome.' 'Most of the books of the time were in French and Latin, so this one is unusual.' Dr Harris is curious as to why Richard signed the book in the middle, instead of at the beginning or at the end, which is more traditional. 'He may have done it as a security measure. 'If you sign your signature at the beginning or end it is easy for somebody else to tear it out. But you can't tear out a page from the middle of a book.' Although he has gone down in history as a hunchbacked tyrant, most historians now say that image is fictitious. Richard's modern day image is down largely to his portrayal by William Shakespeare. Richard's body, which was found in a shallow grave in a Leicester car park last year, is expected to finally have a proper burial at a tomb in Leicester Catherdal.","Rare book belonging to a teenage Richard III will go on public display .

Jerry Givens, who carried out executions until 1999, began speaking out against the practice after he came within hours of putting an innocent man to death - and after he himself ended up in jail for a crime he says he did not commit. He now believes that the death penalty is at odds with his religious convictions, and notes that the crime rate in his state actually went up when the death penalty was re-introduced in 1976. 'From the 62 lives I took, I learned a lot,' he told the Washington Post. A changed man: Jerry Givens, pictured, was once the state executioner in Virginia and put 62 people to death over 17 years. He now vehemently opposes the death penalty . Givens started working as a Correctional Officer after losing his job at a tobacco factory and in 1976, before Virginia re-instated the death penalty, he was asked to join the 'Execution Team'. Even though the job did not pay more, he agreed to join as he vehemently believed those who killed deserved to die. When he was 14, he had witnessed a man break into a party and randomly shoot a teenage girl dead - and in the subsequent years, he would think of this killing before he carried out an execution. He also reasoned that because murderers knew there was a death penalty in the state, he was not committing homicide. 'I could consider those people on death row as a suicide,' he told the Daily Life. Old life: Givens is pictured left after he joined the Department of Corrections in the 1970s . Killing machine: Givens shows the electric chair system that was used to execute inmates before Virginia started using lethal injection. He executed 37 people by electric chair . Over the next 17 years, he executed 37 Death Row inmates by electric chair and 25 by lethal injection - although he had no formal medical training. His first execution was in 1984, when he put Linwood Briley - one of three brothers who carried out a seven-month killing spree in Richmond in 1979 - to death. Before the death, Givens prayed with Briley and then focused on the mechanics of the execution. But that night, he could not sleep. 'You . are not going to feel happy,' he told the Post. 'You feel for the condemned . man’s family and the victim’s family. You have two sets of families that . are losing someone.' But Givens went on to become one of the nation's most prolific executioners; the 62 men he put to death accounted for around 11 per cent of all the people executed across the country in those years. Secret life: Givens, pictured left with fellow guards, kept his job secret from his wife for 20 years . Workplace: He worked at the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond, pictured, which has since closed . Since the death penalty was re-instated in the United States in 1976, the state has put more people to death than any . other state, besides Texas. A total of 110 inmates, who were all convicted of capital murder, have been executed since 1982. (Texas has executed 491.) But statistics reveal there has been less support for the death penalty in Virginia in recent years. It has had . fewer death sentences in the past five years than any period since the . 1970s. Robert Gleason, who was executed on January 16 after asking to die so that he would not kill again, was the first . execution in 18 months. This is compared with 1999, when the state put 13 people to . death in a single year. In recent years, as the death penalty . has become less of a key political issue, prosecutors have felt less . pressure to recommend death penalties. Instead, the state has brought in . sentences of life without parole, giving juries and prosecutors a . different option. The number of death sentences . across the country reached record lows in 2011 and 2012 - down 75 per cent since 1996, . according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Five states have . outlawed capital punishment in the past five years: Connecticut (2012), Illinois (2011), New Mexico (2009), New Jersey (2007) and New York (2007). In that time he kept his job a secret from his loved ones. For 20 years, even his wife was unaware that she was living with a professional killer. Yet despite his belief that murderers knew what they were getting themselves into, he said 'crime went up'. His belief in the justice system was also shaken when he came within hours of putting an innocent man to death in 1985. Earl Washington Jr. was sentenced to death after admitting to the rape and murder of a 19-year-old mother. But he had an IQ of 69 and in police interviews, many of his answers failed to match up with the facts of the case. Just days before he was due to be executed, lawyers secured a stay based on doubts about his part in the killing and in 1993, DNA evidence confirmed he was not the killer. He was eventually cleared and pardoned, making him the first person on Virginia's death row . to be exonerated by DNA evidence. It deeply affected Givens. 'If I execute an innocent person, I’m no better than the people on death row,' Givens told the Post. He added that he wondered how many of the men he killed were innocent, and blamed the justice system and its juries for allowing it to happen. 'You're the American people,' he told ABC News. 'You sentenced a guy to be executed. You give him a trial, then you send . him to me to be put to death. 'Then later on you [say] that this guy . was innocent. You didn't put him to death. I did. I performed the . execution. So you might suffer a little. I'm going to suffer a lot, . because I performed the job.' Despite his reservations, he continued to work as Virginia's chief executioner into the 1990s and rose to the rank of captain in the Department of Corrections. Inmates: Givens' first execution was of Linwood Briley, left, in 1984 for a string of brutal murders in Richmond. Givens also came within hours of executing Earl Washington Jr., right, who was later found to be innocent . Fears: Givens, pictured with images of his family, said he wonders how many innocent people he killed . But in 1999, he was charged with money laundering and lying to a federal grand jury; authorities said he bought a car with a friend knowing that the funds came from drug dealing. Givens, who maintains his innocence, was convicted and forced to resign - and his distrust in the justice system was confirmed. He spent four years behind bars and immersed himself in the Bible. He soon realised that what he had done as executioner was not compatible with Jesus' teachings of forgiveness. 'This was God’s way of waking me up,' he said. He does not regret his former work as he believes God put him in the role for a purpose, and took it away for a purpose. 'God said don't worry you go out and save souls. You took 62 but you can save millions,' he said. Last view: An electric chair stands in front of the witness box in the basement of the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond in August 1982 after the state reintroduced the death penalty . After his release in 2004, he found work as a truck driver and started attending Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty meetings. He joined their board in 2009 and started delivering speeches across the country about his experience and his new outlook on the death penalty. In 2010, he gave an emotional testimony at a state legislative hearing on a bill seeking to extend the death penalty to accomplices in murders - and he helped to defeat it. 'The people who pass these bills, they don't have to do it,' he said after the hearing. 'The people who do the executions, they're the ones who suffer through it.'","Jerry Givens served as state executioner from 1982 until 1999 .

'Lingua Franca': Germany's president Joachim Gauck made his comments in Berlin as he pleaded with Britain not to leave the European Union . English should become the language of Europe, the German president has claimed. Joachim Gauck made his comments in Berlin as he pleaded with Britain not to leave the European Union. In remarks unlikely to please the French, Mr Gauck said English had become the ‘lingua franca’ of the continent. ‘One of the main problems we have in . building a more integrated European community is the inadequate . communication within Europe,’ he said. ‘It is true to say that young people are growing up with English as the lingua franca. ‘However, I feel that we should not simply let things take their course when it comes to linguistic integration. ‘More . Europe means multilingualism. I am convinced that feeling at home in . one’s native language and its magic and being able to speak enough . English to get by in all situations and at all ages can exist alongside . each other in Europe.’ Mr Gauck also pleaded with Britain to stay in the EU. Referring . to David Cameron’s pledge of an in/out refernedum on the EU Gauck said . in a keynote speech: 'Dear English, Scots, Welsh, Northern Irish and new . British citizens. We would like to keep you! 'We need your experiences as the country with the oldest parliamentary democracy, we need your traditions, your soberness and your courage. 'You helped with your deployment in World War II to save our Europe - it is also your Europe. ‘More Europe should not mean ""without you,"" he said to thunderous applause at his palace in Berlin in his first major address since taking on the job nearly a year ago. 'Structural floor': The president, whose has a largely ceremonial and moral leadership role, conceded that a 'structural flaw' led to an imbalance in the European Union which was only 'patched up by emergency measures, such as the European Stability Mechanism and the fiscal compact' Aware that a powerful Germany is now seen as a bully in many European countries - dictating austerity in cash-strapped nations - he insisted in his televised speech: 'We don’t want to browbeat others, or press our concepts on them. We stand however by our experiences and would like to convey them,' recalling that less than a decade earlier Germany had been the 'sick man of Europe.' The president, whose has a largely ceremonial and moral leadership role,  conceded that a 'structural flaw' led to an imbalance in the European Union which was only 'patched up by emergency measures, such as the European Stability Mechanism and the fiscal compact.' He also condeded that most of what the EU’s 500 million citizens have read or heard about the 27-member bloc over the past few years has tended to be about the eurozone crisis. “This is also a crisis of confidence in Europe as a political project. This is not just a struggle for our currency; we are struggling with an internal quandary too.” This graph shows the results of a poll which asked British people about their stance on EU membership . The president then went on to remind his audience, which was largely made up of people under the age of 30, of the achievements of the EU since it began as a trading block in the post-war years - including the fact that the bloc 'has been at peace ever since.' After all, he said, 'it was from our country that the attempts to destroy everything European, all universal values were unleashed. Despite everything that happened, the Allies granted our country support and solidarity straight after the war,' he said. 'We were invited, received and welcomed.' The president also stressed that despite its economic might, Berlin had no aspirations of imposing 'a German diktat.' Gauck, an activist pastor from former communist East Germany, defined what Germany owed to Europe and the western Allies in rebuilding after the devastation of WWII.

A cheating wife who paid a personal trainer to shoot her husband dead on Valentine's Day after luring him with the promise of a romantic evening marked the anniversary in jail yesterday. Mother-of-three Stacey Schoeck, 38, was the 'mastermind' of the murder of her fifth husband and adopted father of her children - hiring a hit-man through a woman she met in work, who shot him dead on February 14 2010 in an isolated spot in a local park. On the third anniversary of Richard Schoeck's death and his wife's third month behind bars, his family have told the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of their relief and their hatred of the woman who innocently became a member of their family before turning murderess. Lured to death: Stacey Schoeck admitted hiring a hit-man to murder her husband, Richard, pictured. Richard's family spoke yesterday - the anniversary of the Valentine's Day shooting . Murder plot: Schoeck's work buddy Lynitra Ross, left, advised her friend to hire hit-man Reginald Coleman, right, at a meal at a Mexican restaurant. He worked as a personal trainer called 'Mr Results' 'Richard was always there,' his sister Carol Fillingim told the local paper. 'He would help anybody do anything. It will never be behind us. 'We’re trying to get a little closure to it. I hope it keeps other criminals from thinking they can get away with something like this.' Schoeck, of Snellville, a city just east of Atlanta, was lured to Belton Bridge Park in Hall County by his wife - having been told she wanted to exchange Valentine's cards in a romantic spot. Instead Reginald Coleman, a personal trainer who went by the name 'Mr Results' was laying in wait and shot the University facilities manager dead . Coleman was hired through Lynitra Ross, Schoeck's work colleague at the DeKalb County spinal clinic where they both worked in administration. Coleman had previously offered lunchtime training sessions at the clinic. The arrangement was set up over a meal at a Mexican restaurant between the two women. The prosecution alleged Schoeck gave Ross a house she owned and paid Coleman $10,000. Valentine's murder: Stacey Schoeck, left, was sentenced in December. Richard's family remember him as a kind, fun man, right, who adopted his wife's three children and was always 'there for his family' According to reports Richard Schoeck had a life insurance policy worth $500,000 - something his wife stood to gain following his death. Schoeck admitted to having an affair in court and eventually admitted the plot against her 46-year-old husband and testified against her co-accused to avoid the death penalty. She was sentenced to life imprisonment in December. Phone records revealed communication between the three suspects before, during and after the crime. Prosecutors also alleged the trio went on a 'dry run' to scope out the scene ahead of the Valentine's Day attack. Ross never admitted her role in the killing but was sentenced to life in August. Coleman pleaded guilty and will also serve life in prison. To add further insult to her late husband's family, Schoeck's one defense in court was to claim her ex-husband had molestered one of her sons - something later quashed with the evidence from the children, one of whom told of how he missed 'Daddy Richard' who had adopted them all, according to the Gainsville Times. For Richard Schoeck's family his murder was pointless, a crime masterminded by a woman who just wanted out of her marriage and no longer cared for her kind, hot air ballooning enthusiast husband. 'It was such a heinous murder done to someone that did not deserve it at all,' Fillingim, told the Journal-Constitution. 'She was such a cowardly woman that couldn’t keep herself in control and had never had anyone that stood up to her. When you get too much power and control, you just believe you can do anything.' 'Richard was a fine man, a Boy Scout leader, a very community-minded, compassionate person,' Hall County District Attorney Lee Darragh told the newspaper. 'He was a busy, well-liked person.' 'Judge (Jason) Deal appropriately . recognized that Stacey Schoeck was the engine that put this train in . motion, until the death of her husband. Without her involvement, this would not have occurred,' the DA told the Gainsville Times.","Stacey Schoeck is serving a life sentence after admitting hiring a hit-man to murder her 46-year-old husband Richard, a hot-air ballooning enthusiast who had adopted her three children .

Scientists have been left marveling at an astronomical 'Freaky Friday' when an asteroid the size of the White House made a record close pass by earth on the same day a meteor exploded over a Russian town - a dual event they say had a 100 million to 1 chance of taking place at the same time. The chance occurrence puts into perspective how little we know or can predict about the universe around us and dwarfs the often cited 1 in 10,000 odds we could be hit by a large asteroid some time in the next 100 years. As astronomers excitedly prepared for the White House sized asteroid DA14 to travel a record close distance to Earth three days ago - something that only occurs every 20 to 40 years - other more unexpected reports flooded-in from Russia. 'Coincidence': Nasa model of the asteroid 2012 DA14 passing at a record close level to earth. It passed by safely on Friday - the same day a meteor blasted over Russia . Aftermath: Russia was clearing up after a record meteor blast on Friday. More than 1000 were injured but no one was killed in the explosion . A large meteor exploded over the town Chelyabinsk causing $33million worth of damage shattering 4,000 windows, collapsing roofs and injuring 1,200 at 9.30am local time on Friday. Prior to entering the earth's surface it was estimated to be 55 feet and weighing 10,000 tons, it was the largest meteor to hit earth since 1908 and entered the earth's surface at 40,000 mph. The rare event came hours before the DA14 asteroid passed at the speed of a bullet at a record close distance to earth. Nasa were able to reliably predict . DA14's distance from earth and predicted that 2046 it will make another . close call but have no impact.. But it is just one asteroid being . monitored by Nasa's Near-Earth Object project founded in 1998 to monitor . worrying asteroid trajectories which they themselves admit is no . precise science. One asteroid, 2011 AG5, which was . given a 625 - 1 likelihood of hitting the earth in 2040 according to . models published in February last year is now predicted to have 'near to . no chance' of hitting earth - something which is reassuring but only . when the models work that way around. Found: Russian scientists have retrieved fragments of the meteor from a frozen lake . Shockwave: People heading to work in Chelyabinsk, Russia, heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them . In addition the space agency says . there are 1,379 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids which could collide with . earth and believe they have only located around 90 per cent of such . bodies. However, impact doesn't necessarily mean the levels of devastation seen in Hollywood films. In 1908 the last largest impact in recent history wiped out vast areas of  forest land in Siberia but only killed one man. Russia has now begun clearing up the impact of Friday's meteor blast. Scientists announced today they had found fragments of the meteor and would be studying them. They admitted they had no idea of the meteor's path and could only watch its devastation. 'It was impossible for us to track the [Chelyabinsk] meteor in advance,' Vladimir Lipunov, head of the Space Monitoring . Laboratory with Moscow State University told the LA Times. 'If the . meteor had fallen or exploded low [in the sky] above one of the numerous . military or nuclear facilities near Chelyabinsk, the consequences would . have been far more catastrophic.' Nasa put out a statement explaining Friday's events were not connected. 'According to NASA scientists, the . trajectory of the Russia meteor was significantly different than the . trajectory of the asteroid 2012 DA14, making it a completely unrelated . object,' the statement said. 'Information is still being collected . about the Russia meteor and analysis is preliminary at this point. In . videos of the meteor, it is seen to pass from left to right in front of . the rising sun, which means it was traveling from north to south. Asteroid DA14's trajectory is in the opposite direction, from south to . north. 'We would expect an event of this . magnitude to occur once every 100 years on average,' said Paul Chodas of . NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion . Laboratory in Pasadena, California said of the meteor. Chairwoman of the department of . physics at Yale University, Meg Urry, said the events have intrigued the . world of astronomy but they were, indeed, a coincidence. ' Friday was an extremely unusual day, astronomically speaking,' she wrote on CNN.com today. 'Both events happening within one day . makes us think they could be connected. But the facts don't support . this conclusion. First of all, in the time between the two events, the . Earth moved roughly 300,000 miles, meaning the asteroid and the meteor . were in completely different places. Moreover, they traveled in . completely different directions, so they couldn't have been associated. 'So there is no way the meteor and . the asteroid are connected. It has to be a coincidence that the two . events happened on the same day. 'If asteroids as big as DA14 pass . close to Earth once every decade or two, and meteors as large as the . Chelyabinsk one impact once every 100 years (a similar meteor having . caused the Tunguska event in 1908), the chance of both events happening . on any one day are indeed very small: 1 in 3,650 days times 1 in 36,500 . days, or about 1 in 100 million -- not odds you would bet against.'","Nasa declares the historical firsts which took place just hours apart as a complete coincidence as statisticians put the odds at 1 in 100million .
Random space event which took experts by surprise puts into perspective the probability of a potentially devastating asteroid hit on earth in the next 100 years cited as 10,000 to 1 .
Nasa admits there are 1379 'Potentially Hazarous Asteroids' they are monitoring .

A teenage sports fan has been left recovering from a paralyzing major stroke which doctors mistakenly diagnosed as a migraine. James Finnerty, 15, from Parma Heights, Ohio, who plays both rugby and football, woke up suffering with a severe headache last April and immediately began vomiting. His parents became particularly concerned when the teen appeared confused and couldn't comprehend a note left on the kitchen counter so rushed him to the emergency room. Long road to recovery: Sports fan, James Finnerty, pictured in a football t-shirt, is recovering from a stroke which doctors misdiagnosed as a migraine . Once there doctors misdiagnosed him with a migraine before his mother, who's a nurse, insisted on a second opinion. A CT scan discovered he was actually suffering from a pediatric stroke and was close to death. James and his family have now spoken of his miraculous road to recovery with the teenager now back in school although permanently barred from the sports field where they believe his injuries may have begun. 'She kept yelling at the doctors,' said James, recalling his mother's reaction in the emergency room. 'I remember 95 percent of it. My left side was gone and I couldn't move at all,' he told ABC News. James was held in his local hospital for 25 hours before his mother insisted he be transferred to her workplace - the Cleveland Clinic. She disagreed with the diagnosis of a migraine and it turns out she was right - her son had a torn artery and had swelling in his brain as a result of a stroke. Doctors now believe the injury was the . result of a hit in a rugby game which came four days before and caused a . clot. Friendship: James Finnerty, pictured center, is particularly grateful to his friends who have supported him in his recovery from a life-threatening stroke . He was operated on twice at the clinic and left with a titanium plate in the back of his head. He suffered a second stroke during his treatment and lost the use of speech and movement. In the weeks that followed he was unable to communicate with his family and was so confused he referred to his 14-year-old brother as 'Mailbox' Yet despite the seriousness of his injuries after a year of physiotherapy, the determined young man is well on the road to recovery . 'He can go through this and have a smile on his face like it's no big deal and laugh about his weaknesses,' said his mother Stefania Finnerty, 42. 'He's always been go-lucky and always so dedicated to his fitness that he wanted to do the best he could…He just works so hard.' Life-saving: James Finnerty was taken to the Cleveland Clinic, pictured, after his mother demanded a second opinion. They discovered he was suffering a stroke rather than a migraine as first diagnosed . 'Even with me being a neuro-nurse, I didn't think this could happen. I do feel that any child in sports who has possibly hit his head or neck or chest and they are feeling different should get scanned.' Mrs Finnerty was recovering from breast cancer at the time of the accident but sat at her son's bedside for two months alongside her husband, Thomas, who is a police dispatcher and runs his own gardening business. 'I would go through cancer and chemo a hundred times over than to deal with this. To have your child [sick] -- there are no descriptions. So I had to put myself on a back burner because I was so focused on my child,' she said. James now suffers some balance problems and is permanently barred from the sports field. He is also at risk of having another stroke in the future. According to the Cleveland Clinic around 3,000 children a year suffer a stroke with many left with long-term disability as a result. Stroke often occurs as a result of injury on the sports field. 'It's a common story,' Dr. Neil Friedman, James' doctor, told the broadcaster. 'There was initial damage to the artery, and he did weightlifting and extended the tear and stroked his cerebellum. It wasn't for another 25 hours that he had progressive worsening of the headache that we realized he had a stroke.… The brain was basically being pushed down through an opening in the skull.' James is particularly grateful to his school friends who visited him at hospital and set up a Facebook group called Prayers for James Finnerty. 'My son has the best friends ever, Jamie and my family and I are truly blessed,' Thomas Finnerty wrote on Facebook . 'They were terrific,' James, now 16, told ABC. 'They were there every day and have seen the worst of the worst. Cleaning my room had to be disgusting. I felt bad about that.' However the high school student refuses to be defined by his injury. 'I don’t like to use the word ‘stroke’ anymore. I just say that I got my head messed up,' he told www.cleveland.com.","James Finnerty, 15, was tackled on the rugby pitch four days before being taken ill .

Outraged parents have hit out at a New York elementary school after it emerged 9-year-old pupils were being set math problems about the killing and beating of slaves yesterday. Two questions on a homework assignment set by a teacher at PS 59 Beekman Hill International have caused uproar for asking pupils to subtract the number of dead slaves from alive ones and calculate the number of times a slave was whipped over a month. 'One slave got whipped five times a day. How many times did he get whipped in a month (31 days)? Another slave got whipped nine times a day. How many times did he get whipped in a month? How many times did the two slaves get whipped together in one month?,' read one question. Controversy: The questions, pictured, were drawn up by a fourth grade class last month and were to be set to another class in the year group last week. A teaching assistant stopped them being assigned - outraged by their content . Context: Critics have accused the school of making light of slavery by setting the bizarre math question without any context of the brutality of slavery, captured here in a painting by Robert Riggs . 'In a slave ship, there can be 3,799 slaves. One day, the slaves took over the ship. 1,897 are dead. How many slaves are alive?,' read the other. A student teacher was asked to photocopy the worksheet entitled 'Slavery Word Problems Homework' last Thursday and refused before making a complaint, NY1 reports. As well as the intended class another fourth grade group had been set the assignment and completed it last month. According to the report they wrote the problems as part of a class overseen by a teacher who has been working at the school for seven years, she was named by the New York Post today as Jane Youn. State Senator Simcha Felder, who is the chairman of the New York City Education Sub-Committee, has now called for Youn and the teacher who most recently set the assignment, reportedly fourth grade teacher Jacqueline Vitucci, to be removed. 'While the city, state and unions are busy haggling over teacher evaluations, New York City's students are being subjected to reprehensible and irresponsible educational materials. I am calling for the immediate removal of these two teachers,' he told the broadcaster. Under fire: PS 59 Beekman Hill International school is under fire for setting the controversial assignment. Student teacher Aziz Harding, right, revealed the paper outraged at being told to hand it out to pupils . Parents and guardians at the East Manhattan school likewise expressed their horror. Julia Morales told NY1: 'This is unacceptable. I would not be happy with this."" Another simply wrote 'this is disgusting' on the school's PTA Facebook page. Aziza Harding, the Atlanta graduate student, who revealed the assignment told the broadcaster: 'I'm just like, 'Wow, this is really inappropriate'. It shouldn't be a homework assignment, and I did not want to make copies of this.' She refused to copy and hand out the paper last Thursday and reported it to her overseeing professor at New York University, Charlton McIlwain. 'You're ostensibly teaching or trying to teach history or call attention to a particular historical moment, yet there's no explanation, there's no education, there's no teaching going on,' he said. 'And so, for someone who is probably, at nine years of age, has maybe heard of slavery but probably doesn't know what it is really like, their first, perhaps, and most lasting impression about this historical event comes in a very abstracted, nonchalant type of thing that they have no real sense of connection to.' The school's headteacher, Adele Schroeder, told the channel she was 'appalled' and would be hosting a meeting with parents about the assignment. She said teachers would be trained in the area but was unavailable for further comment today. The Department of Education said: 'This is obviously unacceptable and we will take appropriate disciplinary action against these teachers. The Chancellor spoke to the principal, and she has already taken steps to ensure this does not happen again.' Last year a school in Georgia came under fire for using a similar assignment. Beaver Ridge Elementary was criticized for the worksheet which included the question: 'Each tree had 56 oranges. If eight slaves pick them equally, then how much would each slave pick?'. It also asked 'If Frederick got two beatings per day, how many beatings did he get in 1 week?'. Beekman Hill has a waiting list to get into Kindergarten and is awarded 9 out of 10 on greatschools.org - a level only awarded to a handful of schools in the city. Many of its students are the children of personnel at the nearby UN building.","Teachers at respected East Manhattan elementary school, PS 59 Beekman Hill International School set the assignment to a fourth grade class and tried to hand it out to another before a complaint was made .

Their actions saved the life of the little girl who was later diagnosed with a rare heart condition called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or CPVT, which can trigger cardiac arrest at any time. 'If they'd waited five minutes, Olivia wouldn't have survived,' her father Joe Quigley said at the time. 'I was completely unaware that her school had a plan,' he told ABC News today - the fourth anniversary of the incident. 'It's not something I thought to ask, but I am so thankful they did. Cardiac arrest isn't rare, survival is.' On February 13 2009, Mr Quigley and his wife, Cathy, didn't realize anything was wrong with their little girl beyond the usual 'coughs and colds'. In fact, two days before she had been given the all-clear in her annual check up. But when he received the call from her school that afternoon he knew something wasn't right. Battling illness: Now 10, Olivia Quigley fund-raises for the American Heart Association and calls for schools to be trained in dealing with conditions that cause sudden cardiac arrest . 'You dread getting that phone call . from the school. I remember every word,' said Quigley, a part-time . bartender. 'I knew it wasn't just that she fell over and hurt her leg. It was something serious.' It turns out their youngest child was . carrying a potentially fatal heart condition which kills 30 per cent of . those in their first attack. Teachers at her elementary school kept her alive before medics arrived with a defibrillator. In hospital she suffered another cardiac arrest and was put on life support. Her family were unsure of what her condition would be when she regained consciousness. Life-saving school: Two teachers at East Boston Central Catholic School, pictured, saved the life of Olivia Quigley four years ago when she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest warming up for gym class . She was unable to walk and had issues with short term memory loss but miraculously has since achieved a full recovery. Olivia, now 10, and her family are promoting awareness of the illness and the work of the American Heart Association which is researching the condition. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or CPVT is a condition where the rhythm of the heart is disrupted . It is thought to be the cause for 15% of all unexplained cardiac arrests in young people . It is linked to moments of physical activity or emotional stress and in the majority of cases has a genetic cause . Sufferers are advised to avoid all . forms of vigorous physical activity and can be implanted with devices to . measure the heart and given beta-blockers . Sufferers have a tendency of . fainting during exercise and often have relatives who have suffered from . similar symptoms or sudden cardiac arrest. However, for many the first . sign of the illness is a sudden heart attack . Sudden cardiac arrests claim the lives of 300,000 a year in the U.S. alone . They also want to draw attention to the need for emergency medical response plans in schools. 'It can happen again at any time,' said Mr Quigley. 'All you can do is be prepared for it.' Olivia now wears an implant to keep track of her heart rhythm and to automatically shock it back if she goes into cardiac arrest. 'Sometimes in gym, she'll say, 'I'll need to sit this one out,' when her heart is racing a bit or she is feeling a little faint. But it doesn't happen very often,' Mr Quigley added. 'Initially, she was concerned that that she wasn't like everyone else -- that she was different, somehow. So I say, 'You are different because this happened to you.' Let's look at the positive side of what you can do.' 'She is getting the word out that school staff should be trained in CPR, and schools should have AEDs and an emergency medical response plans. She's putting herself out there.' The family are still concerned they can't find the origin of Olivia's illness. The condition is usually genetic but she was tested and nothing came back positive. That's why they are backing research by the American Heart Association. 'Although it is comforting to know that she is getting the correct treatment, not having a diagnosis is still a big worry,' Mr Quigley told the charity's blog. 'Olivia has a 15 year old brother, Alex, and not having a diagnosis for Olivia means that he could also be carrying the same genetic problems. He could just be a time bomb waiting to go off.'","Olivia Quigley was 6 when she suffered a random cardiac arrest in her school playground and was saved by teachers using CPR .

A daughter, who never knew the story of her heroic father's life, will receive eight medals for bravery awarded to him today after they were discovered by accident in the laundry room of an apartment block. Hyla Merin, of Westlake Village, California, will receive a series of honors awarded to her father 2nd Lt Hyman Markel for his bravery in World War II. The medals, including a Purple Heart and a distinguished Silver Star - awarded for gallantry, have begun her long road to discovering the story of her father, a heroic Rabbi's son who died protecting others against German troops just five months before she was born. Mystery: Hyla Merin, left, was never told the story of her father Hyman Markel, right. She is piecing together his story after a box of medals awarded to him were recently discovered . Just married: Hyman and Celia Markel, pictured, married in 1941, four years before he was killed in World War II. Eight medals he received for bravery have just been discovered in a locker in a laundry room . 'It just confirms what a great man he was,' Merin said tearfully. 'He gave up his life for our country and our freedom. I'll put it up in my house as a memorial to him and to those who served.' 'It was a very difficult topic for [my mother]. When my father died, she was seven months pregnant.' Markel was killed on May 3, 1945, in Italy's Po Valley while fighting German troops as an officer with the 88th Division of the 351st Infantry Regiment. According to research by Purple Hearts Reunited - a charity which reunites families with lost medals - he was awarded posthumously after courageously offering his life to save others. Zachariah Fike, the Vermont Army National Guard captain who founded Purple Hearts Reunited said: 'The accounts suggest that he was out on patrol and he got ambushed and he charged ahead and basically took out a machine gun position to save the rest of his guys. For that, he paid the ultimate sacrifice.' Heroic: Purple Hearts Reunited researched Hyman Markel, right, when his medals were discovered. He was awarded many posthumously, including the purple heart, left, as he died trying to save others . Merin's mother, Celia Markel, was given most of the medals but for some reason never received the Silver Star. The young widow was clearly traumatized by losing her first love and rarely spoke to her daughter about him. In the 1960s she moved into a West Hollywood apartment where she stored a box of precious mementos of her late husband - including the medals - in a laundry room looker. They remained there forgotten about until September last year when the manager of the building stumbled upon them and contacted the veteran's charity. Merin wrote about the shock of receiving the call on Facebook. 'OMG! Got a call this am from the apt manager where we lived when I was a kid . My aunt moved out 3 years ago. They opened a locker and found pictures of my dad, his purple heart, and other special memorabilia ! Can't wait to see them tomorrow morning! I cried with happiness and anticipation all morning!' 'I don't have a lot of pictures, I don't have a lot of stories, and I've always been a crier,' she explained. 'My mother was always the stoic one, very strong.' Now Merin is patching together the life of her father - a man who excelled at mathematics and met his young wife at a Jewish temple in Buffalo, New York, in 1941 - already a serving army officer. As well as the medals, the box contained photos, her father's prayer book and letters which tell the story of Markel's life and death . 'I found it very hard to look at. A lot of them were condolence letters,' Merin said. She told her mother of the discovery and the undelivered Silver Star but she sadly died earlier this month at the age of 94, before the family was reunited with them. She briefly remarried when her daughter was 10 but tragically lost her second husband three years later. Merin will also receive the Silver Star thanks to the work of the veteran's charity.","Hyla Merin, of Westlake Village, will receive the medals including a Silver Star and Purple Heart today .

"By . Barbara Jones and Tom Goodenough . PUBLISHED: . 19:10 EST, 26 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:42 EST, 27 May 2012 . Kenyan police last night agreed to set up a task force to investigate the death of British aristocrat’s son Alexander Monson after protests from his family and allegations of a cover-up. Alexander, 28, died in mysterious circumstances after spending nine hours in a police cell following his arrest for smoking cannabis outside a bar near his mother’s home in the coastal resort of Diani, south of Mombasa. Yesterday, his friends gathered for a memorial service in the family garden overlooking a beach at the edge of the Indian Ocean. Mysterious demise: Alexander Monson, who died after being arrested for smoking cannabis in Kenya, with his mother Hilary Martin and sister Isabella . His father Nicholas, the 12th Baron of Monson, in his eulogy described Alexander as ‘a brilliant comet that blazed through the skies for 28 years’. Following the service, his family had intended for the former Marlborough College pupil's body to be cremated, although it was still unclear if this would be possible due to the likelihood of further autopsies. His family believes his life could have been saved if police had called for medical help when he collapsed last Saturday morning. Instead they allegedly took him to hospital and handcuffed him unconscious to a bed, telling doctors to treat him for a drugs overdose. Guests at Alexander Monson's memorial service cast flowers into the ocean in memory of the 28-year-old . Alexander Monson's family have called for an investigation into his death . Alex's father Lord Monson giving a reading at his son's memorial service, in which he described him as 'a brilliant comet that blazed through the skies for 28 years' His family, headed by Alexander’s father, has instructed lawyers to  carry out an independent inquiry  with a view to taking action against the police. A post-mortem examination carried out last week showed Alexander died from the result of ‘blunt force trauma’ – a blow to the head that led to swelling of the brain. His left hand was heavily bruised, leading pathologists to believe he may have been trying to defend himself, and there was bruising to his groin that suggests he had been kicked. Police had initially claimed the public schoolboy had suffered fatal complications relating to drug use after he was held under suspicion of smoking Bhang, a local variety of cannabis. Cover-up claims: Alexander's father, Nicolas, pictured with his ex-wife Hilary, has instructed lawyers to conduct an independent inquiry with a view to taking action against the police . Lord Monson, who travelled to Mombasa for his son’s funeral, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Whatever happened in that police station need not have led to Alexander’s death. It is clear he was attacked and we want this properly investigated. ‘His death is a terrible tragedy and a waste. However painful it is for us at this time, we are determined to find the truth and bring those responsible to justice.’ Monson also spoke of his devastation he felt after first hearing of his son's death: 'I was on holiday in Spain and I was playing a game of Scrabble when a friend rang me up and said: 'I have some appalling news to tell you: Alexander has died in hospital. Alex's father pictured with his new wife has spoken of his devastation at his son's unexplained death . 'As you can imagine I just couldn't believe it - I was in a state of shock. 'Then, when I arrived in Kenya, it was revealed to me that he had died from a blow to the head. 'Again, that was another great wave of shock.' Last night, the head of Mombasa’s Provincial Criminal Investigation Office, Ambrose Munyasia, said: ‘I am appointing senior officers to a special task force which will hold a thorough inquiry. A person has died in the arms of the police and we must investigate his death.’ A family spokesman said: ‘Everything points to an attack followed by  a cover-up.’","Post-mortem examination shows that former Marlborough College schoolboy died from 'blow to the head'

The story of his long political life; embodiment of the spirit . of New York and the colorful manner of 'Hizzoner' Ed Koch have been . remembered since his death this month, but for the . first time Koch the 19-year-old Army draftee has been . revealed with the discovery of a secret diary. A journal belonging to the former Mayor, when he was just a Bronx teenager training to serve in World War II, . has been unearthed by his sister, Pat Thaler, and is revealed today. It shows Koch's early liberalism; firm stance against prejudice and his stubborn refusal to back down in a fight, three aspects of his character which came to represent his time in office. A proud soldier: New York mayor Ed Koch, left, was drafted to serve in World War II at the age of 19. His sister, Pat Thaler, has just discovered a diary he wrote at the time, right . Early life: A diary of Ed Koch's time in the army reveals how similar the Mayor of New York, pictured, was to his teenage self both in his political views and love of the movies . 'What struck me was that he was the same person then that he was at the . end of his life,' Thaler, 80, told the New York Post today. Koch was given the diary by his mother, Joyce, it was a leather bound book inscribed 'God bless you, my son.' He filled it out during his days in basic training at Camp Croft, South Carolina, in 1943. In it the man who famously went on to become New . York mayor from 1978 to 1989 told of his arguments against prejudice in the armed . forces - foreshadowing the kind of campaigns he would take on in his . political life and showing his early belligerence in the face of those he disagreed with. 'Had an argument with several of the boys over anti-Negro prejudice, . this led to arguments over Jews and the usual line,' he writes in one journal entry. 'Tired': Ed Koch's entries into his wartime diary, such as the one pictured, reveal the conditions in his army training camp and his dislike for some of his colleagues . Fresh start: Koch is pictured celebrating his win as New York City mayor in November 1977. A new diary reveals his time serving in the U.S. army during World War II . 'The arguments Lee . presented were very poor and ignorant. I know that he is very biased . even though he covers it up with an air of friendliness. It’s a pity . that there are so few liberals in the land and so many ignorant people. I’m referring to all the bigoted individuals who make up this country.' In another passage written on August 21, he adds: 'All week long they have called . yiddy yiddy yiddy all the poor [GIs] who happen to be Jews. I couldn’t . take it anymore today and when LaRue kept calling out that miserable . epithet, I boiled and told him to meet me outside the supply room. I was . boiling inside and the whole company was out there to watch the fight. I . was beaten pretty badly — knocked down a couple of times and the Lt. wanted to stop the fight but I wouldn’t let him. Finally, he did. Strangely enough I’m not marked up which makes me feel pretty good. Even . though I took the beating, I’m glad I fought.' In a WLIW television program, The Jews . of New York, Koch would later speak of his attachment to his faith and . refusal to back down in the face of anti-semitism which he first . encountered in the army. 'Jews have always thought that having . someone elevated with his head above the grass was not good for the . Jews. I never felt that way,' he told the program. 'I believe that you have to stand . up.' He had Daniel Pearl's words engraved on his tombstone:  'My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish.' Following his training, Ed Koch went on to serve in the 104th Infantry Division known as the Timberwolves. He was deployed in France and his unit helped to liberate the Nordhausen/Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp in Germany. Tough: Koch, pictured in 1977, secured three terms in office. He was known for belligerence in the face of opponents and it came to him early according to a new diary unearthed today . Affection: Koch, who never married, is pictured kissing Diana Ross on the steps of City Hall in July 1983. The larger than life politician reveals his outspoken character in a newly discovered diary . New Yorker for life: Koch left New York for the first time to serve in World War II. He was a proud veteran and New Yorker, pictured at a Mets parade, left, and at a welcome event for the team in 1986, right . He left the army with two battle stars and a combat infantry badge. Thaler discovered the journal in a dresser drawer in Koch's West Village department following his death. As well as revealing the more serious development of his political views, it also reveals his humor. 'Patrolling today,' the new soldier writes in one entry. 'Our object was to get out of a forest. We had to go . from cover to cover. I hid behind a tree and assumed the prone position. Lt. Reed came over with the Lt. Col. and said, 'Koch, on what side of a . tree do you aim from,' I said, 'On the right side.' He said, 'So what . the hell are you doing on the left side?' When Koch took over the city reporters covered him around the clock because of 'the . Koch factor' - his ability to say something outrageous any place, any . time - something he also seemed to get the hang of in his early life. In another entry he notes: 'Full field inspection in the afternoon. The whole battalion set up their . shelter halfs in a line and displayed equipment. it took about an hour . to get everything ready for display and then the Col. merely walked . swiftly up and down the aisles and glanced at the tents once in a while. It was the biggest example of a waste of time that I have ever seen in . the Army.' Other passages reveal his struggle adjusting to army life. Fighting anti-semitism: Jewish Koch refused to back down in the face of anti-semitism in the army. His tombstone bears Daniel Pearl's words 'My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish' Remembered: Hundreds attended Ed Koch's funeral earlier this month including dozens of political friends such as Bill Clinton, pictured . 'The chow (chili con carne) was terrible but I . scraped the plate. It will be a long time before I’ll get used to the . open latrine. The fellows in the bunk are pretty good. I think that I’ll . get along fine. . . . The beer stinks, it leaves a taste in my mouth.' It also reveals Koch's early love of the movies. The former mayor enjoyed a successful . career as a reviewer after he left office. 'Karl Marx had it all wrong,' he would later say. 'Religion is not the opiate of the masses. It’s the movies.' 'Went to main base and saw “Sahara.” Good but unbelievable — 10 men catching a battalion,' he writes in one entry. 'Had double date with Madison. I took Betty Lou Carnagie. We went to . AAFSAT. Had supper in the PX and saw 'Flesh and Fantasy.' We made the . late show 8-10. Got out at 10. We were going to miss bed check by traveling by bus so we took a cab back to Rollins $2.00', says another. 'Went to movies, 'Above Suspicion'. Grade B picture. Staying in tonight. Received package from home containing candy and rugelach plus a very . handsome dog bracelet,' he adds. Koch passed away at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital on February 1. Hundreds of well-wishers, political colleagues and dignitaries as well as his family attended his funeral. Mayor Bloomberg described Koch as 'a great mayor, a great man, and a great friend'. 'In elected office and as a private citizen, he was our most tireless, fearless, and guileless civic crusader,' he said. 'Through . his tough, determined leadership and responsible fiscal stewardship, Ed . helped lift the city out of its darkest days and set it on course for . an incredible comeback. We will miss him dearly.'","Ed Koch's sister Pat Thaler found the diary hidden in a drawer in his West Village apartment following his death this month .

That's a policy I can't understand.' In a statement to The Smoking Gun, Applebee's spokesman Dan Smith said: 'Our franchisee has apologized to the guest,' and that the employee who posted the bill to Reddit 'is no longer employed by the franchise.'

David Simpson, the young British pilot who faced a death sentence while imprisoned in Central Africa, yesterday returned to his relieved family in North Yorkshire after a five-month ordeal. In an emotional reunion with his parents, pheasant farmer Peter Simpson and his wife Vicky, David said he was 'terribly sad' to have caused them distress and anguish. His mother, close to tears as she hugged him, said she always believed her son would return home safely. Out of Africa: David Simpson gets a hug from his overjoyed mother Vicky while father Peter looks on . 'It's been unreal, months of sleepless nights and worrying sick,' she said.

I'm home: David Simpson returns to the Yorkshire village of Gillamoor with a suitcase full of washing . 'He's brought a suitcase full of washing with him, and he's already demanding my home cooking. We're going to have a proper family tea and watch the football results.' David, 24, was working with a safari company in the tropical forests of the Central African Republic in March, clearing a track for four-wheel-drive vehicles, when he and his African employees discovered 13 mutilated corpses. When he reported the deaths to local authorities in the eastern town of Bakouma, David and 13 staff members were arrested and accused of mass murder. Corrupt officials had used him as a scapegoat, intending to force him to pay compensation to the dead men's families. The assassinations were almost certainly carried out by the rebel group the Lord's Resistance Army. For five months, David languished in a primitive rat-infested prison cell with 34 other men. He suffered three malaria attacks and was told he could be executed if found guilty of the murders. He received release papers last week, clearing him of all charges. Yesterday he shared a pint with his father at The Royal Oak Inn, the Simpsons' local pub in the village of Gillamoor on the Yorkshire moors. David, travel-weary and 'overwhelmed' by his welcome home, said: 'I need to spend some quiet time with my family now. They can't really believe I'm home. I feel so bad for them. Most of  the time they had no idea what would happen to me and when we talked on the phone I couldn't tell them the true hell of it. 'I didn't want them to know I was sick. I didn't want them to know I could be killed by firing squad.' Hellhole: David Simpson was held in dire conditions in a Central African Republic jail for five months . As general manager and safari pilot for Central Africa Wildlife Adventures, a Swedish-owned company, David intends to return to work in the inhospitable savannah and forests, some of the remotest on Earth, after a month's rest. 'I've made a life there,' he said. 'This year has been very bad for me but I feel I can cope with Africa and I feel I can do some good.' He has started setting up an organisation to provide anti-poaching patrols for the Central African Republic. His mother now wants to visit him in this unlikely environment. 'I'm planning to go right out to the wild places where he spends his days,' she said. 'You need to know where your kids are, don't you?'

One of the hostages rescued in a daring raid on a remote Afghan cave has spoken for the first time of the dramatic SAS rescue mission and their perilous dash to safety. Aid worker Moragwa Oirere and her British colleague Helen Johnston were thought to be hours away from execution when David Cameron ordered Special Forces to make the 1am swoop on their captors’ hideout. Now Miss Oirere has told of the ‘terrible’ firefight that left five of the kidnappers dead – and of how the fearless troops helped them scramble barefoot for miles over rocks and mountains in pitch darkness until they could be airlifted out of harm’s way. Miss Johnston, from Cambridge, and Miss Oirere, from Kenya, were on a mercy mission to bring health-care and medicine to mothers and babies in isolated communities . The 26-year-old described how the stillness of the night in the so-called ‘Valley of the Ants’ in the isolated province of Badakhshan, in north-eastern Afghanistan, was shattered by the surgical rescue operation . She said: ‘I didn’t even know what sounds I was hearing when the soldiers came. I was in a deep sleep and I’d never heard a gunshot or a bomb explosion in my life. I know now that the British troops were killing the kidnappers, a terrible sound. ‘Helen and I were groggy from sleep, but we were pulled out of the cave and found ourselves being rushed towards safety.’ But the flight out of the steep-sided valley to the waiting helicopter was not easy. ‘We had no shoes on so the soldiers had to carry us in their arms,’ Miss Oirere said. ‘It was a pitch-black night and very cold. We climbed up stony mountainsides and down through valleys. ‘The soldiers had already done the difficult journey to come and find us, and there was a terrible shoot-out with the kidnap gang. ‘But they talked to us, comforted us and carried us, all the way back to the helicopter. We thank them and we thank God for saving our lives.’ Last weekend’s joint British and American-led operation came after the two women and their two Afghan translators had spent 12 terrifying days in captivity, drinking water made from melted snow and living in constant fear for their lives. The heavily armed criminal gang, who demanded a £7 million ransom, had seized the group from the  charity Medair on May 22 as they were crossing the mountains on horseback. Miss Johnston, from Cambridge, and Miss Oirere, from Kenya . Their cameras, mobile phones, laptops and wallets were stolen and the group was taken at gunpoint to a cave. Shortly afterwards they were moved to another. ‘We stayed in the second cave for about a week,’ said Miss Oirere. ‘There were no comforts but the kidnappers needed to keep us alive. ‘We were given adequate food and there was water from melted snow. Helen and I comforted each other and that helped us both. After that we were moved to a third cave, and that was where we were rescued. ‘I’m still very shaken by what we went through. Twelve days seemed like a lifetime and there was no knowing when or if it would ever end.’ After their escape, the two women were flown to the Afghan capital Kabul for medical checks and a  military debriefing. Miss Johnston, from Cambridge, and Miss Oirere, from Kenya, were on a mercy mission to bring health-care and medicine to mothers and babies in isolated communities. Now safely back home with her family in Ngong, near Nairobi, Miss Oirere declared: ‘It’s not just a job to me, it’s a calling. I felt sure it was the right thing to do and I would probably do it again. But I need to spend time just getting back to  normal now. I know my parents and my brothers went through a lot, not knowing if I would survive this.’ She said she had never ridden a horse before but agreed to tackle the eight-hour journey because of her desire to help mothers in a region where maternal death rates are among the highest in the world. Special forces swooped in on the cave where Miss Johnston and Miss Oirere were being held captive in the isolated Badakhshan province and carried them to a helicopter to be airlifted out . Miss Oirere has been receiving counselling at her home, an imposing hilltop house where she lives with her two older brothers and her parents, Naftali, a doctor, and his teaching consultant wife Milcah. She said she hoped to enjoy a reunion with 28-year-old Miss Johnston – a nutrition expert who trained at the London School of Medicine and Tropical Hygiene – because their ordeal had brought them so close together. Miss Johnston, who has still to talk about her ordeal, was said by friends last night to be ‘resting’. Miss Oirere’s father told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It would be good for Moragwa to talk to Helen. The two girls hardly knew each other before but the dreadful circumstances of their kidnap have brought them close. I think they need each other.’ Dr Oirere added that he was monitoring his daughter’s health, saying: ‘She seems physically fine but we are concerned. It’s very early days and she often breaks down.’ He also said that the conditions in Afghanistan had taken his daughter by surprise. ‘She has been to some remote, arid areas but I don’t think she was prepared for the scale of that hard, barren landscape,’ he added. After the operation, David Cameron praised the rescue team, which also included members of the New Zealand SAS, American Rangers and Navy Seals, and Afghan special forces called the Tiger . Teams. He said: ‘We will never be able to publish their names but the whole country should know we have an extraordinary group of people who work for us who do amazingly brave things.’","Kidnapped Moragwa Oirere and her British colleague Helen Johnston did not know what was happening with Special Forces came to their rescue .

A Saudi celebrity cleric who allegedly raped and murdered his five-year-old daughter has claimed he injured her because he doubted she was a virgin. Lama al-Ghamdi died in October having suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, severe burns, broken ribs and fractured left arm as well as extensive bruising. Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitted using a cane and cables to inflict the horrific injuries after doubting his daughter’s virginity, according to the campaign group Women to Drive. After the case attracted international attention, members of the Saudi Arabia's Royal Family are now believed to have blocked al-Ghamdi's release and ensured that a stronger sentence is upheld. Killed: Lama al-Ghamdi died in October having suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, broken ribs and left arm as well as extensive bruising. Women to Drive said the preacher, a regular guest on Muslim . television networks, had his daughter checked up by a medic after doubting her virginity. It has been alleged that she was repeatedly raped and had been burned to cover up the injuries she had sustained from the horrific . sexual abuse. Yesterday Sayeda Hamadari, the girl’s . mother, who is divorced from the cleric, said she wanted her ex-husband . to be put to death, reported The Times. 'I want him killed. I want the full Islamic punishment. This is God’s law,' she said yesterday. Claims: . It has been alleged that she had also been repeatedly raped and that . the injuries she sustained from the sexual abuse had been burned . 'I am in constant pain when I think . of what he did to my daughter. I cannot bear to think of it. I have been . reading the Koran to seek some comfort. Only God knows what I am going . through.' She is divorced from al-Ghamdi who . remarried and has two more children, and claims the torture happened . whilst Lama was in her father’s care in March last year. It was previously reported that Fayhan al-Ghamdi had been . released after paying ‘blood money’ to  Lama’s mother. Albawaba News reported the judge as saying: 'Blood money and the time the defendant had served in prison since Lama's death suffices as punishment.' But the Saudi Justice Ministry . responded saying that the cleric was still in prison . and that the case was continuing. The death penalty is thought to be unlikely in this case. Lama’s stepmother is appearing as a witness to the murder at another hearing tomorrow according to Ms Hamadari. Torture: Saudi preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitting beating his daughter with a cable and is said to have been concerned about his five-year-old daughter's virginity . ‘My dear child is dead, and all I want . now is justice so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain,’ Sayeda Hamadari told CNN, adding that her daughter was ‘brutally . tortured in the most shocking ways.’ ‘The state needs to even consider taking his two children from him and his wife away because I fear for their lives,’ she added. 'These are not . some unfounded accusations, but everything is based on the medical . examination by the hospital and the team of physicians who treated Lama . when she was first admitted.' Randa . al-Kaleeb, a social worker from the hospital where Lama was admitted, . said the girl's back was broken and that she had been repeatedly raped and her injuries burned. Activists . say under Islamic laws a father cannot be executed for murdering his . children. Husbands can also not be executed for murdering their wives, . the group say. Three Saudi . activists, including Manal al-Sharif, who started the women's right to . drive campaign, have raised objections to the case as it highlights the . urgent need for legislation to protect women and children from domestic . abuse. Manal al-Sharif . has launched a campaign on Twitter using the hashtag 'Ana Lama', which . is translated as I am Lama, calling for an improvement on the judicial . treatment of women and children.

Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling 'to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter' The father of the South African model allegedly murdered by Oscar Pistorius spoke movingly yesterday of his family’s grief – and said he bore the athlete no animosity. In an emotional interview with The Mail on Sunday, Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling ‘to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter’. Pistorius broke down in tears in court when he was formally charged with Reeva Steenkamp’s premeditated murder and Mr Steenkamp said: ‘He must be going through things that we don’t know about. There is no hatred in our hearts.’ Ms Steenkamp, 29, had been dating the Olympic athlete, a double-amputee known as the Blade Runner, since November. She was shot dead in the early hours of Valentine’s Day at his gated mansion in Pretoria. It has been reported she was hit four times by bullets fired through the door of a bathroom. Pistorius, 26, a keen marksman, owned a pistol and machine gun. Sources told how he carried his dying girlfriend from the bathroom, her blood splattering the staircase, as he desperately tried to revive her. The pair had been called South Africa’s ‘golden couple’, and the arrest of Pistorius – who in London last year became the first man to compete at both an Olympics and Paralympics – was met with disbelief. Speaking for the first time since the death of his law graduate daughter, Mr Steenkamp, a horse trainer, wept as he said he and his wife June were at ‘a complete loss’. He said: ‘This is a very difficult time for us. June is inconsolable. We just need to find some answers. We ask the Lord every day to help us find a reason why this should happen to Reeva. She was the most beautiful, kind girl in the world. She had love for everyone, and she was loved by everyone who knew her.’ Mr Steenkamp said he had never met Pistorius but his wife occasionally spoke to him on the phone.On the day of the killing, Ms Steenkamp had been due to give a talk to high school pupils ‘to empower them to be confident’. Her father said: ‘That’s what she was like, always wanting to help others.’ Tragic: Mr Steenkamp, a horse trainer, wept as he said he and his wife June were at 'a complete loss' Blade Runner: Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics last year . Former girlfriends of the Paralympian have publicly suggested he has a dark side. One, 26-year-old student Samantha Taylor, said he is ‘certainly not what people think he is’. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Ms Taylor has been warned  to expect a subpoena, forcing her to give evidence at Pistorius’s trial. Ms Steenkamp appeared on a TV programme, Tropika Island of Treasure, in South Africa last night, which sees celebrities paired with contestants competing for a cash prize. Executive producer Samantha Moon claimed the programme had the backing of Reeva’s family. She said: ‘This is how they want to remember her.’ Reeva’s funeral will be on Tuesday, the same day Pistorius  is due in  court where it is understood lawyers will say the shooting was a tragic accident.","Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling ‘to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter’

Terry Blair’s mother was convicted of killing her drug-dealing boyfriend in 1989. One of his brothers was executed for another killing and a half brother was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and other charges. Last week a Jackson County jury found Diamond Blair guilty of murdering 22-year-old Montague Kevin Ashline on June 24, 2009. They also found him guilty of robbery and armed criminal action in Ashline's death  outside a Kansas City apartment complex. The Kansas City Star reports Diamond Blair is already serving 23 years in prison for other convictions.

Before turning 16 the newspaper reported that he was charged in four robberies, a kidnapping and weapons violations. A judge certified him to stand trial as an adult and sent him to jail. But his reign of terror continued behind bars and Diamond Blair and two others sodomized a 15-year-old boy. His family have committed a string of murders. Blair's uncle Terry Blair was described as being a cold, . calculating killer determined to kill as many women who worked as . prostitutes as he could during his trial. At the time of his September 2004 arrest, Terry Blair was on parole after . serving 21 years for the 1982 murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, . Angela Monroe, who was the mother of two of his children. Terry Blair's mother Janice Miller was charged with murder twice and convicted once for shooting and killing her drug-dealing boyfriend in 1989. She was sentenced to probation. The mother-of-ten raised her children in what Terry Blair later described to a parole officer as poverty. She went no further in school than ninth grade and suffered from mental illness, court records show. One of Terry Blair's brothers, Walter Blair Jr, was charged in a murder-for-hire scheme and was eventually executed. His half brother, Clifford Miller, was convicted in the 1992 abduction of a woman from a bar. He was sentenced to two life sentences plus 240 years for charges including kidnapping and forcible sodomy.","Diamond Blair's uncle is serial killer Terry Blair .

A Las Vegas assembly is set to decide whether a local politician is fit to serve after his third arrest in a month. Troubled Nevada Assemblyman Steven Brooks was arrested early Sunday in Las Vegas on suspicion of physically attacking a family member, then grabbing for an officer's weapon. The arrest came only days after the North Las Vegas Democrat embarked on a three-week leave following a string of bizarre events that began with his January 19 arrest for allegedly threatening Assembly Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick. Brooks, 40, was 'agitated' and refused to obey officers' orders when they arrived to find him outside a home after responding to a report of a domestic dispute, according to police. Brooks is accused of fighting and grabbing for an officer's weapon as they tried to arrest him shortly aftermidnight. Police spokesman Bill Cassell said the domestic dispute occurred inside the home, but he did not know the identity of the homeowner. No other details about the dispute were immediately available. Las Vegas police have a policy of not identifying the relationships of domestic dispute victims to suspects, Cassell said. Brooks was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on misdemeanours charges of domestic battery and obstructing a public officer. His bail was set at $4,000, and he awaits an initial court appearance Monday morning.

Brooks' attorney, Mitchell Posin, said he probably would talk to Brooks later Sunday. 'It would be premature for me to say anything until I hear what his side of the story is,' Posin said. The arrest came only days after the Assembly announced the unprecedented creation of a seven-member committee to investigate Brooks' behavior. Under the Nevada Constitution, lawmakers are given authority to judge the qualifications of their own members. Assembly Majority Leader William . Horne, D-Las Vegas, who will chair the bipartisan panel, said Sunday . that Brooks' arrests reflect ongoing concerns about his fitness to . serve. 'It's unfortunate . that these things are happening in Mr. Brooks' life, and I'm grateful no . one was injured,' he told The Associated Press. 'I'm . not a mental expert. But I would agree it has shown some signs that Mr. Brooks is dealing with problems that may distract from his ability to . do the service he was elected to do.'

The former American ambassador to Mali says France paid $17 million in ransoms to free French hostages and that the money ended up in the hands of the same al-Qaeda militants the country is fighting now. In an interview that aired Friday on iTele, Vicki Huddleston said the money allowed al-Qaeda's  North Africa branch to flourish in Mali. 'Two years ago, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) kidnapped a number of French citizens at a uranium mine in Niger,' she said. 'To get them freed, France paid a 17-million-dollar ransom.

NASA has released an astonishing image of what they believe is the youngest black hole in the Milky Way galaxy and, in space terms at least, it's just around the corner. Information from the agency's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, a telescope that observes the cosmos from an orbit 139,000 kilometres above the Earth, suggests that the supernova remnant's oddly-shaped clouds of glowing gas may contain a young black hole. The remnant, called W49B, is about 1,000 years old. That is equivalent to a blink of an eye in a universe believed to be nearly 14 billion years old. Our own sun has clocked up 4.5billion years. Music of the spheres: A highly distorted supernova remnant that, according to NASA, may contain the most recent black hole formed in the Milky Way galaxy. The remnant, called W49B, is about a thousand years old, as seen from Earth, and is at a distance of about 26,000 light years away . A black hole is a region of space-time where gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. It is called 'black' because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. It's also just 26,000 light years away and was created in a very rare way, reports the Los Angeles Times. 'It appears its parent star ended its life in a way that most others don’t,' said Laura Lopez, who led the study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NASA said the supernova explosion that occurred when this star ran out of fuel was 'peculiar'. The star exploded with 'jets shooting away from the star’s poles' — making the supernova elongated and elliptical. Usually, the explosions tend to be symmetrical. Supernova explosions occur when massive stars run out of fuel, but NASA notes such blasts are not well understood. Another surprising element is that there was no neutron star. Normally, the collapse of some massive stars leaves a dense, spinning core, but not this one. Megan Watzke, press officer at NASA’s Chandra X-Ray Observatory, said it’s that lack of evidence that points to the existence of a black hole. 'In this case… the lack of pulsations from the other possible explanation (a rapidly rotating dense star called a neutron star) add to the evidence that a black hole is there,' Watzke said. 'In other situations, however, astronomers can detect the black hole’s presence by its influence on the material around it.' The possible black hole and the reason behind it remain something of a mystery. As Lopez says in a blog post, these 'exotic explosions can happen within our own galaxy, and further study… will give great insights into how these awesome events come about'. NASA launched the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 1999. The findings about W49B will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal.","W49B is just 1,000 years old, a split second in a universe that is estimated to be 14 billion years old .

He added: 'We have had confirmation this morning that the parents of the six children will not be attending the funeral which will take place at St Mary’s Catholic Church at 11am on June 22. 'The family have chosen that church as a venue because they are Catholic children and they wanted a full requiem mass in a Catholic church.' The couple originally wanted to hold the funeral at Derby Cathedral because of the . amount of people it was thought would want to attend.

'It is a unique situation and we cannot think, right now, of . any other defendants in the past who have been charged with murdering . their children, then wanting to attend their funerals.That is why it . poses such a huge risk.' The spokesperson said that public protection was key and if the risk is too high a private memorial may be arranged. Respect: Well-wishers have left hundreds of cards, flowers, teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil . The People reported Mr Philpott's son . Richard, 25, told a friend: 'They want to be at the funerals and need . to be able to say goodbye. Whatever has happened, they are innocent . until proven guilty. The public should not judge them.

The costs of the funeral service will . be met by DJ’s Trust - the D standing for Duwayne and the J for the five . other children - which was set up following the blaze.

Earlier this month Mairead Philpott wore a white sleeveless dress to court showing her tattoo that bears her dead children's names . 'In terms of money, I think we have hit what we need to hit to cover the funeral costs.' The news comes after the coroner’s office in Derby released the bodies from the mortuary at the Royal Derby Hospital on Tuesday. The six children were asleep upstairs when the fire broke out at the semi-detached house in Victory Road in the early hours of May 11. Derbyshire Police have confirmed that petrol was used to start the blaze. Smoke from the fire travelled upstairs to where the children were in bed. All six died as a result of smoke inhalation, the force has said. An inquest into their deaths was opened and adjourned at Derby Coroner’s Court last month by Coroner Dr Robert Hunter. The hearing was told that John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Jade were all certified dead at the accident and emergency department of the Royal Derby Hospital. Duwayne died of his injuries in Birmingham Children’s Hospital two days later. No causes of death were given during the inquest. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill is leading the murder investigation. He said: 'Our police investigations are ongoing and we are preparing a file for the Crown Prosecution Service.' The Prison Service has not confirmed if the Philpotts applied for leave, but said a risk assessment would be carried out as is standard practice if an application has been made. A spokeswoman said: 'We do not comment on the movements of individual prisoners. 'Prisoners can apply for escorted visits to attend the funeral of a close relative, but it will always be subject to a strict risk assessment where public protection is key.'

Agony: Frances Andrade was traumatised by the trial of her former tormentor Michael Brewer and killed herself. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Coopers says she was 'let down' by the criminal justice system . The Home Secretary will look for lessons in the handling of a sexual abuse case after a witness committed suicide but warned police forces must have operational independence. Theresa May was pressed in the Commons on the case of Frances Andrade, who killed herself after undergoing cross examination on evidence against her former music teacher Michael Brewer. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper urged Mrs May to hold a formal review into the case and said she was 'let down by the criminal justice system whose job it was to help and protect her'. She compared the approach of Greater Manchester Police in offering counselling and Surrey Police not doing so. Ms Cooper said: 'The Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner has said in the last couple of days, ""it's the responsibility of the police to present evidence to the court with the victim in a way which is untainted"". 'That means they will not and should not refer a victim for counselling until after they have given their evidence. 'Do you agree this approach by Surrey Police is completely unacceptable, goes against national guidance, and that victims of sexual abuse should never be denied the support and counselling they need? 'Will you tell all police forces they need to make sure counselling is available? 'And will you ensure a proper review takes place into the handling of this entire case so lessons can be learned from this dreadful tragedy?' Mrs May replied: 'This was a terrible case when you look at the details of this and we all have sympathy with the family and what they have gone through. 'Obviously this whole question of how the police deal with rape cases is one that is being looked at and we have been trying to improve the police handling of this under both governments, over a number of years. Guilty: Michael Brewer was found guilty of indecently assaulting Frances after she won a place the music school where he was choirmaster . 'We all recognise that one of the issues here is the difficulty victims feel in coming forward and sadly when we see incidents such as has happened in this case, I fear others may be put off from coming forward rather than encouraged from coming forward. 'I think we do need to look very carefully at what has happened at what has happened in this case and very carefully at how we can further improve the system to ensure victims feel they will be believed when they come forward and they can have the confidence of taking their case through the courts.' Answering a follow up question, Mrs May added: 'We will look to see what lessons should be learnt from this particular case but you will be aware the Home Secretary does not instruct police forces to take particular routes - they do have operational independence and decisions as to how they deal with particular cases.'","Theresa May described the case of the mother-of-four as 'terrible'

Chilling photos have emerged of the bathroom where Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend lay dying after he gunned her down through the door. The luxurious stone-clad en-suite is now the focus of a murder inquiry as investigators try to piece together what happened in the toilet cubicle where Reeva Steenkamp spent her last moments. Prosecutors argue the model was trapped in there hiding from Pistorius, while he claims his girlfriend was using the bathroom after getting up in the night at his upscale Pretoria home.

Hidden: Prosecutors believe that Pistorius stood near the large corner bath and took aim at the cubicle door (seen on the right) which Miss Steenkamp was hiding behind .

'If I arm myself, walk a distance and murder a person, that is premeditated,' he said. 'The door is closed. There is no doubt. I walk seven metres and I kill.' The motive is 'I want to kill'. That's it,' he added. 'This deceased was in a 1.4 by 1.14 metre little room. She could go nowhere.' Mr Nel said the killing was premeditated because Pistorius had planned to say that he thought he was shooting an intruder. 'It was all part of the pre-planning. Why would a burglar lock himself inside the bathroom?' Mr Nel said. 'She locked that door for a purpose. We'll get to that purpose. That is where she was when those shots were fired. She couldn't go anywhere. It must have been horrific.' But Pistorius's lawyer, Barry Roux, said Miss Steenkamp was not murdered, and there were a number of cases where men shot members of their own family through doors after mistaking them for burglars. He also suggested that Pistorius broke down the bathroom door after the shooting to help his girlfriend. 'We submit it is not even murder,' Mr Roux said. 'There is no concession this is a murder.' In a sworn affidavit, the 26-year-old, who broke down in tears on several occasions, said the pair were in bed together when he woke up and went onto a balcony to bring a fan inside. Grisly: After the shooting at his luxury home Pistorius said he 'called paramedics and complex security. I tried to carry her downstairs for help. I tried to help her but she died in my arms' On his return to the bedroom he said he heard a noise and thought an intruder had broken in through his bathroom window. Pistorius claimed he was too scared to switch a light on, so he grabbed his 9mm pistol - which he kept under his bed after receiving death threats - and walked towards the bathroom, which contains a toilet with a separate door. 'On my way to the bathroom I screamed words to the effect for him/them to get out of my house and for Reeva to phone the police. It was pitch dark in the bedroom and I thought Reeva was in bed,' he said. Defence: Today Pistorius's lawyer said there were a number of cases where men shot members of their own family through doors after mistaking them for burglars . 'I believed that when the intruder/s came out of the toilet we would be in grave danger. I felt trapped as my bedroom door was locked and I have limited mobility on my stumps. 'I fired shots at the toilet door and shouted to Reeva to phone the police. She did not respond and I moved backwards out of the bathroom, keeping my eyes on the bathroom entrance. Everything was pitch dark in the bedroom and I was still too scared to switch on a light. Reeva was not responding. 'When I reached the bed, I realised that Reeva was not in bed. That is when it dawned on me that it could have been Reeva who was in the toilet. I returned to the bathroom calling her name. I tried to open the toilet door but it was locked. I rushed back into the bedroom and opened the sliding door exiting onto the balcony and screamed for help.' According to Pistorius he then smashed his way into the toilet using a cricket bat, finding her 'slumped over but alive'. Answers: Miss Steenkamp's funeral was held today. Her family have demanded to know why their 'beautiful angel' was blasted to death with his 9mm gun and have begged the sprinter to 'tell the truth' about the shooting . He then phoned for an ambulance and carried her downstairs, but she died in his arms. The defendant said he was 'absolutely mortified' by what had happened, but insisted the evidence would prove his innocence. Although no decision was made on bail today, Mr Nair did rule that the charge would be premeditated murder indicating Pistorius, who last year became the first double-amputee track athlete to run at the Olympics, is likely to remain behind bars until trial. He has now been driven back to jail where he will spend a sixth night behind bars before the hearing resumes in the morning. As Pistorius's relatives supported him in court, the distraught family of Miss Steenkamp attended her funeral in Port Elizabeth. Her brother Adam said that her death had 'left space missing inside all of the people that she knew.' But there was also anger. Gavin Venter, an ex-jockey who worked for Reeva's father, called for the harshest of sentences for Pistorius. 'Without a doubt. He must stay in jail,' he said.","Luxurious stone-clad en-suite is now the focus of a murder inquiry .

Lung cancer survival rates in the UK lag behind five other developed countries, researchers have found. One-year survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer - the most common form of the disease - are not as good as those in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, according to a study published in the journal Thorax. Survival rates for one year ranged from 30% in the UK to 46% in Sweden. Australia and Canada reported one-year survival rates of 42%, while Denmark had 34% and Norway had 39%. The study, conducted by the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, examined data concerning 57,000 lung cancer patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2007. It examined survival rates and what stage of cancer the patients were at when they were diagnosed. In Denmark and the UK only one in seven patients with non-small cell lung cancer were diagnosed at the earliest stage of disease, compared with one in five in Sweden and Canada. One-year survival for patients with the earliest stage disease in the UK was 72.5% - 16% lower than in Sweden. Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said: 'This research should remind us that while great progress is being made in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the UK, we mustn’t be complacent. 'Around 35,000 people still die from lung cancer each year in the UK and that’s far too many. We would like to see ongoing improvements in data collection and the use of uniform systems for data on stage, in order to improve the accuracy of global comparisons.'

Internet shopping giant Amazon fired a company that allegedly employed security staff with neo-Nazi links to intimidate its foreign workers. HESS security was linked to the country's far-right by an investigation made by German television documentary makers . Amazon came under fire for using the firm after German film makers filmed black-clad guards with military haircuts, who are employed to keep Amazon’s over 5,000 foreign employees in check. The film, broadcast on Germany’s ARD television channel, investigated the treatment of workers brought in as temporary staff at the company’s centres in Bad Hersfeld, Konstanz and Augsburg and unveiled a culture of threats and bullying. Backlash: Amazon was criticised for using HESS security, whose staff 'threatened' foreign workers dressed in 'neo-Nazi uniform', a documentary claims . The world's biggest online retailer said the security service in question would no longer be used by the company, 'effective immediately', according to CNN. 'As a responsible employer of approximately 8,000 salaried logistics employees, Amazon has zero-tolerance for discrimination and intimidation and expects the same from every company we work with,' the company said. The temporary staff come from across Europe for seasonal work at packing and distribution centres and stay in budget hotels and youth hostels where the HESS Security guards patrol. The boot-wearing guards dress in uniforms from designer brand Thor Steinar, a label which carries strong neo-Nazi connotations, . The brand has been banned by both the German parliament and the Bundesliga football association and Amazon themselves stopped selling it in 2009 due to its symbolic far-right message. The ARD documentary show the security guards searching bedrooms and kitchen at the foreign workers’ accommodation, allegedly frisking them for bread rolls when they leave breakfast in the morning. ‘They tell us they are the police here,’ a Spanish woman said. Hensel European Security denied any connection with far-right radicalism and pointed out it has a  high proportion of immigrant workers of various religions. Accused: Amazon allegedly employ the guards to patrol the hostels and budget hotels where their foreign workers stay near Bad Hersfeld, Germany . The documentary makers went undercover at one of the budget hotels used by Amazon for their staff and witnessed the brutal ways of HESS Security first hand. ARD made further accusations against HESS Security, claiming its name is a reference to prolific Nazi Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, alleging that its director is associated with convicted neo-Nazis and football hooligans. Due to their temporary status, workers can be fired at will and many are paid less than they were promised. Amazon has faced a number of accusations about conditions at its warehouses in both the U.S. and Europe. A Financial Times report into an Amazon warehouse in the UK found workers often had to walk between seven and 15 miles each day.","Amazon fires HESS Security after TV documentary claims .

Luxury lifestyle: William and Mary (or Breda) Connors, pictured in Dubai, lived the high life while forcing vulnerable people to obey their every command . A family of travellers jailed for forcing vulnerable men to work for a pittance were handed nearly £500,000 in legal aid. They were given the huge amount from taxpayers despite having assets worth millions and more than £500,000 in bank accounts seized by police. The Gloucestershire-based Connors family lived the high life at the expense of enslaved homeless drug addicts and alcoholics kept in squalid conditions. William Connors, 52, wife Mary, 48, their sons, John, 29, and James, 20, and son-in-law Miles Connors, 24, were jailed in December last year after being convicted of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. The profits funded a luxury cruise around the Caribbean and exotic holidays to Tenerife and Cancun in Mexico. As well as holidays, they drove around in top-of-the-range cars, including a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a Rolls-Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick-up, a Ford Ranger and a Mercedes van, and had built up a mounting property portfolio potentially now worth millions of pounds. Several houses - including one with a hot tub and accompanying flat screen television - were registered in the names of other relatives. The family bought two caravan parks in Gloucestershire for £545,000 more than a decade ago and had more than £500,000 in bank accounts seized by the police. And despite their apparent wealth, the Connors were still able to claim legal aid. The Legal Services Commission, the quango that oversees legal aid, paid a total of £461,363.68 for lawyers to defend the family during proceedings at Bristol Crown Court. The large bill was run up during lengthy legal proceedings, which included a three-month trial.Each of the Connors was defended by a QC, a senior barrister, who was assisted by junior counsel. The startling figures were revealed following a Freedom of Information request from the Press Association. A Legal Services Commission spokesman . said: 'We manage costs carefully and legal aid rates are considerably . less than those paid to lawyers in privately funded cases. 'Trials can cost a lot of money if they last many weeks, are very complex and have thousands of pages of evidence. 'The law says that anyone facing a Crown Court trial for a serious . criminal offence can apply for legal aid to ensure they have a lawyer, . but funding is subject to a means test which could require them to pay . towards their defence.' The Legal Services Commission could claw back the money if it is found the Connors have assets of over £30,000. Police raid: Bizarrely, the Connors kept money in a toilet at one of their caravans . Jailed: John Connors (left) was sentenced to a six-and-a-half year . sentence, while his son-in-law Miles Connors (right) was handed a . three-year term . Sentences: Brothers John (left) and James (right), sons of John Connors, . were given a four-year term and a three-year term in a young offenders' institute respectively . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, criticised the availability of legal aid to the wealthy. 'Handing wealthy criminals huge sums of taxpayers' money is yet another . example of why our legal aid system is in dire need of reform,' he said. 'Legal aid is important in ensuring access to justice but it must also be sustainable to taxpayers. 'It's incredible that this gang were able to claim so much in the first . place, but now that they have been found guilty, taxpayers have every . right to expect their money to be reclaimed at the very least.' 'Legal aid is important in ensuring access to justice but it must also be sustainable to taxpayers. 'Now that they have been found guilty, taxpayers have every . right to expect their money to be reclaimed at the very least.' - Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayer's Alliance . The Connors's enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in . Staverton in Gloucestershire, Enderby in Leicestershire and Mansfield in . Nottinghamshire in March 2011 following a lengthy surveillance . operation. In December William Connors was jailed for six-and-a-half years and his . wife Mary received a sentence of two years and three months. John Connors was jailed for four years and his brother James got three years' detention in a young offender institution. Son-in-law Miles Connors received a three-year prison sentence. This week Appeal Court judges reserved judgment on an application to . increase the 'unduly lenient' sentences passed on the family. A hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act is expected to take place . later this year when prosecutors will seek to seize the Connors's . assets. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said that legal aid is not a 'limitless' pot, but has a 'vital place' in the justice system. He said: 'I have been very open about my concern over the extortionate amounts spent in some High Cost Cases and instances where it has looked like people have taken the system for a ride, and clearly stated this is something I intend to address.' Luxury cars: The family had a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a Rolls Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick up, a Ford Ranger and a Mercedes van .

The New York resident, now 32, is being tipped to follow in the footsteps of both her mother and  former-president father and play an increasingly prominent role in public life. Hillary will step down from the helm at the State Department early in the New Year to be replaced by Sen. John Kerry - and will take a long break before her rumoured run for the White House. Now experts quoted in Politico.com are saying Chelsea is ready to take her place as the 'young Clinton' to pave the way for Hillary's Democratic presidential bid. Family ties: Chelsea Clinton looks set to become the new public face of her family's political dynasty as her mother Hillary steps down from the helm at the State Department . As a young girl growing up in the White . House, Chelsea was the subject of massive public fascination, although . her parents are credited with succeeding in protecting her from much of . the media frenzy. And it seems she has not been put off a political career - she joined the board of the Clinton Foundation a few years ago and in July, accompanied her father to Africa on a foundation mission. In 2011 she made what was effectively her first step major in politics on her own, volunteering in campaign to pass New York's gay marriage law. Public life: Chelsea Clinton speaks at the '12-12-12' concert for victims of Hurricane Sandy earlier this month . It is rumoured that she managed to convince her father to change his views on the issue. She is now involved in both the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Health Access Initiative and was also seen interviewing her mother at a Clinton Global Initiative event last year. Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a staunch Hillary Clinton backer in her 2008 primary campaign, believes Chelsea could soon be securing the Clinton political legacy for many years to come. He told Politico.com: 'I think she could be a powerhouse. 'She has just, in my judgment, grown up into a person of considerable skill and competence. 'I don’t know if she has a personal goal in elected politics or not, or exactly what her life goals may be, but she certainly has a lot of rich personal experience as a result of [her upbringing].' While a Chelsea candidacy still appears a long way off - she was still only a teenager when her mother first ran for the Senate in New York in 2000 - she has gradually become a confident public speaker. Brian Ellner, an activist who organized the New York marriage campaign told Politico: 'Chelsea Clinton speaks for her generation of young Americans who support marriage equality by wide margins, no matter what race or gender or even party. 'She has enormous credibility on the issue dating back to her work on the New York campaign.' In a recent interview with Vogue Magazine Chelsea gave a rare insight into what it was like growing up in the White House. Chelsea is now on the board of the Clinton Foundation and in July she accompanied her father to Africa on a foundation mission . She revealed:  “I was very aware of why we were there and that I was living among history. 'One of the things that my parents did a good job of was talking with me about their work. 'So at the end of the day, over dinner, I would tell them what I learned in biology class and my mother would tell me about advocating for women’s health around the world, and my dad would talk about the budget fight or what was happening in advance of a trip he was planning to Russia. 'I knew that we were having a different type of conversation than most of my friends, but there were normal rhythms that we started in Arkansas that very much carried through.'

A four-year-old girl has died from suspected meningitis after being sent home by a hospital children’s ward. Now an investigation is under way to discover why Morgan Phelan was discharged when she had a high temperature and was suffering from a rash all over her body. Gemma Phelan’s daughter, Morgan, was seen in A&E at Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope Hospital in the West Midlands shortly after 7pm on Thursday, January 17 and admitted at 11.30pm. But she was discharged just over an hour later at 12.47am the following day, diagnosed with a viral infection. Four-year-old Morgan Phelan died from suspected meningitis after being sent home from Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope Hospital. An investigation is now underway . The four-year-old, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, remained poorly on Friday but went downhill again on Saturday afternoon before being rushed by ambulance to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where she was declared dead around 5pm. Now Good Hope Hospital is conducting an inquiry into her treatment. Her distraught mother said Morgan had been suffering from a high temperature and had a rash all over her body, but she had been reassured that all she had was a minor infection. Mrs Phelan reacted with anger when she discovered that the children’s ward, Harvey Ward, at Good Hope had since been closed due to a 'lack of appropriately qualified staff'. She fears that had it been closed earlier Morgan may still be alive today. 'I believe she was discharged because they didn’t have enough staff to look after her,' Mrs Phelan said. 'The last time I saw my little girl as normal was on Thursday morning when I took her to school. 'When she came home from school I knew she wasn’t very well and at 6.30pm I rang the ambulance. 'At 7.20pm she was seen by the nurses and she was admitted to the ward at 11.38pm but just over an hour later she was examined and discharged as we were told she was “fine to go home”. 'It was snowy and she had nothing on her feet. 'I was told she had an infection and there was nothing more wrong with her breathing but she was covered in a red rash. The four-year-old, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, went downhill after she was discharged and rushed by ambulance to Birmingham Children's Hospital, where she was declared dead around 5pm . 'On Friday she was not eating or drinking but we were told unless her temperature came back there was nothing to worry about. To me it didn’t look right.' Although she briefly appeared to rally on Saturday she then went downhill rapidly. She died later that afternoon. 'I kept checking her temperature and encouraging her to come downstairs,' said Mrs Phelan, who has another child, two-year-old Kian, with husband Ryan. 'On Saturday she seemed a bit better and she had a couple of sips of pop. I bought her sweets from the shop and went to make her stew but when I went back and saw her, her eyes were like glass. 'I called an ambulance and when they came they put her on the floor. I was told to sort out an overnight bag. On the heartbeat machine she was flatlining at first but then it picked up her heartbeat. 'They took her to the Children’s Hospital but she was declared dead at 5.10pm. 'When I read the Harvey Ward has been closed that sent me so angry and I started shaking. The hospital said it would only affect one or two children but how many has it affected? 'Had the Harvey Ward shut before or had they not discharged her at 1am she might still be here. I believe had they given her penicillin she would be alive today. 'When I read the Harvey Ward has been . closed that sent me so angry and I started shaking. 'The hospital said . it would only affect one or two children but how many has it affected?' - Morgan's mother Gemma Phelan . 'I have been told there will be an inquest in six months and we may find out more in three months.' Mrs Phelan also received a letter from the hospital which referred to Morgan as a boy and “he”, which upset her further. Sue Moore, managing director for Good Hope Hospital, said: 'This is a tragic case and we would like to send our sincerest condolences to the family of Morgan Phelan during this very difficult time.' We take the care and safety of all of our patients very seriously and we are currently undertaking an investigation into Morgan’s sad death which will be shared with the family. 'Unfortunately, due to patient confidentiality, we cannot comment on any individual patient’s treatment. 'We have arranged to meet with the family so we can discuss and address their concerns fully. 'Our decision to close Harvey ward has been taken following the advice of clinicians and is in response to ensuring safe staffing levels within specialist paediatric nursing.'

A Turner Prize judge killed himself in a colleague's garden while dressed in a dinner suit, his inquest heard today. Michael Stanley, 37, hanged himself after struggling with 'relationship and work issues', Oxfordshire Coroner's Court heard. The married father-of-three, who was director of the gallery Modern Art Oxford, suffered from depression and took his own life in the early hours of Friday September 21 last year, coroner Darren Salter ruled today. Mr Stanley, described in the proceedings as a workaholic, was discovered in the garden of colleague Verity Slater shortly after midday on the Friday. Michael Stanley, the Turner Prize judge who killed himself. The father-of-three had suffered from depression for years . His death was reported by neighbours. In a statement read to the inquest Ms Slater, a gallery arts manager, said she agreed to let Mr Stanley feed her cat and look after her house in Jericho, Oxford, while she was on holiday as he needed 'a little bit of head space'. Ms Slater said when she gave him her keys he 'seemed normal, a little tired but there was nothing unusual about his manner'. She added: 'He was a private person. He didn't share details about his private life. He liked to keep work and his personal life apart.' Rigor mortis had set in by the time police community support officers arrived so they did not attempt to resuscitate him. PCSO Thomas Baker said: 'He was wearing a dinner suit with a black satin stripe down the side.' Mr Stanley's widow, Carrie, whom he had been with for 20 years, said he told her he 'needed some space away and moved to Verity's house and I was supportive of this because I wanted him to get better'. She added: 'He would come back to put the children to bed at times.' Mrs Stanley, who did not attend the inquest, made a statement after his death saying he had suffered from depression for the last couple of years. She said it was a 'huge decision' for him to get medical advice and see a psychotherapist following a breakdown in March 2011. In May that year he was urgently referred to a community mental health team. He was assessed as depressed and suicidal but could keep himself safe by taking anti-depressants and keeping follow-up appointments, it was decided. Mr Stanley, of Witney in Oxford, also saw a private counsellor but Catherine Sage, NHS community mental health team manager, said a member of her team saw him in May and June 2011 when he was in 'low mood and distressed because of relationship and work issues'. She said he was 'unforthcoming at times and reluctant to explore in greater detail the issues he presented'. A picture from the Jenny Saville Exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, where Mr Stanley was director . He was eventually discharged from the community team after missing some appointments and appearing 'ambivalent about engaging and addressing his problems', Ms Sage said. After returning from a Spanish holiday 'it was as if his mind was in a different place,' Mr Stanley's widow said. 'He told me he had felt suicidal for three days and it was at this point he started medication,' Mrs Stanley said. The widow added: 'I am totally devastated and did not think he would have taken his life.' The couple spoke on the phone the day before he died but the contents were not disclosed to the inquest. Post-mortem examination tests showed Mr Stanley was about 1.5 times the legal drink driving limit. His private counsellor Dolores O'Malley, whom he saw weekly, between June and September last year, said she did not believe him to be 'imminently suicidal', a view backed up by his GP, Dr Vicky Stansfield. Addressing Mr Stanley's parents Eric and Janet and his sisters Carla and Alice, the coroner paid tribute to Mr Stanley's work ethic. He said: 'Michael was clearly a hardworking man and did what he could to carry on without it becoming apparent to others or impacting on others.'","Michael Stanley, an art gallery director, was discovered by neighbours .

Princess Basmah Bint Saud says she is the victim of an attempted blackmail attempt over a video showing her smoking and with her head uncovered. She has gone public rather than pay the £320,000 . A Saudi Arabian princess is the victim of a blackmail attempt involving a video of her that could anger and shock the establishment in the hardline Islamic state. Princess Basmah bint Saud bin Abdulaziz al Saud - more commonly known as Princess Basmah - is being held to ransom by a man who plans to embarrass her with a video - if she does not pay him £320,000. The video shows her blowing a kiss and smoking with her head uncovered - taboos in strict Saudi Arabia . But rather than bow to the demands of the man, London-based Princess Basmah, who campaigns for human rights in the kingdom, has exposed the extortion attempt on her website and through social media channels. The plot began while Princess Basmah was on holiday at Christmas at The Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, according to The Daily Telegraph. She received a message on Facebook from a man claiming to be a friend, who she refuses to name but described as a sheikh in his 30s from the United Arab Emirates. She later discovered the account had been hacked by her blackmailer. She said: 'He sent me a message saying how fascinated he is by my work, how he admired my writings and how I was a hero of the Arab world.' She continued corresponding and then had a long video conversation via the internet just after Christmas. 'He was a young man. He started getting emotional, saying he would be coming to see me and that I had to see him. He said he was very attracted to me and I started to become suspicious.' She felt the man, who resembled the sheikh, was trying to entrap her into saying potentially embarrassing things of a sexual nature and confronted him. She was stunned when he admitted his deception and the fact he was a blackmailer. 'I felt like I was physically beaten up. I felt bruised psychologically and mentally.' The video shows the 48-year-old mother of five blowing a kiss to the camera and smoking a cigarette while her long brown hair is uncovered. Princess Basmah's Facebook page, where the blackmailer initially made contact . Her blackmailer has demanded money not to publish the contents of conversations the princess was tricked into having, as well as videos and photographs. Princess Basmah says the video was stolen from her laptop and has no sound but shows her talking to her son by Skype. She believes the blackmail attempt is part of a wider conspiracy to discredit both herself and the Saudi Royal Family. She is also convinced the blackmailer has connections to an anonymous Twitter user called Mujtahidd, who has published intimate details of other members of the Saudi ruling family. A statement on her website said: 'In light of recent events surrounding HRH Princess Basmah bint Saud, Her Royal Highness wishes to send a message to her detractors that she is here to stay. King Saud of Saudi Arabia (right) and Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India in 1955. He had 115 children and the youngest is Princess Basmah . 'This is a message I want everyone to hear. I want to state clearly that I am a humanitarian not an activist. I do not follow any agendas, only that of humanity, not only in Saudi Arabia, but all over the world. 'I have recently been threatened and blackmailed by a large organisation which has wielded its power to try and destroy my reputation. 'I have recorded these attempts and therefore have evidence which I will publish via social media exposing the attempts to quiet my voice.' The first three recorded conversations with the attempted blackmailer are published on her Arabic website. Princess Basmah is the the granddaughter of Saudi Arabia's first king and founder of the modern state, King Abdulaziz, and the 115th daughter of his son King Saud, who reigned from 1953 to 1964. She describes herself on her website as 'a tireless advocate of peaceful but essential reform in the Kingdom and elsewhere'.","Princess Basmah went public after the man demanded money .

A 41-year-old man was detained in west Belfast yesterday. Two others, aged 25 and 34, were arrested in Belfast on Monday and are still in police custody. Scroll down for video . Assassination attempt: Police evacuated residents and closed Upper Newtownards Road whilst army technical experts dealt with a 'viable bomb' found under the police officer's car outside his home . Dismantling: It is believe the policeman discovered the viable bomb himself around 2pm on Sunday afternoon after which security forces were called . The Police Service of Northern Ireland . constable was preparing to take his wife and two children out for . Sunday lunch when he discovered a viable bomb under his car at his home . in east Belfast. Senior officers have said the attack could have killed the policeman and his family. Police are on high alert after . dissident republicans attempted to murder the officer with a car bomb . and a second explosive device was discovered near a police station. Moving in: After police evacuate the street, an army bomb disposal expert prepares to examine the bomb on Newtownards Road in east Belfast . Breathing out: The bomb expert examines and secures the booby trap bomb found underneath the car . The under-car device was a tactic frequently used by the Provisonal IRA. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton said the officer's vigilance saved lives. ""If that officer had not checked under his car, we would have been looking at a murder or multiple murders,"" Mr Hamilton said. Dissident republicans are being blamed for the attack. Investigaiton: Armagh Road in Tandragee was sealed off following the discovery of a suspect device close to the local police station . In a separate incident, a pipe bomb . was found close to the gates of a police station in the town of . Tandragee in Mid-Ulster, near the homes of elderly residents. The booby-trap device in Belfast was defused in a controlled explosion by the army. It was recovered from under the . officer's car partially intact and police hope forensic tests on the . remains could identify those who made and planted it. Mr Hamilton said he was linking the attack to 'anti-peace' dissident republicans, who have already murdered two police officers. 'We are hopeful that it will provide useful evidence,' he said. 'The fact that it was discovered and it didn't ignite means that we obviously have a starting point forensically.' Stormont’s Justice Minister David . Ford, who condemned those responsible, said: 'Fortunately, due to the . officer’s commendable vigilance, the attempt on his life was not . successful. 'Let us be clear. This was an attack . not only on a police officer and his family but on our whole community. The officer was serving the community; he was working for all of us. 'The people responsible for this and . other recent attacks have no mandate and speak for no-one. They need to . recognise the futility of their campaign and respect the wishes of the . vast majority of our community who want an end to all violent acts.' Police have been warning for months that republican militants remain determined to kill members of the security forces. On November 1, prison officer David . Black was shot dead as he drove along the M1 motorway on his work to . work at the high-security Maghaberry prison in Co Antrim, which houses . dissident inmates. A group styling itself the 'new IRA' claimed that attack. Army technical officers examined the object close to the gates of the town's Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) station, a short distance south of Portadown . Elderly residents were evacuated from their nearby homes but have been allowed to return as the security alert has ended . Northern . Irish dissidents have repeatedly targeted security force members in . recent years in a bid to destabilise the peace process. In November long-serving prison officer David Black, 52, was shot dead in a motorway ambush in Co Armagh as he drove to work. The attack was claimed by a group styling itself the 'new IRA' which was formed in the summer when a number . of splinter groups joined forces. In April 2011 newly qualified police . officer Ronan Kerr (top right), 25, died when a booby trap car bomb . exploded under his vehicle at his home in Omagh. The faction was formed in the summer when several . splinter groups joined forces. Less than two weeks later, an . under-car booby-trap bomb was found lying on a road in west Belfast. It . is believed to have fallen from a soldier's car. In recent months police in Belfast and . Londonderry have recovered horizontal mortars capable of piercing the . armour of police vehicles and causing multiple fatalities. During the past year, police have . arrested 115 people suspected of dissident republican activity, and 35 . have been charged. Sixty-four officers have been forced to leave their . homes during the past five years because of intelligence that they were . being targeted for potential attack.

A shop worker today told how she was left feeling like a sucker after 'lending' her Henry Hoover to a thief who has duped 16 businesses out of the smiley-faced appliances. Jenn Hall, 53, thought she was being helpful when she gave her company's vacuum cleaner to a man who claimed his had broken while cleaning at a nearby business. But she learned she had been the victim of a serial trickster when she went to collect it - and was told the company did not know the man. Police are now investigating the theft of 16 Henry Hoovers from businesses in Brighton, East Sussex, and nearby Worthing. A thief has duped up to 16 businesses in the South-East out of their Henry Hoovers. Picture posed by model . The offences date from November 22 last year to February 7 this year, and they are worth around £100 each. Mrs Hall, assistant manager of Simplicare, a company that sell disability equipment in Brighton, said: 'He came in saying he was from a business down the road. 'He asked if he could borrow our vacuum cleaner for ten minutes because his had broken. 'We are a friendly bunch on this estate and often lend things to each other, so I thought nothing of it. I actually thought I was being helpful. 'He name-dropped a few people who he apparently worked with and I believed his story. 'He was very convincing and took me in. See ya, sucker: The thief spins a sob story about how his own hoover has broken and he desperately needs to clean, duping kind-hearted workers . 'About half an hour later, when he failed to return, I went down the road to collect it and was told they had never heard of the guy. 'They also told me they had heard about other businesses that had been targeted by the Henry Hoover thief. It seems he is quite prolific. 'I believe he was stealing them to sell on because they are quite expensive. 'Most businesses tend to use them because they are hard-wearing and suck up everything.' Pharmacist Al Twigge, 48, from Stallion Chemists, in Brighton, also handed over his Henry to a man who claimed to work for a nearby business. Henry Hoovers are worth around £100 and are popular with businesses thanks to their hardiness . He said: 'The man came in saying he was preparing for an important function nearby and his vacuum cleaner had blown-up. 'I lent him ours but thought it was strange when he failed to return a few hours later. 'I went to the shop where he said he worked and was told the guy did not work there. 'It is bizarre that he is stealing just Henrys. They are not the sort of thing you would expect somebody to take.' Mr Twigge is believed to be the first victim of the Henry thief.

Embattled: French President Francois Hollande suffered a fresh setback yesterday when France's highest court threw out a plan to tax the ultra-wealthy at a 75 per cent rate and said it was unfair . It was an insignificant amount in the context of France's roughly €85billion (£70billion) deficit. Au revoir: Actor Gerard Depardieu recently announced his intention to turn in his French passport and move to a village in a tax-friendly Belgium . Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was quick to respond, saying in a statement following the decision that the Government would resubmit the measure to take the court's concerns into account. The court's ruling took issue not with the size of the tax, but with the way it discriminated between households depending on how incomes were distributed among its members. A household with two earners each making under €1million (£820,000) would be exempt from the tax, while one with one earner making €1.2million (£980,000) would have to pay. The French Government approved the tax in its most recent budget, amid criticism that it would do little to stem the country's mounting fiscal problems and would drive away the wealthiest citizens. Meanwhile President Hollande's popularity has been tanking as the country's unemployment continued its rise for the 19th straight month.

"By . Sara Malm and Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 14:16 EST, 2 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:13 EST, 2 January 2013 . Victim: 17-year-old Dogan Ismail who was stabbed to death on Sunday . The family of a teenager stabbed to . death protecting his younger brother during a row over a stolen phone is demanding justice. Dogan Ismail, 17, died after being knifed in the chest on Sunday afternoon at a block of flats in Walworth, south-east London. The sixth-form student and his younger . brother Orhan, 15, had gone to retrieve a stolen BlackBerry . when they were confronted by up to four youths and a row broke out. The brothers' cousin Sultan Orun, 25, said Orhan fought to save his brother's life but was unable to stem the blood. Dogan collapsed in his brother's arms and Orhan was holding his chest to stop the blood. 'He said this picture of the stabbing will stay in his memory for the rest of his life,' she said. According to his cousin Dogan was a . committed student and  'family boy' who dreamed of running his own . business who had never been in any trouble with the police. 'Why did they do this over a stupid . phone? I hate them,' she told the Evening Standard. 'They took him away . from me. There has got to be justice.' The mobile phone had previously been stolen by a trio of pupils - that Orhan recognised from his school - as he walked home from playing football. Two days later he received a message saying: 'If you come here we will give it back to you,' according to The Sun. The pair headed to Latimer House to retrieve the phone, but instead one of the boys pulled out a knife and stabbed Dogan in the chest at the top of a stairwell. The teenager bled to death as his younger brother tried desperately to save his life. Orhan later told his family: 'He made to give back the phone, but instead brought a knife from behind his back and stabbed Dogan in the chest. 'His last words were, ‘Oh my God, you have stabbed me!’ The guy just calmly walked away.' Police have now taken the unusual step of naming a youth wanted for questioning in connection with Dogan's death. Dawda Jallow, 15, from the Peckham . area, is described as black, clean shaven with cropped black afro hair, . 5ft 5in tall and slightly built. He was spotted on a bus eight hours after the killing, detectives revealed today. The CCTV footage is the only confirmed sighting of murder suspect whom police believe could have been wearing the same clothes when he was seen on a No. 35 bus from Camberwell Green in south London to Newington Causeway at 10.31pm on December 30th. Appeal: This CCTV image released by London Metropolitan Police shows Dawda Jallow in a black jacket on a bus which he boarded at Camberwell Green at 10.19pm and got off at 10.32pm at Newington Causeway . He has brown eyes and speaks with a London accent, although he is a Gambian national. Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner . of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, leading the investigation, . said: 'I am seeking help from the local community to locate Dawda . Jallow. I appeal to anyone who knows of his whereabouts, or has any . information that could assist us, to come forward. 'If Dawda is seen, please do not approach him but contact police. 'I appeal direct to Dawda to present himself at a police station so this matter can be dealt with.' Speaking at a press conference this afternoon DCI Bonner said: ‘Anybody who knows where he is or is thinking about offering him assistance whether that’s food, accommodation or money should think twice about it and give us a call instead. ‘I’ve thought long and hard about releasing his identity, but this is a serious incident and we need to speak to him and I believe this is a good way of prompting that.’ DCI Bonner said he did not believe the killing was gang related and added that police believe the suspect, who is from nearby Peckham, would stay in the local area. Police carrying out investigations into the latest incident while flowers remain lying in tribute following the death of a 21-year-old man in September . Dogan, a business student at Walworth Academy, was of Turkish origin and lived in nearby Peckham. The Metropolitan Police and London . Ambulance Service were called to Latimer House, Beaconsfield Road, at . 4.20pm, where the victim, from Peckham, south-east London, was . subsequently pronounced dead. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested . on suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of . perverting the course of justice, and were yesterday bailed. Mr Bonner added: 'My thoughts go out . to Dogan's family, who have been left devastated by his senseless . killing. That it should happen at this time of year is all the more . tragic. I would like to urge anyone with information about this incident . to come forward and speak with my officers or, if they would prefer to . remain anonymous, Crimestoppers. Neighbours in the area have said they are living in fear following the second incident in a matter of months . The murder scene is yards from where . 21-year-old Shaun Chambers died on September 26 after being stabbed in . an apparent gang-related killing. Mr Chambers, 21, from Greenwich, was stabbed in the heart. However Mr Bonner said there was 'no evidence' to suggest Dogan's death was gang related. He said: 'I know there will also be . local speculation about the fact that this murder took place on the same . spot that Shaun Chambers was killed on 26 September, but I would like . to make clear that there is no link between the incidents aside from the . location.' Dogan is the eighth teenager to be murdered in London in 2012. Residents on the estate today said . they were living in fear following the second such incident on their . doorstep in the space of a few months. Shaun Chambers, 21, died on September 26 after being stabbed in an apparent gang-related killing . A mother-of-two, who did not want to . be identified, said: 'This is a very bad estate. It's so dangerous. I . want to move, but I have to wait for the council to move me because I am . poor.' Met Police are now cracking down on crime in the area and made 30 arrests as part of Operation Dragonet in December. Southwark Chief Superintendent John . Sutherland said: 'We have now put extra patrols on the street, but our . overriding priority now is to get justice for Dogan and his family.' Anyone with information should call police on 020 8358 0200 or, to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

A driver who was trapped in a car travelling at 125mph with a jammed accelerator and no brakes today said: ‘It was as if my life was flashing before me’. Frank Lecerf, 36, was on his way to do his shopping at a hypermarket when his Renault Laguna developed a fault close to his home in Pont-de-Metz, near Amiens, in northern France. The vehicle, which was specially adapted for disabled drivers, started to accelerate as Mr Lecerf drove along a dual carriageway with a speed limit of 60mph. Terror ride: Frank Lecerf, 36, was on his way to the supermarket when the accelerator of his Renault Laguna jammed and he couldn't slow down . Desperation: As the car reached its top speed Mr Lecerf called the police, who put him through to a Renault engineer who tried to guide him to a stop . Step on the brake pedal with both feet using firm and steady pressure. Do not pump the brake pedal as it will deplete the vacuum utilized for the power brake assist. Shift the transmission gear selector to the Neutral (N) position and use the brakes to make a controlled stop at the side of the road and turn off the engine. If unable to put the vehicle in Neutral, turn the engine OFF. This will not cause loss of steering or braking control, but the power assist to these systems will be lost. If the vehicle is equipped with an Engine Start/Stop button, push the button for at least three seconds to turn off the engine. If the vehicle is equipped with a key-ignition, turn it to the ACC position to turn off the engine. Do NOT remove the key from the ignition as this will lock the steering wheel. Without any pressure on the accelerator . at all, the Laguna started to increase in speed, and Mr Lecerf could do . nothing about it. Soon the car had reached its top speed of 125mph and Mr Lecerf became to suffer health problems during Saturday’s night ordeal. ‘I just wanted it to stop,’ he said, explaining how he called the police, who put him through to a Renault engineer who tried to guide him to a stop. As he swerved in and out of traffic, and through three toll booths, Mr Lecerf was joined by high-speed police cars which created a ‘safety’ convoy. The trail of cars sped across northern Europe for some 150 miles, eventually crossing the border from France into Belgium. Miraculously, they avoided a serious accident before Mr Lecerf’s car ran out of petrol and plunged into a ditch in Alveringem, Belgium. As he swerved in and out of traffic, and . through three toll booths, Mr Lecerf was joined by police . cars which created a ‘safety’ convoy. He eventually ran out of petrol after 150 miles and ended up in a ditch in Belgium . Monsieur Lecerf set off for the shops in Abbeville and ended up across the border, 150-miles later in a ditch in Belgium when the car's petrol finally ran out . A Renault technician had sought to advise police on how to solve the problem as they gave chase, to no avail. Mr Lecerf said it was not his first speed jamming incident but that Renault had looked at the car and said they had fixed the problem. His lawyer said he would file a legal complaint over 'endangerment of a person's life'. Renault said it would await the results of an investigation.","Frank Lecerf, 36, was on way to hypermarket when car developed a fault .

DNA recovered from crime scene where a mother-of-three was murdered in the south of France matches that of a British suspect, a prosecutor said today. It came as 32-year-old Robert Plant prepared to be formally placed under investigation by judges – the first step towards a criminal trial under the French legal system. Plant is suspected of sexually assaulting and then killing Joudia Zimmat, 34, while she was out jogging in Nimes. DNA trace: The French Police issued this photofit picture of British suspect Robert Plant from Chatham, Kent . Home: Plant, originally from Chatham, Kent, has been living with his mother Esther in a luxurious villa in the same road as the one where Ms Zimmat¿s body was found . Stephane Bertrand, the tourist town’s . prosecutor, said: ‘We compared the genetic profile with the evidence . found at the scene, and the results were a match. His DNA corresponds . with the objects recovered from the crime scene.’ Ms Zimmat failed to collect her . three-year-old daughter from school last Thursday, and then a police . sniffer dog found her body in scrubland. She had been repeatedly hit around the face, and was stabbed so savagely that she was barely recognisable. A Stanley knife and two stones coated . in blood found close to where Ms Zimmat’s body was discovered are . believed to have been used by the murderer. Arrest: Robert Plant, 32, is being questioned about the murder of Joudia Zimmat, 34, who was attacked while out jogging in a suburb of Nimes, in Provence . Odd-job: French police said they had arrested Plant, an odd-job man who moved to France aged ten and who lives with his mother in a luxury villa 300 yards from where the body was found . Trace: DNA matching Plant was recovered . from the scene close to where Ms Zimmat's body was found in brambles . Brutal murder: The alarm was raised when jogger Joudia Zimmat, whose body was found lying next to a path in Courbessac, failed to arrive to pick her children up from school on Thursday . Plant is originally from Chatham, . Kent, but now lives with his mother, Esther, in a luxurious villa in the . same road as the one where Ms Zimmat’s body was found. A tearful Mrs Plant was back in Nimes today after returning from a visit to Paris to see her daughter, Victoria. Mrs Plant was accused by police of . providing a false alibi to her son – saying that he was at home all day . on Thursday – but was not expected to be charged. Instead she is expected to provide . support to Plant when he appears before prosecutors. He will be ‘mis en . examen’, the French legal term for ‘put under examination’ – the process . which launches a formal enquiry by examining judges before a trial. Plant denies having anything to do . with the murder. On Tuesday he was accompanied by detectives as they . searched his mother’s house, which has a swimming pool. Police also believe his face matches a photo-fit image created by witnesses who saw a man hiding in bushes before the attack. Plant is suspected of sexually assaulting and then killing Zimmat, 34, while she was out jogging in Nimes . Evidence: A Stanley knife and two stones coated . in blood found close to where Ms Zimmat’s body was discovered are . believed to have been used by the murderer . Plant’s father died of cancer last . summer, and he had been staying with his mother for a number of months, . while looking for work as a decorator and art restorer. One neighbour described him as a ‘tall, clean-cut, pleasant young man who was often strolling around with his pet dog.’ Ms Zimmat regularly went running on . jogging paths in the suburb of Courbessac, which is a few miles from the . centre of Nimes, which is famous for its Roman remains including an . amphitheatre. Plant had hand injuries ‘consistent . with bramble scratches’ and the victim’s body was found ‘in a thicket of . brambles’, said a police. The source said the police were investigating . whether there was any CCTV footage that would help their inquiry. Neighbours also described Ms Zimmat . as a ‘pretty and petite woman’, who had recently moved to a house in the . area with her family. A friend described how Plant had gone . to ‘drink pints of beer’ at La Tosca, a local Italian bar and . restaurant, the day after the killing. Quiet suburb: The British suspect is thought to have living in Nimes with his parents for several months . Sources: One police officer in France said the victim had been so savagely attacked her face was unrecognisable . Khadra, a waitress at La Tosca, told Le Figaro: ‘He came in on Friday. He regularly came here to drink pints. It’s been years since we first met.  He comes several times a week. ‘He speaks French very well but with a strong accent. On Friday he had injuries on his forehead and his hands. We asked him what had happened, and he said: ‘It’s the thorns that scratched me when I went to get the dog who had fallen into a hole. Another acquaintance, a former Foreign legionnaire called Andy from Scotland, said: ‘He was a loner. He was very well educated. We’re not from the same type of background but he often came her for a drink. He’s very pleasant.’ Nimes is in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France, and is hugely popular with British expatriates and tourists.

The captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise liner has admitted he has no regrets about his actions in the aftermath of the shipwreck that left 32 people dead. The holiday vessel Concordia . slammed into rocks off the Italian island of Giglio last year after Captain Francesco Schettino took it off its . pre-programmed course and brought it closer to land as a favour to . friends from the island. Schettino say he understands why some people . 'hate' him, but defended his actions and blamed others . on the bridge for failing to inform him of the situation in time, and . then of botching his orders once he tried to steer clear of the reef. Schettino who is accused of multiple manslaughter, causing the wreck and abandoning ship, said in an interview with NBC News he tried to make sure he was the last person to leave the ship. 'People don't understand that the ship . is 58 meters (nearly 200 feet) wide, so you don't have a chance to see . who else is left on the other side. 'And in the moment the floor started . to become steeper, you have no other option: To die, or to swim,' he . said. 'So, I regret nothing.' Schettino, insisted that other people should share the blame for the accident and claimed that Costa Cruises told him before the wreck that he needed to share . some authority with lower-ranking officers. A year on: The Costa Concordia capsized on January 13 2012 with 4,252 passengers and crew on board, 32 lives could not be saved . 'Unfortunately I was relying, in the last three minutes, on an officer, . when all of a sudden he was handing me the control of the ship without . giving me distance -nothing,' Schettino said. 'I . regret that I was trusting (that officer).  I was trusting him before . the accident, and also after the accident.  And I have been living with . these things inside me.  I will never trust anyone anymore because this . was a very deadly mistake,' he said. As survivors . and victims' families marked the one-year anniversary of the accident at the weekend Schettino did not attend the . unveiling of memorials and remained at his home near . Naples, where he lives under some court restrictions. Anniversary: Silence is observed during a Catholic mass to commemorate the Costa Concordia disaster near the shipwreck on the island of Giglio, located off the coast of Tuscany, on Sunday night . In honour: The participants joined in a torchlight procession on Giglio Island close to the wreckage, and placed the torched to light up the commemorative plaque with the names of those who died in the disaster . But taking part in the anniversary . commemoration was Captain Gregorio De Falco of the Italian coast guard, . who became something of a hero to survivors after his recorded . conversations with Schettino during the evacuation were made public. In . them, De Falco excoriated Schettino for having abandoned the ship before . all passengers were off and ordered him to return, shouting the . now-infamous order ""Go on board (expletive)!"" Stranded: Aerial view of the the Costa Concordia in Isola del Giglio, Italy . In an interview broadcast Sunday with RAI state television, Schettino  said he wanted to 'share in the pain of all the victims and the families of the victims.' At the remembrance on Sunday a Catholic Mass was held in memory of the tragedy after which the islanders, passengers and relatives gathered observed a minute's silence at 9.45 - the time of the ship's collision with the rocks. Some of the 3,200 surviving passengers, and relatives of the 32 who lost their lives, were taken by boat close to the wreck. They watched as a crane lowered part of a rock that was removed from the hull of the 950 ft long ship into the water. The rock has been carved into a memorial and adorned with a plaque. After a year we are still traumatised,’ said Violet Morreau, a survivor from France, who was in the restaurant area with 10 family members the ship hit the rocks before keeling over on its side off the Tuscan island. ‘No one told us what to do. We were scared of dying, like the people who did lose their lives, because of somebody else's recklessness,’ Morreau said. Salvage crews are working on refloating the wreck in what would be the largest ever operation of its kind. U.S. firm Titan Salvage said on Saturday the ship would be removed by September at the latest. The 114,500-tonne liner will be pulled upright by cranes, helped by tanks attached to its sides filled with air, and the ship will be towed to an Italian port and broken up. The vessel's owner Costa Cruises, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp, now expects the removal to cost £248 million, more than its original £186 million estimate. A total of 3,229 passengers and 1,023 crew were on board the Costa Concordia when it sank. Whilst 30 bodies have been recovered, two people are still missing, presumed dead.","Cruise liner slammed into rocks off the Italian island of Giglio last year .

Three Tottenham Hotspur football fans are in hospital today after being attacked by a mob of masked French hooligans chanting Nazi slogans. A gang of up to 50 thugs attacked an English-style pub in Lyon, where the north London club are due to play a Europa League match tonight. Police believe that the violence in the Smoking Dog, in the city's old town, was 'of an anti-Semitic' nature and 'well-coordinated'. Aftermath: Around 150 Tottenham fans were attacked by a mob of French Nazi hooligans at the Smoking Dog Pub in Lyon which was left with smashed windows and doors ripped off their hinges . Attack: A smashed mirror and broken chair lie on the the floor of the Smoking Dog pub, the scene of what French police described as 'anti-semitic' violence . Rampage: Sportmsmail's Laura Williamson captured pictures on her mobile . phone of the damage inside the bar after Spurs supporters had been . attacked in France's second city last night . It saw flares thrown into the pub, . which was packed with around 150 Spurs fans watching the European Cup . game between AC Milan and Barcelona on TV. 'Doors and windows were smashed open, . and then chairs were thrown at the English fans,' said a local police . spokesman, who confirmed that other bars were also targeted. It is thought that those responsible for the attack were a far right group, rather than Lyon football fans. 'The attackers wore balaclavas and . other face masks, and were chanting as they carried out the attack,' said the police source. 'Their chants was of an anti-Semitic nature. 'They caused as much damage as . possible, ran off, and then came back again a few minutes later. Three . English fans were seriously injured and taken to hospital.' Violence: Footage taken by an eyewitness to the attack shows one of the thugs preparing to hurl an object towards the pub . The pub owners were forced to barricade the entrance as the thugs continued their attack . Violence: A gang of up to 50 thugs attacked an . English-style pub in Lyon, where the north London club are due to play a . Europa League match tonight . Tottenham supporter Christian . Radnedge said: 'They came in at around half past 10. There were lots of . Spurs fans in the pub. It was fit to burst. 'Then around 20 masked men came towards the pub. The glass was smashed, missiles were thrown into the pub. Damage: A smashed picture lies on the floor inside the Smoking Dog pub after the attack last night . 'The owner of the pub said there were 25 of them. They came in making Nazi salutes. It was frightening. 'They . left and then we thought that was it, but five minutes later it started . again. More stuff was thrown in through the windows and then they left. 'The . intruders did not get in to the bar because it was full of Spurs fans. There were drips of blood left in the bar. The owners barricaded the pub . between the two waves of attacks.' David Eales, the landlord of the . Smoking Dog who is originally from Retford, Nottinghamshire, said: 'At . 10.18 the pub was rammed with Tottenham fans watching the Champions . League on the television. 'The front of the pub, which is made up of reinforced glass, was attacked by between 20 and 25 people. 'They threw projectiles through the . windows. There was a stand-off. They didn't get into the bar. Then it . calmed down. Then they came back a second time and it all started again. 'There were three injured Tottenham fans taken away by ambulance. One of them had a head injury. I'm not sure how bad it was.' Mr Eales, 42, attended last week's . first leg of the Spurs- Lyon clash at White Hart Lane, which passed off . without incident, as a Lyon fan. He had invited Spurs supporters to his . bar while in London, and anticipated trouble from far-right groups in . Lyon because Tottenham traditionally has a big Jewish following. Location: The Smoking Dog is an English-style pub in Lyon Old Town district . Away game: Around 150 fans had gathered at the English-style pub ahead of Tottenham Hotspur's Europa League match in Lyon tonight . Anti-Semitic: Witnesses say the thugs chanted Nazi slogans and hurled chairs at the Tottenham fans . Mr Eales said: 'The most disappointing . thing is that I spoke to the police a couple of days ago about the . potential for trouble because of what people associate Tottenham being. There will be a big presence on the match day, but tonight it didn't . happen.' It is the second time that Spurs fans have been targeted by anti-Semitic hooligans in the last three months. In November, some were ambushed inside a pub in Rome on the eve of their game against Lazio. Tottenham fan Christian Radnege, who was in . the bar at the time of the attack, said: 'They came in making Nazi . salutes. It was frightening. 'Rome was fresh in everyone's minds. Everyone realised this was serious. The pub was packed with around 150 Spurs fans watching the European Cup game between AC Milan and Barcelona on TV when the mob attacked . All boarded up: The Smoking Dog pub in Lyon this morning . 'They left and then we thought that was it, but five minutes later it started again. 'The intruders did not get into the bar because it was full of Spurs . fans. There were drips of blood left in the bar. The owners barricaded . the pub between the two waves of attacks.' Another fan James Taylor had driven . through the night from his home in Ilford, Essex, to attend tonight's . Europa League second round second leg clash. He said the attack 'was pre-meditated, pre-arranged. It was nothing to do with Spurs fans. 'We were in the pub having a few drinks at about 10pm. There were about 150 Spurs fans singing. It was all in good nature. Clash: Tottenham will play Lyon in tonight's Europa League second round second leg clash . 'Then there was a bang. We ignored the . first one and there was a second one, suddenly. The windows were . smashed and stools were thrown into the pub. We ran back to hide. 'We were stuck in the back of the pub for about half an hour. We were worried. No Spurs fans were violent or too drunk.' A spokesman for Britain's Foreign and . Commonwealth Office said: 'We are aware of reports of an attack on . British nationals in France and are offering consular assistance.' A Tottenham Hotspur spokesman said: . 'Club officials attended an incident last night in Lyon. A group of . around 50 people confronted fans. 'The situation was dealt with and . arrests were made within the hour. Three fans sustained minor injuries . and received prompt medical assistance. 'Spurs officials and stewards will be in the city throughout the day, along with matchday French police ahead of kick-off.' Sportsmail's Laura Williamson . The Smoking Dog Pub on Rue Lainerie on the cobbled . streets of Lyon's old town had its dark red shutters closed when we arrived at . around midnight local time. We had already met groups of Spurs fans in the street; . many just groups of ordinary young lads who had driven through the night to . follow their team. They were shocked but many were starting to feel angry, too; . angry that their club had been targeted again. All were critical of the . response of the French police. The Smoking Dog is a narrow pub with reinforced glass . windows at the front, wooden floors and benches, a crowded bar to your right . and a slightly narrower back room. This is what had scared the English and . Scots who drink their regularly: there is only one way out and that is through . the front door, which is where the gang attacked. Spurs fans had been trapped . inside. The landlord Dave Eales, who has run the pub since 1995 . but is originally from Retford in Nottinghamshire, was trying to make sense of . it all. There had been a quick and concerted clean up operation by the time we . arrived, with the British community in Lyon quick to help a friend in need, but . everyone looked visibly shocked - particularly a girl who had been working . behind the bar. She could barely speak. The glass and bits of broken bar stools had been swept . away and the floors had been cleaned of the drops of blood and beer that had . been spilled in the panic. But the collection of items that had been hurled . into the pub - including a flare - by the gang in two waves of attacks was . chilling. There were cast-iron table legs and the kind of large circular weight . used to secure a patio umbrella. One man said how a Spurs fan had rushed behind the bar . into a back office when the attack happened, urging the bar staff to barricade . themselves inside. 'I was in Rome and I've got a two-year-old baby,' he . said. 'This can't keep happening.' There was certainly that sense of disbelief. The pub . staff expressed it in the way they described the gang of hooded men doing Nazi . salutes on their front door and the Spurs fans had the same tone as they . discussed the events of Rome. Both agreed on another thing, too. This attack . had nothing to do with football. Brutal: Ten supporters were hurt and one seriously injured in the Rome attack, while two Roma fans were charged with attempted murder . In the last decade English football fans have been the subject of a series of knife attacks when going to support their team at games in Rome . The attack on the Tottenham fans is the latest in a long series assaults on suspected Jews in Lyon, which has a long history of anti-Semitism. Last year a gang of 10 youths attacked three Jewish men with hammers and metal bars. It led to Jewish community leader Joel Mergui saying: 'Not a week passes without anti-Semitic assaults in France. I refuse to believe Jews will be forced to choose between security and their Jewish identity.' Richard Wertenschlag, chief rabbi of the Grand Synagogue in Lyon, called the atmosphere 'unbearable.; . 'These incidents are becoming more and more frequent, so much so, alas, as to make one take them for granted,' he said. Lyon's dark history of anti-Semitism extends back centuries, and includes Klaus Barbie, the so-called 'Butcher of Lyon' - a Nazi who tortured and murdered hundreds of Jews with the help of French collaborators during World War II.","Three Tottenham fans in hospital after Nazi hooligans storm French bar .

Pinched present: French President Francois Hollande in Mali where he was given a stolen camel . A baby camel presented to French President Francois Hollande for 'liberating' Mali was stolen and will not be allowed to stay in Paris, it emerged today. In a plot straight out of a madcap Gallic comedy film, a Malian refugee said he wanted the young dromedary back. Mr Hollande was hailed a hero on Saturday when he arrived in Timbuktu, Mali, which until a few days before had been in the hands of Al-Qaeda backed terrorists. As a token of thanks for the part French troops played in defeating the Islamist radicals, Mr Hollande was presented with the camel. The pair were pictured together, although the camel screeched constantly, and was far from impressed with the portly French head of state tried to pat him on the head. Now it has emerged that the camel, who had not been named, actually belonged to a farmer, whose house was destroyed by French shelling during their attack on Timbuktu. The true owner of the camel is now living in the Ambra refugee camp, on the border with Mauritania. This effectively means that the animal is stolen property, and Mr Hollande and his entourage had no legal right to take it out of the country. A furious Malian calling himself Said Toureg has now threatened to file a lawsuit, saying on Twitter: 'Paris will witness unprecedented judicial activities regarding the stolen camel... there are reports stating that the owner of the camel has filed a lawsuit in the Ambra camp.' A diplomatic Mr Hollande is now said to be prepared to respect the request from Mali, with France's BFM TV news channel reporting: 'It was decided to resend the camel back to his native country Mali because of the difficulty of surviving in France's cold weather.' French forces carried out a lightening military campaign in Mali, forcing a terrorist army to retreat, and now Mr Hollande has pledged that his military will withdraw by March. This has led to Mr Hollande being described as a 'liberator' by ordinary Malians. The Elysee Palace had no immediate comment on the camel scandal, which came as the country’s defence minister announced that it has killed hundreds of militants in Mali. Jean-Yves Le Drian also told a French radio station that the conflict . was a ‘real war with terrorists’. Nicked gift: France's President Francois Hollande receives presents during his visit to Mali before he was given a baby camel which now has been reported as stolen . Victorious: French troops clearing near Hambori, northern Mali, earlier this week as the French defence minister announced 'hundreds' of militants have been killed in Mali . Just one French soldier has so far died in action in Mali. ‘It’s a real war ... when we go outside of the centre of cities that have been taken, we meet residual jihadists,’ said Mr Le Drian. The French-led troops have taken the key city of Gao and control the capital of Timbuktu, but plans to move forward on the last major city in control of the Islamist militants, Kindal, have been hampered by sandstorms. President Francois Hollande said France may start pulling out of west Africa nation at the end of March. That will depend on an increase in the deployment of African forces, which are meant to take over the international effort to secure Mali. The country currently has 4,000 soldiers deployed in Mali fighting alongside 3,800 local soldiers, but is expected to keep a rapid reaction force in Mali to back up the U.N. force. Mr Le Drian said French aircraft are continuing airstrikes every night on suspected militant arms depots and mine-making sites. On the ground, troops have found war material, weapons manuals and makeshift laboratories for constructing improvised explosive devices. ‘We discovered preparations for a true terrorist sanctuary,’ he said. France launched a swift military intervention Jan. 11 against Islamist extremists who had taken over northern Mali, where they imposed a harsh version of Shariah law.","Baby camel gifted to Francoise Hollande in Mali appears to have been stolen .

Battling: Brook Hill is in a coma in a French hospital after a ski collision on a junior slope at the Les Monts d¿Olmes ski resort in the south of the country . A nine-year-old boy is in a coma after being knocked down by a skier on a family holiday in the Pyrenees. Brook Hill was enjoying a beginners’ skiing lesson on a junior slope at the Les Monts d’Olmes ski resort in southern France when the accident happened. The youngster, who was wearing a helmet, was knocked unconscious by a 27-year-old man who lost control and ploughed into him at high speed. Brook was airlifted to a hospital in Toulouse where he has had an operation to remove a section of his skull to relieve pressure on his brain. The other skier suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung and is recovering in hospital. Police have launched an investigation into Sunday’s accident. Yesterday, his entrepreneur father Louis, 40, said doctors have told him they cannot be sure of the extent of the brain damage until Brook wakes up. Mr Hill, of Wrenbury, Cheshire, said: ‘Brook is stable and we are hoping he wakes up soon. ‘He’s a tough little chap and a real fighter, so our fingers are . crossed. 'He has not, as yet, opened his eyes and . ‘woken up’ so things still remain in the balance and doctors are . reluctant to give any prognosis until he can answer questions or respond . to instructions. ‘It is still early days and doctors are advising any recovery is . likely to be a long process.’ Accident: The resort of Les Monts d'Olmes is popular with families because the slopes are relatively easy .

A popular pupil, his family and friends have been writing messages of support and jokes on a website which his parents are reading aloud to the schoolboy, who is in intensive care. His uncle, Paul, of Tattenhall, Cheshire, added: ‘We are so grateful Brook was wearing a crash helmet. ‘In all honesty, we all ignorantly . believe that such accidents only happen to other people, and it’s a big . wake up call when it’s one of your own. ‘As . a family we really believe in the power of positive thinking and the . amount of people who tell us they are sending good vibes to Brook is . overwhelming. ‘Brook is very lucky to have such warmth around him. ‘It’s . very difficult to determine the damage to Brook’s brain while he is in . the coma, so we are willing him to wake up so we can figure out what the . next step is. ‘Listening to music and jokes will be a constant part of his routine until we have another development.’ Monts-d’Olmes is a small resort in the Ariege department, around one-and-a-half hours’ drive from Toulouse. Its slopes are especially popular with families with young children, because all are relatively easy.

David Beckham's new football club today negotiated a record £110 million shirt sponsorship deal - within two days of him signing. In what many see as the real reason the 37-year-old arrived at Paris St Germain, executives have jumped on the chance to make as much money from the star's profile as possible. Replica shirts costing almost £100 with Beckham's name on the back are already flying of the shelves at the club shop on the Champs Elysee. Big money signing: David Beckham's new club Paris Saint Germain have negotiated a record £110 million shirt sponsorship deal . Extended: The deal is an extension of the current contract held with Emirates, as seen on this shirt displayed by Beckham with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, pictured left, and sports director Leonardo, right . And according to today's Parisien newspaper: 'After signing David Beckham, there is even more good news for PSG. 'According to our information, the capital's club on Saturday agreed an extension of its shirt sponsoring contract with Emirates, the airline company of the United Arab Emirates. 'The agreement, which focuses on a partnership of five years, from 2014, has risen sharply and reaches a level never recorded in France of 25 million Euros a year, including bonuses.' This figure amounts to around £110 million and, according to the Parisien, will put the club 'firmly in the category of European heavyweights including Real Madrid, Manchester United, or Barcelona'. Daddy's girl: David Beckham posted a photograph of baby Harper's new Paris Saint Germain shirt on his Facebook page . Parisian couture: Shirts emblazoned with Beckham's name have been flying off the shelves in Paris . On Friday, within 24 hours of signing for the previously relatively unfashionable PSG, Beckham, was plugging the PSG shirts on his Facebook page, saying he had even bought one for his toddler daughter, Harper, one. Beckham wrote: 'I've got all the shirts for the kids, you can see little Harper's one here. Blown away by the reception of the people in Paris.' The player is donating his PSG salary, estimated at around 3 million pounds over a five month contract, to an unspecified children's charity in Paris - a move he has said to have agreed with his wife, Victoria. Joint decision: Beckham said that he and wife Victoria, pictured with their three sons at the launch of musical Viva Forever, had decided to give his wages to charity . 'Glad to get so many positive comments about the donation,' Beckham wrote on the same Facebook page. 'Victoria and I made the decision to give the wages away to a children's charity. We are incredibly fortunate so we are glad we could do this with the club's blessing. Thanks as always for your support, I will always do my best for you.' But analysts in both France and Britain say that Beckham, who is already worth around 200 million pounds, will still profit from massive image rights payments during his time at PSG. [caption .

Hearing my four-year-old son’s cry from the next room, I assumed he had fallen out with his playmate over a toy, or their favourite spot on the sofa, where I’d last seen them sitting together, watching TV. But as I stood up to investigate, Christian stumbled into the room, tears streaming down his face, hands clutching his neck. My friend, whose home we were visiting last Friday evening, gently steered Christian towards me and, as he stretched out his arms, I spotted an angry red mark circling his neck. A close call: Christian, four, who clearly shows the marks around his neck, was saved by his older brother when he got caught in a blind cord and nearly hung himself from it . In the sickening seconds which followed, I learned that Christian and his friend had been jumping off the windowsill when a loop, which had formed in a venetian blind cord, caught around my son’s neck, leaving him hanging and unable to free himself. My throat constricted as the older children, who’d been in the room watching a film as the near-tragedy unfolded, recounted how my eldest child, 11-year-old Daniel, had leapt off the couch, lifted Christian by his armpits and unhooked the killer cord from around his neck. Mercifully, Daniel had reacted in seconds. Deeply shaken by the event, Daniel later told me it had seemed to have taken an age to work out how to free his little brother. Sickening discovery: Helen, centre, found out that just a few feet away, while she was oblivious, her youngest son Christian, left, had come perilously close to tragedy, but was saved thanks to his older brother Daniel, right . Chillingly, I’ve since discovered through the Blind Cords Safety Campaign that it can take just 20 seconds for a child to be strangled to death by a blind cord. Brain damage can occur even sooner. Christian cried inconsolably for a full 15 minutes after his near-miss, his little body shaking as I cradled him on my lap. I just kept thanking God that my older boy had been in the room with the little ones. Eager not to add to my son’s distress, I fought an overwhelming urge to break down. I in no way blame my friend for what happened. Highly safety-conscious, she had carefully wound the blind cord around a metal cleat beyond the children’s reach. Indeed, most blinds come with these cleats as a safety measure: a wooden or metal fitting that can be fixed to a wall so the cord can be wrapped around it. But clearly cleats are not infallible, as we discovered. Without a clear account from either boy, we are left to assume that one of them yanked on the wound cord as they stood on the windowsill, oblivious to the fact this left a loop hanging in mid-air, which fast became a deadly noose. Quick thinking: Christian, four, left, was saved by brother Daniel, 11, right, who managed to pick him up by the armpits and lift him free from the cord which had become tangled around his neck . This accident, I now realise, could just as easily have happened in our home, where we have similar blinds and wind the cord around hooks fitted high on the window frames. While Christian and his four-year-old friend were told in no uncertain terms that it had been very naughty of them to first climb onto and then jump off the windowsill, the shocking outcome was clearly punishment enough for them. In the hours that followed, Christian was as upset about people knowing he had done something wrong in jumping off the sill as he was about the stinging pain around his neck. It was clear from his ability to move his neck and the lack of swelling or bruising that nothing had been broken. However, to be on the safe side, we Skyped my sister, an advanced nurse practitioner who lives 200 miles away, and she prescribed paracetamol and TLC. So I gave Christian a spoonful of Calpol then laid with him until he fell asleep, exhausted, in my bed. Studying the gash around my son’s neck, I finally allowed my mind to explore the horrors of what might have happened had Daniel not reacted so fast. Terrible images flooded my mind of my husband and I being led into a mortuary. Tragically, at least 25 children in Britain have been strangled to death by cord blinds since 1999, 12 of them in the past three years. Danger: The increase in the number of deaths involving blind cords similar to this one has led to campaigners calling on them to be banned . The Royal Society For The Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) says the figure could even be far higher as, since 2002, such deaths have been logged under the umbrella term ‘accidents in the home’. Consequently, RoSPA is largely reliant on reports in the press and information from coroners. Not surprisingly, given the shock he’d had, Daniel said he’d lain awake for hours that night, replaying events and recalling the look on his brother’s face. ‘Christian was trying to cry but, because of the rope squeezing his throat, he couldn’t make any noise,’ Daniel told me the following day. ‘His eyes were wide open and he looked really scared. ‘I was panicking, trying to work out how to get him down. It was awful — like looking into the face of my dying brother.’ What chills me most is the thought that had Christian been alone in the room, albeit a mere six steps from where I was sitting, neither I nor the other mums in the house would have been alerted to the fact that he was being strangled to death because the cord must have been pressing on his voicebox. We had been checking on the children regularly. In fact, my friend walked into the room just as Daniel was steadying Christian back down on the floor. How fate has an unpleasant habit of mocking us. Only a couple of months ago, I read the sad story of Alexandra Lucy Hoegh — a recent victim of this killer in our homes — and thought: ‘Thank heavens my children are past that stage now: it’s one less thing to worry about’. Alexandra, the three-year-old daughter of Morten Hoegh, one of Britain’s richest men, was found by her mother, Dana, lifeless in her cot, with a blind cord around her neck. It is thought Alexandra had been playing with the cord of a window blind when she became tangled. Neighbours described how Mrs Hoegh ran screaming into the street outside her £12 million home in West London, begging for help. That could so easily have been me. I’ve always been a very protective mother, but with them all growing up, and Christian about to turn five, I’ve recently stopped watching them every single minute of the day. And RoSPA does say that the majority . of children who suffer blind cord deaths are around two — an age when . they are mobile but have no sense of risk or danger. ‘Most . children killed by blind cords are toddlers who have died in their . rooms at a time when their parents thought they were sleeping,’ says . RoSPA’s Michael Corley. ‘Our advice to parents is not to put blinds with cords in their children’s bedrooms.’ Home danger: There has been 12 deaths in the past two years where children under four have been strangled by cords of venetian blinds . Campaigners are lobbying the EU to get on with the job of ratifying new safety legislation to ensure all newly manufactured cord blinds come fitted with break connectors. This would mean that the cord would snap when weight, like that of a child, pulls down on it. Christian’s near-miss has left me paranoid about every potential threat to his safety. I’ve gone back to reminding him not to run up and down stairs, and to use the proper steps on our garden slide. Over the past few days, Daniel has found roughly half a dozen opportunities to remind his little brother that he saved his life. Brothers will be brothers, and I rejoice in the knowledge that they will still be reminiscing about Daniel’s heroism and Christian’s lucky escape over a pint in the pub when they are grown men. Surely it is high time the EU rubber stamps this important legislation governing blinds. And that parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles fully comprehend the lethal danger hanging at our windows.","At least 25 children in Britain have been strangled to death by cord blinds since 1999 .

Helping hand: A report by the University of Buffalo found that being generous to friends, neighbours and relatives can improve our health . It has long been said that it’s better to give than receive. Now scientists have revealed that the benefits of generosity extend beyond a warm glow. Providing tangible help to others appears to protect our health and lengthens our lives, they claim. A five-year study of 846 individuals found that when dealing with stressful situations, those who had helped others during the previous year were less likely to die than those who had not. Stressful experiences included such things as serious illness, burglary, job loss, financial difficulties or death of a family member. Respondents reported the amount of time in the past 12 months they had spent helping friends, neighbours or relatives not living with them by providing transport, running errands, doing shopping, performing housework, looking after children and other tasks. Michael J. Poulin, of the University at Buffalo in the US, said: ‘This study offers a significant contribution…to our understanding of how giving assistance to others may offer health benefits to the giver by buffering the negative effects of stress.’ He added: ‘Our conclusion is that helping others reduced mortality specifically by buffering the association between stress and mortality.' He added: 'As the title of our study indicates we tested the hypothesis that providing help to others . would predict a reduced association between stress and mortality for the . helpers. 'Specifically, over the five years of the study, we found that . when dealing with stressful situations, those who had helped others . during the previous year were less likely to die than those who had not . helped others.' The five-year study of 846 individuals found that when dealing with stressful situations, those who had helped others during the previous year were less likely to die than those who had not . He said: 'When we adjusted for age, baseline health . and functioning and key psychosocial variables, the Cox . proportional hazard models (the most widely used method of survival . analysis) for mortality revealed a significant interaction between . helping behavior, stressful events, morbidity and mortality. 'Our conclusion is that helping others reduced mortality . specifically by buffering the association between stress and mortality. 'These findings go beyond past analyses to indicate that the health . benefits of helping behavior derive specifically from stress-buffering . processes and provide important guidance for . understanding why helping behavior specifically may promote health and, . potentially, for how social processes in general may influence health. The study – in conjunction with Stony Brook University and Grand Valley State University – points out that although it is known that social isolation and stress have significant impacts on health, research has failed to establish whether receiving support from others helps protect individuals from stress in the same way as ‘givers’. The report will be published in the American Journal of Public Health.","Scientists from America's University of Buffalo conducted five-year study .

Former president: Edwin 'Kevin' De Boer, 26, has been charged with sexually assaulting a young woman for the second time in three years . A former fraternity president has been charged with drugging and raping a woman in his second sex assault charge in just three years. Prosecutors say Edwin 'Kevin' De Boer, 26, spiked a woman's drink with a sedative during a date last November before taking her back to his apartment in Federal Way, Washington and having his way with her. Three years ago in 2009 De Boer was similarly accused of raping a woman at a University of Washington fraternity house where he was president, a charge he struck a plea deal with to spare him from registering as a sex offender. De Boer pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment according to the deal, dropping a charge of rape. Today a second woman tells police that she consensually went out for dinner and drinks with him in Tacoma late last year but doesn’t entirely remember how it ended, SeattlePi reports. The woman told police the last thing she remembers was sitting at a table with beer and appetizers before waking up naked and in pain in De Boer's apartment. She said she spoke with De Boer briefly before leaving his place and going to a nearby hospital for a sexual assault examination at the advice and help of her sister. The exam found she had ingested a potent sedative that causes amnesia. Photos also taken during the exam backed her claim of rape. Previous crime: In 2009 De Boer, right, was accused of raping a woman at a fraternity house where he was president, a charge he struck a plea deal with finding him instead guilty of harassment . New charge: In November a woman says she went on a date with De Boer, second from right, but blacked out half-way through before waking up to find herself naked and in pain . When the woman asked De Boer what happened, he denied giving her any sedative but admitted to sexually assaulting her, according to police. The woman told police she had never blacked out before and did not plan on having sex with De Boer during their date together. During their date the woman claims De Boer had briefly mentioned another woman he had been seeing while president of his fraternity but who had 'gone crazy' on him. In July of 2009 that possibly same woman, a 21-year-old, accused him of raping her during a fraternity party after a series of advances by De Boer that were unsuccessful. The woman told a court that after several shots of liquor De Boer first tried making out with her on the steps of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity house but was turned down. Attack: In July of 2009 a 21-year-old accused the former Phi Kappa Theta president of raping her inside the room of their fraternity house, pictured . Punishment: De Boer was removed from University of Washington's fraternity following the 2009 charge, the campus pictured, while also given a suspended sentence, probation and ordered to 15 days of community service . She said he later pulled her into a room and demanded oral sex from her. When she refused he allegedly pushed her onto a bed and raped her. A detective told a court that De Boer claimed the woman only changed her mind while they were already having sex. He later said she was just upset that he didn't take precautions to ensure she didn't get pregnant. 'The defense counsel and I together interviewed 11 witnesses,' the detective later told a court according to Seattle Pi. 'None of the witnesses saw [the woman] kiss, touch or show any interest in Mr De Boer, so it appears that Mr De Boer is not being truthful.' The allegations presented before an ‘administrative hearing’ involving fraternity members and alumni led to De Boer’s removal from their fraternal chapter. De Boer was given a suspended sentence, probation and ordered to 15 days of community service following the plea deal. Today he faces a second-degree rape charge over the November report. He has been jailed on $300,000 bail while pleading not guilty to his current charges.","In 2009 Edwin 'Kevin' De Boer, now 26, was accused of raping a woman at his fraternity house at the University of Washington .

Wrestling has been dropped from the 2020 Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee in a surprise decision that removes one of the oldest Olympic sports. The IOC executive board decided to retain modern pentathlon - the event considered most at risk - and remove wrestling instead from its list of 25 'core sports ' on Tuesday in a move that sent waves of outrage throughout the wrestling community. Should wrestling be dropped from the Olympic Games? Rulon Gardner, the 2000 gold and 2004 bronze U.S. medalist told TMZ he was 'appalled' at the news saying, 'as a two time Olympian, I think it's a shame to drop the sport of wrestling, one of the original Olympic Sports.' The IOC board acted after reviewing the 26 sports on the current Olympic program. Eliminating one sport allows the International Olympic Committee to add a new sport to the program later this year.

Original titans: Rulon Gardner of the USA took the bronze medal in the men's Greco-Roman wrestling in the Athens 2004 Summer Olympic Games seen here while today is expressing his fury over the IOC's decision . Appalled: Gardner who retired after his 2004 bronze medal said he was 'appalled' at the IOC's decision to drop wrestling from their sports . Wrestling, which combines freestyle and Greco-Roman events, goes back to the inaugural modern Olympics in Athens in 1896. 'This is a process of renewing and renovating the program for the Olympics,' IOC spokesman Mark Adams said. 'In the view of the executive board, this was the best program for the Olympic Games in 2020. It's not a case of what's wrong with wrestling, it is what's right with the 25 core sports.' Among those also immediately voicing their upset over the decision included 2012 U.S. gold medalist Jordan Ernest Burroughs from New Jersey. 'It's not over yet. We will keep fighting to save the sport we love. Don't stop dreaming and don't stop believing. #SaveOlympicWrestling,' he Tweeted on Tuesday. Reminding of the sport's history while also voicing his upset was Matt Valenti, a two-time NCAA Division I U.S. champion wrestler who Tweeted: . 'Ancient Olympic wrestlers would sometimes fight to the death. IOC better understand we're ready to do that again.' U.S. medalists: Jordan Burroughs, left, took home a gold medal in freestyle wrestling at last year's London Games along with Jacob Varner, right .

Fighters: Akzhurek Tanatarov of Kazakhstan holds Ramazan Sahin of Turkey during the Men's Freestyle 66 kg Wrestling bronze medal fight at last year's 2012 Olympic Games . Adams said the decision was made by secret ballot over several rounds, with members voting each time on which sport should not be included in the core group. IOC President Jacques Rogge did not vote. Wrestling is one of the original Olympic sports included in all but one Olympic competition since 1896 . Sumerian cave drawings in Mesopotamia can link the sport to more than 7,000 years ago . In Greek mythology Zeus wrestled Cronus, his father, to win possession of the universe. That triumphant win furthermore was celebrated by making it the last and determining event in the ancient Olympic Games’ pentathlon . After a 1,500-year hiatus the Olympic Games were resurrected in 1896, implementing Greco-Roman wrestling - upper-torso restricted - into their program . In the 1904 St Louis games freestyle wrestling was introduced, allowing players to use their legs to attach and defend above and below the waist . In 2004 women competed in wrestling for the first time with Japan taking home two golds, a silver and a bronze . At the 2012 Games, more than 340 wrestlers competed for medals in 18 events . Only four other sports of track and field, cycling, gymnastics and swimming have been in more Olympic Games . Wrestling was voted out from a final group that also included modern pentathlon, taekwondo and field hockey, officials familiar with the vote told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the voting details were not made public. The board voted after reviewing a report by the IOC program commission report that analyzed 39 criteria, including television ratings, ticket sales, anti-doping policy and global participation and popularity. With no official rankings or recommendations contained in the report, the final decision by the 15-member board was also subject to political, emotional and sentimental factors. The international wrestling federation, . known by the French acronym FILA, is headed by Raphael Martinetti and is . based in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. Calls to the federation for . comment were not immediately returned. Wrestling featured 344 athletes competing in 11 medal events in freestyle and seven in Greco-Roman at last year's London Olympics. Women's wrestling was added to the Olympics at the 2004 Athens Games. The U.S. took home four medals last year in wrestling: two gold and two bronze. Wrestling will now join seven other sports in applying for inclusion in 2020. The others are a combined bid from baseball and softball, karate, squash, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding and wushu. They will be vying for a single opening in 2020. Though there's still a chance . wrestling could be spared depending on a September vote by the IOC, Gardner says . 'seeing the hardship baseball has been through, I am not too confident.' He adds, 'I don't think we have heard the end of this.' Beginnings: Heracles, whose father Zeus won possession of the universe through a wrestling match, is depicted here wrestling with the Libyan giant Antaeus on this pottery dating back to 515 or 510 BC . Legacy: Images of two men wrestling on a Greek Vase dated to 1813 are seen here, with the sport found dating back to more than 7,000 years ago . Original Games: This stadium in Olympia, Greece is where the ancient Olympic Games and the Heraia, the women's games in honour of Hera, were held . The IOC executive board will meet in May in St. Petersburg, Russia, to decide which sport or sports to propose for 2020 inclusion. The final vote will be made at the IOC session, or general assembly, in September in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is extremely unlikely that wrestling would be voted back in so soon after being removed by the executive board. - Matt Valenti, two-time NCAA Division I U.S. champion wrestler . 'Today's decision is not final,' Adams said. 'The session is sovereign and the session will make the final decision.' The last sports removed from the Olympics were baseball and softball, voted out by the IOC in 2005 and off the program since the 2008 Beijing Games. Golf and rugby will be joining the program at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. Previously considered under the closest scrutiny was modern pentathlon, which has been on the Olympic program since the 1912 Stockholm Games. It was created by French baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic movement, and combines fencing, horse riding, swimming, running and shooting. Ancient Greek Cup dating back to 530 BC is seen here showing two athletes wrestling . Egyptians: In Egypt tombs have been found featuring drawings showing how to wrestle, like this one seen, with some dating back to 2500 BC . Klaus Schormann, president of governing body UIPM, lobbied hard to protect his sport's Olympic status and it paid off in the end. 'We have promised things and we have delivered,' he said after Tuesday's decision. 'That gives me a great feeling. It also gives me new energy to develop our sport further and never give up.' Modern pentathlon also benefited from the work of Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., the son of the former IOC president who is a UIPM vice president and member of the IOC board. 'We were considered weak in some of the scores in the program commission report but strong in others,' Samaranch told the AP. 'We played our cards to the best of our ability and stressed the positives. Tradition is one of our strongest assets, but we are also a multi-sport discipline that produces very complete people.'

A former California attorney has been arrested for the murder of his ex-wife nearly seven years after she was strangled and thrown off a cruise ship during a trip meant to rekindle their failed marriage. Lonnie Kocontes was arrested in Safety Harbor, Florida on Friday night and indicted with the 2006 murder of Micki Kanesaki, 52, whose body was found after washing ashore in southwest Italy. Kocontes told police that Kanesaki, whom he was divorced from at the time, left their cabin around 1 a.m. for a cup of tea on May 26 but never returned. He later suggested she may have been suicidal. Scroll down for video . Mystery: In May of 2006 the body of Micki Kanesaki, pictured, was found washed ashore in southwest Italy one day after reported missing by her ex-husband from their passing cruise ship . Open investigation: Lonnie Kocontes, left, was arrested on Friday night and indicted with Kanesaki's murder, seen right after a domestic assault arrest in 2003, nearly seven years after her death . Kanesaki's body was found the next day after washing on shore in Calabria, in southwest Italy. At the time investigators suggested that foul play was not involved but an autopsy later revealed she had been strangled, KCAL reports. Kocontes said the cruise was meant to rekindle their failed marriage that withstood both . her two-time arrest for domestic assault and his for sexual acts and lewd . conduct on a child - his charges later dropped. Kocontes told authorities that his ex-wife had previously talked of committing suicide suggesting it as a possible reason for her death. That was a claim her mother fiercely denied. 'There's no reason to believe it was a suicide,' her mother Setsuko Kanesaki told the OC Register through a translator in 2006. She said her daughter appeared particularly upbeat before their trip and had plans to see them after her return. Kanesaki's father also told KCAL in 2006 he suspected Kocontes had something to do with it. 'I was committed to this woman,' Kocontes told the LA Times just after her death. 'I loved her with all my heart. I wish I never had gone on the cruise.' Rocky romance: The cruise was meant to rekindle their failed marriage that spanned both her arrest for domestic assault and his for sexual acts and lewd conduct on a child, Kanesaki seen here . Smooth sailing: Kocontes told authorities that the couple were working to rekindle their failed marriage and during their Mediterranean cruise hadn't fought but instead discussed getting remarried that November (file photo) The couple divorced after six years of marriage in 2002 but continued to live together in the Southern California house they both legally owned for a few years after their split. During this time Kanesaki was arrested for domestic violence and ordered to attend a program with Kocontes. After her second arrest in January of 2003 for kicking her ex-husband in the leg, she enrolled herself in anger management classes as well as an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Kocontes had his own arrests as well including the 1999 arrest for sexual acts and lewd conduct on a girl under . 16. Those charges were dropped after the girl allegedly became too distraught to testify in court, the LA Times reports. Home: The couple who divorced after six years of marriage in 2002 continued to live together in this Southern California house they both legally owned and later fought over its sale . Denial: Kanesaki's family denied allegations that their daughter was suicidal with her father, seen here in 2006, saying he believed Kocontes might have something to do with it . After their divorce Kocontes later briefly remarried for a few months and around the fall of 2005 he asked a judge to force Kanesaki to sell their Landera Ranch home and split the proceeds. That case was dismissed after both failed to show up in court. Just several months later they embarked on the cruise that was said to have been an effort to give their marriage another go. Kocontes told police their relationship was getting better and they weren't fighting on the trip but instead discussed remarrying that November. Kocontes will be sent back to Orange County, California to face his charges of murder. It’s still not clear what new evidence has been collected to indict him of the charges nearly seven years later.

Whether they are trying to prove their manliness, their style credentials, or it is just sheer laziness, there appears to be a resurgence of facial hair amongst men and actor Hugh Jackman is leading the way. The Les Miserables star has topped a poll to find the celebrity with the sexiest facial hair - while onetime heartthrob Brad Pitt is deemed to have the worst. Jackman - nominated for Best Actor at Sunday's Academy Awards for the musical movie  - pipped Silver Linings Playbook star Bradley Cooper to the top spot. Best beard: Hugh Jackman was voted as having the sexiest beard while Brad Pitt, who usually tops the best looking charts, came bottom . David Beckham came third and George Clooney was fourth. The survey also looked at the celebrities with the unsexiest facial hair. Brad Pitt topped this poll with Joaquin Phoenix in second and Duran Duran star Simon Le Bon - pictured recently with a weird handlebar moustache - in third place. The survey also found that 62 per cent of men reckon they look sexier with some kind of facial hair - either a beard, moustache or designer stubble. But the same poll found that only 35 per cent of women like men with fuzzy faces - with designer stubble (48 per cent of women like it) far more popular with women than beards (just 18 per cent like them) or moustaches (15 per cent). Facial hair faux pas: Bradley Cooper just missed out on the top spot while Joaquin Phoenix was at the bottom end of the list . Surgeon Asim Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic who carried out the research said: 'Hugh Jackman looks great whatever kind of facial hair he has - stubble, a moustache or a beard.' Dr Shahmalak, hair loss expert on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies who has treated Callum Best, said that beards have never been more fashionable and one of the main reasons is because they make men feel more manly. He said: 'For many men, growing a beard or designer stubble defines their masculinity. It is not surprising that more than six out of ten believe they look sexier with some form of facial hair. 'But they might want to pay attention to what the women in their life are saying - they clearly don't like that manly look quite as much as their partners.' Boom: People are desperate to get sideburns like Olympian Bradley Wiggins and even John Lewis have roped in a bearded man for their latest campaign . Crown Clinic saw a surge in bookings last year from men who wanted to get their sideburns bolstered with hair transplants so that they could look like Olympic hero Bradley Wiggins. Wayne Rooney has also sparked a boom in hair transplants for under-30s - with a 25 per cent increase in booklngs since the Manchester United striker had his op. Dr Shahmalak added: 'Men want to look like their heroes. Sadly they can't always naturally grow a perfect full beard like Hugh Jackman or have bushy sideburns like Bradley Wiggins. 'They will have often patches in their facial hair. 'That is where a transplant clinic like ours can help - we can fill in their gaps and help men to get the look they desire.'

Jodi Arias admitted to killing ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander on Wednesday but said she could not remember stabbing him 27 times or whether she had slit his throat with a kitchen knife. On the most explosive day of her murder trial, Arias testified that there was a 'huge gap' in her memory from June 4, 2008 - the day that Alexander died at his Mesa, Arizona home. Arias told jurors that she and Alexander had been taking naked pictures in his shower when she dropped his camera, causing him to erupt in a rage, body-slamming her against the tiles and threatening to kill her. Scroll down for video . In tears: Jodi Arias cried on the stand throughout her testimony on Wednesday as she told how she ran away from Travis Alexander and threatened him with his own gun in an effort to make him stop . The big moment: Arias said that she does not remember stabbing him 27 times with the knife or dragging his body into the shower before fleeing the scene and trying to 'cover her tracks' She said that she managed to roll out of the bathroom and ran through . Alexander’s home to escape as he chased her. She went to hide in his closet when she remembered that was where Alexander hid his gun. 'He was angry at me and he wasn't going to stop,' she said. 'It was like mortal terror.' The 32-year-old told the court on Wednesday that she pointed the weapon at him but never meant to pull . the trigger. ‘I pointed it at him with both of my hands I thought that would stop him, if someone pointed a gun at me it would stop me,’ she tearfully told the Phoenix court. ‘The gun went off i didn’t mean to shoot him or anything I didn’t even think i was on the trigger. ‘He lunged at me and we fell really hard against the tile toward the other wall… so at this point i didn’t even know if he had been shot. ‘After the gun went off I thought ''crap because now he's really going to be pissed'' because I didn’t know I had shot him.’ Arias said that she blacked out at several points that day and has no memory of stabbing Alexander 27 times with his own kitchen knife - before putting the instrument in the dishwasher. The murder suspect said that it was the same knife that her on-off lover had brought upstairs earlier in the day to cut rope that he had used to bind her wrists during a graphic sex session. Distress: Arias struggled through her testimony on Wednesday as the court heard explosive details of how she killed Travis Alexander in his Mesa home in 2008 . She said: ‘I have a few memories but nothing is super clear. I have a vague memory of putting the knife in the dishwasher, but I put the knife in the dishwasher before but I'm pretty sure it was that night. ‘I remember I was in the bathroom. I . remember dropping the knife and it clang to the tile, it made a big . noise, and i just remember screaming. I don't remember anything after . that.’ She said when she left the home, she 'didn't think Travis was alive but hoped he was'. She was asked by her defense attorney why she did not call 911. Arias answered: 'I was scared. I couldn't imagine calling 911 and telling them what I had just done. I was scared of what would happen to me.' Arias told the court she also remembered disposing of Alexander's gun in the desert on her way from Arizona to California. She also told the courtroom that to 'throw the scent off for a little while' she began to form an alibi - leaving a voice mail on Alexander's phone and traveling to see a friend in Utah. For seven days, Arias has answered in detail to questions from the defense including about the sordid . sexual relationship that she had with Alexander. Wednesday was the . first time that she spoke about the moment when Alexander died. Arias is facing the death . penalty if convicted of the first-degree murder of 30-year-old . Alexander. She had claimed that she killed him in self-defense. The prosecution said that she killed her lover in a jealous rage. Throughout . the trial, Arias has painted a picture of how she was allegedly mentally . and emotionally abused by Alexander who she described as hot-headed and . aggressive. She also said that he tried to kill her once before. Hiding spot: Arias ran from the bathroom into Alexander's closet which had two exits in order to get away from him, but then she remembered where he hid his gun on the top shelf of his closet . The scene: The defense attorney showed a picture of Alexander's closet and Arias pointed out where he hid his gun on a top shelf which she knew because she cleaned it previously when she was working as his maid . Her story: Arias' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed Alexander in self-defense and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail . The focus of Wednesday’s testimony was the events of June 4, 2008. Arias' mother wiped her eyes while in court while Travis Alexander's two sisters looked down as their brother's last moments were described. After a long road trip from her home in California, Arias had decided to stop by Alexander’s house in Mesa, Arizona and spend two nights. After the first court recess, Arias went on . to describe what happened following Alexander's death on June 4. She began developing alternate versions of events which she told police investigator Esteban Flores when he questioned her repeatedly about the murder. Firstly, she said that she was not in . Arizona at the time of his death and later that a man and a woman broke . into his home and attacked Alexander. Arias said on Wednesday: 'I began to . tell him things that I thought would comport with what the forensics . would show as well as create-not an excuse but- create a way that would . have me not have been responsible for it.' Emotional: Arias said that her actions following the murder- which included driving to Las Vegas, spending time with another romantic interest, and leaving voicemails on Alexander's phone- were to 'throw them off the scent' Final moments: She got choked up when she was shown one of the pictures she took of Alexander during their shower photo shoot, and she was unsure whether or not that was the final picture she took of him . Hardest day: Alexander's sisters looked down as Arias told of the moment he was killed . Support: Arias' mother was seen wiping her eyes with tissues at different points during the testimony . As for her rationale as to why she would develop the story that a man and a woman broke into the house, she said that it was both practical (‘Flores told me repeatedly that it had to have been more than one person’) and symbolic. She said: ‘It sounds a little esoteric but it could have been symbolic: it’s like Travis and I were the ones fighting that day.' She said that she attended Alexander's memorial service to keep up appearances and wanted to go to his funeral but was unable to make it. ‘I thought that if I didn’t show up it would look suspicious because Travis and I were close and a lot of people knew that,’ she said. Another reason she wanted to attend was because during their relationship, the pair had a conversation about what Alexander would do if she were ever to die. Arias told the court: ‘He was going to give a eulogy if I ever died… he said he would have come to mine even if it was in Antarctica.' Contemplation: Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi works out his next move as his client Jodi Arias explains to the court how she killed lover Travis Alexander . She also explained today why, in all the times she spoke about her relationship with Alexander prior to the trial, she never mentioned his alleged violence, their sexual relationship or his supposed sexual fantasies about children. She said: ‘I was very concerned about both of our reputations and I didn't want to start throwing him under the bus so to speak because there were already people hurting and I didn’t see what benefit it would be to talk about those things.' During the time between the June 4 murder and her arrest on July 15, Arias purchased a gun. Her defense lawyer Kirk Nurmi repeatedly asked her about whether or not she tried to kill herself following the murder, though she said that the purchase of her gun had nothing to do with her suicide plans. ‘I wanted to someday see myself being a responsible gun owner so that was something I had always seen myself doing,’ she said. Following a short afternoon recess, Arias discussed interviews that she had done while in prison with CBS and Inside Edition where she said she was 'under the microscope at that point'. Arias said that she felt pressured by a sheriff's officer to do the interview with Inside Edition against her attorney's advice. During this interview she said: 'No jury will ever convict me'. Her attorney asked her on Wednesday why she had said those words to which Arias explained that she had seen them used on a TV crime drama and that they appeared to be 'powerful' and 'eloquent'. She also told the court that she planned to commit suicide in prison. ‘I took [a razor] apart one night with intentions of slitting my wrists… I asked for extra laundry because there was someone sleeping below me so that I could stuff it around my body because I didn’t want anything to get on her. I couldn’t bring myself to do it,' she said. The defense ended questioning today. The trial resumes at 10am on Thursday.","Jodi Arias said she shot Travis Alexander using his gun during a fight .

But despite the concerns over flooding, the good news is that the chance of unpopular water restrictions being introduced is very low. The Environment Agency said the chance of a hosepipe ban this year is 'extremely unlikely'. The . huge amount of rain in 2012 means that the South-East - the region most . at risk from drought - has enough water to get through two 'dry' winters, according to the Agency.

Infamous: Letters belonging to Black Widow killer Mary Ann Cotton, who was hanged in 1873 for murdering her seven-year-old stepson Charles, will go on sale next week . A set of desperate letters penned by a 19th Century poisoner known infamously as the 'Black Widow' before she was executed will be sold at auction next week. Serial killer Mary Ann Cotton was hanged in March 1873 for murdering her seven-year-old stepson Charles with arsenic. Cotton, who married four times, was suspected of poisoning 21 people in total, including her own children, husband, lovers and mother. At the time of her death, three other murder charges and an accusation of bigamy were left to lie on file. Until Harold Shipman, Cotton, of West Auckland, County Durham, was Britain's most prolific mass murderer and is regarded as Britain's first serial killer. Three of her husbands died suddenly of 'intestinal disorders' or 'gastric fever' and she went on to collect insurance payments on their lives - but her third, James Robinson, grew suspicious when she insisted he take out life  insurance. Their daughter, Isabella, died after suffering stomach pains in 1868, and he threw Cotton out after discovering she had been forcing his children to pawn  items of value in his house. It was a short while later the police caught up with her. Now letters written by the killer as she awaited being taken to the gallows are set to go to auction next week. The series of eight notes offer a fascinating insight into her desperation as she prepared for her impending execution and made instructions to her solicitors. Paul Hughes, of Tennants auctioneers in Leyburn, North Yorkshire, who are holding the sale, said: 'It is very unusual to get letters like this, and they show she has no control over events unfolding outside her cell. 'When the letters start in July 1872, she was quite literate and her handwriting is quite strong, but as she becomes more and more desperate her grammar, spelling and handwriting all start to go and by February 1873 she was  really struggling.' Artifacts: The set of letters and a bible are a fascinating insight into the mind of one of Britain's most notorious serial killers . On February 11, 1873 – a month after the birth of her 12th child – Mrs Cotton writes to Mr Lowrey, a pitman and stranger who lodged with her for a week before her arrest. She relied on him to conduct her affairs while she was in prison and here asks for money to buy clothes for her child. Six weeks later she was hanged . 'Dear sir I take the opportunity of writing to you hoping to find you well as it leaves me improving every day a little strength... .... I wish to know if you have given Smith any money if you have knot would you be so kind as to try to send me a little as I want sum to get the child sum close (sic) with as she has knon to come out with please write by return of post you can send either stamps..' The letters are on paper stamped: 'County Gaol, Durham,' and were sent to William Lowrey in West Auckland. Mr Lowrey, a pitman, was a stranger who lodged with Mrs Cotton in Front Street  for a week before she was arrested on July 18, 1872. His descendants are selling the letters he received and the unusual lot are expected to fetch between £300 - £500. Although their acquaintance was brief, Mrs Cotton relied on Mr Lowrey to conduct her affairs while she was incarcerated. In one of her most desperate letters, she laments that 'Ie have kn no frends of my one' (sic). The eight letters begin with confident, fluent handwriting as she instructs Mr Lowrey to employ a solicitor and to round up named witnesses who 'will be able to say how I treated the child'. By October 1872, things are going wrong. George Smith her solicitor of Bishop Auckland had sold her 'bed, carpets, knives (and) forks box and some little thing,' for £13 to pay for her legal costs, but when he finds she is to be charged with mass murder, he finds himself out of his depth. Notes: The neat letters were written in the final weeks of her life and she was suspected of poisoning 21 people in total, including her own children, husband, lovers and mother . Pen pal: Cotton wrote to pit man William Lowrey, who was a stranger, but ended up helping handle her estate . Mary Ann Cotton was hanged in 1873 at Durham Jail after she was accused of killing 21 people . Until Dr Harold Shipman (pictured) Cotton was Britain's most prolific mass murderer . The trial of Mrs Cotton, who wed four times and had numerous lovers, was delayed so she could give birth to her 12th child, a daughter, whose descendants still live in County Durham. On February 11, 1873, a month after the birth, Mrs Cotton writes to Mr Lowrey for money. She wrote: 'I want sum to get the child sum close as she has knon' (sic). Six weeks later, she was executed. Also in the lot, which will be auctioned on Wednesday and which and which has an estimate of between £300 and £500, is a bible. Mr Hughes said: 'I see these basic bibles on a regular basis and they're almost worthless, yet in the front of this one is written: 'Bought of Mrs Cotton, William Lowrey.' It appears to have belonged to Mrs Cotton's fourth husband, Frederick Cotton whom she married bigamously in Newcastle in September 1870 and who died of 'gastric fever'- in December 1871. In the Bible, Mr Cotton who moved around the country wrote a morbid verse: 'Frederick Cotton is my name, England is my nation. Wisbeach is my dwelling place and Christ is my salvation. 'When I am dead and in the grave and all my bones are rotten, take this bible and keep it clean, until I (am) quite forgotten.' The letters will go up to auction  at noon at Leyburn auction centre.","Mary Ann Cotton hanged in 1873 for killing stepson, but had 21 total victims .

Despite his playboy persona, Prince Harry has made no secret of his desire to settle down if he could find the the 'right person' who was 'willing to take on the job'. Now it seems he has found 'The One' in the form of  Cressida Bonas, a member of the so called  BBB Crew - Blue-Bloods And Blonde - who he has been dating since last year. Despite being coy when quizzed about his love life while in Afghanistan at the end of last year, the Prince made no secret of his affection for the 24 year old beauty this week as they were pictured embracing on the slopes during a ski holiday with his uncle Prince Andrew and family. Public display of affection: Prince Harry embraces Cressida Bonas on the ski slopes in Switzerland this week . In love: The couple are said to be 'keen to spend as much time together as possible' Family friend: Cressida, pictured with Sarah Ferguson, has long been acquainted with her princess daughters . Now the pair are set to attend the wedding of Cressida's half-sister, Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, who is marrying Sir Richard Branson's businessman son Sam in South Africa next week. A source told today's Sun that the Prince is keen to accompany Cressida to the wedding because: 'Harry and Cressie are at . the exciting stage of a relationship where they just want to spend as . much time together as possible.' Date night: The blue blood blonde was first linked to the Prince last May when they were seen leaving a night club together . Girlfriend in waiting: Prince Harry has been coy about their relationship until now . Wedding bells: The couple are due to attend the wedding of Sam Branson to Cressida's half sister Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe . As any woman in a fledgling . relationship will know, a beau agreeing to attend a family wedding with . you is a promising sign of commitment. So while Harry, 28, may be a long way . from popping the question himself, his recent behaviour suggests he's . now prepared for Cressida to go from being his casual date to filling . the role of royal girlfriend. Indeed, before his trip to . Afghanistan, friends of privately-educated Cressida had joked that she . was his 'girlfriend-in-waiting'. Given the intense press interest in . royal love lives and the impact Harry has seen it have on the life of . his late mother Princess Diana, and more recently the Duchess of . Cambridge, it's no surprise he has wanted to shield Cressida from the . public gaze for as long as possible. Blue-blood: Cressida with her mother Lady Mary Gaye at the Macmillan . Cancer Relief Dog Day held at the Royal Hospital Chelsea South Grounds . in July 2003 . The fact his long-term relationship . with Chelsy Davy broke down because she wasn't prepared for a life in . the global spotlight could have also played on his mind. But according to the Evening . Standard's royal correspondent, Robert Jobson, Harry's public display of . affection with Cressida this week was 'a clear message of intent' from . the media savvy prince. That message being, 'she's my girl, and I don't . care who knows.' While being the subject of global media attention is new to Cressida, mingling with the rich, famous and royal, is not. She is friends with both Princess . Beatrice and Eugenie, joining the former in the world record attempt to . complete the London Marathon in a human caterpillar in 2010, while the . latter is said to have introduced her to Harry. Royal circles: Cressida Bonas (second from right) went to Ascot in 2010 with friends Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie . Record breaker: Cressida, bottom right, joined Princess Beatrice in a human caterpillar to complete the London Marathon in 2010 . She is the daughter of renowned Sixties It girl Lady Mary Gaye Curzon (whose father was the 6th Earl Howe) and Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas (her mother's third husband) owns a fabric company . called MacCulloch & Wallis. Her parents have racked up six . marriages between them so Cressida has a number of half brothers and . sisters including soon-to-be a Branson, Isabella, who was once admired . by Prince William, and Gabriella Wilde, a model for Burberry. Following her parent's separation, Cressida continued to enjoy a privileged upbringing as her bohemian mother then married multi-millionaire Christopher Shaw. Cressida attended £30,000-a-year Stowe School in Buckingham where she showed a flair for acting as well as sport. She was said to be one of the most popular girls at the sixth form because of her zest for fun and free spirit. Fun: The dance student, left and far right, loves music festivals and socialising with friends . ‘It was non-stop laughter and . mischief for two years,’ her school friend told the Daily Mail last . year. ‘Our group of girls were all quite different and arty, which is . more Cress.’ She then attended Leeds University where she studied for a degree in dance and had another boyfriend with royal connections - Harry . Wentworth-Stanley – whose stepfather, George Milford Haven, is a cousin . of the Queen. Dancing is the blonde's passion and she now studies contemporary dance at The Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich. In the spotlight: The world's media will now be watching Cressida . She is said to dislike the London . Sloane party scene usually popular with the upper classes and instead . prefers letting her hair down at music festivals. Her friends say, 'when not in the studio she's out on the tennis court or up a mountain with her skis.'

"By . Alex Jones . PUBLISHED: . 14:02 EST, 22 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:02 EST, 22 February 2013 . TV presenter Alex Jones, who is currently fronting Let's Dance for Comic Relief, was recently invited to visit Malawi in Africa to see how money raised by the charity is helping make a difference to the lives of families there. During her stay, the 35 year old was shocked to learn that millions of children around the world are dying from diarrhoea, an illness that can be treated quickly here in the UK. As she recalls in her own words below, she was moved to tears when she met one mother who had lost her two year old daughter after she became  sick with diarrhoea from drinking dirty water... Tragic: Alex at the graveside of two year old Miracle who died because her diarrhoea could not be treated . Emotional: The presenter was shocked that so many mothers like Angelina, pictured, are losing their children to treatable illnesses . It’s early morning and I’m driving through lush green mountains to reach a rural village called Muyayano, enveloped by fields of tobacco and maize. Although beautiful, the stunning scenery masks the real hardship that people here are facing. It’s the rainy season and while the crops are thriving, the 400 families in this village are struggling to find enough food to eat while they wait for the next harvest. I’m visiting during the hunger months, which bite between January to March when two million of the country’s 16 million population regularly go without food. The wet weather also means that they have to deal with a sharp rise in cases of malaria and diarrhoea. Preventable: Alex hopes people will donate to charity so less families will suffer in the future . Comfort: Alex said she struggled to imagine what Angelina must have been through . In this village alone, I’m told that 84 out of 89 households have experienced childhood deaths or serious illnesses, from preventable diseases like diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria. That’s a truly shocking statistic. I meet Angelina, 23 and her husband Kamlon, 30, who live here with their gorgeous eight month old son Joshua and 10 year old daughter, Fanny. As if conditions aren’t hard enough, . Angelina tells me that the borehole that supplies their clean drinking . water regularly stops working leaving the whole village thirsty. It . means they’re all forced to use the filthy water from the nearby river . to drink, cook and wash their clothes. Not . surprisingly, it makes them all sick with diarrhoea, which leaves their . babies and children dangerously dehydrated, and explains why there are . so many deaths here. Like . other mums, Angelina has no choice but to use the murky river water. She . shows me a bucket full and I know if I drank it, I’d be rushed to . hospital but they have no option. Maternal: Alex hopes to become a mother herself one day . Health risk: But the people in Malawi often have no choice but to drink the dirty water . As she shows me the river, I ask whether her family has suffered much illness. That’s when she tells me that her two year old daughter Miracle died after having diarrhoea from drinking the water. 'It's so awful, I can't stop myself from . crying. I hope to be a mum one day and the thought of losing a child is . just too terrible' I’m completely gob-smacked. I had no idea that she had lost a child due to drinking this water, it’s so awful, I can’t stop myself from crying. I hope to be a mum one day and the thought of losing a child is just too terrible. I put my arm around Angelina and give her a big hug as she describes what happened on that February day in 2009. Tearfully, she tells me that Miracle became poorly with diarrhoea in the afternoon and they took her to a clinic the next day. But it was while she was being transferred to hospital to receive treatment that the terribly weak toddler lost the will to live. It’s utterly heart-breaking to hear and I’m at a loss to know what to say. I look up and see children swimming and playing in the river. It’s such a worrying sight. We take clean drinking water for granted back home. We just go to the kitchen and turn on the tap and there it is. My younger sister Jen has a 14 month old baby called Dash who I absolutely adore. For me the thought of him having to drink this brown disease ridden water and not surviving something like diarrhoea is unthinkable. Hope: Money raised by Comic Relief helps provide clean drinking water for the villagers and vaccines to protect the children from illness . Back home we can treat diarrhoea easily. But it’s one of the leading killers of children worldwide, claiming the lives of around 1.5 million children every year. But despite this grim statistic, there is hope for the future. Thanks to money raised through Red Nose Day, Comic Relief is funding GAVI to purchase more vaccines in Malawi, giving thousands of children a chance of a healthy life. In the UK we’re protected from birth from preventable diseases. Imagine if the children in Africa had the same opportunity. Miracle might still be with us. Eye-opening: Alex with Angelina and her family whose experiences made her realiise how much we take for granted in the UK . My day at Muyayano ends with Angelina and her husband taking me to Miracle’s graveside. It’s a peaceful spot tucked away among the fields of crops and trees. A simple headstone records her short life ‘born 11 September 2007 - died 8 February 2009’. It’s such an incredibly emotional moment. I just can’t believe how unfair it is that a mother with an eight month old son has to visit her two year old daughter’s grave. The rotavirus vaccine came too late for little Miracle and her brother Joshua, but with your help and just a £4 donation to Red Nose Day, we can help to protect thousands of children from easily preventable illnesses like diarrhoea.","TV presenter visited Malawi in Africa for Comic Relief .

Venables and Thompson became notorious in 1993, when they abducted James from a Liverpool shopping centre and tortured him before leaving him for dead on nearby railway tracks. The toddler's disappearance launched a widespread manhunt, and the revelation that his killers were themselves children led to widespread revulsion. The pair were released on parole in 2001, when they were both 18, and were granted almost unprecedented injunctions preventing the publication of their new identities. Thompson has not been heard from since his release, but in 2010 Venables was returned to prison for violating his parole. It was later revealed that Venables had downloaded child pornography and shared images with others. He pleaded guilty to possession and distribution of indecent images of children and was jailed for two years, and is now believed to be in indefinite detention as officials fear he will endanger himself by revealing his true identity if he is released.

Turnbull & Asser made Winston Churchill's siren suit, which he dubbed his 'romper suit', and have made shirts for every lead actor of the James Bond films, from Sean Connery to Daniel Craig. Charles accepted the offer of operating a sewing machine as he was shown around the factory by twin sisters Kath Cope and Bette Elton, who began working for the company in the 1960s. With rows of female workers sat behind him he carefully placed the cloth under the needle. Charles concentrated on the job at hand and fed the material through as the machine whirred away and then laughed as he completed his task.

When asked if he would offer the Prince a job operations manager Shaun Bird, joked: 'I'd give him a six-week trial like anyone else.' During the visit to the factory in Quedgeley, Gloucester, Charles saw one of his shirts go from design to near-finished article.

A drug offering hope to late-stage breast cancer sufferers was approved by the government yesterday. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Kadcyla, which is said to work as a 'smart bomb' on a strain of the disease which is believed to effect one fifth of sufferers. It is a combination of the well-known Herceptin and a chemotherapy drug called DM1. Wonder drug? On Friday the Government approved Kadcyla, a new breast cancer drug which it is hoped can extend the lives of advance stage sufferers of the disease . DM1 is too powerful to go straight into the blood stream but Herceptin works as a carrier delivering it to the cancer cells directly. The drug has been proven effective on HER2-positive breast cancer, a protein which advances cancer growth, adding several months onto the life of many women who were facing death. It was trialled on 991 women with advanced stage HER2-positive breast cancer and found to extend their lives by and average of 5.8 months compared to standard chemotherapy. According to the FDA, 20 per cent of breast cancer sufferers suffer from HER2 protein breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second most deadly type of cancer among American women. This year estimates say 232,340 will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,620 will die as a result of the illness. Makers . of the drug, Genentech, put out a statement saying the drug will be . available in two weeks but NBC reports it is expensive at a cost of . $94,000 for a 10 month course. The company said it would help patients who couldn't afford to make the payments. 'People . who do not have health insurance, or who have reached the lifetime . limit set by their insurance company, might qualify to receive Kadcyla . free of charge,' it said in the statement. Hope: Genentech, the makers of Kadcyla, say the drug on average added almost 6 months onto the lives of advanced-stage breast cancer sufferers . The company say the release is the first of several cancer drugs which they are working on which adopt this 'smart bomb' approach . Chief medical officer and Head of Global Product Development, Hal Barron, said: 'Kadcyla is an antibody-drug conjugate representing a completely new way to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, and it helped people live nearly six months longer. 'We currently have more than 25 antibody-drug conjugates in our pipeline and hope this promising approach will help us deliver more medicines to fight other cancers in the future.'","Kadcyla, a drug which can work on up to 20 per cent of breast cancer sufferers, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration .

When three-year-old Rohid Zamani and his family fled Afghanistan to escape the terrors of the Taliban regime, they could only hope to reach a better place. But never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined such a spectacular outcome for their little boy. While the family have built a new life in Britain, Rohid, now 16, has defied overwhelming odds to win a full scholarship to Eton. Rohid Zamani, 16, who fled Afghanistan to become a student at Sirius Academy, Hull, and now has been accepted for a scholarship at Eton College . His extraordinary story began in the city of Jalalabad, where the Zamanis lived in fear of the extremist Islamic rulers and civil unrest raging around them. Among the horrors they witnessed was a man who was decapitated because he put gel in his hair to style it. ‘He was dragged out in the street and they chopped his head off,’ said Rohid. ‘There were people getting killed for almost no reason. Every day we were afraid.’ His mother narrowly escaped death after briefly getting out of bed when a relative visited while she was ill. Rohid said: ‘Moments after she got up a bomb went off and shattered the windows . 'Level-headed': Rohid Zamani, 16, with his mentor, teacher Adam Rust, right . Rohid can reel off hair-raising tales of murder and violence that were commonplace under the Taliban . Rohid's father held a respected job as a civil engineer designing roads in Afghanistan . Rohid's family fled Afghanistan when he was three. This file picture showing Taliban fighters is from 1997, a year after the religious zealots came to power . ‘The shards of glass fell on the bed. If my mum had been there she would have been dead.’ Rohid’s father, who worked as a civil . engineer, decided to risk everything by fleeing the country with his . wife and two children. Their journey took them across 3,500 miles, including crossing rivers in Russia in a leaking rubber dinghy. Rohid said: ‘My mum was scared we were going to sink. She put her hand on the hole. ‘I was really scared. After that we had to wait for a van and the van broke down so we had to go through a forest. ‘There were wolves and dogs, everybody was just so scared.’ The family also became separated at one point. They spoke no English when they . arrived in Hull but they soon adapted and were allowed to settle in the . UK. And Rohid showed his dedication to learning early on. When the family moved to Birmingham to live near friends, the children weren’t happy. So Rohid, who was ten at the time, . took matters into his own hands and phoned his old primary school . teacher in Hull to ask if he could return. Headmaster Brian Roberts said: ‘I was working in my office late when I got a call from Rohid. Eton College is renowned in the UK as the school of choice for Prime Ministers and Royals . Royal students: Prince William, left, on his first day at Eton and Prince Harry, right, with his house master Dr Andrew Gailey . He said: “Mr Roberts, we are really . unhappy. If we come back to Hull would it be possible to come back to . your school?” I said I was sure it was a strong possibility.’ Rohid's ability also bought him to the attention of both Hull KR and Hull FC, who offered him a scholarship . His plan worked. The family returned to Hull and Rohid later joined the city’s Sirius Academy. As well as being bright and . hard-working, he excelled at rugby league and athletics. When the school . suggested Rohid apply for an Eton scholarship he jumped at the chance . and was among hundreds who took part in a tough four-day interview . process. ‘Luckily I was picked so I must have done OK,’ he said. He starts at sixth form in September, studying A-levels in maths, biology, chemistry and physics.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 13:10 EST, 22 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 22 February 2013 . Nevada has passed an 'historic' bill making it legal to play online poker within the state and with other players across the country. The legislature, Bill AB114, was passed unanimously in both  the Assembly and Senate on Thursday before it was signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval. While the legislation ruled that interstate gambling is now allowed, players from across the country will only be able to play legally once Nevada makes agreements with individual states. The federal Department of Justice has . previously cracked down on sites that let people illegally gamble across states, but Sandoval said he was . confident Nevada was on firm legal footing. 'Historic day': Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, surrounded by state lawmakers in the state's Old Assembly Chambers, signs AB114 legalizing online gambling in Nevada on Thursday . On Thursday, he promised to communicate with the Department of Justice on the language of the agreements made between states. Exactly how the federal government will react to the legislation following its major crackdowns on online gambling sites in the past is yet to be seen. In April 2011, the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office shut down three of the biggest internet poker sites and charged the owners with fraud, money laundering and illegal gambling. The poker companies - including big sites such as PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker - were all based overseas and argued they operate outside the reach of U.S. law, but 11 defendants were accused of the charges. Should online poker be legalized in every state of America? The Nevada bill had been declared an . emergency measure and the process had been somewhat hurried as Nevada . rushed to beat New Jersey Chris Christie, who could sign a similar . legislation next week. AB114 keeps Nevada at the front of the . gambling market, legalizing online gambling for the first time in the . state and potentially netting it millions of dollars in licensing and . other fees. 'This is an historic day for the great . state of Nevada,' Sandoval said, flanked by state lawmakers. 'Today I sign into law the framework that will usher in the next . frontier of gaming in Nevada.' Sandoval, a former chairman of the . Nevada Gaming Commission added, 'This bill is critical to our state's . economy and ensures that we will continue to be the gold standard for . gaming regulation.' The . Wire Act had previously made gambling across state lines illegal, but . in 2011 the Court of Appeals ruled this only applied to sports betting. Law: The bill makes interstate online poker legal for the first time - once other states compact with Nevada . New frontier: The bill will change the landscape of gambling and some fear the impact on smaller casinos . The ruling put Nevada in position to legalize internet . gambling if the federal government sanctioned it - but when those efforts . failed in Congress, Sandoval said Nevada would work toward agreements . with other states. For the bill to reach its potential, Nevada still has to convince other states to partner with it, but officials are reportedly confident that this will not be any issue. Partnering with other states gives . Nevada an expanded customer market and provides other states with . Nevada's expertise in gambling regulation. Pete Ernaut, a lobbyist representing the Nevada Resort Association, said expanding the customer base was key. 'It's imperative for the success of . this that we compact with other states because we don't have a universe . of players,' Ernaut said. The benefit for other states, he said, is Nevada's 'most mature regulatory infrastructure'. 'We . have the most mature financial, auditing and collection capabilities, . much greater than some of those states, and they have the players,' he . said. Beating him to it: The bill was rushed through in Nevada after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured, indicated he could sign a similar legislation next week . AG Burnett, chairman of the Nevada . Gaming Control Board, said the state already has about 20 applications . from operators, equipment and software vendors to be licensed for online . gambling. One Assemblyman, Ira Hansen, voted for the bill but voiced his concern for smaller casinos in Reno, Sparks and Nevada's outback who could be hurt by the bill, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported. 'The smaller casinos in the state, . especially in Northern Nevada, which are already hurting,' he said. 'I'm hoping . this is actually going to be beneficial to them and pick up some new . (business). I just wanted to get on the record that is my concern, for . the little guy in this whole argument.' But supporters of the bill . argued that those casinos too will have the opportunity to enter into . agreements with compacts in other states . The bill means Nevada beat . New Jersey, its East Coast casino rival. Gov. Chris Christie had . previously vetoed an online wagering bill but indicated he may sign an . amended version next week.","State legislation signed on Thursday legalized interstate gambling .

An incredible video shows two tiny autonomous drone quadrocopters throwing and catching a pendulum by its narrow end. Dario Brescianini, a student at ETH Zurich’s Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, developed the complex algorithms which allow the robot quadrocopters to juggle the inverted pendulum. The video shows one incredibly balancing the pendulum on its end as it buzzes around a lab space, then throwing it up into the air to be caught by the other. Aerial acrobatics: These grabs are from an incredible video which shows two tiny autonomous drone quadrocopters throwing and catching a pendulum by its end . Too cool for school: Dario Brescianini, a student at ETH . Zurich’s Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, developed the . complex algorithms which allow the robot quadrocopters to juggle the . inverted pendulum . Instructing the robotic quadrocopters to perform the amazing feat required complex mathematical modelling and a learning algorithm to account for any errors in the model. The researchers modified the quadrocopters themselves by fixing a 12cm plate that could hold the pendulum while balancing, and they also developed shock absorbers to add at the pendulum’s tips. The video they made to showcase their work has proved a hit on YouTube, attracting around 300,000 views and nearly 5,000 'thumbs up' in the two days since Mr Brescianini uploaded it. To achieve the aerobatic feat with the robot drones, Mr Brescianini and his colleagues first made a two-dimensional mathematical model to understand what was required for the pendulum to lift off from the quadrocopter and become airborne. 'It showed the ideal trajectory in terms of positions, speeds, and angles the quadrocopter needed to follow to throw a pendulum,' wrote Markus Waibel on the Robohub blog. 'And it offered an insight into the throwing process, including identification of its key design parameters.' Gone viral: The video the researchers made to . showcase their work has proved a hit on YouTube, attracting around . 300,000 views and nearly 5,000 'thumbs up' in the two days since Mr . Brescianini uploaded it . Perfect balance: The researchers modified the . quadrocopters by fixing a 12cm plate that could hold the pendulum while . balancing, and they also developed shock absorbers to add at the . pendulum's tips . For their next step they had to work out how well this theoretical model matched real life, throwing the pendulum by hand to study its aerodynamic properties and precisely timing the quadrocopters' movements. Then they tested the process of balancing, throwing, catching and rebalancing the pendulum between the two tiny flying machines do adapt their maths to fit. Mr Brescianini said: 'This project was very interesting because it combined various areas of current research and many complex questions had to be answered: . 'How can the pole be launched off the quadrocopter? Where should it be caught and – more importantly – when? What happens at impact? 'The biggest challenge to get the system running was the catching part. We tried various catching manoeuvres, but none of them worked until we introduced a learning algorithm, which adapts parameters of the catching trajectory to eliminate systematic errors.' The throwing manoeuvre: Mr Brescianini and his colleagues first . made a two-dimensional mathematical model to understand what was . required for the pendulum to lift off from the quadrocopter and become . airborne . A major challenge was the demonstration's highly dynamic nature: the total time between the throw and catch is just over half a second, a very short time to manoeuvre the catching quadrocopters into place. A second serious challenge the researchers faced was the high cost of failure. Failed catches tended to result in the pendulum crashing into a rotor blade, sending the quadrocopters plummeting to the ground. 'A crashed quadrocopter not only entailed repairs, but also meant recalibration of the vehicle to re-determine its operating parameters and restarting the learning algorithms,' the Robohub blog reported. The catching manoeuvre: The total time between the throw and catch . is just over half a second, a very short time to manoeuvre the catching . quadrocopters into place . Markus Hehn, a PhD student at ETH Zurich who supervised Mr Brescianini's project, told Robohub: 'This was a really fun project to work on. 'We started off with some back-of-the-envelope calculations, wondering whether it would even be physically possible to throw and catch a pendulum. 'This told us that achieving this manoeuvre would really push the dynamic capabilities of the system. 'As it turned out, it is probably the most challenging task we’ve had our quadrocopters do. 'With significantly less than one second to measure the pendulum flight and get the catching vehicle in place, it’s the combination of mathematical models with real-time trajectory generation, optimal control, and learning from previous iterations that allowed us to implement this.'","Video showing the incredible feat uploaded to YouTube has been viewed nearly 300,000 times .

Police are probing claims that the world's most powerful drugs baron died in a hail of bullets yesterday in a violent jungle shootout with a rival gang in Guatemala.

Mexican soldiers have been dispatched to comb the area for his corpse, which remains missing, and to determine if the alleged gunfight ever even took place. Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez . Bonilla told The Associated Press that police and soldiers would begin . searching on foot and in the air at first light Friday, looking for the . scene of the reported gunfight in Peten province near the border with . Mexico. Authorities initially said on Thursday night that they were investigating whether Guzman was one of at least two men killed in the remote area, but hours later backtracked and said they had only received reports of a battle from local people. Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas first told Guatevision Television that two drug gangs had clashed in Peten, an area that has seen an increase in drug violence and that at least two men had died in the shootout.

'We have to wait for all the . technical information in order to determine if, in fact, one of the dead . is of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman,' Cuevas said. He is the top dog in Mexico's bloody drug war, presiding over a $1billion drug empire and accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed 38,000 people. And in 2011, aside from a personal fortune to rival Bill Gates and Warren . Buffet, Joaquin Guzman Loera was officially named as the . world's most wanted man. Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a Mexican high security prison in a complex break out that reportedly cost him £2.5million. Since then the drug lord known as 'El Chapo' - meaning 'Shorty' - because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture, protected by his vast Sinaloa drugs cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth. He has attained almost mythical status in Mexico vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from Columbia into Mexico and on to the United States. He is accused of starting Mexico's cartel wars when his hitmen . assassinated the leader of the Juarez cartel and his wife in 2004 in a . bid to take control of the city of Cidudad Juarez, breaking the pact of . non-aggression that had previously existed. As tit for tat . fighting escalated, government troops were sent into drug strongholds in . 2006 marking the start of a conflict that has so far claimed . 38,000 lives. Now . El Chapo is said to have infiltrated the highest level of Mexico's . government as President Felipe Calderon fights to keep control of his . country amid claims that such drug lords are . really the ones in charge. Later, Cuevas told Mexico's Televisa . network that authorities hadn't yet found a body or the scene where . reports said a shootout took place. He never said what led officials to think that one of the dead men might be Guzman. But Interior Department spokeswoman . Carla Herrera told The Associated Press that one of the victims . physically resembled the drug lord. She said officials had asked the . Mexican government to send Guzman's fingerprints to compare them to the . man found inside a vehicle and to send investigators. However, Herrera's boss, Lopez Bonilla, told the AP that it was residents of the town of San Francisco who had told officials of a gunbattle and reported that one of the people killed looked like Guzman. 'The fact is we don't have any of this information confirmed,' Lopez Bonilla said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said late Thursday that he had no information on the case. 'I don't have any information that can confirm that,' he told reporters. Peten province is an isolated area of jungle and ranches where 27 ranch workers were massacred in 2011 by the Zetas drug gang, a top rival for Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel. Guzman, who has been in hiding since escaping from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001, is one of the world's most dangerous and most wanted fugitives. Last year,  the U.S. Treasury department named the Mexican drug lord as the 'the world's most powerful drug trafficker'. Then this month Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at $1 billion. Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel . has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building . international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific. And earlier this month, Guzman formally receives the title of Chicago's Public Enemy No. in both the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's first use since Prohibition.

But because I know I’m not it makes me laugh. ‘People are pretty surprised when they find out that I have a masters degree. 'I don’t make a point in telling people but if they find out it’s so funny to see their reaction.’ The graduate actually had her breast implants within two weeks of beginning her BA in law and psychology. Since then she has gone on to attain a masters in fashion marketing, also from Nottingham Trent University, and secure a high-flying job as a social media coordinator for a fashion company.

Research shows that over 65-year-olds could benefit from learning how to use social networking sites . Forget crossword puzzles and scrabble, the way to keep your brain sharp into old age is to get on Facebook, new research suggests. Scientists from the University of Arizona have found that over 65s who use the social networking website performed better in cognitive tests than those who simply surfed the internet or didn't use it all. It's thought the ever-changing nature of the site - such as the constantly rolling updates - may boost mental acuity. Adults who used the site performed about 25 per cent better on tasks designed to measure their ability to . continuously monitor and to quickly add or delete the contents of their working memory – a function known as 'updating'. During the study, 14 adults between 68 and 91 who had either never used the site or used it less than once a month were set up on Facebook. They were instructed to make 'friends' with those in their training group and were asked to post on the site at least once a day. A second group were taught to use online diary site, Penzu.com, in which entries are kept private, with no social sharing component. Before the tests, participants completed a series of tests which assessed their levels loneliness and social support, as well as their cognitive abilities. The assessments were done again at the end of the study, eight weeks later. In the follow-ups, those who had learned to use Facebook performed about 25 per cent better than they did at the start of the study on tasks designed to measure their mental updating abilities. Posting updates on Facebook may improve the cognitive performance of older adults . Participants in the other group saw no significant change in performance. Lead researcher Janelle Wohltmann, from the University of Arizona department of psychology, said: 'The big difference between the online diary and Facebook is that when you create a diary entry, you create the entry, you save it and that's all you see. '[Whereas] if you're on Facebook, several people are posting new things, so new information is constantly getting posted. 'You're seeing this new information coming in, and you need to focus on the new information and get rid of the old information, or keep it in mind if you want to go back and reference it later, so you have to constantly update what's there in your attention.' The researchers said they also see Facebook as a potential alternative to some online games marketed to older people to help boost mental acuity. 'Those games can boring after a while, and this might be a new activity for people to learn that's more interesting and keeps them socially engaged,' said Wohltman. She added that those considering teaching their elderly relatives how to use the social networking site, should also consider their safety. 'It's also important to understand and know about some of the aspects of Facebook that people have concerns about, like how to keep your profile secure,' she said. 'So I wouldn't suggest to anyone to get out and get Granny online right away, unless you or somebody else can provide the proper education and support to that person, so that they can use it in a safe way.'","Adults aged 68-91 performed 25 per cent better in cognitive tests after being taught how to use Facebook .

Aldi and Lidl were the only supermarkets to get four-star ratings for their pricing, with 97% of Which? members saying they both offer good value. Fourth place went to Marks & Spencer with 68 per cent, while The Co-operative scored just above Tesco with 48 per cent. Ocado took top spot in the online ranking with 81 per cent, followed by Waitrose (74 per cent), Sainsbury’s (71 per cent), Tesco (63 per cent) and Asda (61 per cent). The poll revealed that consumers’ biggest irritation when supermarket shopping is not being able to compare prices because of different unit measurements, with 37 per cent reporting that this annoyed them. Members also wanted supermarkets to keep special offers simple, with 55 per cent preferring straight discounts ahead of other offers such as petrol vouchers (16 per cent) or buy-one-get-one-free deals (11 per cent).

Popular: Lego saw sales rise 25 per cent, boosted by the popularity of Lego Friends (pictured), which sold so well production units were unable to keep up with demand . Sales for Danish toymaker Lego soared 25 per cent last year, thanks in part to its new series of building blocks designed for girls. The privately owned company today said that on revenue of 23.4 billion kroner (£2.7 billion) its net profits grew 38 per cent, to 5.6 billion kroner (£650 million). The company, based in western Denmark, said the Lego Star Wars and Lego Ninjago series remained among the more popular, but it was a novel rollout for girls, Lego Friends, that sold better than expected - to the extent that production units were unable to keep pace with demand. Chief executive Joergen Vig Knudstorp said Lego had shown it can develop toys that children across world 'put at the top of their wish lists in 2012.' In the United States, Lego Friends surpassed early projections, with its sales eventually increasing three times more than expected, Lego said. The new line, which includes mini-figures in pink, a dream house with a pool, and a beauty shop, was criticised by some US consumer groups as reinforcing gender stereotypes. Lego said its share of the total US toy market has quadrupled in five years. As of the end of 2012 it was 7.9 per cent, up 1.6 percentage points from the previous year. Markets in North America, Asia and Europe delivered 'impressive' sales results, the toy maker said, while growth in some southern European markets were 'more moderate but still in healthy single digits.' The company, which sells products in more than 130 countries, expects sales to continue to climb in 2013, but at a slower rate due to global economic uncertainty. Lego is not publicly listed but has published earning reports since 1997. It does not release quarterly figures. Lego said its Star Wars range remained as popular as ever, which helped its net profits grow 38 per cent . Toys: The Lego Ninjago range also remained popular in 2012, when the Danish toymaker saw its sales soar 25 per cent .","Production units were unable to keep pace with demand for Lego Friends .

Humans living 40,000 years ago in the area around Beijing were already genetically distinct from the ancestors of modern Europeans, DNA analysis has found. An international team of researchers sequenced DNA that had been extracted from the leg of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave near to the Chinese capital. Analyses showed that the Tianyuan human shared a common origin with the ancestors of many present-day Asians and Native Americans - but had already diverged genetically from ancient Europeans. The leg of the early modern human from Tianyuan Cave that was used for the genetic analysis: DNA sequencing showed a genetic profile already distinct from that of the ancestors of Europeans . The researchers also found that the proportion of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in the early modern human was no higher than in the present day population of this region. Researchers with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, took nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from a 40,000 year old leg bone unearthed at the Tianyuan Cave in 2003. They used newly developed techniques to enable them to identify ancient genetic material from an archaeological find even when large quantities of DNA from soil bacteria are present. The researchers then reconstructed a genetic profile of the leg's owner. Study leader Svante Pääbo said: 'This individual lived during an important evolutionary transition when early modern humans, who shared certain features with earlier forms such as Neanderthals, were replacing Neanderthals and Denisovans.' The genetic profile revealed that this early modern human was related to the ancestors of many present-day Asians and Native Americans but had already diverged genetically from the ancestors of present-day Europeans. In addition, the Tianyuan individual did not carry a larger proportion of Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA than present-day people in the region. Study: Researchers carrying out excavation works at Tianyuan, where the leg bones were unearthed in 2003 . 'More analyses of additional early modern humans across Eurasia will further refine our understanding of when and how modern humans spread across Europe and Asia,' said Professor Pääbo. Parts of the work were carried out in a new laboratory jointly run by the Max Planck Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. The study's findings have been published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","DNA sequenced from leg bone found in cave near to Beijing .

She is a glamorous Hollywood star who has graced hundreds of red carpets. But the cause closest to Mira Sorvino's heart is a long journey from the bright lights of Tinseltown and into the dark world of human trafficking. In a moving interview with Mail Online, she told how one heartrending meeting with an imprisoned sex slave had changed her life and made her even more determined to end the trade she branded a 'hideous scourge'. The 45-year-old described coming face-to-face with the woman, who was wrongly locked-up for killing the man who had taken her captive when she was 16. Despite the real murderer confessing to the crime, she had still spent much of her youth in a jail cell. She had also endured years of horrific abuse at the hands of the human trafficker. He would routinely threaten her with black magic and say he would murder members of her family. ‘Although she had wanted to commit suicide, she did not,’ Mira said. ‘She told me “I have nothing left to give on this earth, beside staying on and enduring to keep my brother alive.’ ‘To see in her eyes deep, excoriating pain and yet to hear no bitterness in her words, after spending her entire youth incarcerated for a crime someone else ultimately confessed to, was extraordinary.’ ‘More extraordinary still was her commitment to help others and become a fighter of this hideous scourge.’ Mira’s latest project is CNN documentary Mozambique or Bust which features the pioneering work of a small American charity Free The Girls. Scroll down to watch the documentary . Survivors: Tashina (left) was . trafficked when she was 15, and Ofelia (right) became a sex slave when she . was just 12 - their stories are among those that have inspired Hollywood star Sorvino . The project was set up to help . victims of human trafficking in an innovative and highly unusual way – . by sending bras to Mozambique where they can be sold by freed sex . slaves. Set up by Denver housewife Kimba Langas, who thought her appeal for unwanted lingerie would only have moderate success. But she was completely overwhelmed when women sent her 20,000 bras but was then faced with the fresh challenge of getting them shipped to Africa. The problem was when Paul Jarzombek, the CEO of shipping company LR International stepped in and offered free transportation from Chicago to Maputo. ‘Kimba is an amazing person, a stay-at-home mom with a dream and gumption as big as the sky’, Mira said. ‘She proves that there are no limitations to what we can do to fight slavery if we put our minds and hearts to it.’ The actress said that the idea of selling bras was both surprising and inspirational. Some of the thousands of unwanted bras donated by American women ready to be shipped out to Mozambique . Breast efforts: A group of former sex slave and human trafficking victims unload a box of bras donated by women in the U.S. which they will sell in the local market . ‘I . like the idea that these are items that would exclusively be bought by . women, so that the women and girls selling them wouldn’t have to sell . them to me, and possibly be intimidated or retrafficked by them. ‘They . are being set up to succeed, in a safe zone. I think it was a great, . genius idea and proves that you don’t need money to fight human . trafficking. ‘Kimba’s story shows that you do not need special expertise.

Both are now selling . Free The Girls bras and supporting themselves. ‘We lived in darkness,’ Tashina said before talking optimistically about the future. For . the women of Mozambique, bras are a difficult item to acquire and . highly-coveted. The people  who sell them make about three time the . living wage.

Eight-year-old Eren Gok is forced to put up with cruel taunts and stares wherever he goes. The little boy suffers from a life-threatening condition that makes his skin look sunburned all year round. His condition appears so distressing that his parents are regularly accused by strangers of leaving him out in the sun to burn. Eren Gok, with his mother Arzu, suffers from a condition that makes his skin look sunburned all the time . Eren was born with Netherton's Syndrome, a rare condition that leaves his skin permanently red, flaking and tight . In fact,Eren, now eight, was born with Netherton Syndrome, a rare condition that affects just one in 200,000 births in the UK. It leaves his skin permanently red, flaking and tight. The youngster spent the first year of his life in hospital where he stopped breathing four times and battled MRSA. Eren's parents, from Enfield, north London, were told he would never walk or talk, but he has now defied doctors by reaching all his milestones. His mother, Arzu, 31, said: 'We get comments every day. 'The first time we took him out my husband Baykal was carrying him in his basket and three young guys came over. They called him a disgusting baby. 'People say horrible things. It does hurt. 'One day, I was in the supermarket and a man was shouting at me, asking me why I had burnt my baby. He kept shouting: ""What kind of mother are you?"" Eren spent the first year of his life in hospital where he stopped breathing four times and battled MRSA . Eren's parents Arzu (left) and Baykal are forced to endure cruel comments about their son's appearance on a regular basis . 'Eren's repeated some of the nasty things people say to him. It really upsets me. 'For a long time, I didn't go outside and tried to keep him under cover. But I finally see things more positively. I don't see his skin condition now. I see my cheeky, happy son.' Netherton Syndrome is caused by damage in a gene called SPINK5, which controls the formation of a protein found in the skin. An lack of this protein results in flaking, red, dry and itchy skin. The condition requires regular hospital check ups including appointments with a dermatologist and ear specialist (because of skin blocking the ears as it flakes). The skin needs to be cared for several times a day using various mixtures of paraffin and Vaseline. Infections to the skin and other body parts can quickly develop into life-threatening conditions because of the delicate nature of the skin. There is still no treatment but efforts are being made to find a cure at Great Ormond Street Hospital. His parents must bathe his skin twice a day with a medicated wash and use special creams to make sure it doesn't become infected. But Eren is still at risk of infections, which can be life-threatening because they can cause heart failure. His parents immediately knew he was different from the moment he was born. His mother said: 'It was obvious. His skin was very tight and red. He looked almost plastic.'His skin was peeling off. 'The doctors thought it might be eczema. They didn't really seem to know. We kept pushing for answers but they just discharged him.' The worried couple decided to move from where they lived in Kent to London to try to get an appointment at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. It was there specialists broke the news their son had Netherton's Syndrome. Eren, who had become seriously ill, was placed in a medically induced coma while medics battled to keep him alive. Mrs . Gok said: 'I couldn't sleep. I always had this fear something might . happen to my baby. I didn't feel like a mum. I couldn't cuddle him or . pick him up. Eren with his cousin Uman. His parents were told he would never walk or talk, but he has now defied doctors by reaching all his milestones . Hope: For the first few years of his life, Eren made little progress. But but with the help and encouragement from his family, he started interacting with them . 'They had to put a tube in his nose so they could feed him. He was losing weight fast. 'He was a on life support machine and stopped breathing many times.' Medics also used special creams to try to soften his skin and stop it becoming infected. But he developed the superbug MRSA and his parents were warned he was so poorly he was unlikely to survive. Mrs Gok said: 'A nurse said he'd been in intensive care too many times. I broke down. 'I wasn't feeling well so I went outside to get some fresh air and when I came back I realised Eren had pulled his mask off and was breathing fine. No one could believe it.' The couple were finally allowed to take him home a month before his first birthday but they found it difficult to cope. His mother added: 'He was like a newborn baby. He couldn't crawl or walk. He couldn't even sit up. 'His clothes had to be thrown away after he'd worn them because of the risk of infection. We had to keep buying new ones. Eren needs regular injections of immunoglobulin to treat his skin when it gets infected. He also can't go out if it's too cold because his skin will crack . 'Taking care of him was very difficult. He was in so much pain he cried for hours. 'He'd scream if you tried to put him in the bath.' For the first few years of his life, Eren made little progress but with the help and encouragement from his family, he started interacting with them. 'I'd put a DVD on for him and I could hear him laughing,' said Mrs Gok. 'Then I saw his hands and feet were moving. It was a magical moment. Eren said his first word when he was five.

By the time they are ready to go to senior school, the proportion has doubled to almost 20 per cent. Overall, three in 10 boys and girls aged two to 15 are overweight or clinically obese - so fat it threatens their health. Statistics from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) give a snapshot of England’s obesity epidemic in 2011. Unhealthy: Almost half of the children who were obese thought they were about the right weight . It shows adults are getting even . bigger, with more obese people needing hospital treatment although the . trend may be ‘flattening out’ among children. In 2011/12, 9.5 per cent of children . in reception class aged four and five were classed as obese, rising to . one in five pupils in year 6 aged 10 and 11. Significantly, almost half of parents whose children are obese wrongly thought they were ‘about the right weight’. Older children are more likely to be obese than younger - boys are worse . than girls - but the ‘lack of significant change in recent years . suggests the trend is flattening out’. But the figures show a worsening picture among adults, with a ‘marked increase’ in obesity over the last 20 years. Overall, 65 per cent of men and 58 . per cent of women are overweight or obese - just 37 per cent are classed . as a ‘normal’ weight. In 1993, 13 per cent of men and 16 . per cent of women were obese and the figures soared to 24 per cent and . 26 per cent respectively by 2011. There has also been a stark rise in obesity-related hospital admissions. Obese: The study showed that 65 per cent of men were clinically obese, a significant increase over the last 20 years . In 2011/12, 11,740 people were . admitted to hospitals in England because of obesity - up threefold in . five years - with the number of women three times higher than men. Stomach operations designed to help fat people lose weight also shot up, says the HSCIC. In 2011/12, 8,790 people underwent a . procedure to help them lose weight - such as stomach stapling or a . gastric bypass - a fourfold rise in five years. Over the same period, people bought less fruit and vegetables, with fruit sales falling 4.1 per cent in 2011 compared to 2008. The amount of vegetables bought was 2.4 per cent lower - with a 6.6 per cent drop in fresh green vegetables. Only 36 per cent of adults were found . to take part in 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity at least once . a week HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said ‘It won’t have escaped . the majority of people that obesity is a high profile issue in this . country. ‘This annual report is important in . bringing clarity to how this actually affects people, patients and the . NHS, from the weighing scales to the operating theatre. ‘Based on the Body Mass Index . measurement, the proportion of adults estimated to be of a normal weight . has dropped substantially since this report’s time series began in . 1993.’ Graham Rowan, chairman of the Obesity . Management Association, said ‘The obesity epidemic is getting worse by . the day and steadily spiralling out of control.’ Amy Thompson, Senior Cardiac Nurse at . the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said ‘These figures hold a mirror . to the state of the country’s health - and it is not a flattering . reflection. ‘The number of people who are . overweight or obese is steadily climbing and unhealthy lifestyle choices . are helping us along this path. 'After our Olympic year, it is a sad . fact that only a third of us manage 30 minutes of physical activity once . a week, when we should all be aiming for 150 minutes every week to keep . our hearts healthy. ‘Alarmingly, over 1 in 10 children . are now classed as obese when they start school. We know that obese . children are more likely to become obese adults, but education is the . way to break this cycle. By teaching children about healthy . eating and inspiring them to be active at a young age, we can help these . kids towards a healthier future.’ Labour’s shadow public health . minister Diane Abbott said ‘The Government is receiving warning after . warning that it has a serious crisis on its hands, and that their . strategy is not working, and yet David Cameron and Jeremy Hunt are . simply not listening. ‘These figures show British children . and families paying the cost of this Government’s total lack of . leadership on this growing crisis, which is storing up huge problems and . costs for our NHS, and for the country.’","Worrying figures show this rises to 20% by Year Six .

So far this winter flu levels have fluctuated but remained relatively low across the UK. But new figures show that the number of people seeing their GP with symptoms has risen sharply. An increasing number of people are seeing their GPs with flu-like symptoms . For the week ending February 3, the rate was just under 13 per 100,000,. But during the week ending February 17, this had risen to just over 22 per 100,000. In the latest week there were 55 people admitted to intensive care with . confirmed flu, up from 34 the week before when there were also two . deaths from the disease. A total of 517 admissions have been reported across the UK since the beginning of the season along with 57 deaths. The increase seen in England has not been mirrored in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland, the figures from the Health Protection Agency showed. The flu virus: It's important to cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough to avoid spreading germs . Calls to NHS Direct about flu symptoms remained stable at 1.2 per cent of all calls. A spokesman for the HPA said: 'Flu continues to circulates in the UK. It is vital that those who are most ‘at risk’ from flu make sure they receive their vaccination as this is the most effective way of preventing them from becoming ill with the virus. 'These ‘at risk’ groups include people with weakened immune systems, those with underlying conditions such as liver, lung or renal diseases, heart problems or diabetes, as well as the over 65s and pregnant women.' The HPA also expressed the importance of helping to prevent the spread of flu by covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, disposing of the tissue promptly and washing your hands as soon as possible. Across Europe, particularly in Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and Belgium, there is substantial flu activity, but the season appears to have peaked in some countries.","More than 500 hospital admissions across the UK since the beginning of the season .

Legendary actor Gerard Depardieu is to give up his French passport in protest at huge tax hikes imposed by the country's Government. Depardieu, 63, star of films including Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac, is furious at French President Francois Hollande for several of his policies aimed at taking money away from the rich, including a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent. The actor is now set to move to Belgium after putting his £40million mansion on Paris's Left Bank up for sale. Leaving: French actor Gerard Depardieu has put his Paris mansion up for sale and will leave France in protest at tax hikes imposed by the government . In an open letter to prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault today, Mr Depardieu said: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’ Mr Depardieu said he has paid 85 per cent of his income to the Government this year, and estimated that he had paid more than £130 million in total since he started work on leaving school aged 14. New financial measures: French President Francois Hollande has imposed a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent . Mr Ayrault had earlier branded Mr Depardieu ‘pathetic’ and ‘unpatriotic’, but the actor wrote in an open letter in the Journal de Dimanche: ‘Who are you to judge me like this, Mr Ayrault? I ask you, who are you? 'Despite my excesses, my appetite and my love of life, I am a free man. ‘I am not asking to be approved of, but I could at least be respected. All of those who have left France have not been insulted as I have been. ‘At no time have I failed in my duties. The historic films in which I took part bear witness to my love of France and its history.’ The actor is not the first wealthy French resident to signal their intention to leave since Mr Hollande came to power back in May. Bernard Arnault, chief executive of the luxury goods group LVMH and France’s richest man, is among those who have applied for Belgian residency, although the billionaire denies it is for tax reasons. It came as an Ifop poll released in France at the weekend put Mr Hollande’s public approval rating at just 37 per cent, with Mr Ayrault on 35 per cent. MailOnline reported last week how Depardieu had moved to a new 'tax exile' mansion just 800 yards from the French border in Belgium. The actor's lavish home in the village of Nechin - on a street known as Millionaire's Row - is less than two minutes drive from the French town of Roubaix.","Depardieu, 63, is furious at French President Francois Hollande for several of his policies aimed at taking money away from the rich .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:57 EST, 22 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:55 EST, 22 February 2013 . Legal woes: The Department of Justice joined a civil fraud lawsuit against Lance Armstrong filed by his former teammate . Lance Armstrong will now have to answer to the Department of Justice for using performance-enhancing drugs during the Tour de France. The agency told a federal court Friday that it has joined a civil fraud suit filed two years ago by Armstrong's former teammate Floyd Landis under the False Claims Act, according to NBC News. U.S. Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart wrote Attorney General Eric Holder on January 14, urging him to join the civil case and telling Holder that ‘fraud and other crimes were committed’ by Armstrong and other members of his former U.S. Postal Service teams. The letter is dated the same day Armstrong admitted his drug use to Oprah Winfrey in a television interview that was broadcast on January 17 and 18. The civil suit argues that because Armstrong’s team used banned drugs and blood transfusions, they violated their sponsorship agreement with the Postal Service. The USPS spent around $30million backing Armstrong's cycling team. Under the False Claims Act, the government can recover three times that amount in damages, bringing the total to nearly $100million, USA Today reported. A quarter of that sum could go to Landis for his role as the whistle-blower who was among the first to publicly accuse Armstrong of cheating. Besides Armstrong, the suit also names his agent, Bill Stapleton, Stapleton's agency and the cycling team's management company, Tailwind Sports. Bad blood: Former cyclist Flyod Landis, who admitted in 2006 to doping, was among the first people to publicly accuse Armstrong, right, of cheating during Tour de France races . Fraud allegations: The suit argues that because Armstrong’s team used PEDs and blood transfusions, they violated their sponsorship deal with the Postal Service under the False Claims Act . In response, Armstrong’s attorney Robert Luskin released a statement challenging the premise that the government was defrauded. ‘Lance and his representatives worked constructively over these last weeks with federal lawyers to resolve this case fairly, but those talks failed because we disagree about whether the Postal Service was damaged,’ Luskin said. ‘The Postal's Services own studies show that the Service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship -- benefits totaling more than $100million.’ Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title for using illegal substances, accuses Armstrong of committing fraud against the Postal Service, which sponsored most of Armstrong's teams as the star rider used PEDs to win the Tour a record seven times. Landis also was a key witness in a USADA investigation last year that exposed Armstrong's doping. He stands to collect a portion — potentially millions of dollars — of any possible financial penalties against Armstrong. USADA officials had been urging Armstrong to speak under oath with its investigators if he hoped to have his lifetime ban reduced. Tygart’s letter was first reported Thursday by Velonews.com and The Associated Press independently obtained a copy from a person familiar with the case. Costly claims: USPS spent about $30million backing Armstrong's team, and it is now in line to recover three times that amount - about $100million - in damages . Armstrong and USADA officials talked on and off over a couple of months about the terms of the cyclist sitting down for a long interview to spill all he knows about doping in cycling, but Armstrong said Wednesday he would not cooperate. A source familiar with discussions between the two sides said among the topics was how much protection USADA could provide Armstrong in the whistle-blower case and against possible criminal action. The cyclist and his attorneys ultimately were not satisfied with USADA's offer, the person said. In commenting Wednesday on Armstrong's refusal to talk, Tygart said that, ‘over the last few weeks he has led us to believe that he wanted to come in and assist USADA, but was worried of potential criminal and civil liability if he did so.’ In his letter to Holder, Tygart wrote that USADA ‘uncovered one of the greatest frauds in the history of sport’ but that his agency had reached the end of what it can do to punish Armstrong and other ‘non-sports’ people involved with his teams. ‘Fraud and other crimes were committed,’ Tygart wrote, telling Holder that the case involved drug trafficking, federal witness intimidation and that other federal agencies have gathered more information. ‘USADA has already done the work in the sports case and won,’ Tygart wrote. Coincidence: The head of USADA sent a letter to the Justice Department asking the agency to join the suit against Armstrong the same day the cyclist had admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey . Armstrong was the subject of a two-year federal grand jury investigation that was dropped a year ago without an indictment. Tygart also told Holder that the Justice Department joining the case against Armstrong would be viewed favorably by the public and the media. The letter noted the federal government recently went after Landis for defrauding donors to his defense fund back when he still denied doping to win the 2006 Tour de France. Tygart called the doping by Armstrong and the Postal Service teams a ‘massive economic fraud’ that ‘absolutely dwarfs anything Landis did.’ However, the government’s case against Armstrong is far from airtight. The disgraced cyclist's defense team could argue that the sponsorship deal with USPS did not expressly forbid team members from using blood transfusions during races. Another major hurdle for the DOJ would be proving that Armstrong had defrauded the government out of millions of dollars. The cyclist’s attorneys would likely claim that not only did the Postal Service not lose money by backing the USPS team, but that in fact the agency came away with about $100million in value from media exposure. Earlier this week, after more than two months of negotiations, Armstrong attorney Tim Herman said that the cyclist won't speak to USADA about doping in cycling, calling it a process designed 'only to demonize selected individuals.' Refusal: Lance Armstrong won't interview under oath with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which may have been his only chance at ending his lifetime ban from cycling . Armstrong had previously said he was willing to participate in an international effort to clean up a sport that is based mostly in Europe. For years, Armstrong denied using performance-enhancing drugs. But last year, USADA released a report that detailed extensive doping on his seven Tour de France-winning teams and stripped him of those titles. Armstrong then admitted last month in an . interview with 'Queen of Talk' Oprah Winfrey that he doped and used . performance-enhancing drugs to win those races. 'We remain hopeful that an international . effort will be mounted and we will do everything we can to facilitate . that result,' Mr Herman said in a statement. Defense strategy: Armstrong's lawyers will likely argue that the cyclist had never expressly promised not to use blood transfusions, and that the Postal Service actually came away with $100million in value from the sponsorship deal . 'Lance will not participate in USADA's efforts to selectively conduct American prosecutions that only demonize selected individuals while failing to address the 95 per cent of the sport over which USADA has no jurisdiction.' Armstrong is facing several legal challenges, and testifying under oath to USADA could have exposed him to further troubles. Armstrong also has been sued by a Dallas-based SCA Promotions to recover more than $12million in bonuses. He also has been sued to by The Sunday Times in London to recover a libel judgment that Armstrong won against the paper.","Justice Department joined civil suit filed by Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis .

Over the limit: David Bye, 88, was driving his Skoda on the A14 when he was stopped in Felixstowe, Suffolk, by police and breathalyzed . A frail pensioner who is believed to be Britain's oldest drink-driver has been banned from the road - at the age of 88. David Bye failed a breath test after an off duty police officer saw him driving his grey Skoda erratically on the A14 near Felixstowe, Suffolk. Mr Bye of Ipswich, Suffolk, who walks with two sticks, was helped by two women relatives as he shuffled into South East Suffolk magistrates' court on Wednesday. He struggled to hear and tapped his hearing aid as the court clerk shouted questions at him to confirm his name and address. Bye of Ipswich admitted drink-driving and was given a 12 month driving ban. He was also fined £140 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Lesla Small said the off duty officer who was behind Mr Bye saw him driving 'very slowly' and crossing the central white lines in the road at 8pm on December 15 last year. She said: 'Officers responded to the information they received about the vehicle Mr Bye was driving along the A14 towards Felixstowe. 'The information they were given was that it was being driven in an extremely erratic manner. The officer got the vehicle to stop and noticed he was extremely unsteady on his feet. That was partly due to his elderly age. 'A roadside breath test was conducted and was positive. He was then taken to the police station.'A second breath test at the station showed he had 43mcsgs of alcohol in 100mls of breath, slightly over the legal limit of 35mcs. Mr Bye was given an opportunity to have a blood test which showed he had 94mgs of alcohol in 100mls of blood. The legal limit is 80mgs. Ms Small added: 'The officer has put a . note on the files. He states that the vehicle he was driving has now . been sold and the DVLA have been notified about his medical condition. 'The officer says that Mr Bye said he . only had one drink, but it contained more alcohol than he realised. The . officer thought it was a total misjudgement error on his part.' Penalty: Mr Bye was banned from driving for 12 months at South East Suffolk Magistrates Court (pictured) Ms Small confirmed that Bye had no previous convictions or cautions, other than a speeding conviction last November. District Judge Celia Dawson told the pensioner: 'I appreciate this must be very difficult for you because you are 88-years-old and you have never been in court before. I am pleased you have sold your car. Is it your intention to give up driving? 'Mr Bye replied: 'I think so - at my age. I am 88 now.' Judge Dawson told him she would have ordered him to take a re-test after his driving ban if he thought he would get behind the wheel again. However, she warned him that if he drove during the period of his ban he would be committing 'a very serious imprisonable offence.' Britain's previous oldest drink driver is believed to have been D-Day Navy veteran Rennie Carr who was found to be nearly twice the legal limit in 2007 when he was aged 86. Mr Carr was banned after police saw him driving his Honda Prelude on the wrong side of the road in Blackpool, Lancashire.","David Bye was breathalyzed after driving 'erratically' near Felixstow, Suffolk .

The third climber killed in an avalanche in the Scottish Highlands last week has been named today. William Currie, 18, from Penzance, Cornwall, was one of three people on a winter skills training course who died in the Cairngorms on Thursday. Mr Currie - who was a student on the second last day of a course at the nearby Glenmore Lodge outdoor centre - was among two parties of six climbers in a 120ft gorge on the popular Lairig Ghru walk between Deeside and Speyside when the avalanche happened. Nine other people who were on the mountain at the time of the avalanche escaped unhurt. The three victims died when they were buried under 13ft of snow said to be like 'concrete'. Northern Constabulary said a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal but investigators are unsure as yet why the avalanche happened. The principal of Glenmore Lodge, Bob Kinnaird, said today that Mr Currie was the first fatality at Glenmore Lodge for more than 40 years. The other two victims, both RAF officers, have already been named as Flight Lieutenant Fran Capps, 32, from Dulverton in Somerset, and Squadron Leader Rimon Thann, 33, of RAF Valley, North Wales.

A Chinese businessman was so angry about a filthy river in his hometown that he made an equally dirty offer: daring a local official £21,000 to swim in it. Jin Zengmin posted photos of the garbage-filled river on his blog, making the offer to local environmental protection chief Bao Zhenming. It comes as China's environment ministry admitted the country is home to 'cancer villages' - clusters of hundreds of people who have developed the fatal disease. Pollution: The Daqubang river is turned orange by iron discharged from nearby factories in Haiyan . Accused: Local media has accused companies of pumping toxic waste into the groundwater supply . Dirty: Green duckweed floats on the surface of Hanjiang River, running through the city of Wuhan . Mr Zengmin had grown frustrated about pollution in Rui'an city in China's eastern province of Zhejian . He said on his microblog that a . rubber shoe factory has been dumping waste water into the river and that . the area had an exceptionally high cancer rate. The challenge, made on Saturday, reflects a growing frustration among the Chinese public over widespread pollution and lack of governmental action. It quickly inspired at least one other offer, with another post appearing on Tuesday on an online forum offering a 300,000 yuan (£32,000) cash prize to the environmental protection chief in the nearby county of Cangnan if the official swam in polluted rivers there. Grey skies: A woman wears a mask as she walks in front of the CCTV building in Beijing in January when a blanket of smog covered the city . A Rui'an government spokesman would not say whether Mr Zhenming would accept the challenge. But he said the bureau had contacted Mr Zengmin and will take some measures, including working with residents to clean up trash in the river and putting up signs warning against dumping. He also said that the public should shoulder responsibility in protecting the environment and that the environmental protection bureau welcomes public supervision and participation in cleaning up local rivers. China's booming economy has caused serious water pollution, with a number of high-profile industrial accidents along major rivers. Hu Siyi, vice minister of water resources, said that 20 per cent of China's rivers were so polluted that their water quality was rated too toxic for human contact and that up to 40 per cent of the rivers were seriously polluted. Last month, around nine tons of aniline, a chemical used to make polyurethane, leaked into a river in northern China. The leak wasn't reported for five days, and by then it had contaminated the water supply of a city in a neighboring province. The government made it startling 'cancer villages' admission in its five-year plan for tackling air pollution. The document reads: 'In recent years, toxic and hazardous chemical pollution has caused many environmental disasters, cutting off drinking water supplies, and even leading to severe health and social problems such as 'cancer villages'. Campaigners have long called for the authorities to recognise the problem of contaminated soil, water and air, and to support those affected. Ma Jun, one of the countries leading environmentalists, told The Telegraph: 'I do think this shows a positive development.

Cancer is already China's biggest killer, with one in four residents dieing from the disease following an 80 per cent rise in the mortality rate from cancer over the past 30 years. But experts warns lung cancer rates in particular are only going to get worse because of the air pollution. The capital Beijing and other large cities have had to cope with numerous onsets of toxic smog already this year, which has made the authorities look at the issue.

Lung damage: Even a healthy activity like cycling can be problematic when there is little clean air around . But allegations in the local media that factories have been pumping toxic waste into the groundwater supply has forced this issue onto the public agenda as well. Mr Deng, who has encouraged people to post pictures of such pollution online, added: 'If things continue like this, we will all be doomed. If the issue is not properly solved, not only will it kill people but it will also drag down the entire healthcare system because of the number of cancer patients it causes.' Ma Jun, from the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs said more research is needed to establish a clearer link between 'cancer villages' and pollution, and said China should introduced precautionary measures similar to those used by the United States and Japan. He added the government is much more willing to be open about the issue than it has been in the past, and said it signals a shift towards greater transparency by the country's secretive authorities.","Jin Zengmin had posted the pictures of the river in Rui'an city on his blog .

Those wanting a bit of privacy - and the chance to pretend to be a Bond villain - can now rent a secluded house perched on top of an island. That is, if they have £6,000 for a week's stay. The hideaway home which sits atop the 80ft summit of Towan Island is surrounded by water during high tide with the only way to gain access via a private suspension bridge. Welcome to the island! Lord and Lady Long have sold the property and it is now being offered as a holiday let . What a view! The remarkable dwelling, in Newquay, Cornwall, has a terrace where holiday makers can enjoy stunning sights from the privacy of their home . The home will now be available for nearly £6,000 a week - but here is no other place like it in the UK . Its suspension foot-bridge is the only means of connecting it to the mainland . Its previous owners, Lord and Lady Long, . have finally sold up for £1million because they were fed up of walking . up the slippery granite stairs and endless noisy beach parties in . Newquay, Cornwall. But a British holiday firm have now . rebranded it 'The House in The Sea' and will rent it out this summer - . at the steep price of nearly £6,000 a week. A week's stay will cost £5,575 for a party of six in June, although the unique pad can be had for as little as £1,845 for two people later in the year. A spokesman for Unique Home Stays insists the steep cliffs 'should be of no concern - indeed that is one of the main attractions of this unique property.' Marketing manager Claire Ray said: 'There is no other beach holiday experience like it available. 'Guests will be able to hoist a flag . to let everyone know they are in residence and they have their own . suspension bridge gated at the mainland end to ensure complete privacy.' The remarkable dwelling, in Newquay, . Cornwall, was built in the 1901 and was once owned by Sir Oliver Joseph . Lodge, inventor of the spark plug. And rather fittingly for a pad . reminiscent of a super villain's hideout, Sherlock Holmes creator Sir . Arthur Conan Doyle was once a visitor.

The government's planning reforms have spectacularly failed to stimulate a new wave of house building across the country. Figures showed that the number of new homes started last year in England was a massive 11 per cent lower than the year before - exacerbating the chronic shortages at a time when the population is on the rise. Work was started on just 98,280 properties in 2012 - one of the lowest totals in recent years and less than half of the country's estimated need. Declining: the number of new builds is declining despite government efforts to boost the industry . The disappointing figures come despite former planning minister Grant Shapps' high-profile reforms to free up public land for building, to enable communities to identify parcels of land for building, and to help people get a foot on the housing ladder through new state-backed mortgage schemes. Last night Jack Dromey, Labour's housing spokesman, said thousands of young people would be denied the chance to own their own home unless more houses were built. 'David Cameron's failed housing policies are making the biggest housing crisis in a generation worse, not better,' he said. 'Nearly 18 months on from David Cameron's promise to ""get Britain building"", it's clear he is failing. 'We started to build 11 per cent fewer homes in 2012 than the previous year, less than 100,000 homes in the whole of England and only two fifths of what is needed to meet housing need. Tough times: Jack Dromey said that the government is failing new buyers who want to get onto the property market . 'This Government's failing housing and economic policies are depriving millions of people of a decent home. Young families are locked out of home ownership. Too many are struggling with the choice between paying rent and feeding their families because rents have soared. 'Too many people presenting as homeless, staying in bed and breakfast and sleeping on our streets. And too many building workers on the dole and young people out of work desperate for an apprenticeship.' Figures show that in 2012, annual housing starts totalled 98,280 - 11 per cent down from the 2011 figure. Locked out: The number of homes that are available to new buyers is lower than before . This compares to a recent high of 183,000 housing starts in 2006, but numbers have fallen since the credit crunch to a low of 75,000 in 2009. The numbers recovered slightly but have now fallen back again. However, the number of homes completed rose slightly over the past year - up 1 per cent to 115,620 in 2012. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'The Government is far from complacent, which is why despite the need to tackle the deficit we're investing £19.5billion public and private funding in an affordable housing programme set to deliver 170,000 homes, putting £1.3billion into unlocking stalled sites and building the infrastructure we need and making enough formerly used, surplus public sector land available to deliver 33,000 new homes. 'And to help aspiring homeowners get their foot on the housing ladder, the Funding for Lending scheme is helping improve the access to and availability of mortgages, while our FirstBuy and NewBuy schemes are helping thousands of people buy newly-built homes with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require.' The British Property Federation said the country needs to end its obsession with owner occupation and consider a range of housing options, including build to let. Ian Fletcher, the organisation's director of policy, said: 'Against the backdrop of these figures we need to seriously think about how we're going to build the homes this country needs to meet growing demand. 'As things stand the owner occupied model just isn't delivering the required numbers, and we need to focus on a range of options. 'To improve overall housing supply it needs to be affordable, does not require access to mortgage finance and not put undue strain on tight public finances. An institutional-funded professional rented sector, building to let, ticks all these boxes.'","The number of homes started in England last year was 11 per cent lower than the year before .

Peter Sellers’ role as Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films brought the actor vast wealth. And he spent lavishly: he had a penchant for fast cars and bought properties all over the world. But unlike his fellow Goon Michael Bentine, who was educated at Eton, Sellers, the son of variety entertainers, did not enjoy a privileged childhood. One of his first homes was in Highgate, North London, a modest early 19th Century two-up, two-down terrace that is currently on the market. Inspector's pad: The Miller family outside their terrace house in Highgate, London where Peter Sellers grew up . The house is priced at £645,000. That . might seem steep outside the capital, but it is rare for a house in this . desirable area to sell for less than £1 million. Sellers, who suffered from depression and alcohol problems later in life, never seemed to find happiness in his grander homes, but he appeared to retain great affection for the house where he lived between the ages of ten and 14. His actor friend Graham Stark recalls Sellers stopping his brand-new Bentley outside the Highgate house shortly before his death in 1980. Stark remembered: ‘He just put his head on the steering wheel and cried, “Whatever happened to Peter Sellers?” ’ The vendors of the house, Tim and . Ilaria Miller, will certainly leave behind happy memories. Their . daughters – Anna Lily, seven, and Francesca, four – were both born after . they bought the house in 2003. Selling Sellers': The living room in the two-up two-down property which is on the market for £645,000 . The family are moving for the simple . reason that they need more space, though there is more now than when . Sellers lived in the property. Civil servant Tim and Ilaria, who . works in the Cabinet Office, paid £275,000 for the house and spent . £20,000 renovating it. They later added a kitchen extension. Growing up: Peter Sellers, who lived in the house as a boy, as Inspector Clouseau in 1963 film Pink Panther . While . the rooms are still fairly small, the downstairs space – which . comprises a reception room, dining room, kitchen-diner and bathroom – is . well organised and has plenty of light. Upstairs, however, you get an impression of how cramped the house would have been in Sellers’ day. At the top of the stairs is a tiny landing and two modest bedrooms. ‘The house had been used as an office before we moved in,’ says Tim. ‘There was no central heating and the floors on the second storey were badly warped.’ The couple knocked down the old galley kitchen and built the stylish new extension but lost space from the already small garden at the back. However, they have no regrets about this, as the vast spaces of Highgate Wood and Queen’s Wood are just over the road. The Millers concede there is no scope for further expansion – there is no loft or basement – and they believe they would not get planning permission to put another room above the kitchen. The couple say many people, on seeing the Dead Comics’ Society plaque on the front of the house commemorating Sellers, stop and take pictures. With its fine restaurants, green spaces and lofty views over London, Highgate continues to attract celebrities – Kate Moss and Geri Halliwell both have houses there – and the Millers believe theirs would suit a young professional couple looking for these qualities, as well as efficient transport into Central London. But when children arrive, as the Millers have discovered, the house may prove a tad too small.

A mother-of-six was hailed a hero today after she dragged an unconscious neighbour from his  £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded into a huge fireball. Karen Buckland, 39, put 'her life on the line' to save the 49-year driver after she found him slumped at the wheel at the silver GTC supercar as it was bursting into flames on his driveway. Despite the obvious danger, Mrs Buckland opened the driver's side door of the blazing vehicle then used all of her strength to hoist him to safety. As she did so the fire ripped through the rest of the luxury vehicle - leaving it a burnt out wreck. Wreckage: Karen Buckland dragged her neighbour from his £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded in to flames on his driveway in Marple, near Stockport, Manchester . Brave: Mother-of-six Karen Buckland has been commended for her bravery after putting her 'life on the line' to save her neighbour . The driver - a wealthy accountant with three children - was later treated in hospital for the effects of smoke inhalation but made a good recovery. He has moved out of the neighbourhood. Mrs Buckland was today commended for her bravery by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Mrs Buckland, from Marple, near Stockport, said: 'I actually feel guilty thinking about how I could have saved him sooner and stopped his car exploding. We weren't that friendly, otherwise I would have popped over to say hello earlier.' Lucky escape: Mrs Buckland managed to drag the 49-year-old man to safety just moment before the entire car went up in flames . Quick thinking: Mrs Buckland could smell electrics burning in her kitchen and heard a huge bang. She then found her neighbour unconscious in his car with the engine compartment on fire . She added: 'My husband nearly had to . drag me to the awards ceremony - frankly I didn't know what the fuss was . about. I was overwhelmed when I found out the whole thing had been put . on especially for me. 'The . fact is my 16-year-old our daughter Morgan was there too and she was . brilliant, taking all the information from the control room and a . neighbour helped as well - and the crews were obviously also very good. Lifesaver: Karen Buckland grabbed her neighbour under his arms and dragged him away from the car . 'I was so touched and lost for words, . all I could say was that these fire fighters do what I did every day - . they are the real heroes in my opinion.' The . incident occurred when Mrs Buckland, who works as a director of . enrichment at a local grammar school came home from work and and after . dinner realised she could smell burning. Mrs Buckland, who lives with property . developer husband Eain, 52, said: 'Eain was still at work, so Morgan and . I were watching television. 'I went to fetch something from the kitchen and smelt an electrical burning smell. I checked on the tumble drier and then shouted upstairs to our friend, who is staying with us, if he knew. 'He told me the man next door, who was still sat in his car, had been revving it. I went to the front door and there was a huge bang. The front of his Bentley was on fire and the flames were spreading fast. 'He was sat behind the wheel with his head facing down and the flames were coming through the windscreen.' With the flames towering above the car and spreading up the walls of the house - burning the ivy and causing the windows to crack - all Mrs Buckland could think about was rescuing the man before he burned to death. She said: 'I didn't reason, I just did it. I didn't think about myself or anything else; it's all a bit of a blur but I managed to get him. As I went out, the car exploded and I just thought I had to get him out of there.' Mrs Buckland grabbed the man under the arms and pulled him from danger while her daughter Morgan called 999 and asked for help. Morgan took instructions from the GMFRS Control Room and crews from Marple and Offerton fire stations arrived shortly after and tackled the blaze and took over from Karen and gave first aid to the man. Presentation: Karen Buckland being presented with a County Fire Officer's Commendation with her husband Eain her daughter Morgan and Chief Officer Steve McGuirk . Mrs Buckland said: 'As he lay on the . ground unconscious, he looked in a bad way - he was singed, covered in . smoke and foaming and gurgling from the mouth. That image is hard to . forget. 'Even now I . drive up to our house, I can spot where the tiles have been replaced in . next door's driveway because of the damage - and what happens comes . flooding back. It's a constant reminder. Well-deserved: Karen Buckland pictured holding her award next to her proud daughter Morgan . 'It wasn't until later and I saw the damage to the car that I realised how bad the fire was. 'Morgan had some flashbacks, but apart from that we've been okay - we're just happy he's alive. 'I think it would have been much more difficult for us if the outcome had not been a good one. 'It's so fortunate that I went out exactly when I did, it would have been very difficult to get to him. 'I was meant to be there, I was meant to save him - if it had been another minute, it would have been a very different story. 'I didn't think about the danger to me - you do whatever you can to help someone survive and not think about the consequences for yourself. 'The fire also made me understand just how fantastic my daughter is and how calm she can be in a crisis.' Inquiries revealed the accidental blaze had been caused by an 'over revving' of the car's engine. County Fire Officer Steve McGuirk said: 'It is without doubt in the minds of all those emergency service personnel who attended the incident on the day that, had Karen not displayed the utmost bravery and ignored the risk to her own life, the man would most certainly have lost his. 'Karen put her life on the line - watched by her family - to save this man and let there be no underestimation of the courage and strength of character that such actions take.'

You perhaps wouldn’t expect the brash TV presenter Johnny Vaughan to live in a such an elegant house, with calm neutral shades throughout and beautifully co-ordinating fittings. But Johnny and his wife Antonia’s home in Wandsworth is exactly that: a tranquil oasis in a busy part of London. With a secluded walled garden at the back, their property has given them both privacy and a great space for entertaining for 14 years. But now Johnny – whose new series of Mud Men, which sees him digging around in River Thames mud unearthing relics from the past, will be shown on the History Channel next month – is ready to move on. Absolute gem: TV presenter Johnny Vaughan is selling his £3.5million Victorian home in London's Wandsworth . He and Antonia have already found a bigger house nearby that better suits them and their two children – Tabitha, 12, and Rafferty, nine. Their current home is on the market for £3.5 million. Houses in their street were built as show homes for the Great Exhibition of 1851, which drew hordes of people to London from around the UK. At that time, much of the area was still fields, while Clapham Junction station – now the busiest in the country – hadn’t even opened. The road forms part of a conservation area, with Wandsworth Common close by. Most houses are semi-detached, though some, like the Vaughans’, are detached. Time to go: Johnny Vaughan and Antonia are leaving their home after 14 years . Almost all the architectural styles of Victorian London are here – Gothic gables, classical designs, Italian Renaissance – and they also feature bay windows. Johnny, 46, can thank Antonia for the tasteful renovation of their four-storey gem. The lower-ground floor has a family room and a large kitchen/dining room with limestone steps leading to the garden. On the upper-ground floor, the  main sitting room has two sets of French windows opening on to a balcony, again with steps to the garden, and a second reception room. There’s plenty of space for four bedrooms on the two top floors, although the Vaughans use the first floor for a master bedroom suite with a large dressing room, and the top floor for the children’s bedrooms and a bathroom. Antonia, 42, used the skills she learned on a course with interior designer Kelly Hoppen to complete the project, and clearly no expense was spared. Her favourite room, the kitchen, was redesigned to make the most of the link with the garden. The back wall was replaced with glass folding doors, and a limestone terrace for al fresco dining leads to steps up to the garden. The clean lines of the contemporary kitchen, with its smooth Corian worktops and large central island, were chosen by Antonia, as were the bespoke wooden shutters on all the other floors. The house is a hymn to harmony, with polished wood floors, limestone fireplaces and Lefroy Brooks bathroom fittings. Underfloor heating, Lutron lighting with multiple settings and surround-sound systems on three floors add to the high-spec finish. The Vaughans knew they were . stretching their budget when they bought the house for £900,000 in 1999, . but Antonia wanted it more than any of the others they saw. Wandsworth . has since moved dramatically upmarket, with demand from the so-called . Nappy Valley set – families searching for good-sized houses, decent . schools and green spaces. Tranquil: The first floor master bedroom in the property, built in the mid-19th century . Space to breathe: The airy front room has a view of the secluded back garden . Property website Zoopla says a detached home in Wandsworth averages £1.6 million, but estate agent Savills gives the Vaughans’ a top-end guide price of £3.5 million due to its position and high standard of the interior. The house – the childhood home of broadcaster Louis Theroux – is painted in neutral shades for good reason, says Antonia. ‘You need somewhere calm if you live with my husband,’ she laughs. ‘I like things to be simple but of really good quality. I loved the course with Kelly because it made sense of everything I’d always been drawn to – smooth shapes, symmetry and neutral shades.’ So be warned, Johnny: don’t spoil the look by trampling that Thames mud indoors.

The mother of a 13-year-old dancer killed when their car was hit by a drug dealer chased by police, has spoken of her ‘unbearable’ grief over losing her daughter. Wiktoria Was died instantly when 33-year-old Devon Newell crashed into the car she was travelling in with her mother, stepfather and four-year-old brother in Southwark, south-east London on January 6. Her mother Anna Uroda said her life was ‘incomplete’ without her daughter adding: ‘I will be tortured for the rest of my life,’ Woolwich Crown Court heard today. Victim: Talented Wiktoria Was, left, died when Devon Newell, right, hit her family's car fleeing from police . Year 9 pupil Wiktoria and her mother . were travelling with her step-father Maciek Struzik and four-year-old . brother Max Uroda at the time of the crash. Drug dealer Newell, who did not have a . drivers licence, was trying to evade capture when he slammed into the . back of the family’s VW Polo causing the car to spin violently onto the . pavement and into a wall. The court was shown police video that . Newell had driven to speeds up to 70 miles per hour, sometimes three . times the speed limits, going through red lights and swerving onto the . other side of the road moments before the crash. Seconds later, after his vehicle had . spun 180 degrees into the other side of the road, he ran out of the car . leaving his female passenger, Ms Brooks, in the passenger seat but he . was soon caught by police officers. Wiktoria was pronounced dead 20 . minutes later despite CPR from police and paramedics and emergency . surgery carried out on the roadside. Tragic: Wiktoria died in the crash in New Cross, south-east London on January 6 . Injuries: Wiktoria was pronounced dead at the scene and her stepfather was taken to hospital . In a statement read out in court Ms . Uroda said her daughter was ‘loveable, sensitive, trustworthy, happy, . intelligent, hardworking and a sensible young girl full of life and . blossoming into a beautiful blue-eyed young lady’. The statement continued: ‘It breaks my . heart open with unbearable emotion, all purpose of life have become a . mystery. How do I tell Max that he will never see his sister again? He . says, ‘Where is Wiktoria? I want Wiktoria, I love Wiktoria.’ ‘Without Wiktoria my life is incomplete, I will be tortured for the rest of my life for it. I face only darkness. ‘If only life had a stop and rewind button, Wiktoria would be with us safe and sound.’ The court was told that following the . crash, Wiktoria’s little brother had been left traumatised suffering . from night terrors and bedwetting. Her stepfather had also suffered . serious injuries and was awaiting physiotherapy for four fractures to . the left side of his lumber vertebra but he had not been permanently . disabled. Newell, who pleaded guilty to one . count of causing death by dangerous driving, one count of causing . serious injury by dangerous driving and one summary count of driving . without a licence and without insurance, had been bailed by Sussex . Police for another offence in October of last year. Crash: Mr Newell was being chased by a marked police car when he hit the back of the Volkswagen Polo where Wiktoria had been sat in the back, pictured . The court heard that he had a series . of previous convictions including drug dealing and sexual offences and . had never owned a full driving licence, having had his provisional one . revoked in 1998. ‘It was driving characterised by ignoring obvious signals by police for him to stop’, said prosecutor Peter Clement. ‘The danger that he posed in driving the way that he did, deliberately ignoring the rules of the road, was obvious’ ‘He demonstrated absolute disregard for the speed limits, traffic lights, or other road users. ‘In short, we suggest the defendant had regard only for himself.’ Sentencing him to a total of eight and . a half years, Judge Hilliard said: ‘This case represents a terrible . tragedy and you are responsible for it. Because of your criminal . conduct, 13-year-old Wiktoria Was was killed. Her own life ended, all . that promise, all those hopes for the future, all brought to an end and . by you. Her mother, parents, her family, they have always got to live . with that loss long after you have been released from the sentence I . will pass. No sentence I pass will make up for what you have done. The . sentence is not for one moment intended to reflect the value of human . life, which of course is wholly beyond value.’ Damage: Council workers are pictured trying to repair a traffic light damaged in the fatal collision . News of Wiktoria’s death prompted an outpouring of grief from her fellow pupils at Goffs School, in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire . Headteacher Alison Garner said immediately after the death that staff and pupils were still in shock after receiving the news. ‘Wiktoria was a highly valued member . of our community - funny, charming, bubbly and with a bright future . ahead of her’, she said. ‘She will be much missed by us all.’ In a statement on the school’s website Mrs Garner paid tribute to Wiktoria. She said: ‘It was impossible to be in . Wiktoria’s company without being struck by her wonderful personality and . humour, as well as her many talents, and her loss is felt deeply . throughout our school.’ The family requested all Goffs School students wear their uniform to the funeral, as blue was Wiktoria’s favourite colour. Following the funeral mass, the family attended a private cremation before returning to the Church Hall.","Wiktoria Was, 13, died following the crash in Southwark, south-east London .

Stirling business: This Ferrari 250 GT SWB, driven to victory by Sir Stirling Moss during three races in 1960, has been sold for more than £7million . Iconic: The car, which was sold in the past six weeks, still has the original gearbox and the original engine . Chassis number 2119, which has been owned by businessman Nigel Corner since 2003, was privately sold in the past six weeks. But because sales of classic Ferraris are handled 'behind closed doors' like those of fine works of art, news about the sale has only just surfaced. James Cottingham, a vehicle acquisition specialist at Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering, confirmed the firm had brokered a deal but would not reveal the agreed price-tag or discuss the two parties involved. However, it is thought the car - known as 2119 GT - sold for in excess of £7million, making it one of the most expensive cars to ever change hands in the UK. Another alloy-bodied 250 GT SWB, with no racing provenance, fetched £5million at auction in the US last month. Stirling's successes at the wheel add a significant value to the Ferrari with Mr Cottingham believing it is one of the most important Ferraris in existence. Success: Stirling Moss racing a later version of the Ferrari 250 GT, at Goodwood in 1961, in which he was also victorious . Classic: Sir Stirling drove a Ferrari 250 GT SWB in 1960 and in 1961. He is pictured here with the later version . He said: 'The 1960 Goodwood TT was a defining race for so many reasons. 'Rob Walker had ordered 2119 GT from Ferrari for Moss to drive in the Tourist Trophy. 'Moss had suffered a severe accident at Spa earlier in the season and was a doubt to start the race. 'Telegrams in the history file of 2119 GT document correspondence between Walker and Ferrari including the message from Walker to Ferrari declaring ""Moss is fit!"" and that the car would be needed in time for the race on August 20, 1960. Winner: The car has a top speed of 152mph and a 0-60mph time of 6.2 seconds . 'In the race itself Moss and 2119 GT were in a class of their own. Moss won the race by two laps. 'It was the first Ferrari to win the TT and it remains completely original, the engine and gearbox are both original. 'It is a very famous British Ferrari and it has hardly been seen in recent years and we are delighted it will be staying in the UK. 'It is a unique car. It was sympathetically restored by DK Engineering in the 1980s and is the best car we have sold in recent years. Deal: Chassis number 2119, which has been owned by businessman Nigel Corner since 2003, was sold discreetly in the past six weeks . Important: James Cottingham, a vehicle acquisition specialist at Hertfordshire-based DK Engineering, said the car was 'one of the most important Ferraris in existence' 'Without doubt 2119 GT is the most iconic Ferrari 250 SWB and indeed one of the most important Ferraris in existence. 1960: STIRLING MOSS AS DRIVER . 1st - Tourist Trophy, Goodwood1st - Brands Hatch1st - Tourist Trophy, Nassau . 1961: MIKE PARKES AS DRIVER . 1st - Snetterton1st - Fordwater Trophy, Goodwood4th - Oulton Park (driven by Jack Sears)2nd -Tourist Trophy, Goodwood1st - Molyslip Trophy, Snetterton . 'It is a great honour for DK Engineering to have been given the responsibility of maintaining and selling what we consider to be one of the greatest GT Ferraris in existence.' Under the bonnet of the Ferrari 250 GT SWB - which was the 39th model built - is a 3-litre V12 engine which develops around 300bhp. This gave it a 0-60mph time of 6.2 seconds and a top speed of 152mph. The Ferrari was built in August 1960 with Moss winning the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood race track later in the month. During the race, Moss covererd 108 laps in three hours, averaging 85mph. It was the first time Ferrari had won the Tourist Trophy with the Italian car manufacturer responsible for the winning cars over the next three years too. Moss won two more races in the 250 GT and in 1961 the car was sold to Tommy Sopwith of the Equipe Endeavour race team. Fellow Brit Mike Parkes picked up three victories in the car in 1961.

Similarities: A judge refused to grant Adelphoi Ltd a trademark for the name Batsman, as as it could be mistaken with superhero Batman, featured above in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises . One is a position in cricket, the other is the world's best-known superhero. But a company has been told that it cannot brand its products with the name Batsman as the public will become confused and liken it to Batman. Intellectual Property Office adjudicator Oliver Morris refused to grant a trademark for the name to London-based Adelphoi, a sound and design company. Adelphoi had sought to secure the Batsman . trademark for exclusive exploitation across a huge range of goods, the . majority of which were cricket-related. But Mr Morris ruled in favour of DC Comics,  the US entertainment giants behind the famous superhero who own the Batman trademark. In his ruling, the judge accepted that 'Batman is a . very well known comic book character' pointing to evidence that Batman was first invented in 1939. Despite accepting that there is a 'conceptual dissonance' between Batman and Batsman, described as 'a type of cricketer or . an aircraft safety officer', he found that the two words 'may easily be . mistaken for one another'. Mr Morris added: 'The marks look (and sound) so close that the difference in concept is likely to go unnoticed. 'If . the difference goes unnoticed then the conceptual difference has no . material effect. There is a likelihood of confusion.'

The hearing heard that the degree to which the . average consumer considers purchases meant that the difference in . concept would not readily leap out. Difference: The judge found that the two words 'may easily be mistaken for one another' despite a 'conceptual dissonance' between Batman and Batsman . Mr Morris said that DC Comics relied on its .

He added that the evidence showed there was also a comic book character called 'Batsman', who, he said, is 'apparently the disembodied consciousness of a future Batman'. However, the judge found that this had no significance in his decision. Batman has appeared in thousands of comic books, with global sales ranging from around $6 million (33.9million) to $12 million (£7.9million) per year between 2001 and 2007. Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, grossed over £30million in the UK and its sequel, The Dark Knight sold more than 2.5million copies on Blu-ray and DVD by December 2008. Mr Morris also detailed almost $20million (£13.1million) in merchandising sales in the UK between 1998 and 2011. However, he declined to order Adelphoi to pay DC's legal costs, finding that DC's lawyers could have been 'more measured in their approach'.","Adelphoi Ltd wanted to use the name Batsman for range of cricket goods .

Tall, blonde and fearsomely clever, 42-year-old Helena Seger is a multimillionaire businesswoman who doesn't take any prisoners. She also happens to be the girlfriend of Swedish footballer, Zlatan Ibrahimovich, 31, whose team, Paris St Germain, just welcomed David Beckham into its ranks. Dubbed the 'Queen Bee of French WAGS' by local tabloids, it is Seger who Victoria Beckham will need to impress if she is to make any headway with the wives of David's new team mates. Sharp: Swedish businesswoman Helena Seger is said to be ferociously clever... and has a temper to match . Catwalk to catfight? Victoria (second left) has had a busy week but things could take a turn for the worse . And with Victoria, 38, set to attend Paris St Germain's match against Marseille on Sunday, the moment when she finally comes face to face with Seger isn't far away. But will the high-powered pair get along? According to French sources, Helena is known as the 'Victoria Beckham of Paris' and she's not keen on having a rival for the spotlight. The source added: 'If Posh is to fit in at PSG, she will need to try to befriend Zlatan’s girlfriend and not do anything that will get on her nerves. 'Helena is a shrewd and powerful woman who is a real force in Paris. She is refined, elegant and classy and comes from a respectable family. 'But she is also someone who made her own money and got where she is today through sheer force of ambition. 'In many ways she is very similar to Victoria. They could end up being good friends. After all, she is one of the few WAGs at PSG who speaks English. 'But they are so similar I can also imagine them having a huge falling out. And if Posh gets on Helena’s wrong side, life could be very difficult for her in Paris. She might find herself completely cut off from the other WAGs.'

Unlike British WAGs, the trio are hardly ever seen in public and rarely give interviews. What's more, the threesome - and Seger - consider themselves to be the epitome of Parisian chic and wouldn't be seen dead in obvious logos and bling, unlike the England team WAGs. While Victoria was top dog among England team WAGs such as Coleen Rooney, Alex Gerrard and Melanie Slade, building any kind of relationship with the PSG sorority means winning the approval of the fearsome Seger. Seger was memorably described by boyfriend Zlatan Ibrahimovich as an 'evil super bitch deluxe' in his 2011 autobiography, I Am Zlatan.

Love: Before meeting, Ezequiel Lavazzi, model Yanina Screpante dated tennis player Juan Martin del Potro . He also likened her to a mafia boss, saying she was like 'Tony Montana in Scarface, only a girl.' Despite Zlatan's unflattering choice of words and her initial rejection of him, the couple have been together since 2002 after meeting in the southern Swedish city of Malmö, and have two children, Maxmillian, seven, and Vincent, five. Like his girlfriend, the Swedish striker is notoriously spiky, and admits he doesn't suffer fools gladly. Zlatan is also believed to be less than impressed with the Beckhams' impending arrival, with sources revealing that the footballer sees David Beckham as little more than a trophy. Said a PSG source: 'Zlatan still sees himself as one of the best players in the world and only wants to play with his equals. He wants to win trophies — not be paraded next to them.' While Paris might be warmer than London, with a reception committee like that waiting for them, the Beckhams could soon find that the frosty weather has followed them to France.

The Russian birth mother of two boys who were adopted by a Texas couple appealed to President Vladimir Putin Wednesday, asking that her younger son be returned to her after his three-year-old brother died under suspicious circumstances. Yulia Kuzmina, 23, lost custody of her sons, Maksim (Max) and Kirill, in 2011 after she had been deemed unfit to raise them due to her addiction to alcohol. Alan and Laura Shatto, from Gardendale, Texas, adopted the siblings from a Russian orphanage last year. In January, three-year-old Max Shatto passed away. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heartbreak: Yulia Kuzmina, 23, made a tearful plea asking President Putin and the Russian state prosecutor to restore her parental rights so that she could raise her surviving son, Kirill . Emotional: Speaking to a Russian tabloid, Kuzmina broke down while recalling how her two young sons were taken away by social services while in the care of their alcoholic grandmother . Innocent: Two-year-old Kirill, left, and three-year-old Max, right, were taken away from their birth mother due to her alcoholism and adopted by a Texas couple . Laura Shatto told sheriff's deputies that her three-year-old adopted son was playing outside with his younger brother before she found the boy unresponsive. According to Ector County Sheriff Mark Donaldson, Mrs Shatto told deputies that she was inside the family's home outside of Odessa on January 21 and came out to find the three-year-old on the ground. Max was pronounced dead at the hospital. The medical examiner's office said it couldn't immediately be determined if bruises discovered on Max's body were intentional or accidental. Russian authorities have blamed Max's death on inhuman treatment by the adopted parents. In a letter made public Wednesday and cited by the New York Times, Kuzmina asked President Putin to restore her parental rights concerning her two-year-old son. 'I accept my guilt before the children, have found work and have the ability to provide for the child. Help me please, don’t allow the death of my second child, Kirill,' she wrote. The 23-year-old woman reiterated her request in an emotional interview with Russian tabloid Life News . 'I would like to appeal to the president, the state prosecutor and [attorney] Pavel Astakhov, asking them to take my second child from these adoptive parents so the same thing that happened to my first son doesn't happen again,' Kuzmina said in a Russian-language video posted on the paper's site. 'I will do everything to make it up to Kirill,' she added. Speaking to Life, a pale and gaunt Kuzmina tearfully recalled how she traveled to another city for work and left her alcoholic mother in charge of her two sons. When she returned, the 23-year-old mother was informed that Maksim had been taken away by social services. A year later, she lost custody of Kirill. According to Kuzmina, she was not made aware that the children were adopted by a U.S. family until much later. Astakhov, a children's rights ombudsman who is a vocal supporter of Russia's adoption ban, tweeted on Monday that Maxim had been 'murdered' by his adoptive mother, although he later conceded the investigation into the boy's death is ongoing, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. 'Inhuman treatment': Russian authorities are also saying Maxim was given psychiatric medication and are demanding to play a part in the investigation . Accused: Laura Shatto, right, is accused of beating little Max, right, to death last month . The news comes just days after Russia's Investigative Committee accused Little Max Shatto's adopted American mother of causing his tragic Jan. 21 death after she allegedly abused him and gave him psychiatric drugs. An . autopsy into Max's cause of death is . pending but Ector County Medical Examiner's office gave weight to the . Kremlin's claims after it confirmed marks on the child's body that could have been caused by abuse. Chief investigator Shirley Standefer said there were signs of bruising on Max's body, including in the lower abdominal area. However, she refused to comment on whether the bruises appeared to be intentional or accidental. The State Department has meanwhile cautioned people not to jump to conclusions about the boy's cause of death and to instead wait until the investigation and autopsy have delivered their results. Max's tragic death has received international attention in the wake of a recent Russian ban on all American adoptions. Russia's Investigative Committee said that it had opened an . investigation into the little boy's death. 'Three-year-old Maxim was beaten, . according to the investigators, by his adoptive mother, who fed him . psychoactive drugs over a long period of time, saying that he had some . psychiatric illness,' said Pavel Astakhov, the Russian Children's Rights . Commissioner alleges, according to The Telegraph. Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused . Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death . He said the toddler had numerous bruises on his body and damage to organs. 'Our consuls must be allowed to see the materials of the case and take part in the formulation of the prosecution,' he added. Texas Child Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins confirmed . the agency had received a report on Jan. 21 of the death of a three-year-old . named Max Shatto, and that the Ector County Sheriff's Office in West . Texas was investigating. Crimmins said CPS had received allegations of physical abuse and . neglect, but had not determined whether those allegations were true. Parents: The boy's adopted parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made . Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21 . Sgt. Gary Duesler, spokesman for the Ector County Sheriff's Office, said . no arrests have been made and authorities are waiting for autopsy . results. An obituary for Max Shatto published Jan. 26 by the Midland . Reporter-Telegram says he was born on Jan. 9, 2010, in the town of . Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a . family in Gardendale, about 350 miles west of Dallas, before his death . on Jan. 21, according to the obituary. When reached by telephone, Mr Shatto told the Telegraph: 'We're not aware of what any Russian envoy has said. We're not making any comment.' On the funeral home's website, . Max's parents wrote: 'Max, you were not with us long enough to leave . fingerprints on the walls but you left fingerprints upon our hearts. Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating . 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you.' The death comes weeks after Russia announced it was banning all American . adoptions in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian . human-rights violators. The ban also reflects lingering resentment over . the 60,000 Russian children adopted by Americans in the past two . decades, of which at least 19 have died. Russian Foreign Ministry official Konstantin Dolgov said in a statement that the boy's death was 'yet another case of inhuman treatment of a Russian child adopted by American parents.' Duesler said he could not immediately confirm or deny Russian allegations of abuse. Dolgov also accused the U.S. Department of State of not helping Russian consular officials investigate the death. Look of love: Alan Shatto embraces his son, Maxim, in this photo. Max's parents wrote in his obituary, 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels.

A State Department official said the government is aware of the case and 'takes very seriously the welfare of children, particularly children who have been adopted from other countries.' 'We will continue to assist the Russian Embassy and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in Texas,' said the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter.

An American couple have spoken of their joy after returning from Russia with the adopted son they thought they'd never have. Robert and Kim Summers from New Jersey, were just weeks away from picking up little Preston from a Moscow orphanage, when the Russian President Vladimir Putin passed a ban on Americans adopting Russian children. The move was widely seen as retaliation for a U.S. law which targeted Russians suspected of violating human rights. Joy: Kim Summers gives adopted son Preston a great big kiss after successfully getting him back to the U.S. despite a ban on American adopting Russian children . Despite feeling that the odds were stacked against them, the Summers travelled to Russia mid-January so they could at least try to bring Preston back . At the time the Summers were . devastated, with Robert breaking down in tears on television as he made a . heartfelt plea to Putin to reconsider the policy . He told CBS at the time: 'I cannot put into words how my wife and I feel right now. Russian President Vladimir Putin passed a ban on Americans adopting Russian children . 'And we ask Putin, please, consider alternate means, but don't let these children suffer. Please. That's all we ask.' But despite feeling that the odds were . stacked against them, the Summers travelled to Russia mid-January so . they could at least try to bring Preston back. In an interview with CBS Mrs Summers . recalled: 'We did not know. We just prayed and kept the faith and just . kept believing that, you know, all of our efforts would pay off.' The couple thought all hope was lost after a clerk at a Russian government office refused to process as passport for Preston. 'She looked at it and she said in Russian, ""Americans? I thought there was a ban on Americans. How could we give them this passport?""' Kim recalled. 'We held our breath and I gasped for air and I said, oh no. Please, don't let us go through all this and we're going to have problems,"" Robert added. The couple were save thanks to a loophole which stated that because the judge had already signed off on their adoption before the law was passed. They returned the next day and were issued a passport for Preston. Five days later, they left Russia and brought Preston home. New Home: Preston plays with some of his toys back at the Summers' house in New Jersey . New wheels: Preston's new father pushes him around on a Harley Davidson-style tricycle . 'Robert and I looked at each other and we said, it's over, it's over. And I can't even tell you the relief. And how elated we are,' said Kim. 'I completely understand when a mother says that she takes one look at her newborn child and is instantly in love with that child. I'm in love with him. I'm in love with him, and I do believe he's in love with us, too.' The Summers were one of an estrimated 1,0000 American families caught in teh middle of the adoption process when the ban was passed. The State Department estimates just 50 of those will be allowed to return to the U.S. with their children.","New Jersey couple were weeks away from picking up little Preston .

We still don't know why Lucy learned to walk: The famous 3.2million-year-old hominid fossil was found in Ethiopia, one of the regions analysed . A new study has cast doubt on the long-held theory that our ancestors evolved to walk upright to help them see farther on Africa's vast open grasslands. Scientists have long believed that early human ancestors began walking on two legs as a response to savannah encroaching on shrinking rainforests in north-east Africa. With fewer trees to swing from, human ancestors began walking to get around, while walking on two legs enabled them to see predators and prey further afield, the theory claims. But now a new analysis of the past 12million years' of vegetation change in the cradle of humanity has challenged long-held beliefs about the world in which our ancestors took shape - and, by extension, the impact it had on them. It found that while the shift to bipedalism seems to have occurred somewhere between 4million and 6million years ago, rainforests had been replaced by grasslands and seasonally dry forests some time before 12million years ago. Not only that, the tropical grasses and shrubs of the modern African savannah began to dominate the landscape earlier than thought, replacing other kinds of grasses better suited to a wetter environment. Sarah Feakins, of the University of Southern California, set out to investigate what types of vegetation dominated the landscape surrounding the African Rift Valley. The area, which includes present-day Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, is where early hominin fossils trace the history of human evolution. By combining sediment core studies of the waxy molecules from plant leaves with pollen analysis, Dr Feakins was able to investigate plant molecules dating back to between 12million and 1million years ago. 'It is the combination of evidence both molecular and pollen evidence that allows us to say just how long we've seen Serengeti-type open grasslands,' she said. Earlier studies on vegetation change . through this period relied on the analysis of individual sites . throughout the Rift Valley - offering narrow snapshots. But . Dr Feakins took a look at the whole picture by using a sediment core . taken in the Gulf of Aden, where winds funnel and deposit sediment from . the entire region. She then . cross-referenced her findings with Naomi Levin, of Johns Hopkins . University, who has compiled data from ancient soil samples collected . throughout eastern Africa.

The Renoir painting that caused a sensation when it was bought at a flea market for $7 may have been stolen from a museum six decades ago, and an auction house has put its sale on hold. The planned Saturday auction has been canceled after documents in the Baltimore Museum of Art's library were uncovered which reveal that the painting was on loan there from 1937 until 1951, when it was stolen. The Impressionist painting, whose title translates as 'Landscape on the Banks of the Seine,' was purchased two years ago at a West Virginia flea market. Scroll down for video . Stolen painting: The Renoir was discovered at a flea market in Virginia and bought unwittingly for $7 . BMA director Doreen Bolger could have the painting returned to her gallery . The buyer, a Virginia woman who has not revealed her name, took it to auction house The Potomack Co. in July, and experts there confirmed it was by the French master Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The frame of the painting includes a 'Renoir' plaque. It had been expected to fetch $75,000 or more at auction. 'Potomack is relieved this came to light in a timely manner as we do not want to sell any item without clear title,' said Elizabeth Wainstein, the owner of the Alexandria, Va.-based auction house. Potomack and museum officials have notified the FBI about the theft, and an FBI spokesman said the bureau was investigating. The documents, discovered by The Washington Post, indicate that the painting was part of . the collection of Saidie May, a major donor to the BMA. It was reported . stolen on Nov. 17, 1951, according to the documents, although there is . no known police report and the painting does not appear on a worldwide . registry of stolen art. The reported theft occurred shortly . after May's death, and the painting had not yet been formally accepted . into the museum's collection, which is why museum officials did not . initially realize it had been there, BMA director Doreen Bolger said. 'We were caught by surprise,' Bolger said Thursday. Bolger said she would be happy to show the painting again if it is ultimately returned to the museum. Antiques Roadshow: A flea-market like the one in Shenandoah Valley where the Renoir was uncovered . 'As this unfolds, we'll find out more about the ownership of the painting,' she said. 'If the painting is ours, we would be pleased to have it on view.' The woman who bought the painting at a flea market recently told The Huffington Post that she hasn’t entertained the thought of keeping it. 'I’d be too scared,' she said. She added that after auctioning the painting she planned to treat her mother to a trip to the Louvre to reward her for convincing her not to tear it apart.

A man convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend by dousing her with gasoline and setting her on fire was executed in Texas on Thursday after the U.S. Supreme Court refused his final appeal. Carl Blue, 48, was convicted of the September 1994 death of Carmen Richards-Sanders, 38, at her apartment in Bryan, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. Blue also tossed gasoline on a man in the apartment, but he survived and testified against Blue, who claimed the attack was a prank gone wrong. Carl Henry Blue, 48, who was convicted of capital murder in the fiery 1994 death of his ex-girlfriend, was executed Thursday evening in Huntsville . In his final statements, he greeted . victim’s daughter, Terrella Richards, as she entered the death chamber . viewing area by telling her he loved her. 'I never meant to hurt your mama,' Blue said while strapped to a gurney in the state’s death chamber. 'If I could change that, I would. … I forgive you. I hope you can forgive me.' He also told his parents, watching through another window, that he loved them. 'I . did something wrong, and now I’m paying the ultimate justice,' he said. 'It may be crooked justice but I forgive those people.' 'Hang on,' he told them. 'Cowboy up. I’m fixin’ to ride and Jesus is my vehicle.' He . took about a dozen breaths as the lethal drug began taking effect, said . he could 'feel it,' then slipped into unconsciousness. Blue was . pronounced dead at 6:56 p.m. Carl Henry Blue, 48, was pronounced dead at 6:56 p.m. local time at the state penitentiary at Huntsville, said the Texas Department of Criminal Justice . Blue’s death was the first execution this year in the nation’s most active death penalty state. Prosecutors said Blue walked seven miles from his home to a convenience store and had been drinking malt liquor and smoking crack behind the store when he bought 50 cents’ worth of gasoline he put in a 'Big Gulp' cup. Court records said he waited outside Richards-Sanders’ apartment, then rushed in when she opened the door, telling her: 'I told you I was going to get you.' He doused Richards-Sanders and ignited her. She was trying to start her life over after the couple broke up months earlier, 'and Carl wasn’t part of that, and that was a problem for Carl,' Shane Phelps, a prosecutor at Blue’s punishment trial, said before the execution. In this November 15th, 2012 photo, Carl Henry Blue looks back at family and friends while being escorted back to jail after having his execution date set - Blue was convicted of killing ex-girlfriend Carmen Richards-Sanders, 38, in her apartment in Bryan, Texas, in 1994 as she was getting ready to leave for work (right) When Blue discovered Larence Williams at the apartment, he threw what was left of the gasoline on Williams, setting him on fire. 'He had only one true love in his life … and here she was with another guy,' recalled John Quinn, the lead defense attorney at Blue’s 1995 trial. Hours later, Blue turned himself in to police. 'When I went to knock, she snatched the door open and had a cigarette,' Blue told police in a tape-recorded statement played at his trial. 'I wasted gas on both of them. And she caught on fire, and he caught on fire, and I took off running … I was scared, man.' Carl Henry Blue's execution was the second in the country this year. Texas leads the United States in total executions since the state re-introduced the death penalty in 1976 . Blue’s present appeals attorney, Michael Charlton, argued in appeals this week it was a conflict of interest for one of Quinn’s co-counsels to represent him in appeals because he likely wouldn’t contend his previous work was deficient. The conflict 'resulted in valuable and worthwhile claims not being presented to any court,' Charlton said. The Texas Attorney General’s office said the federal appeals were meritless because Blue had waived his right to a different lawyer, negating the conflict claim. Five years after his conviction, his death sentence was among about a half-dozen in Texas overturned by a federal judge who ruled it was improper for a former state prison psychologist to testify that the black man’s race could indicate a propensity for violence. Blue again was sentenced to die at a second punishment trial in 2001. At least 11 other prisoners are scheduled for lethal injection in the coming months in Texas, which executed 15 inmates last year.","Carl Henry Blue, 48, was pronounced dead at 6:56 p.m. local time at the state penitentiary at Huntsville .

Britain's second busiest railway station was evacuated after a fire on a train caused rush hour chaos this morning. Commuters were asked to leave Victoria station in central London after the blaze on a Gatwick Express service. Smoke was seen pouring from the engine before being extinguished but the train was empty at the time, National Rail said, and no one is reported to have been injured. The Victoria incident comes a day after a helicopter clipped a crane and crashed into a road just the other side of the Thames from the station during yesterday's rush hour. Emergency: Staff inspect the Gatwick Express train that was on fire this morning as it pulled into Victoria . Delays: Passengers waiting for services to Gatwick Airport and all over south London and southern England faced delays because of the incident . Trains were stopped from leaving or arriving for about an hour, with some still being diverted to London Bridge station or delayed by up to an hour. Firefighters have put out the fire on platform 13, and the station has reopened, but with delays. The Tube is running normally. Millions of rail passengers across Britain suffered miserable journeys this morning after a series of other problems led to long delays on major routes. Away from Victoria there were also difficulties in and out of King's Cross, Moorgate and Fenchurch Street stations in London. There were also long delays affecting services run by five train companies after a body was discovered on the line south of York. Delays of up to 90 minutes to services in and out of Fenchurch Street happebned due to a broken-down train in the Limehouse area of east London. A train failure was also the cause of disruption at New Southgate in north London and this led to delays to services between Stevenage in Hertfordshire and King's Cross and Moorgate stations. The problem near York, at Colton Junction south of the city, caused delays of up to 80 minutes - hold-ups which were expected to last until at least 1pm. Passengers on the London to Scotland East Coast line were among those affected. Incident: A fire on a Gatwick Express train led to Victoria station being completely evacuated this morning . In the West Midlands, a signalling problem at Wolverton was causing delays between Rugby, Northampton and Milton Keynes Central, while a broken-down train at Chelmsford in Essex led to delays of up to 60 minutes between Colchester and Shenfield. Victoria deals with 74million customers every year, second only in Britain to nearby Waterloo. As well as services to Gatwick, the station also serves Southeastern and Southern customers in south London . and as far away as Brighton. Southern Rail, responding to tweets from worried customers said: 'No-one was hurt which was good.' Chaos: Smoke was seen pouring from the train's engine on the platform at Britain's second busiest station, Victoria, but firefighters quickly put it out . Tom Edwards, an antiques dealer from London, who was trying to get a train to visit his mother, said he spotted flames and black smoke coming from the train. 'There was just a little bit of flames by the wheels,' he said. 'They put it out and then started chucking everybody out of the building. 'There was no panic.

Ministers were shamed into witholding a £16million aid payment to Rwanda last night following mounting criticism of their support for a regime accused of serious human rights abuses. The Department for International Development (DFID) confirmed that the payment had been blocked indefinitely while officials investigate evidence that Rwanda has been fuelling a bloody civil war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. The move is a major embarrassment for the Government, which has been a staunch defender of the Rwandan government and its controversial president Paul Kagame, who was due in London last night for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Bloodmoney? Aid payments from the UK to Rwanda have been blocked while officials investigate evidence that Rwanda has been fuelling a bloody civil war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo . David Cameron and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell have publicly defended Kagame, despite mounting allegations of human rights abuses within both Rwanda and its neighbours. Tony Blair is also an enthusiastic supporter of Kagame, and has described him as a ‘visionary leader’ and a ‘great friend’. Accusations: Rwanda's controversial president Paul Kagame . Kagame’s regime is heavily dependent on . foreign aid, which accounts for a third of its annual budget, and . Britain is the tiny East African country’s biggest foreign donor. This year it is due to give £75million. The Dutch government suspended its entire aid programme to the country earlier this week, and Washington has also frozen military support. Now, apparently stung by criticism that they were ‘turning a blind eye’ to human rights abuses, UK ministers have also decided to act. Carina Tertsakian of the campaign group Human Rights Watch said the Government’s support for Kagame’s regime was ‘becoming embarrassing’. Welcoming the suspension of aid, she said: ‘DFID has provided almost unconditional support to Rwanda, despite abundant evidence of human rights violations inside Rwanda, and Rwanda’s persistent interference in armed conflict in neighbouring Congo. ‘We hope that this signals a long-overdue shift in UK policy on Rwanda, and that the Government will now take a strong stand not only on Rwanda’s role in fuelling the deadly conflict in Congo, but on severe restrictions on freedom of expression inside Rwanda. Rwanda remains a country ruled by fear, in which opposition parties are not allowed to function, and people end up in prison simply for daring to criticise the government.’ Mr Mitchell, who visited Rwanda last week, said he had delivered a ‘frank’ message to Kagame about alleged human rights abuses. A DFID spokesman said the aid payment . had been delayed while Mr Mitchell considers whether Rwanda is meeting . its commitment to respect human rights, a key element in any British aid . programme. Tony Blair described Kagame as a 'visionary leader' and a 'great friend' while David Cameron has publicly defended him, despite mounting allegations of human rights abuses . Two years ago the United Nations published a damning report alleging appalling war crimes by the Tutsi army in 1995, which Kagame led. But supporters of President Kagame insist that his record has to be seen in the context of his country’s war-torn recent history. Kagame disputes the UN findings.","Major embarrassment for the Government, .

The United Nations is set to introduce a treaty cracking down on the $60billion global business of illicit trading in small arms. The move is aimed at curbing violence in some of the most troubled corners of the world, but has unsurprisingly ruffled feathers with pro-gun activists in the US, including those of the National Rifle Association. They have denounced the treaty as a threat to their constitutional right to bear arms. Controversial topic: Pro-gun campaigners say the treaty as a threat to their constitutional right to bear arms (file picture) 'Without apology, the NRA wants no . part of any treaty that infringes on the precious right of lawful . Americans to keep and bear arms,' NRA executive vice president Wayne . LaPierre told the UN this month. 'Any treaty that includes civilian firearms ownership in its scope will be met with the NRA's greatest force of opposition.' Fellow . critic John Bolton, who was President George W. Bush's ambassador to . the UN, wrote that gun-control advocates 'hope to use restrictions on . international gun sales to control gun sales at home.' But . what both sides ignore is a well-enshrined legal principle that says no . treaty can override the Constitution or US laws, according to the . Associated Press. Campaign issue: Barack Obama, left, has suggested stiffer gun regulations while Mitt Romney, right, yesterday said he did not think the laws should change . In fact, a first draft of the treaty circulated in New York this week has been criticised by arms-control activists for containing too many loopholes. For instance, it does not include a proposed ban on ammunition trade. Gun activists are standing firm in near-blanket opposition to such a ban, as last Friday's deadly Aurora, Colo., theater shooting rampage heightens interest in the deliberations and raises the stakes. Barack Obama supports the treaty effort but has not talked about it on the presidential campaign trail. Equally, presumptive Republican candidate Mitt Romney has not addressed the issue but broadly opposes what he sees as overreach by the UN on many fronts. He told a town hall in Ohio last week that he was 'not willing to give the United Nations sovereignty in any way or form' over US citizens or law. This week, they clashed long-distance when Mr Obama suggested stiffer gun regulations in a speech to the National Urban League and Mr Romney argued in an NBC interview from London, where he is traveling, that America does not need new gun laws. The Constitution's Second Amendment offers broad protection for weapons ownership by civilians. As recently as 2008, the Supreme Court affirmed this when it struck down a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia, ruling that individuals have a constitutional right to keep guns for self-defence and other purposes. The rule that treaty obligations may not infringe on individual constitutional protections and rights goes back at least to a 1920 ruling that a migratory bird treaty with Canada, which prohibited the hunting or capturing of certain birds, was an unconstitutional interference with states' rights under the 10th Amendment. Treaties are government-to-government agreements and do not subject citizens of one nation to laws of another or to those of an outside body. The UN resolution that authorised the drafting of the small arms treaty recognises the right of nations 'to regulate internal transfers of arms' and says nothing in the treaty that emerges will affect 'constitutional protections on private ownership' of firearms. There are many other court rulings spelling out the limits of treaties. If an act of Congress is inconsistent with a treaty obligation, the law passed by Congress prevails, which has led to various international treaties with Indian tribes being quashed. A proposed treaty to regulate exports and imports of small weapons has been on the UN agenda since 2006, when Mr Bush ordered a veto. Mr Obama got the process rolling again in 2010. So far, 152 nations have participated in the drafting and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has pledged to push for Senate ratification once there is a final document. But it may be an empty gesture. Treaties must be ratified by two-thirds of the 100-member Senate, or 67 votes. With pressure mounting from the gun lobby, led by the politically powerful NRA, a letter opposing such a treaty has already gained the signatures of well over 50 senators. Even so, fears have spread online lately, with some pro-gun activists even suggesting the Obama administration was capitalising on the Colorado killings to advance its case for gun control and others portraying it as a plot by the UN to expand its reach. The controversy fuels suggestions by many conservatives that Mr Obama ultimately hopes to ban possession of firearms, even though he has stood up for protecting Second Amendment rights. Some gun-rights advocates acknowledge that a treaty by itself would not be likely to undercut these Second Amendment guarantees. 'But there are all kinds of ways that international law insinuates itself into US law even when there's not a formal ratification,' said David Kopel, research director for the conservative Independence Institute, based in Colorado. For instance, he suggests a treaty could affect the shipment of certain gun parts to US manufacturers. But Gabor Rona, international legal director of Human Rights First, said: 'There is no doubt that the Constitution is superior to any international treaties.'","The National Rifle Association say the treaty is an infringement of their rights .

American authorities are increasing the number of licenses for surveillance drones despite concerns over personal privacy. The Federal Aviation Administration announced on Friday that it had issued 1,428 permits to domestic drone operators since 2007, far more than were previously known. Of these permits, 327 are still listed as active. The permits have been issued to police, universities, transport departments and at least seven federal agencies for devices from unarmed Predators drones to model airplanes. A Dragonflyer X6 helicopter was among drones owned by Seattle police before its mayor ended the program over privacy concerns . A Seattle police officer demonstrated the drones before the city's mayor banned their use by officers . This week the FAA took the step of soliciting proposals to create six testing sites for drones ahead of the September 2015 deadline set by Congress to open airspace to drones. It estimates that as many as 10,000 drones could take to the skies by 2020. Police departments are said to be waiting for the FAA to issue guidelines on drone use in congested area, among other issues, according to the LA Times. Lawmakers in 15 states are looking at plans to restrict drone use in their airspace amid concerns over spying. Earlier this month the mayor of Seattle ordered the city's police to abandon its plan to use drones after protests from residents and privacy campaigners, despite FAA approval. Mayor Mike McGinn said the police department would return the unmanned aerial vehicles to the vender after being bought with a federal grant. The drones would have been unarmed but allowed the police to use face-recognition software. Opposition . to the use of drones in the United States has come from across the political spectrum, including civil liberties advocates and those . worried over government intrusion. Mayor McGinn is among lawmakers leading the opposition to drones because of concerns over individual privacy . Earlier this month the Charlottesville City Council in Virginia passed a resolution imposing a two-year moratorium on the use of drones within city limits. The Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties group behind the city's effort, said Charlottesville is the first city in the country to limit the use of drones by police to collect evidence related to criminal activity. US Department of Homeland Security drones enter Washington airspace occasionally, patrolling the Canadian border east of the Cascade mountains.

Fiona Harris held a framed picture of Charlie as she followed his coffin out of church before a private family burial today . Despite the odds, Charlie defied doctors by living to see his last Christmas. But despite undergoing an experimental drugs trial to try to overcome acute myeloid leukaemia, medics were unable to save him. He died with his parents and sister Ellie, 12, by his side last Friday at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. Today 500 mourners packed out St Mary & All Saints Church in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, for the youngster’s funeral. His tiny white coffin was carried into church by his parents and escorted out by his favourite toy car 45 minutes later. Before the service, Mr Beard posted a moving tribute to his son on the Facebook page set up by the family to publicise Charlie's plight. He wrote: 'Well it's nearly time my little hero, what a journey we have had, loads of tears loads of pain but most importantly loads and loads of smiles and laughter. 'You brought us all closer together, you was a fighter right until the end, you proved them wrong so many times Charlie and I'm so proud of you for that.

We just want to give thanks for his life and courage.' Among those who attended the service were 120 postal workers who worked alongside Mr Beard. A group of them previously recorded an album to raise money for Cords4Life, a charity set up by Charlie’s parents. Postman Carl Wilkes said the youngster had 'united a workforce' through the Rubber Band Aid project. Mourners, including people wearing 'Charlie's Pride' T-shirts, gathered outside the St Mary and All Saints church in Kidderminster to pay their respects . Before the service, a cavalcade of motorbikes and scooters, with riders wearing tribute T-shirts, arrived at the church followed by a fire engine from the Hereford and Worcester fire brigade . Only three months earlier Charlie had joined big sister Ellie, 12, in the same church for their parents' wedding . He said: 'Charlie will never be forgotten and we will continue to raise funds for Cords4Life in his memory. 'We had a minute’s applause for him at work and there were a lot of tears. We consider his dad one of our own and our thoughts are with him and Fiona.' After the service, Charlie’s coffin was taken for a private burial nearby. To date, Charlie’s fight against leukaemia has reached more than two million people through a social media campaign started by his mother. During his illness, Charlie received stem cell treatment from an umbilical cord donated by a mother in the United States. The family want to raise awareness of umbilical cord donation in the UK through their charity Cords4Life.","Charlie Harris-Beard had suffered from cancer since April 2011 .

A trainee lawyer who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination was subjected to a 'full frontal attack' on her abilities by a corporate partner, a tribunal heard today. The same corporate partner was also said to have criticised Katie Tantum, 33, for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night in the office on a major project. Miss Tantum was a trainee on £42,000 a year at Travers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby. But she claims the firm 'just stopped bothering' with her when they discovered she was pregnant. Katie Tantum is suing law firm Travers Smith for loss of earnings after claiming she was not offered another contract when she told bosses she was pregnant . Miss Tantum claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay maternity leave, despite a glowing review from the firm's head of real estate. Now she is suing for loss of earnings. Helen Croke, a partner in the corporate department, told other bosses during a review of Miss Tantum’s progress that the Cambridge graduate 'lacked drive and enthusiasm' and made mistakes on important documents. She said: 'I saw certain things in Katie that made me talk to Caroline Murphy (her first supervisor). I was very involved in why Katie was not given a job in corporate. 'It was a not a good review. Clearly corporate wasn’t a good seat for her.' When comparing Miss Tantum's review with that of another trainee, Ms Croke said it was like 'comparing apples and oranges.' She said Miss Tantum made mistakes on an important corporate transaction when the team had to work through the night. She added: 'Katie would have been working on very particular types of documents, processing documents and transferring shares. 'Those were the documents I particularly noticed, and other transactions, were coming back and being marked as incorrect. 'I was aware of mistakes. The impression I received from both Caroline and another employee was that Katie’s work on transactions were poor. 'When you’re in a situation where work is frustrating assistants because it was incorrect, that is not the time I can take on a review of a trainee. 'I can’t believe she didn’t know she was making mistakes.' Miss Tantum's lawyer accused Ms Croke of launching a 'full frontal attack' on Miss Tantum in her witness statement after she said the plaintiff 'gave the impression she didn’t want to do what she was doing'. The tribunal also heard that Ms Croke was 'very critical' of Miss Tantum after she worked through the night on the transaction, but left at around 6.30am because she did not feel well. David Massarella, representing Miss Tantum, said: 'You made a comment on her leaving work in the middle of the night. 'She knows she left at 6.30am. She knows that because she went to Pret, which does not open until then.' Ms Croke denies criticising Miss Tantum's behaviour that night. In March last year, Miss Tantum, from Kew, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses. In her witness statement she said: 'I told my supervisor, Mahesh Varia, who seemed supportive and thanked me for telling him. Miss Tantum said she was criticised for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night . 'But Mr Mahesh just stopped bothering with me. I was not given anywhere near the same amount of work, which I found frustrating.' Miss Tantum, who is fluent in French and German, said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full maternity leave and was ‘absolutely committed to returning to the firm’. However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. She said senior partner Andrew King told her that ‘no one put their hand up’ for her. She said: 'I was one of only three trainees out of 22 not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract.' The firm's head of real estate told the hearing he was 'delighted' to find out Miss Tantum was pregnant. Julian Bass said: 'Having shared a room with Katie for six months, we got on very well. When she told me she was pregnant I wasn’t surprised because of her age and so on. 'I was genuinely delighted.' But despite a glowing review from Mr Bass, Miss Tantum was not offered a place in the real estate department, even though there were two spaces for trainees. He said: 'She was a strong contender in the real estate department. She demonstrated the sort of skills which could make her a good real estate lawyer.' The tribunal also heard how the pregnancy was not even mentioned by 'mute' partners when discussing Miss Tantum’s future at the firm. Ms Croke said: 'I don’t believe there is pregnancy discrimination at Travers Smith.' The hearing continues.","Katie Tantum claims she was criticised for leaving early after working through the night at law firm Travers Smith .

He later joked about plastering the offending image on the festival's shuttle buses instead, and suggested the mermaid could wear a shawl. The firm Alpha Taxis applied to the council for permission to use the image on the back of its car to show its support for the festival. But they were surprised to be told the graphic design of a mythical creature broke council rules. Mr Giddings said: 'I am genuinely stunned, I thought it was a joke at first.

Nascar racing driver Danica Patrick has become the first woman to take pole position at the Daytona 500 race in Florida. Patrick, 30, also became the first woman to become the pole-sitter in any Nascar top division event - the latest in a long line of achievements for one of the most prominent women in motorsport. Patrick posted a qualifying lap of 196.4mph in her number 10 Chevrolet, completing the 2.5mile-long route at the Florida superspeedway in 45.817 seconds yesterday. She will line up alongside four-time Nascar champion Jeff Gordon on the front row of the grid this Sunday, for the first race in the 2013 Sprint Cup Series. Scroll down for video . Danica Patrick posed with her pole award after qualifying on the front row for Sunday's Daytona 500 . Danica Patrick celebrated her pole position by holding up her hands to acknowledge her number 10 Chevrolet . Last season Patrick was given the Most Popular Driver Award for the lower division NASCAR Nationwide Series . She was tipped to take pole after topping the second practice session on Saturday before qualifying. After her lap, she had to wait for two hours while 37 other drivers took their turns to try to knock her off top spot with faster laps. Patrick, from Roscoe, Illinois, qualifies as a rookie as it is only her first full season in the sport - and became the first rookie to take pole since Jimmie Johnson in 2002. Patrick, competing for Stewart-Hass Racing, told CNN that the magnitude of her achievement would only sink in after the race itself. She said: '[It] is something that happens down the road. In the moment, it's about thinking about what I need to do for next Sunday and trying to make some more history. 'If you're anywhere but the front row, it's hard to see on race day.' She paid tribute to her crew, claiming her involvement was only 10 per cent compared to their 90 per cent input. But crew chief Tony Gibson said it was an equal effort. He said: 'I'm proud of her. She didn't falter.' Patrick told CNN's Don Lemon: 'I've heard stories about a kid, a boy or a girl, saying, ""But mommy, daddy. That's a girl that's out there racing."" 'And then they can have that conversation to say that, ""You can do anything you want to do, and gender doesn't matter."" Your passion is what matters. And that's cool.' Three-time Daytona 500 winner Gordon . said: 'This is great from the sport and the rest of us will benefit from . it. I'm proud to sit on the front row with her.' After the qualifying session, Gordon . asked Patrick to pose for a photo with his five-year-old daughter Ella, . who had requested an introduction. The Daytona 500 is the series' most prestigious race - considered to be Nascar's equivalent of the Super Bowl. The Florida track's breezy coastal location makes it difficult for a driver to break away on their own from the chasing pack. It is one of four races in the Nascar calendar where power is restricted to 500bhp. Before making the switch to Nascar, Patrick raced in the IndyCar series. Her Indy Japan 300 win in April 2008 made her the only woman so far to win an IndyCar race.

Coronation Street star Catherine Tyldesley has come under attack for donating her £10,000 prize from All Star Family Fortunes to a charity for prisoners' families. Miss Tyldesley, 29, who plays barmaid Eva Price in the ITV soap, and her family beat Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean and her relatives to win the money on the show, broadcast on Sunday evening. But some viewers on the social networking site criticised Miss Tyldesley's choice of charity - Out There, in Manchester. Catherine Tyldesley joined forces with her family to win £10,000 on All Star Family Fortunes . Miss Tyldesley appeared on the show with host Vernon Kay and her family . Catherine Tyldesley plays barmaid Eva Price in the ITV soap, pictured alongside Marc Baylis as Rob Donovan . The charity, which is staffed by Catholic volunteers from the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, gives emotional and practical support to the families of those behind bars. One viewer, Chris Deighan, wrote: 'What about a victims charity? You are a disgrace.' Another, Jade Conway, said: 'Bit tasteless u chose that charity considering it just been James Bulgers anniversary, his charity is a more worthy 1.' Viewer Amy Jones tweeted: 'Did you really choose prisoners' families as your chosen charity when there is the NSPC or cancer charities - what a waste!' The husband of James Bulger's mother tweeted Miss Tyldesley to say that the donation was ill-advised. Stuart Fergus, 37, who is married to James's mother Denise, 45, wrote: 'There are so many more deserving charities. What about the victims' families?' Miss Tyldesley, who has 92,000 followers on the site, took to Twitter to defend her choice. She wrote: 'Getting a lot of stick about my chosen charity. 'The children/families of prisoners are innocent and often left with nothing. 'Children living with constant bullying and in poverty. It's NOT their fault. Have a heart.' Most of the tweets responding to Miss Tyldesley were overwhelmingly supportive. Annie Parker wrote: 'The families of prisoners carry out a hidden sentence that no one sees, the statistics for their children is sad - let's help.' Claire Greenwood said: 'Its not fair . for children to pay for the mistakes made by their parents/guardians! I . think you chose a good charity!' Another . user, Pat Hendry, wrote: 'Bang right.

Miss Tyldesley responded to her critics on her Twitter profile after the show's broadcast . 'The families are often considered . guilty by association. This stigma has far reaching effects.

It's not just the bride who wants to look her best when she gets married - the groom hopes to sparkle in the wedding photos, too. So Jon Borowik, 23, who tipped the scales at an obese 23.5 stone, knew he had to do something about his appearance before getting married to his girlfriend Jessica, 27, this April. And in just one year the bar manager from Sidmouth, Devon, has managed to lose nine stone - one stone more than the weight of his eight-stone wife-to-be. Jon Borowick, 23, lost nine stone in preparation for his wedding to girlfriend Jessica in April . Over 12 months Jon shrunk from an XXXL to a medium, as he hated the idea of being fat in photos of their special day. Jon, who proposed to Jessica on Christmas Day 2011, has had to change his entire wardrobe three times since then. He said: 'Jessica is eight stone, so I've lost her in weight and more - it's surreal. Annoyingly, she's happy no matter what, but she's proud of me and very supportive.' Jon now aims to reach his ultimate target of 10st before he and tie the knot.

Super-slimmer Jon tries on his wedding outfit, and holds up the pair of trousers he would have worn on his big day had he not lost all the weight . He said he was 'lazy', refused to walk anywhere and ate far too much. 'Now I can walk down the street with my head held high and don't feel as self-conscious. I went in to Slimming World with the goal of losing one stone in four months, but I lost it in two weeks. That gave me real motivation.' Slimming World consultant Katrina Barker, who runs the town's sessions, called John 'an inspiration'.

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 07:30 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 18 February 2013 . A wildlife photographer hoping to capture images of the elusive bobcat was horrified when she eventually found one - in the jaws of an alligator. Despite her shock, professional photographer Jamie Felton managed to capture the moment in a nature centre in Florida on her camera. The brutal collection of images show the alligator in its most lethal state as it rips apart the bobcat - normally around twice the size of a domestic cat. Scroll down for video . Overpowered: The bobcat makes a desperate bid to escape but is overpowered by the much bigger alligator . Alligators' diet consists mainly of fish and birds but they've been known to attack deer, dogs, Florida panthers and black bears if they hungry enough. Ms Felton had spent several months visiting the nature centre to photograph the bobcats and was heartbroken to see one of them being killed by an alligator. Ms Felton, 53, said: 'As I walked on the boardwalk, someone told me a alligator had caught an otter. 'I've gotten used to alligators eating turtles and birds but was surprised to hear it had caught an otter. 'As I rounded the corner the alligator jumped out of the water with an entire bobcat in his jaws. 'I wanted to cry, I may have shed a tear or two, but I took the pictures anyway. 'That's what happens when your a nature photographer, you take the pictures no matter what.' Oblivious: A bobcat leans down for a drink of water at a lake in a Florida nature reserve . Action: An alligator bursts up out of the water and pulls the bobcat underneath with its jaws . Ms Felton usually photographs birds but also has developed a passion for capturing images of bobcats. She said: 'I take a lot of bird . photos but I am also always eager to take any animal photos especially . bobcats, when I can find them.' Ms Felton managed to spend much of last year following a particular family of bobcats at the Florida nature reserve. She continued: 'Bobcats are usually quite elusive but . I've been lucky and have been able to watch a family of bobcats quite . often throughout 2012. 'I watched the young ones grow from blue eyed kittens into almost adults and fell in love with them.' Trapped: The bobcat - which is normally around twice the size of a domestic cat - is wedge between the jaws of the alligator . Ms Felton spends time trying to protect the bobcats by not revealing their location for poachers to see and encouraging others to do the same. She said: 'I've become very attached to this family of bobcats and have even written a children's book about them which I am in the process of illustrating with my photography. 'It took me weeks to recover and come to terms with what I had seen, but that's nature and how it works. 'Since then I have spotted most members of the bobcat family - I can tell them apart by their facial markings.' And Ms Felton believes it may be the father of the family who was caught by the alligator. Rare pictures: Wildlife photographer Jamie Felton captured these images while visiting the nature reserve to photograph a family of bobcats . She added: 'I have a feeling it was the father cat. He is one of the two I have not seen. 'He may have been wounded by a new male in an attempt to take his territory and breed with the female. 'That would have made him an easy target. 'I've also seen the bobcats go to the waters edge for a drink or to chase a duck. 'Since alligators can stay submerged under water for up to two hours, it's not hard to imagine how they might surprise a bobcat that way. 'Nobody saw it happen so we can only make an educated guess as to how an alligator could possibly catch a bobcat, but now we know one thing for sure, it definitely can be done.' Up close: Ms Felton has spent several months following the bobcat family and believes the alligator killed the father of the pack .","Wildlife photographer Jamie Felton took images at Florida nature reserve .
