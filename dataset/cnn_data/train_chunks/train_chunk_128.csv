"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A barrage of at least 18 rockets struck Tripoli Tuesday, killing 19 people and wounding another 150 in the heaviest onslaught since NATO's aerial strikes began, a government official told CNN. Six thunderous explosions rocked the center of Tripoli late Tuesday. A hotel for international journalists located within 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's compound shook during the attacks. Outbursts of gunfire, as well as ambulance sirens, could be heard in the streets. A Libyan government official said initial information indicated that the night-time strikes hit the same compound that had been hit earlier in the day -- the volunteer element of the army compound. During the attacks in the capital, a U.S envoy in the eastern rebel-held city of Benghazi was courting members of the transitional government. Jeffery Feltman, the U.S assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs, told reporters in Benghazi that he had invited the National Transitional Council to open a representative office in Washington -- and that the council has accepted. Feltman added that he had come to reiterate a message from President Barack Obama that ""Gadhafi has lost legitimacy to rule. He cannot regain control of Libya. And he must step down immediately."" After the airstrikes Tuesday morning, smoke was seen rising from the area near Gadhafi's Bab-al-Azizia compound. Moussa Ibrahim, a Libyan government spokesman, said the attack targeted a guard compound for pro-Gadhafi military volunteers that had been emptied in anticipation of the attack. He called the attack an escalation by NATO. A NATO statement said the attack had targeted a ""regime vehicle storage facility"" adjacent to the Bab-al-Azizia compound. The facility resupplies government forces that have been attacking Libyan civilians, according to the NATO statement. Gadhafi's forces ""still represent a threat to civilians and we will continue to strike targets that carry out this violence,"" said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of Canada, who commands the Libya operation. Journalists later visited a hospital where they said they saw the bodies of three men, at least two covered in dust, and a number of wounded people. Arrest warrants have been issued by the International Criminal Court for Gadhafi and two relatives, linking them to ""widespread and systematic"" attacks on civilians as they struggle to retain power in Libya. The court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has said that the court in The Hague will investigate allegations of institutionalized rape in the war-torn country. A Libyan government official told CNN that Gadhafi's government welcomes the court's investigation but said that prosecutors ""have not been to Libya to do an investigation.""

"(CNN) -- The family of a woman who died three years ago wants to know whether she is the victim of a suspect accused of locking up four people in a Philadelphia basement. Maxine Lee, who died in 2008 in Norfolk, Virginia. was a roommate of Linda Weston, the accused ringleader of a group charged with locking up four mentally disabled adults in an apartment's boiler room. ""I want police to re-open this. I do,"" her sister, Tracey Lee, told CNN. Lee said her family believes she died under suspicious circumstances. The suspects are charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, unlawful restraint, criminal trespass, and conspiracy. The alleged victims were discovered severely malnourished, without food, and left with buckets to go to the bathroom. A landlord discovered them and called police. Maxine Lee died after disappearing several years earlier. She had last worked as a security guard after jobs with the post office and the IRS, her family told CNN. Her relatives didn't know what happened to her until they got a call in November 2008 from Virginia police saying Maxine was dead. She rushed to Norfolk from Philadelphia to get whatever information she could from police. ""I was surprised that they weren't at all supportive,"" Lee said. Lee said police told her they couldn't find Weston or another man who had been in the apartment. When she asked about whether they had any of her sister's belongings, she said police ""printed me a map to find her house on my own."" ""I felt like I was a reporter trying to find out what happened,"" Lee added. Lee says she was taken to identify her sister's body. ""Her hair was falling out,"" she said. She was told her sister died of acute bacterial meningitis with a contributing factor of malnutrition. Her manner of death is listed as ""natural causes."" Tracey Lee says her family was devastated. She was frustrated police said they couldn't find the people living with her sister. When she heard Weston's name in connection with the bruised, malnourished, allegedly mistreated disabled woman and three men imprisoned in a basement, she immediately recognized the name. ""I said 'it can't be. It can't be.' I was distraught,"" Lee said. After hearing about Weston's charges, Tracey Lee wonders whether her sister could be another possible victim of Weston's. ""I think she played a role (in her sister's death). ""Maxine probably went days without water. And if she was so sick, why didn't she take her to the ER?"" she said. Norfolk Police tell CNN they're looking at Maxine Lee's case again but haven't formally re-opened it. Philadelphia police spokesman Lt. Ray Evers says they're aware of Maxine Lee's death and her connection to Weston. They've set up a task force to investigate every aspect of the Philadelphia case, looking for more people who might have been victimized by Weston and her co-defendants. Investigators found about 50 different identification cards among Weston's belongings. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told CNN on Monday that Weston had IDs for about 50 people in her possession: ""Social Security information, power of attorney information, those kinds of things."" ""We're looking at everything,"" Evers said. 'Are these people dead, alive?"" He says they have to track down each person and look for any connections to Weston and her three co-defendants. Police say Weston's motive may have been befriending needy victims and eventually ripping off their Social Security checks. The case continued to develop Friday when CNN uncovered new information that shows the Philadelphia case was not the first time Weston has drawn scrutiny for possible Social Security fraud. The Social Security Administration's Office of Inspector General confirmed to CNN that it investigated Weston in 2009 for continuing to collect benefits for her roommate, Maxine Lee, after she died of acute meningitis. When the administration finally cut off benefits, Weston appeared at a Philadelphia office seeking to have the benefits reinstated, the Office of Inspector General said in a statement to CNN. The money -- totaling less then $3,000 -- was repaid to the Social Security Administration, the inspector general said. The acknowledgment by the inspector general's office has raised questions about why the Social Security Administration allowed Weston, a convicted murderer, to serve as a ""representative payee"" for a Social Security recipient. Under Social Security Administration policy, certain individuals convicted of criminal offenses are prohibited from serving as representative payees. The Social Security Administration is reviewing its handling of Weston. After initially asking for questions for comment in writing from CNN, a spokeswoman for the administration declined to provide details of the Weston case, including whether Weston was the representative payee for any of the people found in captivity in Philadelphia. ""We are very concerned about this situation. As this is an ongoing investigation, we can't provide you any details at this time,"" spokeswoman Kia Green said. As for Tracey Lee and her mother, they plan to attend Monday's first public court appearance for Weston and the three other defendants in Philadelphia. ""I plan on getting up early and sitting in the first row, "" Mary Lee said. CNN's Mike Ahlers and Sarah Hoye contributed to this report.","Maxine Lee, 39, died in 2008 in Norfolk, Virginia .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Georgia's parole board  convened Monday morning to hear a last-minute appeal by Troy Davis, who is set to die by lethal injection for the murder 21 years ago of a Savannah police officer. A jury convicted Davis of murder in 1991, paving the way for his execution, which has been delayed three times and is now scheduled for 7 p.m. Wednesday at a state prison in Jackson, Georgia. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles noted in a press release Sunday it is ""the sole authority in Georgia for granting clemency to inmates."" Options for the board include commuting a death sentence without parole, giving a convict a life sentence or denying clemency -- which, in this case, would pave the way for Davis' execution. In addition to Davis and his supporters making their appeal, the victim's mother, Anneliese MacPhail, told CNN this weekend that she, too, plans to attend. Many of Davis' supporters, who believe he was wrongly convicted and have staged rallies in recent days calling for his release, will not be allowed in. But in a statement Sunday, officials with Amnesty International, the NAACP and Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty issued a fresh appeal for people to join them Monday for prayers, musical performances and speeches outside the building where the board will meet. According to these groups, there have been about 300 rallies, vigils and events worldwide since last week. In addition, they say that more than 1 million people have signed a petition in support of Davis' bid to be exonerated. Since his 1991 conviction, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony. There also have been questions about the physical evidence -- and, according to some, the lack thereof -- linking Davis to the killing. But the mother of Mark MacPhail, the police officer killed that night, said that those rallying don't understand all the facts of the case. She is convinced that Davis shot her son, and that the jury's decision to convict him was fair. ""I'm not out after blood, I'm after justice,"" said Anneliese MacPhail, adding she doesn't plan to attend the execution. ""I want my son to rest in peace."" In a 2008 statement, then-Chatham County District Attorney Spencer Lawton described how Davis was at a pool party in Savannah when he shot another man, Michael Cooper, in the face. Davis was then driven to a nearby convenience store, where he pistol-whipped a homeless man, Larry Young, who'd just bought a beer. Soon thereafter, prosecutors said MacPhail -- who was working in uniform, off-duty, at a nearby bus station and restaurant -- arrived. It was then, the jury determined, that Davis shot the officer three times, including once in the face as he stood over him. Davis' lawyers, in a petition to a U.S. District Court, insisted that there is ""no physical evidence linking"" Davis to MacPhail's murder. They point, too, to ""the unremarkable conclusion"" of a ballistics expert who testified that he could not find definitively that the bullets that wounded Cooper and killed MacPhail were the same. Georgia's attorney general, in an online statement, claims that the expert said the bullets came from the same gun type and noted that casings at the pool party shooting matched -- thus came from the same firearm as -- those found at MacPhail's murder scene. Two decades ago, a jury convicted Davis on two counts of aggravated assault and one each of possessing a firearm during a crime, obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder. The latter charge led, soon thereafter, to his death sentence. While reviewing Davis' claims of innocence last year, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia found that Davis ""vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence."" ""Some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror,"" Judge William T. Moore wrote in a 172-page opinion. ""Other evidence that Mr. Davis brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors,"" the court found. The Rev. Raphael Gamaliel Warnock, who is set to testify before the parole board Monday, said that he ""can only begin to imagine the pain (the MacPhail family) must be feeling."" MacPhail ""was protecting the community, and there is no pain greater than when a parent loses a child,"" Warnock said. Still, he believes ""there is too much doubt in this case for an execution."" ""I have met with (Davis) on death row,"" Warnock said. ""I believe he is innocent."" The odds do not appear to be in Davis' favor. The parole board denied him clemency once before. And the board has never changed its mind -- on any case -- in the past 33 years.","Troy Davis is set to die by lethal injection on Wednesday .

"Rockhampton, Australia (CNN) -- River levels were slowly receding in eastern Australia on Friday, but officials warned residents to steer clear of roads damaged by devastating floods. In Rockhampton -- one of the hardest hit cities -- the fast-flowing Fitzroy River remained near its recent peak of 9.2 meters (about 30 feet). With many major roads underwater, some residents holed up in homes surrounded by the deluge were still using boats to travel. Government officials warned residents to avoid flooded areas. ""We are still seeing incidents of people driving through floodwaters, getting stuck and having to be rescued. We understand people feel confined and are increasingly frustrated at not being able to get from place to place easily, but I cannot stress enough how unsafe some road infrastructure is after being flooded for days,"" Queensland Acting Chief Superintendent Brian Codd said. Officials said the degree of damage remained unclear. ""The full extent of the damage to the 33,000 kilometers of state roads is impossible to quantify right now,"" Craig Wallace, Queensland state's minister of main roads, said. ""It will be an unprecedented long-term repair job that will take months, perhaps even years to fully complete,"" he said. Rainfall continued in some areas, prolonging problems in some of the hardest hit places, Queensland's government said. Nearly 2,000 people had been evacuated from flood-affected areas, the government said, with 640 of them in shelters across the state. The flooding also affected about 40 mines in the coal-rich state, the government said in a statement. Environmental officials were monitoring water discharges from the mines, the statement said. Farmers were particularly hard hit, as water washed over crops and blocked roads used to transport them to market. Global transport of commodities like coal and steel out was also stymied. The seasonal flooding in the state of Queensland intensified last month after monsoon rains caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels. The floodwaters covered an area the size of France and Germany combined, stretching from Queensland into the neighboring state of New South Wales. Police said 10 people have died as a result of flooding since November 30 -- many of them swept away by swift waters. The airport in Rockhampton closed Sunday and was expected to remain closed for weeks, according to Emergency Management Queensland. At least 200,000 people have been affected by prolonged flooding, police have said.

"Rockhampton, Australia (CNN) -- While floodwaters in Australia have begun to recede in some areas, the worst could still be on the way for at least one city, the country's prime minister said Saturday. ""Today I've been in St. George, and they are still bracing for the peak of the flood,"" Julia Gillard told Australia's Nine Network, according to a transcript from the prime minister's office. ""They're very well prepared, but of course they're anxious as they await the peak."" The seasonal flooding in the state of Queensland intensified last month after monsoon rains caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels. The floodwaters have covered an area the size of France and Germany combined, stretching from Queensland into the neighboring state of New South Wales, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said Saturday. Cabrera said the projected rainfall for parts of the two states is expected to be above average through March. During a press conference Saturday with Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, Gillard said the situation will get tougher for ""many, many people"" throughout the state of Queensland. She said federal and state officials have made about $4 million in emergency payments to individuals and families. ""Of course, that is the money in the pocket, money on the ground now, but there are hundreds of millions more dollars that are going to be required to help Queensland through and to help with the rebuilding,"" Gillard said. Bligh said she was ""very heartened"" by Australians helping Queensland residents in need. The premier's relief appeal has garnered more than $20 million, Bligh said. ""Twenty million dollars worth of aid over and above the hundreds of millions of dollars that each level of government will be contributing to the rebuilding effort will make a huge (difference), particularly to those families who really have lost everything,"" she said. In Rockhampton -- one of the hardest hit cities -- the fast-flowing Fitzroy River was slowly receding after peaking earlier this week at about 9.2 meters (about 30 feet). With many major roads under water, some residents surrounded by the deluge used boats to travel.

"(CNN) -- Ash clouds from a Chilean volcano continued to cause numerous flight cancellations in Australia and New Zealand Tuesday for at least one airliner. Australia's national carrier Qantas said it had canceled flights to and from Adelaide and Tasmania but lifted its ban on flights to and from Melbourne. The airliner has also canceled flights to and from New Zealand Tuesday because of the ash cloud. The company said it would resume flights to and from Adelaide on Wednesday and that all mainland Australian flights would run as scheduled on Wednesday, as well. Virgin Australia announced on its website that flights to those same areas were expected to run on schedule Tuesday. Is Chilean volcanic ash cloud hazardous? Air New Zealand had no announced cancellations on its website Tuesday. The disturbance was caused after Chile's Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcano erupted earlier this month. In 1982, a British Airways 747 Jumbo suffered severe damage and had all four engines fail when it encountered ash from an Indonesian volcano. The plane was able to restart some engines before making an emergency landing in Jakarta. The U.S. Geological Survey says more than 80 commercial aircraft have unexpectedly encountered volcanic ash in flight and at airports in the past 15 years. Ash ingested by jet engines may lead to the deterioration in performance and engine failure, the U.S. agency says.","NEW: Qantas to resume flights to and from Adelaide on Wednesday .

"Rockhampton, Australia (CNN) -- Major flooding across eastern Australia is putting a squeeze on the region's farmers, destroying crops and cutting off routes to market. ""Across the state ... agricultural and primary producers in particular are really feeling the impact of the flood waters,"" CNN's Phil Black reported Thursday. ""A lot of agricultural producers have suffered major crop loses -- vegetable producers, fruit growers, as well as grain growers and sugar cane growers."" Those farmers who haven't lost their crops are having trouble getting them to market over washed-out roads, bridges and rail lines. The flooding also has affected the global transport of commodities such as coal and steel out of Queensland. The Fitzroy River crested at 9.2 meters (about 30 feet), or more than 2 meters (7 feet) over flood stage, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. It's expected to remain above the ""major flood"" level for another week. The forecast calls for isolated rain, which isn't expected to change the situation much. ""Here in Rockhampton, it is residential areas, some small businesses that have very much felt the impact of these rising flood waters,"" Black reported.

"(CNN) -- India's cricket tour of Australia lurched to new lows on Friday, which proved to be unlucky January 13. The visitors slumped to a disappointing 161 all out in Perth and then saw David Warner smash the fourth fastest century in Test history as Australia reached 149-0 at stumps on day one. Down 2-0 in the four-match series, the second-ranked Indians went into the third encounter with doubts about the pitch at the WACA after ground staff were filmed on Thursday night drinking beer and walking on the playing surface in bare feet. Curator Cameron Sutherland defended his employees on national radio. They traditionally have pre-match drinks under the scoreboard, but this time followed Sutherland out to the middle for his final check. Tendulkar falls short again as Aussies take 2-0 lead . ""We were working on it ... up until the toss of the coin we can do anything we want to the wicket,"" he told ABC Grandstand, revealing that Cricket Australia and WACA chief executive Graeme Wood had questioned him about the situation. ""We were there for an hour. So, the thing that Cricket Australia and certainly the WACA have done is got all the facts and said, 'That's a legitimate reason for you being out there, it's not as though you were just sitting on the wicket drinking beer for two hours.' "" The Perth pitch had been described as a ""Green Monster"" by local media earlier this week, and India's formidable batting line-up performed -- once again this series -- with a timidity far below their stature. Pattinson inspires Australian win in Melbourne . Ben Hilfenhaus claimed four wickets and fellow fast bowler Peter Siddle took three, while 21-year-old Mitchell Starc celebrated his third Test call-up -- and first of this series -- with figures of 2-39. Ryan Harris snared just one scalp in his first outing since November, but it was a key one as cricket's record run scorer Sachin Tendulkar was trapped leg before wicket for 15 to leave the 38-year-old ""Little Master"" still seeking his record 100th international century. Virat Kohli top-scored with 44, adding 68 for the fifth wicket with VVS Laxman (31) before both fell to Siddle. If India's batsmen found it hard against the four-man pace attack, the bowlers received a fearful pummeling from Warner. Finding his feet in the five-day game after being initially introduced as a limited-overs specialist, the left-hander smashed 104 from 80 balls, hitting 13 boundaries and three sixes as he raced to his second century. Warner shrugged off a blow to the head from a delivery by Umesh Yadav to pass three figures in 69 balls faced, reaching the milestone with a clubbed six off debutant medium pacer Vinay Kumar. It matched Shivnarine Chanderpaul's effort for the West Indies against Australia in 2003, and is the second-fastest at the WACA behind compatriot Adam Gilchrist's 57-ball effort against England in 2006. West Indian legend Viv Richards holds the record for his 56-ball blast against England in 1986. At the other end to Warner, Ed Cowan contributed a relatively sedate 40 off 58 deliveries as the openers rattled along at a rate of 6.47 runs per over. Kumar went for 31 off his four overs, and Yadav conceded 42 from six. The experienced Zaheer Kahan and Ishant Sharma also suffered, giving up 44 from seven and 28 from five respectively.","Australia take control on opening day of the third Test against India in Perth .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least 80 militants were killed in a series of operations involving Afghan and NATO forces during a day-long firefight last week in the country's restive southeast, Paktika provincial governor Mukhlas Afghan said Sunday. NATO said it could only confirm 50 insurgents were killed in the fight. The operation, which began Wednesday and spanned the night into Thursday, was fought in a ""known Haqqani network"" area. The Haqqani network is an insurgent group loosely affiliated with the Taliban and is believed to be based in Pakistan's frontier territories. The raid included Afghan special forces and engaged ""multiple groups of insurgents"" who were armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and heavy machine guns, NATO's International Security Assistance Force reported Friday. Multiple insurgent groups were holed up in areas that included caves and fortified bunker positions, ISAF said. Elsewhere, coalition raids on Sunday in Helmand province left five militants dead, including three Taliban commanders, according to provincial governor Dawood Ahmadi. Three others were captured, he said. Sunday's announcement coincides with formal ceremonies marking the handover of security to Afghan forces in parts of Kabul and Panjshir province. They are the fifth and sixth areas to be transferred to national forces.

"(CNN) -- One is the loneliest number. Two can be as bad as one. And three, well ... um ... what was three again? Three is hard. I'll start by quoting the silence heard around the political world during Wednesday night's CNBC Republican presidential debate. Here were Texas Gov. Rick Perry's words in the middle of one of his answers: ""I will tell you: It's three agencies of government, when I get there, that are gone: Commerce, Education and the -- what's the third one there? Let's see. ... OK. So Commerce, Education and the -- ... The third agency of government I would -- I would do away with the Education, the ... Commerce and -- let's see -- I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops."" Oops? Oops? Did he just say oops on camera? Watch Perry try to name the three agencies . That was his comeback. Perry completed this painful journey not by telling the audience that remembering the third point wasn't as important as remembering his overall message. He didn't tell the audience that forgetting his third point in a debate was not as bad as forgetting how to run the country or fix the economy. He simply said, ""Oops."" And then the microphone went to one of his seven Republican rivals. Oops indeed. This was seriously terrible. You might say that blunders happen in debates. After all, Perry is not the first, nor will he be the last, to have a mental lapse in a debate. Remember Jan Brewer's Arizona gubernatorial debate last year? When she appeared to have lost her train of thought in her opening statement and for about 15 seconds could only smile and laugh nervously as cameras rolled? That was one of the worst moments ever in a debate, and she still won the election. So the question is: How much damage will Perry's gaffe do? It will do major damage. Here's why. First, I've been evaluating debates for 20 years, and can tell you -- if you doubted it for a second -- that Perry's mental block was very, very bad. One reason is that the question he was asked at the time wasn't even about cutting agencies. It was about how he could work with Democrats across the aisle. But Perry wanted to add some flair, so he looked at Ron Paul in order to brag about how he would cut three different agencies (although still not as many as Paul's five) and then gave himself the self-induced wound. What then made it worse was that Perry was asked twice if he could remember the third agency and he continued to draw a blank. Whatever credibility he had disappeared like his memory. It was a perfect example of a gotcha question, which everyone from Newt Gingrich to Sarah Palin complains about -- except that nobody even asked it. Perry did the gotcha on himself. The more damning reason his mistake will hurt in the long run is because it gives the audience a consistent (and unfavorable) impression of Perry. One of the things I tell my communications classes is that people cling to first impressions. It's why first impressions are so difficult to overcome, especially if they are negative. Unfortunately, if you have been watching these Republican presidential debates, your first impression, along with that of many other viewers, is that Rick Perry does not have the best grasp of the issues and he has a difficult time answering questions. Fair or not, this may turn people away from voting for him. Lately the entire focus of Perry's team has been trying to change the public's first impression of their candidate. They believed these upcoming debates would help. After all, Perry couldn't get any worse, right? Oops. It turns out he could. And since many in the public have an unfavorable first impression, Perry's performance fed right into that. Because of his poor first impression, Perry was the candidate who could least afford a slip-up of this magnitude. Instead of overcoming that negative first impression, he did the opposite. He cemented it. As in cement shoes. And Perry is anchored to them as he is falling into a deep Texas waterhole. Up to now, Perry's cumulative debating performance has been pretty weak. I cringe every time I watch Perry give any answer, since my expectations are that he might forget what he is talking about or begin an undisciplined, meandering ramble and end up mumbling some nonsense under his breath. While he may never give another poor answer in a debate, I still expect it. And therein lies the problem. It has now become a lasting impression. Some blunders cannot be overcome. While Jan Brewer won her election, she was debating against a Democrat when her poor debating performance occurred. Republicans had no other choice but to vote for her or the Democrat. That's not the case with Perry. There are other Republicans that voters will now begin to gravitate toward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Rick Perry forgot what he was going to say in the middle of a debate answer .
He says as debate gaffes go, this one was a whopper that will be hard for voters to forget .
He says for many, it confirmed low expectations about Perry's grasp of issues .
Graham: Since voters have other GOP choices besides Perry, this mistake may be fatal ."
"(CNN) -- Australia hold a slender 30-run advantage over South Africa after the second day of the second Test in Johannesburg, despite another dramatic batting collapse on Friday. The visitors, who were skittled out for an embarrassing 47 on their way to losing the first Test in Cape Town by eight wickets, began their innings brightly as an opening stand of 174 between Shane Watson and Phil Hughes looked to have given them a sturdy foundation for a big score. But, in reply to the home side's total of 266, Australia collapsed once again, losing all 10 wickets for just 122 runs as they finished on 296 all out. Kallis passes milestone but Australia in control . Pick of the South African bowlers was paceman Dale Steyn -- who took four for 64 -- while leg-spinner Imran Tahir mopped up three wickets towards the end of the innings, his first in Test cricket. Both Watson and Hughes scored 88 but, apart from an impressive 38 not out from Mitchell Johnson, not one other Australian scored above 20, leaving the match finely poised going into the third day. Bad light ended proceedings early, with South Africa failing to score from the four balls they faced. ""It didn't go our way this morning, so we had to reassess things and after that the bowlers came out and did a great job,"" Steyn told reporters. Meanwhile, Former Pakistan players Salman Butt and Mohammed Amir will begin their appeals against their jail sentences for spot- fixing next Wednesday. Former captain Butt was imprisoned for 30 months and teenage pace bowler Amir was handed a six-month term for bowling deliberate no-balls against England in August 2010. A third player, Mohammad Asif, was jailed for a year but has not appealed against his conviction.","Australia hold a slender advantage in the second Test in Johannesburg .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A senior Afghan intelligence official was killed Thursday when a bomb exploded in the country's northern Kunduz province, according to a provincial council chief. Payenda Khan -- who headed up a district in Kunduz for the National Directorate of Security -- was killed, and three children were injured in the blast, said Mahbobullah Mahbob. Khan was killed in the Afghan district of Bander Khanabad, and the Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack. His death is latest in a series of high-level officials who have recently been killed across the country. The most high-profile strike occurred in July, when the Taliban also claimed responsibility for the death of the president's half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai. The Kandahar provincial council chief was considered an influential power-broker and key presidential ally in the country's southern provinces. Last week, militants stormed the compound of the governor of Afghanistan's Uruzgan province. A least 19 people were killed and 37 wounded, including three police officers, in that attack. The governor, Muhammad Omar Shirzad, managed to escape after being surrounded by security guards while a gun battle raged for several hours. Elsewhere Thursday, two NATO service members were killed in eastern Afghanistan, according to an International Security Assistance Force statement. One soldier was killed when a man wearing an Afghan National Police uniform turned his weapon against the service member. The second person died from a separate insurgent attack, NATO reported. Meanwhile, coalition forces say they captured a senior Haqqani leader, responsible for more than 250 fighters, in the southeastern province of Paktiya. The Haqqani network is an insurgent group loosely affiliated with the Taliban, and is believed to operate out of Pakistan's frontier territories. Last month, coalition forces reported a day-long fire fight in a ""known Haqqani network"" area in southeastern Afghanistan that left at least 50 alleged insurgents dead.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish police seized a total of 1,600 kilos of bomb-making materials this week from suspected ETA hideouts -- the largest haul ever against the Basque separatist group in Spain. Authorities also arrested three ETA suspects this week -- including one during a seizure on Thursday -- in the latest actions in a police crackdown against ETA despite its unilateral cease-fire declared last January 10. The Spanish government has vowed to keep up the pressure on ETA because the outlawed group, listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States, has broken cease-fires in the past. The police on Tuesday arrested two men in northern Spain suspected of supplying explosives and bomb-making materials to ETA. A search of their property turned up 850 kilos (1,870 pounds) of bomb-making components. Then on Thursday, the police discovered another 750 kilos (1,650 pounds) of explosives and components at various suspected hideouts, and arrested a third suspect. The two seizures totaled about 3,520 pounds. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence, many of those due to car bombs and package bombs. Last month in France, police arrested the suspected military chief of ETA, in charge of commandos who carry out the bombings. In recent years, the police have arrested in succession a series of suspected ETA military chiefs as ETA replacements step in to fill the vacant position at the top. Also last month, in northern Spain, police arrested four key ETA suspects who authorities said had tried to operate under police radar, carrying on ostensibly law-abiding lives but secretly working for ETA. Police seized 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of explosives in those raids. Top government officials have said ETA appears to be weaker than ever, but they have warned that the group still has the capacity to kill. The Socialist government and the main opposition conservative party have said ETA's current unilateral cease-fire is not enough, and that only a commitment to permanently end the violence and lay down weapons would suffice. Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said last month, ""The government's anti-terrorist policy has not changed at all because ETA has not definitively abandoned its weapons. And as long as it doesn't, the police will continue to arrest them, one after another.""","Police seize 750 kilos of bomb-making materials from suspected ETA hideouts .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- Jaime Andrade had just gotten out of the shower when the men came to snatch him. Jaime Andrade was kept in this closet for three days without food or water, police say. His wife, Araceli Valencia, was mopping the kitchen in their family home on a typical warm spring morning in Phoenix, Arizona, ""when she suddenly felt a hard object pointed to the back of her head and a voice in Spanish tell her not to move,"" according to a Phoenix, Arizona, police investigative report. ""I told you not to look at me!"" Valencia heard one of the kidnappers bark as he struck Andrade across the head. Her four children bawling, Valencia was hustled into a bedroom where an armed man fondled her and threatened to rape her if she didn't tell him where Andrade hid his money, according to the report. After beating and binding Andrade, one of the kidnappers put a gun to Valencia's head. His message: We're taking your husband and SUV. We'll be watching your house. If you call the cops, he's a dead man. Andrade, his wife would later tell police, was a mechanic and freelance human smuggler, or coyote. Police say his 2006 kidnapping was evidence of a growing trend in Phoenix: drug and human traffickers abducting each other for ransoms or retribution.  Watch why Phoenix is the hotspot » . The trend continues, as police investigated roughly a kidnapping a day in 2007 and 2008 and are on track to shatter those numbers this year. Police are stingy with details of fresh cases navigating the court system, but recently allowed CNN to review the files from Andrade's kidnapping. For two and a half days after Andrade's abduction, the kidnappers -- including a man whom Andrade later said had been a friend -- deprived their victim of food and water. Through the door of the closet where he was held, Andrade could hear the cries of other victims being tortured in the house, the report said. Meanwhile, Valencia had defied the kidnappers and called police, who listened to Andrade ""scream and howl in pain"" over the phone as the kidnappers tried to cut off his ear and a finger. The torture would continue until Valencia came up with the ransom, the kidnappers told her.  Hear Andrade's wife plead with the kidnappers » . They were true to their word. Andrade was pistol-whipped and beaten with a baseball bat and the butt of a rifle. The kidnappers tried to gouge out his eye and slashed open his left eyebrow. They burned his back as well -- presumably, police said, with a blowtorch found at the scene. Read how the next door neighbors knew nothing of this . The blindfolded Andrade ""could feel his pants and underwear being cut open by an unknown person,"" he told police. He was told to bend over and was beaten when he refused. ""Jaime felt his legs being forced apart and heard Aldo say he was going to get his money,"" the report said. The kidnappers then sodomized him with a broomstick, a pair of scissors and a wooden dowel used to hang clothes in a closet. Kidnappers creative with coercion . Ferocity is often a hallmark of the abductions taking place in this south Arizona city of 1.5 million that serves as a prime transshipment point for drugs and human cargo.  Watch how the kidnappers choose their targets » . Phoenix police say they have yet to witness the level of violence -- the beheadings, the bodies shoved in drums -- that their counterparts are seeing in Mexico City or the border town of Juarez. ""It gets close sometimes,"" said Lt. Lauri Burgett, who heads the Home Invasion and Kidnapping Enforcement squad. Kidnappers will smash their victims' fingers with bricks, snip their backs open with wire cutters, carve them up with knives or simply shoot them. ""We've had them electrocuted. They set them in a tub with water and use kind of barbaric means and zap the tub. I think it was a battery hooked up,"" Burgett said. Two kidnappings last year resulted in murders, she added, but it's not the norm. Phoenix police formed the HIKE squad in October after two years of unprecedented kidnapping numbers -- 357 in 2007 and 368 in 2008 -- gave the city the dubious distinction of being the nation's kidnapping capital. Home invasions were not far behind: 317 in 2007 and 337 in 2008.  See kidnapping numbers since 1999 » . ""It's all about the money. And there's so much money to be made in this that you can't stop it, but you can try to reveal it, and then you can try to do something about it,"" Burgett said. The task force has made dozens of arrests, but as of March 31, the city had 101 reported kidnappings. If the trend continues, Phoenix will record an increase in kidnapping for a fourth straight year. More frustrating is that the numbers represent only a third, maybe less, of the city's kidnappings, said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman with 16 years of drug enforcement experience. Most kidnappings aren't reported, he said, because the victims are generally smugglers, drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three. Other criminals targeted . The most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones. In some cases, a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment, but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom, which can be between $30,000 and $250,000, Thompson said. ""[The victims are] wearing the doper bling-bling, and they target them,"" he said. ""We've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $1 million that the person has asked for. In addition to that, they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana, perhaps a pound or two of speed, a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin."" Phoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them, Burgett said. Less frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote's patrons, known as pollos (Spanish for chickens), Burgett said. Burgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country. See what other cities have a cartel presence . There are rarely ""true victims"" in Phoenix's kidnappings, the lieutenant said. However, one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is ""uglier than the drug trade"" and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes' bidding when they can't come up with the ransoms. ""In the drug business, the people getting killed are in the business. They are not end users, not consumers,"" said Antonio Bustamente. ""In the coyote business, the people killed are really innocent. [First-time] illegal entry is a petty offense."" Though many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix's border-related violence, police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark. Girl mistakenly snatched . On the evening of March 17, 2008, a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale. They were planning to play basketball. The friend, according to a police investigative report, was the niece of a man named ""Chucky."" Chucky and his cohorts, witnesses told police, had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house. Hours later, the investigative report said, armed men arrived at Chucky's sister's house in three vehicles, one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use. The men wanted Chucky, their drugs or $24,000. The 13-year-old said she didn't know Chucky. When she tried to walk away, ""one of them grabbed her by the neck, pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle,"" the report said. Eventually, the men called the girl's mother to demand ransom. A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl. She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise. The case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border, collateral damage is a reality.  Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods » . The origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence. The tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him. On Andrade's third day in captivity, an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $50,000 to $10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen. When the kidnappers arrived at the drop point, a Safeway supermarket parking lot, police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe, the report said. One of the men, Luis Alberto Castro-Vega, then 23, disclosed Andrade's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping. Only Castro-Vega has been convicted of crimes associated with Andrade's kidnapping: first-degree burglary, theft by extortion, armed robbery and three counts of aggravated assault. In September 2006, a judge sentenced Castro-Vega to 54 years in prison. Thompson said he hopes the stiff sentence sends a message that Phoenix police expect the kidnappings and violence to end, regardless of the targets and the perpetrators. ""The problems that occur when it's criminal versus criminal, that's still violence on the streets of America,"" he said. ""If those people get in a gunbattle, those bullets have to go somewhere, and that could be a playground where kids are playing. That could be a neighbor's house where a neighbor is inside sleeping that has nothing to do whatsoever with the illegal activity, but yet they become senseless victims of the violence.""","Phoenix police investigated 368 kidnappings in 2008, 357 in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- An Afghan soldier shot and killed a NATO soldier Monday in southern Afghanistan, high-ranking officials from the country's National Directorate for Security said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said an ""individual wearing an Afghan National Army uniform turned his weapon against"" an ISAF service member, ""killing the service member."" Afghan officials confirmed that the man who did the firing was an Afghan soldier. In another incident, two ISAF service members died after an improvised explosive device attack in eastern Afghanistan, NATO said. The nationalities of the service members were not immediately released. Separately, Afghan and coalition forces repelled an attack on the provincial reconstruction team headquarters in the Herat district of Herat province on Monday, ISAF Joint Command said in a statement. Insurgents trying to get inside the compound attacked the headquarters with a vehicle-borne IED and small-arms fire, but Afghan and coalition forces returned fire, killing several insurgents, it said. Several ISAF service members were wounded. The incidents took place a day after NATO apologized for an airstrike that killed nine civilians in southern Afghanistan. Maj. Gen. John Toolan, head of the ISAF command in southwest Afghanistan, apologized ""on behalf of the coalition"" and its top leaders, including U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus. He also pleaded with Afghans to work with coalition forces to bolster security. Earlier, Afghan and NATO officials said the attack -- an airstrike Saturday in Helmand province --had killed a dozen children and two women. There was no immediate explanation for the disparity between these figure and the toll of nine civilians offered Sunday by Toolan, who also noted that a U.S. Marine was killed immediately before the strike. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the airstrike and said he was warning the U.S military and government ""for the last time"" on behalf of the Afghan people about civilian deaths. He called the operation a mistake. Journalist Reshad Fazel contributed to this report.","NEW: An attack on Afghan and coalition forces in the Herat district is repelled .

"(CNN) -- The search for the data and voice recorders from the Air France plane that crashed more than a month ago off Brazil's coast is entering a new phase, according to France's accident investigation agency. Searchers have discovered hundreds of pieces of wreckage from Air France Flight 447. All 228 people aboard the plane were killed in the June 1 crash. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, commonly known as black boxes, stop giving out acoustic broadcasts after 30 days. But investigators decided to continue listening for the ""pings"" for 10 days after that. Now, the two U.S. naval vessels and a French Navy submarine will halt their search for the recorders which investigators hope will shed light on exactly how the plane crashed. The second phase of the search will involve France's oceanographic ship ""Pourquoi Pas?"" which carries specialized exploration and intervention vehicles, according to the French air accident investigation agency known as the BEA. The French vessel will conduct new searches using diving equipment and towed sonar, the BEA said. Finding the recorders is of ""capital importance,"" and ""no effort must be spared in achieving this end,"" Air France has said. ""We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful,"" an Air France representative said. This month, investigators revealed that the plane bellyflopped intact into the Atlantic Ocean. Investigator Alain Bouillard said it was still not clear what caused the crash, the deadliest in Air France's 75-year history. The mountainous ocean floor in the search area ranges from 3,280 to 15,091 feet, BEA officials have said, making the search for the recorders -- and the rest of the plane's debris -- difficult. ""It is as if it fell in the Andes,"" said Olivier Ferrante, chief of the BEA search mission. Flight 447 went down in stormy weather while flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. Brazil called off the search for bodies June 27, having found 51 of the 228 people who died, according to the military. Investigators have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane, along with luggage, Bouillard said.","Plane went down off Brazil on June 1, killing all 228 aboard .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish Interior Minister Antonio Camacho warned Friday that although the Basque separatist group ETA has declared an end to violence, the most difficult task still lies ahead -- ensuring no Spaniards suffer the threat of terror attacks in the future. His remarks come a day after ETA announced a ""definitive cessation of its armed activity"" in a statement published on the website of Gara, a newspaper the group has used to convey messages in the past. ETA is blamed for hundreds of deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. Speaking Friday on Spanish National Television, Camacho said: ""We have completed a first part of our task, (but) there remains the more complex one, guaranteeing through the strict enforcement of our laws that never again will any generation of Spaniards have to suffer on their backs the weight of a barbarity that slows down our progress and compromises our future."" He said ETA had been defeated ""by the tireless and unstoppable work of the police and the civil guard"" and that as a result it had been forced to declare an end to violence without achieving a single one of its aims. The security services had achieved that outcome ""with tenacity, with work, with dedication, and above all, with a lot of suffering,"" he said. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday that ETA's announcement ""holds out the prospect of a historic step toward peace, although there is a long road ahead to realize this promise."" He paid tribute to the victims of ETA violence, adding: ""We recognize the courage of the Spanish government and the Spanish people in their enduring efforts to advance democracy and freedom in Spain and around the world."" ""The Spanish people have endured over 40 years of violence at the hands of ETA,"" said the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""The secretary-general shares in the hope that ETA is committed to bringing this tragic chapter for Spain to an end."" European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso hailed the development as ""a truly historic moment which ends years of terror and attacks on Spanish society."" The news ""marks the culmination of years of unceasing efforts in the fight against terrorism,"" he said, congratulating Spain on its efforts to combat ETA. Police have cracked down in recent years on ETA in Spain and France, leaving it operationally weak. There have been numerous statements from the Basque group calling for talks or a peace process of some sort, but all falling short of declaring a definitive end to violence. The Spanish government said that since ETA has broken cease-fires in the past; only an authoritative statement that it is putting down its arms for good will do. Thursday's announcement followed a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently. That effort was led by international figures who include Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams of Northern Ireland and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In a nationally televised address hours after the announcement was posted, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero termed ETA's announcement as being of ""transcendental importance"" and a ""victory for democracy."" ""Ours will be a democracy without terrorism, but not without memory,"" Zapatero said, referring to 829 people killed by ETA and their families. The prime minister praised Spanish police, Civil Guard personnel, the intelligence agency and judicial authorities ""who have contributed to this end."" Zapatero also singled out France -- which has traditionally been used as a rearguard base for ETA -- and its president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for their assistance. The prime minister said that it would be up to Spain's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on November 20 -- to lead the peace process. In remarks Thursday night at their respective political party headquarters in Madrid, the two main contenders to replace Zapatero -- Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the candidate from Zapatero's Socialist Party, and Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition People's Party -- cheered the development but did not detail what they would do next if they were to become prime minister. In its statement Thursday, ETA -- which is listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union -- outlined why now was the right time to make such a declaration. ""A new political time is emerging in the Basque Country,"" ETA said. ""We have a historic opportunity to find a just and democratic solution for the centuries-old political conflict."" The group then added that ""dialogue and agreement"" should predominate ""over violence and repression."" ETA urged the Spanish and French governments to conduct ""direct dialogue"" aimed at addressing outstanding issues while calling upon fellow Basques to commit to such a process. CNN's Al Goodman and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Spain's interior minister says there is still work to do to prevent future terrorism .

"(CNN) -- Clashes between tribesmen and government forces near Yemen's Sanaa International Airport on Wednesday led to its closure. All arriving flights were diverted to Aden, and no flights were taking off from Sanaa, said a Ministry of Transportation official who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. Witnesses said the situation near the airport was chaotic, with explosions, clashes, tribesmen approaching the airport and electricity cut to the surrounding neighborhood. According to the office of Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar, a leader of the main opposition al-Hashid tribe, the government is believed to have cut the electricity. The flight restrictions were imposed as anti-regime tribesmen battling Yemeni forces occupied the government's news agency compound and the Tourism Ministry in the capital Wednesday, the latest regime entities to be taken over during this week's street battles, witnesses said. Hundreds of al-Hashid tribal members occupied and surrounded the SABA news agency compound and the tourism building in Sanaa after fighting with government forces in the Hasabah neighborhood. Other ministry buildings in Hasabah also have been seized. They are the Interior, Trade and Commerce, the Education and the Local Administration headquarters. These and other government buildings in Hasabah were evacuated Tuesday night by the Interior Ministry as fighting raged. Yemeni state-run television said supporters loyal to the al-Hashid tribe were shelling government facilities. The fighting broke out after a regionally brokered deal calling for Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to leave office fell through. Saleh himself is a member of the al-Hashid tribe, a huge and powerful entity with many strands. After a march Friday, during which dozens of anti-government demonstrators were killed, al-Ahmar embraced the anti-government demonstrators and broke ranks with the president. Since then, more and more tribal members have turned their backs on the president as well. The violence has attracted international attention. ""We expressed our joint concern on the deteriorating situation on the ground,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday in England with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The United States is evaluating the security situation in Yemen, but is not moving to evacuate the embassy, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday.  However, the embassy is permitting employees who want to leave to do so. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed fears that the battles might further destabilize the situation and called for ""an immediate end to the fighting"" and the continuation of efforts to resolve the country's political crisis. Saleh's office called media outlets, including Yemen TV, and issued statements from Saleh defending himself. ""I will not be forced by the tribes to enter a civil war,"" Saleh said. ""We will not give in and will fight those who threaten security and stability in the country."" Similar clashes Tuesday killed as many as 41 people -- with both sides claiming casualties. Al-Ahmar said 17 men from the al-Hashid tribe were killed in those clashes. The government said 14 soldiers and 10 civilians were killed. Yemen, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda, has been roiled by protests for most of the year amid anti-government demonstrations that have swept across much of the Arab world. Many of the protesters in Yemen want Saleh to step aside after three decades of rule. But representatives of the demonstrators who've taken to the streets for months insist their movement is nonviolent and say they will continue a peaceful revolution as the tribesmen and government forces battle. ""The government wants to show the world that our revolution is violent. We tell them no, it is peaceful and will always be peaceful,"" said Mohammed Saleh Abdullah, a youth revolution leader. Riyadh Areqi, another youth revolution leader, said protests will continue ""under all circumstances until Saleh falls and is held accountable for all his crimes.""? ""What is taking place between the al-Ahmar family and government forces does not involve the Yemeni revolution,"" he said. ""Millions are protesting peacefully today around the country while Saleh sheds the blood of the Yemeni people."" Gulf Arab states said Monday that they had suspended efforts to ease the embattled president from office after he once again balked at signing a deal with opposition leaders. In a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency, foreign ministers with the Gulf Cooperation Council said they were dropping the deal ""for lack of appropriate circumstances for agreement."" The council is made up of representatives from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. Under its plan, Saleh would have ceded power to a transitional government after 30 days. At his meeting Wednesday with Cameron, Obama noted that Yemenis want a ""more unified and more secure"" nation and ""greater opportunity and prosperity."" ""We are proud of the leadership of the Gulf Cooperation Council in seeking an orderly and peaceful resolution to the crisis, and we call on President Saleh to move immediately on his commitment to transfer power."" Opposition leaders signed the pact Saturday, but Saleh said he would not go along unless the opposition re-signed the agreement at a public ceremony at his presidential palace, which was surrounded by armed pro-government protesters. Opposition members have long contended that Saleh had no intention of signing the agreement. Saleh said Wednesday that he's ""willing to sign the proposal, but on the basis of dialogue."" ""I will not give any more concessions in order to step down,"" he said. Journalist Jeb Boone contributed to this report.","NEW: All arriving flights diverted; no flights are taking off .

"(CNN) -- Australia's government is considering spending cuts and a special tax to help offset the massive economic impact of recent widespread flooding, the country's prime minister said. ""There will certainly be spending cuts ... and there may also be a levy,"" Prime Minister Julia Gillard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Thursday, according to a transcript of the interview released by her office. ""I'm not in a position tonight to detail to you the areas. I am working on that now,"" she added. Are you cleaning up from the floods? Share your photos, videos and stories . Official damage estimates for flooding are still being calculated. Earlier this month, Queensland state Premier Anna Bligh said rebuilding after the floods would have a ""multi-billion dollar price tag."" Floodwaters also inundated homes and devastated thousands of acres of crops in the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria. ""We don't have the total damage bill yet, but I want to be very blunt with Australians. We have a lot of flood damage to repair in Queensland. There will be some economic effects on GDP growth, a short-term effect on inflation with food prices and the like, but our economy is strong and we will get through this by pulling together,"" Gillard said. On Wednesday, Victoria state Premier Ted Baillieu said flooding in southern Australia and other parts of the country would have a significant economic impact nationwide. ""It is going to take some time. There is going to be a whack on our economy,"" said Baillieu. ""And it will be that effect right across Australia from Queensland in the north to Victoria in the south."" Floods in Queensland state, which started more than a month ago, have killed at least 20 people, police said. The biggest impact to the economy is Australia's burgeoning coal industry, which -- like other of the nation's commodities -- helped buoy the nation's economy through the Great Recession. Growth in Australia contracted during the financial crisis, but the economy escaped recession. Australia is the world's largest supplier of coking coal, essential in steel-making, and is the second largest supplier of thermal coal used in power plants. Earlier this month the floods caused world coal prices to hit a two-year high. The Queensland region also is a major exporter of sugar, cotton and wheat.

"(CNN) -- An ash cloud from a Chilean volcano thinned over Australia Wednesday, freeing commercial airliners to take to the skies after grounding them this week. Qantas resumed domestic flights to and from Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide and international service began again from Sydney and Melbourne. However, trips across the Tasman Sea to and from New Zealand remain cancelled indefinitely. Virgin Australia airline also said its New Zealand flights were cancelled. Virgin said Wednesday it was resuming service from Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, Albury, Newcastle and Coffs Harbour. The airlines' decision to ground the flights was based on information provided by the Australian Volcanic Ash Advisory Center. ""This eruption ejected these small particles very high in the atmosphere, to a region of stronger winds known as the jet stream,"" the advisory center said. ""The jet stream has then carried the ash particles great distances to the east."" The same ash cloud spawned by the fiery South American volcano also forced major flight cancellations Down Under a week and a half ago. ""It is not unprecedented for volcanic ash to remain suspended for long time periods,"" according to the center. The June 4 eruption of Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcano in the Chilean Andes Mountains sent plumes of smoke more than six miles into the air, filling an otherwise bright blue sky that day with a massive stream of white smoke. Chile is located on the so-called ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The ash cloud forced the shutdown of flights in and out of at least 10 Australian cities Tuesday. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Qantas resumes most flights Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Ricky Ponting hopes memories of last year's Ashes defeat to England will spur Australia on when the latest series begins in Brisbane on Thursday. Ponting suffered his second reverse as captain in cricket's oldest battle, both coming in the northern hemisphere. After the 2005 setback he was able to bounce back immediately with a 5-0 trouncing of the tourists, and this time he will lead out 10 of the 11 players who he made go onto the field at London's Oval after losing by 197 runs to surrender the Ashes urn. ""I made sure they all got down on the ground and they all took in our own disappointment, more the English excitement,"" the 35-year-old told the UK Press Association. ""I made sure that it hurt them as much as possible when the Ashes were being handed over to Andrew Strauss at The Oval. There's no doubt that's what's been driving certainly me, after all the work that I've done, but every one of the players as well. ""It's about that empty feeling we had in our stomachs after walking off The Oval again, after two successive Ashes tours. We want to make sure we don't have that feeling again."" Australia's only change from that game sees left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty brought in to make his Test debut, with Stuart Clark not selected. Vice-captain Michael Clarke has been passed fit after recovering from a minor back problem. Australia have not been beaten at the Gabba ground since 1988, and have lost just two series at home in the past 20 years. ""History suggests that for every touring team coming to Australia they generally find here and Perth the places harder to adjust and adapt to,"" Ponting said. ""England have been here a while, and in Hobart last week it seamed around a little bit. But history suggests we handle these conditions very, very well -- and opposition teams struggle a bit."" Andrew Strauss is seeking to become the first England captain to bring the Ashes back from Down Under since Mike Gatting in 1986-87. ""It's a very strong home ground for Australia. But I think the prospect of maybe turning that record around excites us,"" he said ahead of the first of five Tests. ""We had a similar record to contend with at Lord's last year -- and we were able to turn that around. If the guys put their minds to it, it could be potentially a very good start to the series to maybe overcome that record. ""In past years, Australia have really hit the ground running in the first Test match. They've made a conscious effort to go hard at the opposition, and there's no doubt the conditions here are slightly alien to a lot of touring sides -- especially touring sides that are maybe a bit undercooked or under-prepared. ""But we know what to expect. We've been out here for a while now, we've had a good look at a lot of the Australian conditions. ""We haven't had a particular look at the conditions at the Gabba yet. But we know how it plays and what types of shots to look to play and which ones to avoid.""","England seeking to retain Ashes urn in five-Test series starting in Brisbane .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Police early Friday arrested 13 people suspected of trying to rebuild a youth wing of the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA, which was dismantled a year ago with dozens of arrests, the Interior Ministry said. The youth organization, also outlawed and known as SEGI, is considered the ""training ground for the terrorist group,"" the ministry said in a statement. The latest arrests came as police continued their crackdown against ETA and its supporters, despite ETA's cease-fire of ""armed offensive actions"" announced last September 5. The Spanish government and major political parties have said the cease-fire is not enough because ETA has broken them in the past. The government and the parties demanded a definitive statement from ETA to end its decades-long violence forever and lay down its arms under a verifiable disarmament process. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. Three hundred police officers took part in the arrests Friday of the 13 suspects, who are aged 20 to 29 and include at least one woman. The raids occurred in four northern Spanish provinces with historic Basque roots and one in Barcelona, the ministry statement said. The youth organization SEGI is blamed for fomenting so-called low-level street violence, such as the burning of municipal buses and automated teller machines, in support of Basque independence. Authorities say that some of those activists later go on to become fully-fledged ETA members who carry out shootings and car bombings. In November 2009, police arrested 34 suspected SEGI leaders and considered that the youth wing had been largely dismantled at the time. Before Friday's raids, police had already arrested about 20 suspected ETA members or collaborators since ETA's declaration on September 5.","Arrests came in northern Spain .

"(CNN) -- Australia shocked Germany 2-1 in their friendly international in Moenchengladbach on Tuesday, a result that saw the Socceroos gain some revenge for their 4-0 defeat by the Germans in South Africa 2010. Germany coach Joachim Loew named a weakened side for the match -- and he was punished with the worse defeat in his four-and-a-half years in charge as Australia secured one of their greatest-ever footballing victories. The home side looked to be on course for victory when Bayern Munich striker Mario Gomez slotted the ball home from the edge of the area in the 26th minute. But the visitors turned things around after the interval and levelled on the hour mark when David Carney burst through the Germany defense to fire past goalkeeper Tim Wiese. And Australia sealed a famous win just two minutes later when Christian Traesch fouled Harry Kewell in the area and Luke Wilkshire scored from the spot. Meanwhile, a last-gasp Asamoah Gyan goal gave Ghana a 1-1 draw against England at Wembley in an end-to-end encounter. In front of a capacity crowd that included over 20,000 Ghanaians, England took the lead when the most expensive English signing ever, Andy Carroll, fired home his first goal for his country. But Ghana never gave up and levelled in the final minute when Gyan, who plays his club football in England for Sunderland, found space in the area to shoot past goalkeeper Joe Hart. Elsewhere, in-form France were denied a seventh consecutive victory by Croatia as the teams drew 0-0 in their friendly match at the Stade de France. Lille central defender Adil Rami hit the woodwork for the home side in the second period, while Franck Ribery was jeered by the home fans as he made his first appearance on home soil since being banned for his role in France's World Cup training ground strike in South Africa last year. In other friendly matches playeed on Tuesday, World Cup semifinalists Uruguay came away from Dublin with a 3-2 victory over the Republic of Ireland, while Italy were in impressive form as they defeated Ukraine 2-0 in Kiev.","Australia shock Germany 2-1 in their friendly international in Moenchengladbach .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- French police arrested the suspected new military chief of the Basque separatist group ETA on Monday, just three weeks after his alleged predecessor was captured, CNN partner station CNN+ reported. Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu was captured last month. The suspect, Aitzol Iriondo Yarza, allegedly headed the ETA commandos who carried out attacks. He was detained in the southern French village of Gerde with two other ETA suspects, French police said. The suspected overall leader of ETA -- heading both the military and policy-making, or political, wing -- was arrested November 17, also in southern France, Rubalcaba said last month. That man, Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu, 35, alias ""Txeroki,"" is wanted in connection with numerous ETA fatal attacks, Rubalcaba said. Since then, a Basque businessman was shot and killed last Wednesday in northern Spain, in an attack authorities blamed on ETA. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. ETA, listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States, has long used France as a base to prepare for attacks across the border in Spain. There are about 600 ETA convicts or suspects in Spanish jails and 150 in French jails, authorities in the two countries have told CNN.","French police arrest suspected new military chief of ETA .

"(CNN) -- Australia remained top of the Commonwealth Games medals table after the second day of competition in India following a clean sweep of the three cycling events. Scott Sunderland won the men's 1km time trial, Jack Bobridge claimed victory in the 4,000m individual pursuit and Anna Meares retained the women's 500m time trial title to help Australia win five golds on Tuesday for a leading nine and 23 medals overall. Meares, who broke her neck in 2008, beat her own Games record in a time of  33.758 seconds to head off compatriot Kaarle McCulloch and Becky James of Wales. The 22-year-old Sunderland beat Malaysia's Mohd Rizal Tisin, with New Zealand's Edward Dawkins third, while 21-year-old rising star Bobridge broke the Games record in qualifying before completing the hat-trick with victory from New Zealand's Jesse Sergent. In India, authorities fight monkeys with monkeys . Australia's swimmers won nine medals, but only Leiston Pickett struck gold following the country's haul of three titles in the pool on Monday. The 18-year-old won the women's 50m breaststroke from her teammate and defending champion Leisel Jones, with England's England's Kate Haywood third. England won the British nation's first two golds in the pool, with Fran Halsall triumphing in the women's 50m butterfly ahead of Australia's Marieke Guehrer and Emily Seebohm and world record-holder Liam Tancock taking out the men's 50m backstroke title from Australia's Hayden Stoeckel and Ashley Delaney. Robbie Renwick won Scotland's first swimming gold in the 200m freestyle from Australians Kenrick Monk and Thomas Fraser-Holmes. Australia also won gold in the women's artistic gymnastics team event at Indira Gandhi Stadium in Delhi. Hosts India moved in second place after winning five gold medals, three in the men's wrestling events and two in shooting disciplines. Ravinder Singh beat England's South Africa-born Terrence Bosson in the final of the newly-introduced Greco-Roman 60kg category, and Sanjay defeated Richard Addinall of South Africa in the 74kg division. Anil Kumar beat Hassene Fkiri in a stormy 96kg final which saw the Australian stripped of his silver medal, having aimed an obscene gesture at a judge after being disqualified for dangerous play. India also won gold in the men's pairs 10m air rifle ahead of England and Bangladesh, and took out the women's pairs 25m pistol title from Australia and England. But India, already embarrassed by technical problems in the weightlifting and boxing events plus reports that facilities will not be ready in time, suffered a humiliating record 113-18 defeat by world netball champions Australia. The margin surpassed New Zealand's 116-26 victory against Sri Lanka in Manchester in 2002. But the hosts made a better start in the men's field hockey, one of the nation's most popular sports, beating Malaysia 3-2 in a Pool A match after rivals Pakistan cruised past Scotland 3-0. In Pool B, New Zealand thrashed Trinidad and Tobago 7-0 and South Africa won 4-1 against Canada. In the women's hockey, Australia thrashed Trinidad and Tobago 11-0 and South Africa beat Scotland 2-1 in the other Pool A tie. In Group B, England beat Wales 4-1 and New Zealand thumped Malaysia 5-0. In the weightlifting, Canada's Marilou Dozois-Prevost won gold in the 53kg division despite a power cut which stopped the scoreboard operating. Her overall total of 182kg was enough to head off U.S.-based Nigerian Onyeka Azike and Malaysia's Raihan Yusoff as she went one better than her silver medal in the 48kg class four years ago.","Australian cyclists win all three gold medals on offer in the sport on day two .

"(CNN) -- Investigators probing the June crash of an Air France flight in the Atlantic Ocean still do not know what brought the plane down, who was at the controls when it crashed, or what the pilots did in the moments leading up to the disaster, according to a new report released Thursday. ""At this stage ... it is still not possible to understand the causes and circumstances of the accident,"" investigators said in the report. Flight 447 -- an Airbus A330 -- went down in stormy weather in the Atlantic Ocean June 1 while flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. All 228 people on board were killed. Most of the bodies were never recovered. France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, released its second interim report into the crash Thursday. It had been planning a news conference at the same time, but canceled it because of snow in Paris. The plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact, studies of the debris and the bodies that have been recovered show. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the report said. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring airspeed, the investigators said. But that alone was not enough to cause the disaster, they added. ""Inconsistency in the measurements of airspeeds was one of the elements in a chain of events that led to the accident, though this alone cannot explain it,"" the report says. Large parts of the plane -- including the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- have never been found, leaving investigators without key pieces of the puzzle. Investigators are preparing to begin a new search for the recorders in February, the report said. But the area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days for ships from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in west Africa. The underwater terrain is rough, with great variations in depth -- that is, underwater mountains and valleys -- over short distances, the report says. The new search will involve air accident investigators from the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, Russia, the United States and France, as well as the U.S. Navy. The search is planned to last 60 days, the report said. Jean-Paul Troadec, director of the French investigation bureau, told reporters earlier this week that the new search, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from Brazil's northeast coast, will involve sonar and robot submarines. Troadec was in Rio de Janeiro to speak to the relatives of the 58 Brazilians who were on board, the French news agency AFP reported Sunday. ""We tried to convince the families that we are conducting the investigation with the full intention of getting to the truth,"" he said. Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Before it crashed, Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich.","Investigators still don't know what caused an Air France jet to crash .

"(CNN) -- Teenage Nigerian weightlifter Augustina Nkem Nwaokolo claimed the first gold medal on day one of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. The 17-year-old took top prize in the women's 48kg division and set a new Commonwealth record in the process by lifting 175kg as events finally began after weeks of controversy surrounding Delhi's readiness to host the Games. It's the first time India has hosted the competition between countries of the former British Empire and the build-up was dominated by negative headlines about the cleanliness of the athlete's village as well as poor construction. Nwaokolo lifted 77kg in the snatch and 98kg in the clean and jerk to deny India's Soniya Chanu. The home favorite failed with two attempts at lifting the 103kg required to take gold. In the men's 56kg category Malaysia's Amirul Hamizan Ibrahim took gold ahead of Sukhen Dey and Srinivasa Rao of India. Ibrahim posted a new Commonwealth Games record of 166kg to win his second gold after Manchester in 2002. He missed the Games in Melbourne four years ago due to a doping ban. In the pool, Kylie Palmer swam to gold for Australia in women's 200 meter freestyle ahead of Jazz Carlin, who secured Wales' first medal since 1974, while England's double Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington stook bronze. Australia claimed a one-two in the 200m individual medley with 18-year-old Alicia Coutts upsetting her teammate, and favorite, Emily Seebohm. South Africa's Chad Le Clos set a new Games record as he pipped England's Michael Rock to gold in the men's 200m butterfly while Canada's Ryan Cochrane beat Australia's Ryan Napoleon by 11 hundredths of a second to claim the 400m freestyle. Australia struck gold again when they clawed back the English team in the 4x100m freestyle relay. Away from the pool Australia also proved too good for the rest of the field in the artistic gymnastics team competition, as they finished three points clear of England to take gold. After the opening day of competition, Australia top the medals table with four gold's while South Africa, Canada, Nigeria and Malaysia all have one.","Events at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi get underway .

"(CNN) -- The prime ministers of Australia and Malaysia on Saturday announced an agreement aimed at reducing human smuggling and illegal migration to Australia. Under the deal struck between the two countries, the next 800 asylum-seekers who arrive in Australia illegally will be transferred to Malaysia for refugee status determination. In exchange, over the next four years, Australia will take in 4,000 refugees who are already residing in Malaysia. ""I made it very clear that what I wanted to do was to break the back of the people smuggling model, to take away from them the very product that they sell, to stop people risking their lives at sea and to stop people profiting from human misery,"" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said at a news conference. ""I wanted to see us do something to end the profitability of people smuggling."" The agreement is also seen as a way to address what has become a political debate in Australia over the arrival of unauthorized immigrants. Thousands of refugees seek asylum in Australia each year, said Paul Power, CEO of the Refugee Council of Australia, an umbrella organization for groups that support refugees. Each year, 4.1 million travelers visit Australia on temporary visas. Of those, 4,000-5,000 -- mostly from China -- seek asylum, Power said. But this isn't the group that has stirred controversy. Opposition politicians have raised concerns about the asylum-seekers who are smuggled in, arriving in makeshift boats to the country. This amounts to a level of political fear-mongering, Power said. Still, in the last several years, asylum-seekers who reach Australia illegally have reached about 4,500 per year, Power said. Most of those come from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Iran and Burma, and go travel through Malaysia -- a transit point for many refugees headed for Australia. The agreement is an attempt to remove the incentive to sneak into Australia. ""Under this arrangement, if someone seeks to come to Australia then they are at risk of going to Malaysia and going to the back of the queue -- that's what it means,"" Gillard said. In other words, those 800 who are transferred from Australia to Malaysia will not get preferential treatment over those refugees who are already there and have already begun to apply for asylum in Australia. But Power sees some red flags with the new deal. For one, he said, Malaysia, unlike Australia, is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention. Malaysia does not have a good record of dealing with refugees and has been down to arbitrarily detain asylum-seekers, Power said. According to the agreement, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees will be process the asylum-seekers once they arrive in Malaysia. Despite the political fires being stoked in Australia over unauthorized asylum-seekers, there is broad bipartisan support in the country for its resettlement program. Under the deal, for every migrant sent from Australia to Malaysia, Australia will intake five refugees from Malaysia. ""We've been a generous country in the past over our history, over many decades resettling people who were fleeing persecution and of course I believe we will continue to do that over the years to come,"" Gillard said. Other steps will be taken in the future to address the migration issue as well, she said. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Unauthorized migrants arriving in Australia is a political issue .

"Madrid (CNN) -- A former chief of the Basque terrorist group ETA has been sentenced to 105 years in prison for ordering the assassination of a politician, according to a copy of the court ruling, made public Monday. It is the first sentence in a case involving ETA from the National Court, which handles terrorism cases, since ETA announced last month ""a definitive cessation of its armed activity,"" raising hopes that decades of separatist violence may finally be over. The maximum that can be served in Spanish prison is 40 years, although courts often hand down a longer sentence for terrorist attacks. Spain has no death penalty. In the sentence issued last Friday but made public on Monday, the court ruled that Francisco Javier Garcia Gaztelu, whom Spanish authorities called the military chief of ETA when he was captured in 2001, ordered the assassination of a Basque Socialist politician, Fernando Buesa. Buesa and his bodyguard were killed in the Basque city of Vitoria in northern Spain in February 2000 when they walked past a vehicle that contained a hidden bomb that was exploded by remote control. Garcia Gaztelu, now 45, was sentenced to 30 years each for the killings of Buesa and his bodyguard, 13 years each for two people injured in the attack, and additional time mainly for damage caused by the bomb, the court said. The government, courts and police have said they will not halt the court cases pending against ETA operatives despite the outlawed group's announcement last month. Listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. ETA's announcement last month followed a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently. That effort was led by international figures who include Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams of Northern Ireland and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero termed ETA's announcement as being of ""transcendental importance"" and a ""victory for democracy."" ""Ours will be a democracy without terrorism, but not without memory,"" Zapatero said, referring to 829 people killed by ETA and their families. The prime minister said that it would be up to Spain's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on November 20 -- to lead the peace process.","Francisco Javier Garcia Gaztelu has been in custody since 2001 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Roadside bombs killed two service members in separate attacks Friday in southern Afghanistan, NATO said, marking the  eighth death in the region in the past three days. On Thursday, five Americans were killed in an improvised explosive device attack. An additional service member died Thursday in a similar strike in eastern Afghanistan. No other information was provided. The rash of attacks comes on the heels of the worst single-incident loss of life for Americans since the Afghan war started nearly a decade ago. Thirty U.S. service members, including 17 Navy SEALs, were killed Saturday when their helicopter was apparently shot down by insurgent fire in the eastern central province of Wardak. Sgt. Daniel J. Paton, 26, of Canton, Ohio, was also killed that day in a roadside bomb in Helmand province. The attacks coincide with a NATO drawdown and a transition of security to national forces. Ten thousand U.S. soldiers are scheduled to depart Afghanistan by year's end, with the full drawdown set for the end of 2014. ""The endgame for NATO is to hand over security responsibility over all of Afghanistan to the Afghan security forces,"" said Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobsen, a spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. ""Once we have achieved that, the NATO mission can come to an end."" Critics question the readiness of Afghan security forces, particularly those operating in the country's restive eastern and southern border provinces. Jacobsen said NATO forces aim to provide a more manageable scenario for local forces ""against only very reduced numbers of terrorists."" But, he said, it ""will have to be seen in the three and a half years that we've got left."" Newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker said last month that a U.S. military presence in the country could extend beyond the 2014 date. Still, he emphasized that America ""has no interest in permanent bases in Afghanistan."" ""We will stay as long as we need to and not one day more."" Roughly 150,000 International Security Assistance Force members are deployed in Afghanistan, including fewer than 100,000 from the United States. Meanwhile, NATO reported Friday that two insurgents were killed and several more detained after a joint coalition-Afghan operation in the northern Baghlan province. The raid targeted a ""Taliban facilitator"" responsible for coordinating a network of suicide bombers who were preparing an ""imminent attack"" on provincial government officials. The whereabouts of the facilitator are not clear. NATO says coalition forces also detained an insurgent leader in Kandahar province, a Taliban heartland often considered their birthplace.","NEW: Two NATO service members die in IED attacks in southern Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Poor Hillary Clinton. Later this week and next, she'll have the unenviable task of visiting Egypt and Israel at a time when America's capacity to influence the policies of both countries has fallen to new lows. And not even the secretary of state -- a veritable superstar of persuasion -- can charm America back into a position of influence. The public aspect of the visits should go smoothly enough. Nobody has a stake in upsetting an American Secretary of State.. Election year politics will diminish any unpleasantness in Israel, and even in Egypt, where the secretary should deliver some tough messages on the need to create and respect democratic principles, nobody really wants a fight. But not so far beneath the surface, agendas diverge and challenges abound for an America that's no longer as admired, feared or respected as much as it needs to be in a region critical to its national interests. Here's a guide to some of them: . Democratization: In Egypt, Clinton confronts so many challenges and minefields that regardless of what happens on this visit, the United States will be wrestling with that country's politics for years to come. The good news, of course, is that for the first time in 40 years, Egypt has competitive politics; the bad news is that the most anti-democratic and exclusive forces in the country are the ones who are competing. Clinton will find herself sandwiched between Islamists she doesn't trust and whose values aren't her own, and generals she believes have subverted Egypt's nascent democracy but are necessary to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel. Navigating this course won't be easy. The meeting with Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy will carry great symbolism: the United States sanctioning the rise of political Islam in the Arab world's most important country. Although Clinton can rationalize she is meeting the democratically elected president of Egypt, Morsy is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, whose views on issues such as female genital mutilation, women's rights, peace with Israel and U.S. policies throughout the region diverge from hers, and America's. The meeting with the generals won't be much easier. The Obama administration believes that the military -- not the Brotherhood -- has been mainly responsible for subverting the democratic process, and yet it's really hard-pressed to do much about it. The $1.5 billion in military aid from the United States will most likely continue, lest America be without any leverage to affect matters in Egypt. The Israelis will press hard to ensure that assistance continues. After all, the U.S. gave it to the authoritarian Mubarak regime; can it really withhold it in a period when Egypt is supposedly democratizing? The generals have concluded that we need Egypt now more than Egypt needs us. Peace process: Clinton's lack of leverage in Egypt will be mirrored in Israel. Israel's focus on domestic issues such as the military conscription law and election politics in the U.S. will ensure that the Obama administration will not seriously push the revival of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Even if talks were to resume, they wouldn't produce much. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, worried about Egypt and Iran, isn't prepared to make big decisions. And neither, for that matter, is a weak and constrained PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. Iran: Israel's worst fears about a nuclear Iran appear to be coming to pass. Sanctions are tougher than ever but apparently won't deter Iran should it persist in its campaign to acquire the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon. The P5-plus-1 (U.S., Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany) negotiations with Iran aren't producing a solution that stops weapons grade enrichment. The Iranian centrifuges continue to spin. And the Americans are in no mood to strike Iran or to give the Israelis a green or yellow light to strike. No Israeli military strike is likely before year's end, certainly not before the U.S. elections. But after that, all bets are off.

"(CNN) -- Unbeaten in 18 races, Black Caviar has already entered horse racing's history books and become a sprinting superstar in her native Australia. But will the mare be able to translate that to international success this year? Black Caviar's annihilation of the rest of the field in Saturday's Orr Stakes in Melbourne matched the feats of legendary 18th century racehorse Eclipse, putting them joint third in the all-time list of undefeated thoroughbreds. Her trainer Peter Moody will now be hoping that history repeats when she defends her Lightning Stakes crown at Flemington this Saturday. But the bigger tests, and larger plaudits, will rest in overseas challenges. Her 18th successive win, at the Caulfield course, was a step up in distance to seven furlongs, or 1,400 meters, but it proved no obstacle for Luke Nolen's mount as she pulled away from the field in the closing stages of the race. Foaled in 2006, the five-year-old bay had only been lightly-raced in her two, three and four-year-old seasons, but she has been busier this campaign with connections now aiming for the glamor Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot for her first foray on English soil. Although a specialist over the shorter distances of 1,000 and 1,200 meters, the step up for the Orr Stakes was thought to be an attempt to prepare her for the undulating Ascot turf, although the Diamond Jubilee Stakes will be contested over six -- not seven -- furlongs. The presence of the world's top-rated sprinter at Royal Ascot's showpiece event -- renamed, in 2012, in honor of the Queen Elizabeth's landmark jubilee -- is a mouth-watering prospect for England's most prestigious race course. ""Running the race with the world's top-rated sprinter, Black Caviar, representing Australia in what is historically Europe's most international race would be a wonderful way to begin a new era for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes,"" said an Ascot spokesman. Black Caviar is something of a celebrity in her native Australia, where thousands of punters regularly pack the stands to see her race, many wearing her traditional salmon and black colors in tribute. Her success has sparked a media frenzy in the sports-mad nation, with the country regularly grinding to a halt when her races are shown on TV -- local networks even broke into coverage of last month's Australian Open tennis championships to broadcast her 17th race. The trip to Britain raises the prospect of a future showdown with top-rated colt Frankel, also unbeaten in all nine of his starts. The four-year-old is the only horse in the world with a higher official rating than Black Caviar. The Sir Henry Cecil-trained powerhouse out of champion sire Galileo is almost as big a star in England as Black Caviar is Down Under. However, connections for both horses remain tight-tipped about the possibility of a match race. Frankel aside, all eyes in the Black Caviar camp are surely trained on the ultimate prize of Royal Ascot, with a possible stopover in the Middle East en route for the Dubai World Cup also thought to be on the cards. But first Black Caviar must overcome her next immediate challenge: Saturday's meet could pit her once again against her principal rival, Hay List -- the only horse who has given her a run for her money so far in Australia, and a top sprinter in his own right. In addition to Hay List, a clutch of exciting three-year-olds entered for the Lightning Stakes will also be looking to stop the Black Caviar juggernaut in its tracks. Just don't bet against lightning striking twice. With Black Caviar proving herself over seven furlongs, do you think a clash with Frankel could be on the cards? Who would win?","Australian racehorse Black Caviar is a sensation in her homeland .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Home Secretary Theresa May has signed an order for British businessman Shrien Dewani's extradition to South Africa, the Home Office said in a statement on Wednesday. Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South Africa, while the couple was on honeymoon last November. Dewani now has 14 days to appeal to the High Court in an effort to overturn the decision of the district judge and the Home Secretary, the Home Office said. The businessman, from Bristol, has said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denies any involvement in the killing. Taxi driver Zola Tongo has confessed that he hired two men to kill Anni Dewani in November last year. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Shrien Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a car hijacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town. A court in London ruled last month that Dewani could be extradited to South Africa to face trial. May signed the order on Monday.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Somali government forces launched an offensive on Islamist strongholds in Mogadishu Thursday morning, killing 15 members of the al Qaeda-inspired group Al-Shabaab, a military commander said. Speaking to state radio, Col. Abdullahi Ali Anod, commander of the presidential palace, said the president ordered the offensive in northern Mogadishu. Fighting has intensified this summer as Somali government forces -- backed by troops from the African Union -- have battled insurgents from the militant Al-Shabaab. The fighting comes also as Somalia is battling its worst drought in 60 years and tens of thousands of famine-stricken people are walking for days into both Kenya and Ethiopia in search of food and water. David Orr, a spokesman for the United Nations' World Food Programme, said the fighting has not interrupted his organization's efforts to get aid into the area. Also Wednesday, a police officer was killed and four others were injured when a bomb exploded on Kenya's border area with Somalia, Kenyan authorities said. Authorities blamed the attack on Al-Shabaab. ""Al-Shabaab militia have been a problem for us at our border because it's porous but our surveillance is high,"" said Michael Mbaluku, the area deputy police chief.

"Washington (CNN) -- Most Americans think Supreme Court justices base their rulings on personal political views rather than legal interpretation, polls show, and Thursday's ruling on the politically charged health care reform law will probably reinforce that. By the narrowest of margins, the high court upheld almost all of President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement: the 2010 Affordable Care Act despised by conservatives as an expansion of government. The 5-4 decision prompted immediate criticism from the political right and the dissenting justices that it was an improper judicial overreach. Meanwhile, the reaction on the left was jubilant, with the Democratic National Committee executive director tweeting in exuberance: ""it's constitutional. Bitches."" Republicans have new rallying point . With justices clearly identified as conservative or liberal, based on their rulings and the party affiliation of the presidents who nominated them, any decision on a high-profile, emotional issue such as health care reform seemed certain to exacerbate the perception of politics motivating the ruling. A recent CBS News/New York Times poll found that 55% of respondents believed Supreme Court justices would decide the health care cases based on personal or political views, compared with 32% who said the rulings would be based on legal analysis. The same poll found only 13% of respondents believed that justices generally base their decisions on legal analysis, while 76% believed they were sometimes influenced by personal views. At the same time, polls show public approval of the nation's highest court dipping near or below 50%, which is on the low side of a rating that has exceeded 70% in the past but is historically volatile. For example, a CNN/ORC International poll in April showed that 50% of respondents approved of how the Supreme Court handled its job, with 41% disapproving and 9% offering no opinion. Ruling cements Obama's political legacy . To Nan Aron, president of the left-leaning Alliance for Justice, the Supreme Court's role in the 2000 presidential election through the Bush v. Gore case cemented the perception that the justices were guided by political ideology. ""Clearly the public sees the courts as similar to Congress -- the branch where politics trumps everything else,"" Aron told CNN before the health care ruling was handed down. Now-retired Justice John Paul Stevens warned of that very eventuality in his dissent in the Bush v. Gore ruling, writing that although the nation may never be completely certain of who won the 2000 election, the identity of the loser was ""perfectly clear."" ""It is the nation's confidence in the judges as an impartial guardian of the rule of law,"" Stevens wrote. Such a dynamic may seem inevitable in an era of stark partisan divide in the country, but court watchers said it shouldn't be that way. ""Precisely because everything is so polarized, there should be one branch of government that people on both sides of the aisle can view as deciding on the basis of law rather than politics, because these issues are so contested,"" said Jeffrey Rosen, the legal affairs editor for The New Republic, in a recent interview on NPR. Opinion: Ruling a Frankenstein's Monster . Connie Severino, chief counsel and policy director for the right-leaning Judicial Crisis Network, said on the same NPR program that the Supreme Court ""has always maintained a position of being the most revered branch of government."" ""What you've seen is a general decrease of public perception of government, and the court has kind of been dragged down along with it,"" Severino added. In one way, Thursday's ruling altered a perception in recent years that a conservative majority on the court led by Chief Justice John Roberts held sway. This time, Roberts joined the court's liberal wing in the health care ruling and wrote the majority opinion, which Scotusblog.com founder Tom Goldstein predicted would change the public view of the court. Roberts' role in the decision ""insulates the court and by extension him from criticism for the next 10 years that it's just a partisan place that's looking for political outcomes,"" Goldstein told Bloomberg Law. Had Roberts sided Thursday with the other four conservatives -- Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy -- the liberal reaction would surely have been as heated as the anger on the political right. ""This is truly a turning point in American history. We'll never be the same way again,"" complained Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a leading tea party voice against the health care law. She called the ruling ""a more far-reaching decision than anyone had expected or imagined."" Gergen: Are voters ready to move on? Scalia added to the perception of politicized justices this week in his dissent of a Monday case on Arizona's immigration law in which he, Alito and Thomas opposed the majority, which included Roberts and Kennedy. In the dissent, Scalia criticized the Obama administration's recent policy shift to halt deportations of some young illegal immigrants and complained that the government failed to enforce immigration laws, leaving border states unprotected. A Washington Post editorial Thursday said Scalia's ""lapses of judicial temperament"" hurt the dignity of his office and endangered ""not only his jurisprudential legacy but the legitimacy of the high court."" In recent years, 5-4 decisions reflected the conservative majority in some high-profile cases such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission of 2010, which opened the electoral process to unlimited private funding without full disclosure. Roberts sided with his fellow conservatives in those cases, while four justices considered to the left -- Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and the now-retired Stevens -- supported the politically liberal stance. Since then, Elena Kagan, another perceived liberal, succeeded Stevens on the high court. The party affiliation of the president who nominated the justices matches the political affiliation now associated with each. Roberts, Alito, Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy all were put forward by Republicans, while Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan were nominated by Democrats. ""The court is agreeing to hear many more controversial cases and rendering 5-4 rulings in these cases, which have the effect of politicizing its decision-making,"" Aron said, adding that ""with Citizens United, the inside game has become much more apparent now to many more Americans."" What the ruling means to you . Asked if Bush v. Gore had instigated the shift in public perception that the high court was politically motivated, Aron responded: ""I think that's right."" Severino, however, rejected the argument that a single ruling or set of rulings showed any particular political leaning by justices. Harsh reactions follow rulings in any high-profile case, she said, noting the continued public division over the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that legalized abortion. ""The fact that a decision like Roe v. Wade was 7-2, something none of us would consider a close case ... and yet has continued to be possibly the most divisive case certainly in this last century by the court, I think that shows that it's not all about just the vote count,"" she said on the NPR program. ""It's about the public perception of whether the court is really being political or is actually deciding based on the law."" An even more one-sided ruling, the 9-0 decision on Brown v. Board of Education that ended school segregation in 1954, also prompted a public outcry, including calls to impeach then-Chief Justice Earl Warren, Aron noted. The desegregation ruling ""galvanized a base of people particularly in the South who were very opposed to that,"" she said. She added that Roe v. Wade led to further right-wing dissatisfaction with the high court that manifested itself in the nominations of conservative justices by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s. Opinion: The Supreme Court punts . More recently, major rulings have followed the 5-4 breakdown, including the Parents v. Seattle School District and Meredith v. Jefferson Co. Board of Education affirmative action cases in 2007, the District of Columbia v. Heller gun control case in 2008 and the Citizens United case. Shortly after the Citizens United ruling, Obama added to the politicizing of Supreme Court issues by challenging the decision in his State of the Union address as six of the nine justices sat nearby in the packed Congress chamber. ""With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests --- including foreign corporations --- to spend without limit in our elections,"" he said to applause. ""I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."" As Obama spoke, Alito appeared to mouth the words ""not true."" Severino, speaking to CNN before the health care rulings, questioned Obama's public criticism of the justices back then, saying the court's role is to decide if ""a law is within the constitutional authority of the Congress"" and nothing more. ""We don't have a Supreme Court to gauge which way the country's going,"" Severino said. ""We have an elected legislature for that."" Rosen, however, said in the NPR interview that ""if it's really a novel argument, and reasonable people can disagree, courts are supposed to defer to the political process and not second-guess it.""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's opposition groups announced the formation of the National Revolution Council Wednesday, the first significant move toward forming a new government in Yemen. The move comes amid efforts to replace President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his embattled government. The council will have 143 members from a range of political factions, including political figures abroad and in exile. Its main mission will be to end the Saleh regime and ensure that its demands be met.  The council will seek recognition from world and regional powers as the sole representative of Yemen. The Yemeni political crisis started January 16, when youth protesters took to the streets demanding Saleh's resignation. Today, protests continue in the majority of Yemen's provinces. Saleh, who has been faced with widespread anti-government sentiment and militant activity, has been urged to accept a political transition plan that will lead to his departure. He has been in Saudi Arabia for treatment of wounds he suffered in an assassination attempt June. Mohammed Qahtan, the spokesman for the opposition Joint Meeting Parties, welcomed the powerful step on the council formation and insisted that Yemen is going in the right direction. ""The national council will speed the process of change in Yemen and will end all government efforts in forcing the country to enter a phase of violence,"" said Qahtan. The council is expected to meet later in the week to choose a president and a 20-person executive committee to run the affairs of the ""Yemeni revolution,"" said Qahtan. Sakhr Wajeeh, a senior opposition official and member of the council, said the doors are still open for more political figures and sides to enter in order to ensure that the council represents all the Yemeni people. ""This council is key to the success of the Yemeni revolution and all parties must be involved and active in order to lead the country towards prosperity,"" said Wajeeh. The Houthi Shiite rebels, who control the northern Saada province and are a strong force in Yemeni politics, were not involved in the national council; they refused to join. However, they are still in dialogue with opposition officials on receiving membership to the council. The council will gradually work on convincing the international community to acknowledge it as a legitimate representative of the Yemeni people. ""This is step one, and if the regime does not accept peaceful transition of power, we will call on the international community to change its stance on who represents the Yemeni people,"" said Ahmed al-Bahri, a senior opposition Haq party official. The conference was held at Sanaa University, just meters away from Change Square, where youth protesters have set up camps demanding a regime change. Protesters insist that Saleh's family stand trial for crimes committed against Yemenis.","NEW: The council is expected to pick a president and executive committee soon .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen'shighest military authority Sunday announced its willingness to open channels of dialogue with al Qaeda in hopes of reaching a long-term cease-fire agreement. The military committee was formed as part of the power transfer deal in November. Spokesman Ali Saeed Obaid told CNN that the new Yemeni military leadership is opening its hands and will seek new solutions with al Qaeda fighters. Al Qaeda currently controls large areas in the southern Abyan and Shabwa provinces of Yemen. ""We are offering al Qaeda a chance to be involved in the political decisions in the country through politics, rather than forcing their views with the use of arms,"" Obaid said. Vice President Abdurabu Hadi is chairman of the committee, which is responsible for rebuilding the Yemeni military. ""The committee is hoping that al Qaeda lays down its arms and participates in seeking change democratically, like the millions in Yemen,"" Obaid said, adding that al Qaeda would in return handover all territories under its control to the military and evacuate government posts. Al Qaeda has not yet responded to the offer, the committee said. Yemen's government is in the midst of a transfer of power in which President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a longtime United States ally in the war on terrorism, has agreed to step down after more than 33 years of rule. Islamist militants seized control of Abyan last May after government positions were suddenly emptied. The province was announced an Islamic emirate a week later, resulting in hundreds of fighters joining their lines. Hundreds of troops and fighters have been killed daily as part of their efforts to rid the province of the fighters. More than 100,000 residents of Abyan evacuated the province when clashes intensified last July. They are currently living in shelters in the neighboring provinces of Aden and Lahj. Last month, a committee formed by Hadi persuaded al Qaeda fighters in Radda, in the nearby province of al-Baitha, to evacuate the area two weeks after they took it over. Suspected al Qaeda fighters left the town after five days of tense negotiations in exchange for the release of three prisoners, Hadi's office said at the time.","The offer is in hopes of reaching a long-term cease-fire .

"(CNN) -- Lourdes Batista wishes she had super powers so she could use them to find her husband, she said Wednesday, 105 days after authorities said he was kidnapped in Mexico. Lourdes Batista says she has no idea why someone would kidnap her husband, Felix. Felix Batista, a renowned kidnapping consultant, disappeared after getting into a vehicle outside a Saltillo restaurant December 10. The family has yet to hear a word from his abductors. ""I don't have words to describe the pain,"" Lourdes Batista said. ""It's cruel, very cruel."" Lourdes Batista was getting ready for bed at her Miami, Florida, home when she received a phone call informing her that her husband of 31 years had been snatched. She tried contacting him on both of his phones, but to no avail. Felix Batista, 53, had arrived four days prior in Saltillo, the Coahuila state capital about 250 miles from the U.S. border, to take part in a security seminar about kidnappings. He was giving talks about kidnappings to a business group in Saltillo and Torreon. Though the Cuban-American worked as a contract consultant for the Houston, Texas-based ASI Global Response, the trip was not affiliated with the company. On the day of his kidnapping, Felix Batista was in a restaurant with several other people when he received a phone call, according to a statement from the Coahuila state attorney general's office. ""After speaking for a few minutes, [he] left the restaurant, telling his colleagues that several people in a white pickup truck were going to give him a message,"" the statement said. ""Afterward, outside the business, at about 7 p.m., he got into a vehicle with different characteristics from those he had mentioned to his colleagues and, since then, no one has had any communication with him,"" the statement said. There was no indication of violence at the scene, the attorney general's office said. Jackie Batista said she has no clue why someone would abduct her brother. ""We can speculate till next year,"" she said. ""We've waited for answers. We don't have any information, and no one has contacted us."" Lourdes Batista added, ""It's very perplexing. I don't know. I don't understand why. This is why I can't sleep at night.""  Watch Felix Batista's wife, sister plead for his release » . Felix Batista served four years in the U.S. Army before entering private practice. He has 23 years of experience as a crisis responder and had worked with ASI Global Response since May 2007, President Charlie LeBlanc said. A profile on the company's Web site, which has been taken down, said Felix Batista conducted threat assessments and had been credited with the ""successful resolution"" of almost 100 kidnap-and-ransom cases. LeBlanc said Felix Batista was a ""multidisciplined security practitioner"" who also worked on extortion cases and consulted corporations. His aptitude as a consultant aside, Lourdes Batista said, he was an outstanding family man: ""a great man and a great father and a wonderful husband. I couldn't ask for better."" Since Felix Batista's kidnapping, ASI Global has been working with his family, acting as a liaison with the FBI and Mexican authorities and vetting those offering to help with the case, LeBlanc said. It's the same kind of work Felix Batista was known for, he said. ASI Global has been sharing information with the Mexican national police, who have ""been very forthcoming in sharing information and asking for advice,"" LeBlanc said. ""We've had viable leads. They just haven't panned out,"" he added. Kidnappings and violence have long been problems in Mexico, but the problem has spiked in the past year, at least statistically. Mexican President Felipe Calderon said this month that there were 6,500 organized-crime killings in 2008, more than double the number from 2007. The nation's human rights ombudsman has reported that there were 5,140 reported kidnappings between 2001 and 2008. Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora's office reported that there were 326 kidnappings in the first five months of 2008 alone. ""Many cases continued, however, to go unreported, as families negotiated directly with kidnappers. The number of reported cases to authorities was believed to be far less than the actual number of kidnappings,"" said a statement from Mora's office. Lourdes Batista said the level of violence in Mexico troubles her. ""The Mexican citizens, how do they live like this every day of their lives? It's beyond me,"" she said. ""I fear for them and fear for their loved ones."" Lourdes Batista said there have been no threats against her or against her five children with Felix, who range in age from 16 to 28, but she still lives anxiously. ""I do live in fear, but mostly for Felix and for the families that are going through what I'm going through,"" Lourdes Batista said, adding that the kidnappers' silence has left her feeling impotent. Last week, exactly 100 days after his kidnapping, the Batistas submitted a letter to three newspapers in Monterrey, about 30 miles east of Saltillo. The letter, addressed to ""the Mexican people,"" sought any leads or information in the case and offered a financial reward for information yielding Felix Batista's safe return. In short, it stated, ""we want Felix back,"" Jackie Batista said. Lourdes Batista said she is willing to add a caveat to the family's plea. ""I am not one to persecute, and I don't want to know. I just want my husband back. We need him here,"" she said.","Lourdes Batista says of perplexing motive, ""This is why I can't sleep at night""

"(CNN) -- A video showing seven Estonians pleading for help in gaining their release -- a month after they were abducted while bicycling in Lebanon -- makes it clear their kidnappers ""want to keep contact,"" Estonia's foreign minister said Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Lebanese internal security spokesman told CNN on Wednesday that seven of 11 people for whom they have warrants in the kidnappings have been arrested. However, authorities say, they are unable to determine the Estonians' whereabouts because the people who abducted them operate in cells, meaning members of one group have no information about -- or direct contact with -- members of another. The men in the video appear to be in good health, but there was no way to determine when it was shot. It was the first contact from the men or their abductors since a web posting from a previously unknown group claiming it was responsible for the abduction. In the video, which was sent as a YouTube link in an e-mail to the Estonian foreign ministry, one of the abductees reads in English from a statement calling on Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Saad Hariri, and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and France to do anything in their power to get them back home. After that, each of the other men makes a short plea for help. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet was in Abu Dhabi Wednesday for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union and Gulf Co-Operation Council, during which he secured pledges of cooperation from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in finding the seven. He said Jordan ""and many colleagues from European Union and NATO countries"" also had agreed to help. Paet told CNN that the men were abducted by ""local criminals"" in the Bekaa Valley on March 23 as they bicycled into northeastern Lebanon from Syria. They then were handed over to an unknown group. In early April a statement was posted on a Lebanese news portal by a previously unknown group calling itself the Renaissance and Reform Movement, saying they had carried out the kidnappings and would issue demands, but none has since been made. The video released Tuesday also included no demands. CNN Correspondent Arwa Damon described the border region where the men were abducted, as ""very porous,"" and that it is ""very difficult for Lebanese authorities to navigate, as well.""

"(CNN) -- Taxes took center stage in renewed Republican attacks on the Obama administration's sweeping health care legislation Thursday after the Supreme Court rebuffed attempts to derail it based on its constitutionality. Using the court's finding that the centerpiece of the law -- the individual mandate -- amounted to a legal exercise of congressional tax power became Plan B for the GOP. ""That's not what the president said when he introduced the bill, but what the court said was that it's OK because it's a tax,"" U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, told CNN. ""The debate that we're happy to have is that our friends on the other side of the aisle [not only] want to tax what you do, they want to tax even what you don't do."" Ruling, tax fears play into campaign narrative for both sides . And Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said, ""Millions of Americans may now have a IRS problem as a result of the ruling."" But Lawrence Jacobs, a leading chronicler of the battle over health care, says that shouldn't be a surprise. The requirement that all adults have health coverage is the linchpin of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the health care legislation President Barack Obama signed in 2010 after an epic brawl in Congress. That rule survived its last legal challenge Thursday when the Supreme Court ruled it was constitutional under the legislative branch's power to impose taxes. Obama had denied the mandate was a tax during a 2009 interview with ABC, comparing it to state requirements that motorists carry auto insurance. ""Nobody considers that a tax increase. People say to themselves, 'that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I'm not covering all the costs.' "" What health reform could cost you . At least four million people are expected to pay a tax penalty when the rule takes full effect in 2016, bringing in about $54 billion to help offset the $1.7 trillion, 10-year cost of the act, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But it's only one of several revenue-raising provisions that help pay for the costs of the act, commonly dubbed ""Obamacare."" ""This was the Democratic tax bill,"" said Jacobs, a University of Minnesota political scientist and co-author of a 2010 book on the health care battle. In addition to the mandate, there is a higher Medicare tax rate on taxpayers making more than $200,000 a year or $250,000 for married couples, and it added a tax on investment income to fund the federal health program for seniors. Opinion: Court's ruling a 'Frankenstein's Monster' ""It's one of those invisible things, and it's very important,"" Jacobs said. There's also an excise tax on so-called ""Cadillac"" health plans, which had been hotly debated at the time; a higher threshold on medical deductions; and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services. But while Republicans have long opposed higher taxes, Jacobs said they concentrated their fire on the mandate instead. ""Rather than getting into a convoluted conversation about taxes that were pretty obscure to most people, they latched onto the individual mandate,"" he said. ""Now that the Supreme Court has up held the mandate, it's really kind of taken the wind out of their sails."" Jacobs said most Americans will be covered by employee health plans, a head of household's employer or by existing government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or veterans' benefits. Of the roughly 6% of the population remaining, a large portion of those will be exempted from the mandate either because of poverty, religious belief or other reasons, he said.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in Louisiana on Thursday rescheduled the liability trial in the BP oil spill in Gulf of Mexico and postponed it to early next year from later this year.

"New York (CNN) -- A Colombian man who federal authorities say was a leader of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was convicted in U.S. federal court Thursday of conspiring to import thousands of kilograms of cocaine into the United States, according to prosecutors. Ignacio Leal Garcia, who was extradited from Colombia to the United States in July 2010, wil be sentenced on November 17 and could get 10 years to life in prison, according to a news release from the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. ""In connection with its request for extradition, the United States has assured the Government of Colombia that it will not seek a life sentence for Leal Garcia,"" the release said. Leal Garcia, 41, is one of five alleged FARC leaders extradited by the United States on the same federal indictment, and the other four defendants already have been convicted, according to the U.S. attorney's office. In the indictment and other court papers, prosecutors describe the FARC as being ""a hierarchical organization comprised of twelve to eighteen thousand members"" and as being a military-style organization responsible for production and shipment of more than half of the world's supply of cocaine and nearly two-thirds of the cocaine imported into the United States. Leal Garcia, who was captured in April 2009, was leader of a FARC section that controlled all cocaine production and trafficking in a 9,000-square-mile area near Colombia's border with Venezuela, prosecutors said. ""To exercise this control, Leal Garcia organized regular meetings in the various municipalities ... where he threatened death or exile for anyone who failed to cooperate with the FARC's control of coca farming, cocaine production and cocaine trafficking in the region,"" the release from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. Leal Garcia supervised production and distribution of ""thousands of tons of cocaine"" intended for the U.S. market, the statement said, with profits from drug sales going to fund the FARC. ""Recognizing that the FARC could not survive without its cocaine revenue, the indicted members of the FARC leadership directed its members to attack and disrupt coca eradication fumigation efforts,"" the news release added. ""FARC leaders also ordered FARC members to kidnap and murder United States citizen in an effort to dissuade the United States from continuing to contribute to coca eradication."" The FARC has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the leftist guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces in the South American nation. The United States and the European Union consider the FARC a terrorist organization.

"(CNN) -- In the empty towns surrounding the ravaged Fukushima Daiichi power plant, piles of radioactive dirt serve as monuments to the difficulty of cleaning up the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. While the physics and engineering that go into a nuclear power plant may be sophisticated, undoing the damage left behind by the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns is largely a brute-force affair that relies on shovels, fire hoses and bulldozers. ""It's pretty simple stuff, at least early in the process,"" said Kathryn Higley, an Oregon State University professor who studies the effect of radiation on the environment. ""They seem very low-tech, but low-tech works reasonably well."" Sunday, Japan marks a year since the historic earthquake that killed nearly 16,000 people in the country's northeast. The tsunami generated by the quake flooded the Fukushima Daiichi plant, triggering meltdowns in its three operating reactors. While no deaths have been attributed to the nuclear disaster, more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its long-lived fallout settled. Unlike Chernobyl, where the former Soviet Union abandoned a 30-kilometer (19-mile) radius around the plant following that 1986 disaster, Japan's government says it will reclaim the stricken area. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda says more than 1 trillion yen ($12 billion) has been budgeted for the reclamation effort, and they hope to begin allowing some of the residents to return home by April. Nearly 60% of that money has already been committed, including $3.4 billion to compensate affected residents. But the decontamination effort is expected to take another two years, and what it can do to make the worst-hit towns habitable again remains to be seen, Noda spokesman Noriyuki Shikata told CNN. ""We are putting our priority to the areas where we have a realistic prospect of having residents return,"" Shikata said. Ultimately, Japan has set a goal for cleaning up all areas where radiation levels are 1 millisievert over normal background, based on an estimate of eight hours a day spent outdoors. That's 104 towns, some in which work has already begun. The government expects to have more than 30,000 people involved in the cleanup effort by April. The work so far focuses on areas where annual doses of radiation are between 20 and 50 millisieverts a year -- seven to 16 times the typical amount a resident of an industrialized country receives in a year, but below the threshold for an increased risk of cancer. Most of those are outside the 20-kilometer exclusion zone drawn around the plant in the early days of the disaster. Monitoring posts in the towns closest to the plant, such as Namie, Futaba and Okuma, report radiation levels many times higher. At some points, annual radiation doses run five to 10 times what's allowed for nuclear plant workers. For residents of those towns, which were battered by the earthquake before the meltdowns occurred, the frustration levels remain elevated as well. ""I have to accept this because an earthquake and tsunami are natural disasters,"" Namie town councilman Bunsai Watanabe said. ""But a nuclear accident is a man-made disaster. The government decides the policy and the operator caused this accident."" Places like Namie remain largely frozen in time a year after the disaster, untouched by the rebuilding boom seen in other parts of Japan. The stillness is broken only by the occasional foray by people like Watanabe, who are periodically allowed back in to check on their properties, and by animals such as dogs and cattle that now roam freely around the former farm towns. Shikata said the government is still studying how to clean up areas where the annual dose tops 50 millisieverts, the standard international limit for nuclear industry workers -- ""a difficult area to realize returns,"" he said. The bulk of the reclamation effort so far involves scraping away the top 2 inches of soil in the contaminated areas, with particular focus on clearing grounds of public facilities like hospitals and schools. Higley and her colleagues have been studying how contaminants spread through the soil and get absorbed into plants -- a major concern in the largely agricultural area around the plant. Studies conducted since Chernobyl have shown that the ammonium nitrate in common fertilizer or the addition of potassium slows that process, while natural processes drive radioactive particles into the ground, she said. Vacuuming, sandblasting, painting and stripping surfaces and hosing down roads and walls are ""consistently effective"" decontamination techniques in urbanized areas, a 2007 review by the U.S. government's Idaho National Laboratory found. But Jan Vande Putte, a radiation expert with the anti-nuclear environmental group Greenpeace, said the government in Tokyo has made a mistake by concentrating on the abandoned towns around the plant. ""They created expectations with population that was evacuated that they would be able to return in a reasonable time,"" Vande Putte said. ""Now it's become more and more clear, and is very frustrating to those people, that they will not be able to return soon or may never be able to return at all."" Meanwhile, he said, local authorities are struggling to clean up ""hot spots"" in still-inhabited areas like the city of Fukushima, well outside the exclusion zone. ""We see that some parts have been decontaminated -- for instance, the soil has been removed and new soil has been put down,"" he said. ""In those areas, radiation levels have dropped. But on the concrete and asphalt, it is a very sticky problem."" Shikata said the government is responding to the demands of its people who wish to go home. ""We wish to respect their intentions, their wish to go back to their homes,"" he said. ""Of course, as I explained to you, we are carrying out massive decontamination efforts. I don't really get the point that you can disregard the wish and will of those residents."" But Shikata said the government is still trying to figure out where to put the contaminated soil and debris that has piled up during the effort. An October report by the International Atomic Energy Agency estimated that material could be as much as 29 million cubic meters, roughly enough to fill the landmark Tokyo Dome two dozen times. And even when annual radiation levels can be cut below the 20 millisieverts the government says is safe -- itself a measure that has been the subject of debate -- former residents may be reluctant to come home. ""It's a little bit of a chicken and an egg,"" Higley said. ""People don't want to be the pioneers, if you will, to go in where there's no supporting infrastructure. So if you're a family and you're told the place is clean, but there's no school open, are you going to move your family back into that area? How are you going to encourage them to come back so that you really do have a functioning town again?"" CNN's Kyung Lah in Tokyo and Tomas Etzler in Namie, Japan, contributed to this report.","Decontaminating towns around Fukushima Daiichi is a largely low-tech affair .

"(CNN) -- The 25 victims of the August 26 terrorist bombing of the United Nations House in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, were honored in a memorial ceremony on Thursday. Omabegho Edward-Dede, the 12-year-old surviving son of Dr. Edward Dede, a national professional officer with the World Health Organization, told the grieving crowd at the ceremony at the U.N.

""However, I take courage and strength when I remember the good life my father lived."" Wreaths were placed to commemorate the victims, who were described as ""martyrs of development"" by Uzoma Ihedirimadu-Abudu, the president of the Federation of United Nations Staff Association of Nigeria. Officials representing the Nigerian government and the United Nations joined members of the diplomatic corps, the armed forces and family members of the victims at the ceremony.

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Closing arguments are scheduled Thursday in the hearing for Pfc. Bradley Manning, the man accused of committing the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history. On Wednesday, Manning's defense attorney spent a brief 35 minutes questioning two witnesses before resting his case. Manning's Article 32 hearing is part of the military's process of determining whether he should face court martial. The first defense witness called was Sgt. Daniel Padgett who served with Manning in Iraq and witnessed one of several angry outbursts witnesses have described. Security Clearance blog: Bradley Manning and the need to share . Padgett was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where Manning worked. He testified that in December 2009, Manning was late for duty and they sat down in a conference room so Padgett could counsel him. Padgett said when they began talking, Manning was calm, but that he began to change. At some point, said Padgett, Manning grabbed the conference room table and turned the table over, knocking a computer and radio to the floor. Because there was a rifle in the room, Padgett testified that he didn't want Manning to get his hands on it, so ""I coaxed him away from that, put my hands on his shoulder and coaxed him away."" At that point another soldier came in the room, subdued Manning, sat him down and Padgett continued counseling him, Padgett testified. When asked by Manning's attorney David Coombs if Padgett remembered Master Sgt. Paul Adkins, the senior enlisted man in the unit, talking with him about the incident, Padgett said ""vaguely."" Padgett testified that he did not discuss the outburst with the major who oversaw the intelligence analysis officers, the company's first sergeant nor the company commander. Manning was not moved out of the intelligence office after the outburst and did not lose his security clearance as a result of the outburst. Coombs has argued that the Army should have known about Manning's emotional issues and kept him away from classified materials. Manning is accused of stealing and leaking nearly three-quarters of a million classified documents from the State Department and the Defense Department to the WikiLeaks website, which published many of them. The leaks occurred while Manning was serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. Prosecution witnesses testified that Manning downloaded and leaked 400,000 DoD field reports from Iraq and 90,0000 similar documents from Afghanistan. There was also evidence presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 State Department cables. Coomb's second witness, Capt. Barclay Keay, testified by phone about his time with Manning's unit. For a short time in December 2009, he was an officer in the intelligence analysis office where Manning worked. Keay said he often saw soldiers listening to music in the office where classified materials were analyzed. At first he thought it was not proper, but he was told it was ""an accepted practice"" that was ""tolerated because it helped soldiers be more productive."" In news reports before the hearing, Manning is said to have bragged in a chat room that he was able to download materials onto a CD while pretending to listen to Lady Gaga. Keay told the hearing, ""I do feel like he wanted to be a good soldier. He did good analytical work."" Even though he called only two, Coombs had requested 48 witnesses, 10 of whom were already on the prosecution witness list. The investigating officer overseeing the case granted those 10 and two other defense witnesses who were not on the prosecution list. He rejected other requested defense witnesses, including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mark Zaid, a national security attorney, said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising. ""For one thing, an Article 32 (hearing) serves as an opportunity for the defense to obtain pre-trial discovery, and particularly information they do not know. Additionally, the likelihood of stopping charges from going forward is non-existent in this case so there is little value in telegraphing to the prosecution information the defense may possess but might not yet have revealed,"" said Zaid.","Manning's defense calls only two witnesses .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Football players from Spain's top two divisions vowed to go on strike at the start of the season if the team owners don't provide ""guarantees"" that hundreds of players who are owed back wages are actually paid, the players association announced on Thursday. ""We're not asking for more money. We're just asking to be paid what's due,"" Juanjo Montener, spokesman for the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) told CNN. Association leaders, flanked by some of Spain's top football stars, such as Real Madrid goalie Iker Casillas and FC Barcelona defender Carles Puyol, held a news conference at a central Madrid hotel, vowing to strike but leaving the door open to further talks to try to resolve the dispute before the season opener scheduled for August 20. But the Professional Football League (LFP), representing the clubs in first and second division football, issued a statement soon after saying it ""doesn't understand"" the players' call to strike. The club owners said they had been negotiating in ""good faith"" with the players association and that club owners on August 3 established a new ""guarantee fund"" that would ""guarantee some important quantities of the salaries of players affected"" by club bankruptcy proceedings. Montener said 22 Spanish football clubs in first and second division have had financial problems serious enough to involve bankruptcy or receivership proceedings. He said 300 players have filed complaints that they are owed back wages. Spain's first division ""Liga"" is among the best in the world, and top players from South America and elsewhere in Europe often have lucrative contracts here. FC Barcelona is currently considered the best club team in the world, having won last May its second Champions League title in the past three years, again beating Manchester United for that title. Real Madrid is a perennial powerhouse and a potent global brand. But below that top tier, it's a different story for many other clubs. Spanish media have reported for months about some other first division and many second division teams that have struggled to avoid financial red ink. A three-year collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players expired recently and negotiations since then have been focused on a new deal. The strike call by the players comes as Spain continues to be mired in a deep economic crisis, with 21 percent unemployment overall and a jobless rate of about 43 percent for young people. The Socialist government has called for early elections, scheduled for November.","League says it ""doesn't understand"" the players' call to strike .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the leader of Ivory Coast for progress made toward peace Tuesday but urged greater dialogue with the opposition to heal the wounds of a deadly political crisis. It's a ""historic moment"" for the Ivory Coast, Clinton said during a press conference with President Alassane Ouattara, who welcomed her to the presidential palace in the nation's commercial capital, Abidjan. Clinton's visit -- the first by a U.S. secretary of state to the west African nation in a quarter of a century -- comes just over a year after contested presidential polls, which led to widespread violence. The former French colony was gripped by a post-election crisis from December 2010 to April 2011 after former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down after his defeat in the presidential election of November 2010. The United States was, along with France and the United Nations, a key ally of Ouattara in his conflict with Gbagbo. Gbagbo is now in The Hague, Netherlands, where he is accused of four counts of crimes against humanity for his role in attacks by forces loyal to him on those believed to be supporters of Ouattara, who was recognized internationally as the winner of the 2010 election. Prosecutors say more than 3,000 people died in the post-election violence. Parliamentary elections held in Ivory Coast in December were calm, but Gbagbo's Front Populaire Ivoirien boycotted the vote, saying Ouattara's government was fostering a climate of terror. Speaking alongside Ouattara, Clinton expressed her ""admiration for the progress achieved and gradual return to normality, which is a bearer of hope for peace and security."" But she also struck a warning note, saying reconciliation is needed. ""Securing these gains for democracy, prosperity and security -- for people around here and for your neighbors -- will require much work,"" she said. ""It will be particularly important to include all voices, including those that are discordant, for the purpose of the political dialogue."" ""We trust, President (Barack) Obama and myself, that the Ivory Coast may be again the engine of economic growth for Ivorian people, but also for the entire region,"" the secretary of state added. Rights group Amnesty International has said that crimes were committed by forces loyal to both sides in the post-election conflict, and has urged Ouattara's government not to allow a culture of impunity. ""Amnesty International has repeatedly called upon the Ivorian authorities and the (International Criminal Court) prosecutor to investigate all crimes under international law committed by all parties,"" the right group said in a statement in November. ""The organization has documented crimes against humanity, as well as war crimes, including murder, enforced disappearances, torture and crimes of sexual violence committed in the country, in particular between 2002 and May 2011."" In Abidjan Tuesday, Ouattara spoke of his government's ""firm determination to build a rule of law, impartial justice with respect for human rights."" Ouattara said Ivory Coast would carry out reforms to the cocoa producing sector, in which the United States has a big stake, by the end of the month. Ivory Coast is the world's leading cocoa producer. Ouattara said he and Clinton had held a ""full discussion"" on international diplomatic issues, as well as the position of the African continent on the world stage. Addressing Clinton, he said, ""You, and we, believe that peace is essential for the Ivory Coast to the African continent and the world."" While the Ivory Coast now enjoys peace, he said, building a strong relationship with the United States would help it meet the many challenges still ahead. Ouattara was welcomed by Obama at the White House in July 2011, along with the presidents of Niger, Guinea and Benin, in recognition of democratic processes in those countries. Clinton was in Liberia on Monday, where she attended the inauguration of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. She left the Ivory Coast early Tuesday afternoon to conclude her mini-tour in Togo and Cape Verde. The first U.S. secretary of state to visit Togo, Clinton met with President Faure Gnassingbe in Lome ""to demonstrate U.S. support for Togo's democratic progress and economic reforms,"" the State Department said. Togo was elected a non-permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations last year.

"(CNN) -- Yemen's embattled president, still recovering from a violent attack last month, met with a top U.S. counterterrorism official in Saudi Arabia Sunday. Yemeni state television broadcast footage of the president's meeting with John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser. The two met at a military hospital in Riyadh, where Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been recovering since he was wounded in the attack on his presidential compound more than a month ago. Video of the meeting shows Saleh wearing a suit jacket, his face still singed from the June 3 blast. Brennan wished Saleh ""a speedy recovery"" but also ""emphasized the importance of resolving the political crisis in Sanaa,"" the White House said in a statement on Sunday's meeting. He urged Saleh to sign the Gulf Cooperation Council's political transition plan for Yemen. ""The United States believes that a transition in Yemen should begin immediately so that the Yemeni people can realize their aspirations,"" the White House statement said. Saleh has voiced agreement with the plan by the GCC, which would ensure his gradual departure from office, but he has not signed it. Saleh told Brennan that the GCC initiative laid the groundwork for exiting the political crisis through national dialogue involving all political parties, Yemen's state-run Saba news agency reported. As Brennan and Saleh met in Saudi Arabia, clashes erupted between government security forces and armed tribesmen in one of the epicenters of Yemen's anti-government movement. Two people were killed and at least nine others were injured in the southwestern Yemeni city of Taiz Sunday, medical sources in the city said. Dozens of homes were also damaged in the fighting, which started early Sunday morning and stretched for more than eight hours, witnesses said. Saleh appeared on television in Yemen Thursday for the first time since the attack, telling viewers he was on the mend, open to talks with opposition forces and determined to strike back at his attackers. His speech from Saudia Arabia transfixed his home country, which has been enduring months of anti-government protests and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militant activity. Saleh said he had had eight successful surgeries in Saudi Arabia, but the president, whose badly burned face was dark and who sat stiffly upright in a buttoned-up robe, didn't specify when he would go back to Yemen -- a return his supporters anticipate but his opponents hope will never occur. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. On Sunday, Saleh thanked Brennan for U.S. support of ""Yemen's unity, security and stability,"" according to Saba. ""He confirmed that Yemen needs to be supported and assisted to promote economic and development fields so as to reduce poverty and unemployment, which represent a fertile environment of terrorism,"" Saba reported.

"(CNN) -- Police in the Philippines have paid an informant in the arrest of a militant tied to the kidnapping of four Americans and dozens of Filipinos. Police escort Hajer Sailani at the Philippine National Police headquarters on September 1, 2009 . Hajer Adjuan Sailani, who also goes by the name Abu Ajair, was captured last week in a mall in Cotabato City, the Philippine National Police said Tuesday. Authorities say Ajair is a member of Abu Sayyaf, a group that the U.S. State Department has designated as a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda. The informant received $7,100 (350,000 Philippine pesos) as a reward on Tuesday. Sailani has been linked to the August 2000 kidnapping of Jeffery Schilling, an American living in southern Philippines. He was held captive for seven months before he escaped in April 2001. Before he fled, his kidnappers had demanded a $10 million ransom and the release of certain U.S. prisoners. Authorities said Sailani was also involved in the kidnapping of three Americans and 17 Filipinos from the Dos Palmas resort in Palawan in May 2001. One American, a California native named Guillermo Sobero, was later found beheaded near the Abu Sayyaf's jungle lair in Basilan province. A second American, Martin Burnham of Kansas, was killed during a rescue operation. His wife, Gracia, was shot in the leg and survived. They were a missionary couple. Filipino nurse Deborah Yap was also killed in the clash between Filipino troops and Abu Sayyaf militants. The other 16 Filipinos were later released. Authorities on Tuesday said Sailani was also involved in the mass kidnappings of teachers, students and priests in Basilan in March 2000. Most were later released, but at least two teachers were beheaded. Abu Sayyaf is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the Philippine government. The group operates largely in Basilan, according to the U.S. State Department, and wants to establish a separate state for the country's minority Muslim population. The government has been fighting to contain the group, which is blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead. This year, Abu Sayyaf has been implicated in the kidnappings of several Red Cross workers and journalists.","Suspected militant Hajer Sailani was captured last week in Cotabato City .

"New York (CNN) -- The ""Dating Game Killer"" was extradited Wednesday to New York to face murder charges in connection with the deaths of two women during the 1970s, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. Rodney Alcala, 68, was escorted by U.S. Marshals to New York from California, where he had been on death row since 2010 for killing four women and a 12-year-old girl there. The California murders took place between November 1977 and June 1979 and covered a wide swath of suburban Los Angeles, from Burbank to El Segundo. He will be arraigned Thursday. Last year, prosecutors in New York charged Alcala with murder in the deaths of Cornelia Crilley and Ellen Hover. Crilley, a 23-year-old TWA flight attendant, was found raped and strangled inside her Upper East Side apartment in June 1971, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said in a news release at the time of the indictment in January 2011. Hover, also 23 and living in Manhattan, was found dead in Westchester County in 1977, it said. ""Cold cases are not forgotten cases -- our prosecutors, investigators and partners in the NYPD do not give up,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr said in the 2011 release. In 1978, Alcala was a winning bachelor on the television show ""The Dating Game."" At the time, he had already been convicted in the 1968 rape of an 8-year-old girl and served a 34-month sentence, authorities said. Police found dozens of photographs of women and children in a storage locker Alcala kept in Seattle. The locker also contained earrings belonging to Robin Samsoe, his 12-year-old victim, according to the Orange County, California, district attorney's office. Authorities asked for the public's help in determining whether any of the people in the photographs were victims of Alcala. A year before his appearance on the game show, Alcala raped, sodomized and killed 18-year-old Jill Barcomb and 27-year-old nurse Georgia Wixted in California, prosecutors said. He smashed in Barcomb's face with a rock and strangled her by tying a belt and pants leg around her neck, prosecutors said. Her body was discovered in a mountainous area in the foothills near Hollywood. Wixted was beaten with the claw end of a hammer and strangled with a nylon stocking, authorities said. Her body was left in her Malibu apartment. During his appearance on ""The Dating Game,"" Alcala was introduced as a ""successful photographer"" who might also be found skydiving or motorcycling. In June 1979, Alcala beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, authorities said. That same month, he raped and murdered Jill Parenteau, 21, strangling her with a cord or a stocking in her Burbank apartment. Alcala's blood was collected from the scene after he cut himself crawling out a window, the prosecutor said, adding, ""Based on a semi-rare blood match, Alcala was linked to the murder."" He was charged with murdering Parenteau, but the case was dismissed after he was convicted of killing Samsoe in 1979. Alcala approached her at the beach in Huntington Beach and asked her to pose for pictures, authorities said. She did, they said, and Alcala then kidnapped and murdered her, dumping her body in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Alcala was convicted of Samsoe's death in 1980 and sentenced to death, but the California Supreme Court overturned his conviction. A second trial, in 1986, also resulted in a death sentence, but it was overturned by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. As he awaited a third trial, Alcala's DNA was linked to the crime scenes in the Barcomb, Wixted and Lamb cases, and he was charged with killing them and Parenteau. Jed Mills, who played ""Bachelor No. 2"" on ""The Dating Game"" alongside Alcala's ""Bachelor No. 1,"" recalled he had an almost immediate aversion to him. ""Something about him, I could not be near him,"" Mills said last year. Alcala succeeded in charming bachelorette Cheryl Bradshaw from the other side of the game show's wall. But she declined the date that the show offered them -- tennis lessons, tennis clothes and a trip to an amusement park.

"(CNN) -- Roberto Mancini has signed a new five-year contract with Manchester City after guiding the club to their first English title for 44 years. The Italian oversaw a gripping finale to the Premier League season when two injury time goals in City's last match of the campaign saw them pip rivals Manchester United to the championship. The former Inter Milan manager has now committed his future to the club until 2017. ""I am delighted to be able to give all of my efforts to Manchester City for a further five years,"" Mancini told the club's official website. Manchester City win Premier League title in thrilling finale . ""The opportunity which exists to build on our recent success is enormous. Manchester City is a fantastic football club, from the owner, chairman, board and the executive team, through to the players, staff and fans. ""I am very much looking forward to the challenges and excitement ahead."" Mancini was appointed in December 2009 after the club sacked Mark Hughes, and has been afforded millions to spend in the transfer market by the club's oil-rich owners. Players like Yaya Toure, David Silva, Mario Balotelli and Sergio Aguero have all arrived for multi-million dollar fees and helped the club to their first major trophy in 2011, when they won the English FA Cup. It was a goal from Argentina striker Aguero that confirmed their dramatic Premier League victory in the final game of last season against Queens Park Rangers, now managed by Hughes. It marked a shift in power in the Premier League as Mancini and his team finally toppled Manchester United, who have a record 20 English titles to their name. City's interim chief executive officer, John MacBeath, said of the deal: ""Roberto's managerial credentials have been well proven in Europe for many years. ""In leading a team which has won the FA Cup and an unforgettable Premier League title in successive seasons, his ability to manage in the English domestic game is also undisputed. ""This new agreement allows Roberto to focus on the challenge of guiding a team which is capable not only of defending the Premier League title, but one which can compete for European honors."" City begin the defense of their Premier League title with a home game against newly-promoted Southampton on August 19.","Roberto Mancini signs a new five-year contract with Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe said Friday he is already enjoying the new Harry Potter attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Florida -- and he's already ridden the thrilling dragon roller coaster five times. The star spoke to CNN on the opening of the park-within-a-park in Orlando, with Hogwarts Castle towering behind him. It's ""pretty amazing, I have to say,"" Radcliffe said of the castle. ""It does appear to be kind of 700 (feet) of rock and castle. My personal favorite thing here is the Dragon Challenge. ... It's been a while since I've been on a roller coaster that terrifying, but I've done it five times in the last two days, and I plan to go a couple more times today."" Another ride, called Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, features Radcliffe and other stars from the cast and simulates parts of the movie, he said. The park is perfect for any fans who want to live parts of the fantastical world of Harry Potter, he said. Radcliffe described seeing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" when he was 10 and trying to simulate the movie's surreal martial arts by running off walls up and down his street. At the park, he said, ""you are just kind of immersed in the world of Hogsmeade, the village from the movies. For any kids out there who were like me when I was a kid ... you can now just come here and live the movie, pretty much, but without all the danger involved."" The attraction re-creates various locations, scenes and other elements from the wildly popular book and movie series. Harry Potter has now beaten out fellow Brit celluloid character James Bond as the top-grossing film series in history. Widespread industry speculation has it that Universal shelled out about $265 million for this Potter project, although officials are not confirming that number. Radcliffe, who turns 21 next month, has played the boy wizard since he was 11 years old -- about half his life. The final movie in the series finished filming last Saturday, and the opening of the park less than a week later is a nice way to punctuate his time in the role, he said. ""Suddenly, at the end of that, we get to come to an amazing park,"" he said. ""And it is amazing. When I was first told it was going to be a Harry Potter theme park, I was kind of thinking, well, that can go one of two ways. I was slightly trepidacious, because when you have been with something for 10 years, you are desperate -- you don't want anything to take that legacy. ""And I promise you that I would not be here today if I did not think this place was absolutely phenomenal, which it really, really is."" The Harry Potter books have been credited with getting children to start reading again. Radcliffe said that they have ""produced a generation of incredibly thorough, analytical, literate kids"" and that the books -- written by J.K. Rowling -- will have that as a legacy for decades. Radcliffe confessed he wasn't one of those young fans of the books at first. ""I wasn't a big reader when I was young,"" he said. ""When I got the part, there was a little bit of a deal made of the fact that the part hadn't gone to an avid Harry Potter fan."" After he got the part, however, Radcliffe said he started ""dutifully"" reading the books, and that's when he ""got completely sucked in and obsessed,"" like so many other fans. ""It's given me a love of literature and books,"" he said. With Harry Potter nearly behind him, Radcliffe said he plans to continue acting, but he'll be selective about the roles he takes. ""I'm in a very, very fortunate position where I've got a job that I absolutely love, and I get paid incredibly well for it,"" he said. ""I'm kind of amazingly lucky. ... And I think if you are in a position where you can afford to pick and choose very carefully what other parts you take and what other films or plays you do, I think you kind of have a duty to, because I'm in a lucky position where I don't have to do things just for the money. So I'm going to enjoy being selective for the next few years of my career.""","Attraction re-creates locations, scenes, other elements from book and movie series .

"(CNN) -- A space shuttle contract worker fell to his death Monday morning while working at the launch pad, preparing the space shuttle Endeavour for its final flight, according to a NASA official. United Space Alliance, the prime contractor for the U.S. space shuttle program, said in a press release that the victim was one of its employees, James Vanover. ""He fell at the pad, and NASA emergency medical personnel responded but were unable to revive him,"" said Kennedy Space Center spokeswoman Candrea Thomas. Vanover was a swing-arm engineer, United Space Alliance spokeswoman Kari Fluegel said. He supported work on the gaseous oxygen vent hood as well as the orbiter access arm, which is the passageway through which astronauts enter the space shuttle. Relatives told CNN affiliate WKMG that Vanover had worked for 30 years at the Kennedy Space Center and had a new job lined up after he was to be laid off, along with many others affiliated with the space shuttle program, in the coming weeks. Fluegel said the man's body was found on another level of Launch Pad 39A at the space hub in northeast Florida. NASA has not indicated what caused him to fall. ""The incident is under investigation,"" Thomas said. ""As of right now, all work at the pad has been suspended for the day while we investigate what happened."" Allard Beutell, a NASA spokesman, told WKMG that ""other than the fact it is a dangerous environment, there was nothing major, no hazardous operation taking place. It wasn't like they were fueling up the shuttle -- it was nothing like that."" Counseling and employee assistance are being provided to Kennedy Space Center workers, NASA said. Virginia Barnes, the CEO of the United Space Alliance, offered her ""heartfelt sympathy"" to Vanover's family. ""Our focus right now is on providing support for his families and for his coworkers,"" she said in a press release. Endeavour is scheduled to blast off on its final mission April 19.","NEW: NASA spokesman: ""Nothing major, no hazardous operation (was) taking place""

"(CNN) -- China plans to make ""every effort to rescue"" a merchant ship and crew hijacked in the Indian Ocean, the country's state news agency reported on Tuesday. The Chinese-owned bulk carrier De Xin Hai was hijacked on October 19 with 25 crew members on board. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu, speaking to reporters, said the government was monitoring developments and has developed an emergency response procedure, the news agency Xinhua reported. Monday's hijacking is the first of a Chinese ship this year, according to the International Chamber of Commerce's International Maritime Bureau. Ma said the ministry warned ships and citizens to avoid traveling along waters where the incident occurred, an area not far from the Somalia coast where pirates have seized many vessels. See a live map of hijackings in 2009 . ""We will watch closely developments in the incident and make every effort to rescue the hijacked crew and carrier,"" Ma said. There are 25 crew members aboard and they are all Chinese nationals. A European Union official Monday incorrectly said the total of crew members was 146. The bulk carrier De Xin Hai was hijacked Monday about 550 nautical miles northeast of the Seychelles and 700 nautical miles off Somalia's eastern coast. The European Union Naval Force said Tuesday the ship was 650 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia and appears to be headed toward there.  See where the ship was hijacked » . John Harbour, a commander with the British Royal Navy who serves with the EU Naval Force, said the UK Maritime Trade Organization in Bahrain called the ship but received no response. An EU force aircraft is monitoring the ship and reported seeing four pirates on deck. The De Xin Hai is owned by the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company and was carrying coal from South Africa to India, Harbour said. Xinhua reported that the total capacity of the ship is 40,892 tons, and that the vessel is 225 meters (246 yards) long. It said that the last time the ship sent a communication was at 4:35 a.m. EDT Monday (4:35 p.m. Beijing time). The ship was dragging two skiffs behind it, much like the kind of skiffs that pirates have been known to use to hijack ships in the waters off Somalia. So far in 2009, 14 ships have been hijacked in the ocean off Somalia's coast, and 33 have been hijacked in the Gulf of Aden, the body of water that lies between Yemen and Somalia, the International Maritime Bureau said. Most of Somalia's coastline is on the Indian Ocean. At present, the bureau knows of four ships that are being held.

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- For the first week of Jerry Sandusky's child sex trial, eight young men held jurors spellbound with testimony about a sports hero they say groped them in the car, soaped them in the shower and sexually assaulted them on a basement waterbed. How do you come back from something like that? Sandusky's defense attorneys, Joe Amendola and Karl Rominger, responded this week with rapid-fire rounds of testimony; 29 witnesses took the stand in little more than two days -- including 11 character witnesses in a single hour. The defense also chipped away at the character and motives of the alleged victims, sparing no one: not the young accusers, not their families and certainly not the cops. The defense rested shortly before noon Wednesday without calling Sandusky as a witness. The prosecution had no further rebuttal. The jurors were dismissed and told to return Thursday morning for closing arguments. They also were advised to pack suitcases, because they will be sequestered at a hotel during deliberations. Many defense witnesses -- including Dottie, his wife of 46 years -- painted Sandusky in glowing terms befitting a saint. Others questioned the motives of his accusers, particularly the ones known as Alleged Victim Nos. 1, 4 and 9. Two mental health experts, one for the defense and one for the prosecution, seemed to cancel each other out. Sandusky's character witnesses included more than a dozen old friends, former colleagues, fellow church members, ex-players and boys and girls he counseled through his nonprofit for at-risk kids, the Second Mile. They portrayed him as a football legend, role model and selfless do-gooder with a sterling reputation. For Sandusky, it was like homecoming weekend in the courtroom as he chatted, smiled and shook hands with people he has known for decades. They included Lance Mehl, an All-America linebacker at Penn State who went on to play for the New York Jets and works now as a probation officer in Ohio. His testimony was typical: ""We all looked up to him,"" Mehl testified in a booming voice. ""He is a class act."" Sandusky, retired defensive coordinator for Penn State's storied football team, is charged with 51 counts of molesting 10 boys over 15 years. He denies the charges, and his lawyers have suggested that overzealous police and prosecutors targeted him in a trumped-up case. They have compared him to David, fighting Goliath. All you need to know about allegations, how case unraveled . The defense called psychologist Elliott Atkins to testify about what No. 4 called ""creepy love letters"" he received from Sandusky. Atkins characterized the letters as symptomatic of a mental condition called histrionic personality disorder. He said he diagnosed Sandusky with the disorder after giving him two personality tests, interviewing him for six hours and reviewing the letters and other evidence. But a prosecution psychiatrist, Dr. John Sebastian O'Brien II, saw no evidence of any personality disorder in the test results. If anything, he added, there might be some indication of a ""psychosexual disorder."" But he said further information would be needed for a diagnosis. Defense attorneys played what they say is a smoking gun audiotape: 16 minutes of inadvertently recorded conversation in which a state trooper, Cpl. Joseph Leiter, casually discusses with attorney Ben Andreozzi how best to get the cooperation of the young man who would become known as Alleged Victim No. 4. Leiter had denied advising No. 4 about what other victims were saying; the tape contradicted his testimony. The witness was so terrified to talk with police that he curled in the fetal position on his sofa the first time officers knocked on his door, according to testimony. He hired Andreozzi, who specializes in representing crime victims and advertises extensively. No. 4 was taking a cigarette break outside when Andreozzi suggested to the trooper that it might help to let him know others were talking. The tape was left rolling inadvertently, and it captured everything. ""Oh, you're kidding, the time frame matches up?"" Andreozzi can be heard saying. ""Can we at some point say, 'Listen, we have interviewed other kids. ... Other kids have admitted there was intercourse. Is there anything else you want to tell us?' "" Leiter responded that such a tactic was not unusual. ""Yes, we do that with all the other kids,"" he said on the tape. ""This is what we found; this is how he operates. ... This has happened, and that has happened."" No. 4 returned to the room and was given a Sierra Mist. The popping and fizzing of soda cans being opened can be heard as Leiter addresses his reluctant witness: . ""You're not the first,"" the trooper said. ""I've interviewed probably nine kids, nine other adults. ... If this was a book, you'd be repeating word for word what other people told us. And we know from these other young adults who talked to us that there is a pretty well-defined progression that he operated and still operates to some degree."" The defense contends that No. 4's statement was ""tainted"" by suggestions about what the accuser should say. ""You mentioned rape, oral sex and other activities you got from other accusers, right?"" attorney Rominger asked the trooper when he took the witness stand. ""Yes,"" Leiter responded. Almost as a bonus for the defense, Leiter and another former trooper contradicted each other on what they had discussed during a court break minutes earlier. Leiter acknowledged that they talked about his testimony; the other trooper denied it. Only one of them can be right. Opinion: Secrecy and the Sandusky trial . The defense attack on No. 4 continued with the testimony of a childhood friend who said he had a reputation for being ""a dishonest person who embellished stories."" There was no love lost with Dottie Sandusky, either. Asked about No. 4, she said, ""He had his problems. He was very demanding, and he was very conniving, and he wanted his own way. He didn't listen a lot."" She found the boy known as No. 1 to be ""very clingy to Jerry"" and said he once ran across the room and jumped in her husband's lap. Another time, at a wrestling meet, he hugged her husband. ""He would never look anybody in they eye,"" she added. The defense also chipped away at the credibility and motives of No. 1 and his family by calling his mother and a former neighbor to the stand. The mother denied saying the case would make her wealthy, but the neighbor, Josh Frevel, testified that after her son claimed he had been sexually abused by Sandusky, she said, ""I'll own his house."" He added, ""She said, 'When this settles out, she'll have a nice big house in the country, with a fence, and the dogs can run free.' "" As for her son, Fravel quoted him as saying, ""When this is over, I'll have a nice new Jeep."" Dottie Sandusky had little to say about the other accusers, except for No. 9, whom she recalled as ""a charmer,"" adding, ""He knew what to say and when to say it."" She said she never witnessed any inappropriate contact between her husband and boys from the Second Mile. She said some slept in an upstairs bedroom at their home during sleepovers, some slept in a first-floor room, and others slept in the basement. She said she never went down there but added that her husband would go to the basement to say good night to his guests. Although the basement was not soundproof, she said, she never heard a thing. ""I just know he went and told them good night."" Asked by prosecutor Joseph E. McGettigan III what would motivate eight young men to make up lies about her husband, she responded, ""I ... I ... I don't know.""","Defense strategy in Sandusky case was to tear down accusers, families, cops .

"(CNN) -- The Spanish football season is set to get under way this weekend, after strike action by players which forced the opening round of fixtures to be postponed was ended on Thursday. Players from Spain's top two divisions went on strike earlier this month, in a bid to force the league to increase the fund which protects players' wages should clubs experience financial difficulties. The strike ended after the Spain's Professional Football League (LFP) guaranteed the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) payments owed to 200 players would be made. ""The Strike Committee of AFE and the LFP have reached an agreement which guarantees through various means the salaries of footballers,"" read a statement on the AFE's official web site. How match fixing ruined the beautiful game . ""After the meeting held today on August 25th, 2011 between the AFE and the LFP, the strike planned for Friday 26th, Saturday 27th, Sunday 28th and Monday 29th has been called off."" Another result of the talks is that players will now be able to leave their club if they are owed three months wages or more. The resolution means the season will now begin with the second round of fixtures, with the first match of the campaign set to be Real Sociedad's trip to Sporting Gijon. ""We want to thank all the Spanish and non-Spanish footballers that play in our league championship,"" continued the statement. ""We want to let you know how proud we are of all of them, for their show of unity and solidarity without precedent that they gave for many companions who were going through truly tough times."" Reigning Spanish and European champions Barcelona will not start their domestic season until Monday, due to their participation in Friday's European Super Cup match against Porto. Their opponents will be last term's third-place team Villarreal, who defeated Danish outfit Odense on Tuesday to reach the groups stages of the European Champions League. Last season's Copa del Rey winners Real Madrid kick-off their season away to Real Zaragoza on Sunday. As the strike in Spain came to an end, Italian players moved a step closer to similar action after the country's clubs voted in favor of changes to the collective contract signed by all footballers. Teams in Italy's Serie A, the top division, and Serie B, the second tier, want to hand coaches the power to force unwanted players to train away from the first team. They also want to introduce changes to the tax paid by the competition's highest earners. ""We dictated the precise conditions yesterday to renew the collective agreement. Our demands are reasonable and balanced,"" Serie A chief Maurizio Beretta told the league's official web site. The row has cast doubt over whether this weekend's opening fixtures can take place, with champions AC Milan set to take on Cagliari on Saturday.","The Spanish players strike has been called off ahead of this weekend's matches .

"(CNN) -- Scientists in Spain say they have developed an electronic ""tongue"" that can identify different types of the Spanish sparkling wine cava -- a task more usually left to the skilled palate of the sommelier. Using sensor systems and mathematical processes, the electronic tongue can currently distinguish between three types of cava -- brut nature, brut and medium dry -- researchers at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona say. But they hope with proper training, it will soon be able to pick out all types of cava on the market, in the same way a human sommelier might, and quantify how much sugar each contains. Cava, made in the same way as champagne, varies in sweetness according to the amount of the sugar added in the production process, with seven classifications ranging from Brut Nature to sweet. The research team in Barcelona believes the electronic tongue could help identify problems during the process and aid quality control -- perhaps reducing the need for human tasters in cava-producing bodegas. The scientists have aimed to reproduce human senses by developing biosensors to obtain chemical information and using computerised systems to interpret that data in the way the human brain and nerve system would. The electronic tongue is not the first device to challenge the traditional role of the sommelier. Scientists in France have in recent years developed an electronic ""nose"" which can pick up chemical signals to detect different types of wine and where they were made. And researchers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden said last year that their electronic nose could be used by vineyards to tell the perfect moment to harvest grapes for maximum flavour, or to detect when an opened bottle of wine has gone bad. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely human sommeliers will be out of a job in fine restaurants any time soon, since their skills tend also to include knowledge of wine regions, service, glasses -- and the all-important wine jargon. Pip Martin, director of the UK-based Sommeliers and the Wine Adventure, told CNN the electronic tongue sounded like a poor rival to human abilities. A human being can identify around 10,000 different aromas and scents, Martin said, and distinguish acidity and bitterness as well as sweetness -- giving the sommelier a distinct advantage over the device. ""If it can only determine levels of sweetness and that's it, I cannot imagine it taking over the role of a traditional sommelier any time soon, not least because it probably wouldn't have the small talk that a sommelier would bring,"" he said. ""Sommeliers are not just about wine recommendations and tasting abilities, they are about being personable when a customer comes in the door."" CNN's Carol Jordan contributed to this report.","Scientists say the electronic tongue can tell how much sugar is in a cava .

"(CNN) -- There is hardly anything in U.S.-Arab relations that screams scandal louder than the torture pictures of Abu Ghraib: . The abuse that went on behind these gates hardened Arab opinion against the United States. Naked hooded male bodies in the fetal position, piled up on top of each other in a pyramid shape, next to them U.S. soldiers in uniform smiling and giving two thumbs up. Naked males made to touch their genitals on camera, others beaten so hard that paramedics are at hand to treat their wounds in preparation for the next round of torture. For the Arab world, the human body is a taboo, a sacred temple that should be covered and respected. For many, exposing the naked body is a sin. So it is no surprise that taking pictures of the naked, hooded men was seen as a sick inexcusable act. The United States was already unpopular in the Arab world, mainly because of its war in Iraq. After Abu Ghraib in most quarters, it became despised with a vengeance. Before the pictures and videos became public in 2004, horror stories of what was going on inside the notorious Abu Ghraib prison were reported on Arab media in bits and pieces. We'd heard from people whose identity was hidden for their own protection. They described despicable acts of sexual abuse and torture that sounded more from a made-up horror tale than from real-life experience. For many Arab media observers, those claims were simply hard to believe. That is, until hundreds of photos and some videos were made available to the public that showed exactly what former Abu Ghraib prisoners had described on Arab media, and even worse.  See the abuse photos » . Arab newspapers and TV networks seemed to run out of words in describing the shock at the images they were printing on their front pages and showing in their newscasts. Anchors, reporters and guests felt uneasy about this bizarre story and all the twists and turns that followed. Those included a guided media tour of Abu Ghraib, showing that the situation was under control and inmates were being treated with dignity and respect. The shock quickly turned to anger against the United States and pity toward the victims. Arab commentators described the photos as ""shameful,"" the act of U.S. soldiers ""barbaric."" The outrage at the acts carried out by U.S. soldiers was a common reaction in the West and among Muslims and Arabs around the world. However, the way the reaction was translated on the ground was different. Gen. Mark Kimmitt first made his rounds on Arab networks arguing that these were isolated acts, made by a few low-ranking soldiers. He said on the most-watched Arab network, Al-Jazeera, that he was ""appalled"" at the photos, but he stressed that the images were being ""used as a tool"" to impact the U.S. military negatively. His boss, then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, broke his silence a few weeks later and reiterated that only a handful of low-level Army troops were involved in the abuse. He also offered to resign twice but his resignation was never accepted. Three months after the photo scandal, amid growing Arab and world outrage that showed no signs of calming, President Bush appeared on the U.S. government-run Arabic-language Al-Hurra TV. Many Arab commentators and columnists were expecting an apology and some high level officials to be held accountable. Neither happened. Bush said, ""I view those practices as abhorrent."" But he added that Iraqis ""must understand that what took place in that prison does not represent the America that I know."" The president's interview with his own station was seen in the Arab world as an attempt to pacify the situation instead of dealing appropriately with the problem. When another wave of Abu Ghraib torture photos became public in 2006, the reaction wasn't as strong because it seemed by then that the Arab world had given up on America. Sateh Noureddine of Lebanon's independent newspaper Assafir wrote that the scandal confirms an image of America ""already engraved in people's minds in the Middle East."" The image is that America isn't genuine about conducting ""an experiment of democracy"" in the region. Newspaper headlines from that time captured the mood. The London-based Al-Hayat newspaper said, ""New Pictures of the Abu Ghraib Scandal: Torture, Killing and Body Mutilation."" The Palestinian-owned Al-Quds Al-Arabi wrote ""Despicable pictures of at Abu Ghraib abuse scandal, suppressing prisoners by using live ammunition. Sexual abuse, barbaric beating and fallen bodies."" The Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Aswat's headline was critical of the U.S. administration's position: ""Washington: The new pictures won't add anything other than stir up anger. Those responsible were punished."" As soon as the news broke that more torture pictures could be released this year, Arab media rolled the old photos of humiliated Iraqi prisoners. The same pyramid of naked bodies showed up and that of a female soldier pulling a prisoner on a leash around his neck. Anchors asked questions about what news the new pictures could bring. Will they show that the Bush administration approved of those torture tactics and applied them in Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and perhaps elsewhere? Was the torture a directive given to soldiers rather than low-level military personnel engaging in ""abhorrent"" practices as the president called them? There is nothing any new photos can prove that wasn't already discussed and oftentimes believed on the Arab street already. One political cartoon by Lebanese journalist Stavro Jabra from May 2004 describes the mood in the Arab region and its experience of the scandal. It was inspired by one infamous Abu Ghraib photo, but, in the cartoon, the U.S. female soldier is replaced by Lady Liberty. At the end of her leash, instead of the Iraqi prisoner, lies President Bush. It was a clear reflection of an Arab view that the Abu Ghraib scandal will be a stamp of shame on the Bush administration. History will judge if it is an accurate prediction. CNN's Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report.","The scandal took the U.S. from unpopular to despised in the Arab world, Nasr says .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Abu Ahmed says he was there: An Iraqi held prisoner at Abu Ghraib by the American military when inmates were abused. Abu Ahmed says he and other inmates were held naked and forced to stand in their cells. He says he was kept naked and saw other naked inmates stacked onto a pile while photos were taken, photos that would become public and bring shame to the United States. The pain of the past few years is clearly etched on the man's face and equally obvious as he talks. It began October 1, 2003, he says, when U.S. troops came to his home and detained him during a sweep of his neighborhood. The next day, he was processed and put into Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. ""They made us take off all our clothes, even our underwear,"" recalled the man who is afraid to reveal his identity, instead offering up the alias of Abu Ahmed.  Watch Abu Ahmed tell his story » . ""They walked us in front of all the cells, about 50 or 60 cells, in front of all the detainees, in front of the soldiers, of the female soldiers. They got us in the cells, still naked, and they locked us inside,"" he said, tears welling in his eyes. ""They made us stand in the corner of the cell. We were not allowed to sit down. We were not even allowed to talk.""  See the photos of the abuse » . That treatment went on and on, Abu Ahmed said. ""For 32 days I was without clothes, even if we wanted to pray, we had to pray naked."" Abu Ahmed says he saw more abuse from his cell, including one of the incidents captured in one of the infamous photos. ""One day, they brought three or four detainees, maybe more. They were about 40 years old or older. They took off their clothes, forced them to climb on top of each other and start taking pictures ... I saw it with my own eyes,"" he said. ""Those detainees, I found out, were former Iraqi officers -- they brought them after a fight inside the camps, they brought them because they were very well respected inside the camp, so they humiliated them and returned them to the camp as a message to the others."" The U.S. military fully admits that the treatment of Iraqis inside Abu Ghraib at that time was unacceptable by its own standards, and that detention centers in Iraq today are run on very different lines. President George W. Bush declared that the ""abhorrent"" acts were ""a stain on our country's honor and our country's reputation."" They made Americans ""sick to our stomachs,"" he said in May 2004, soon after the photos became public. But Abu Ahmed says it is still hard for him to look at an American. ""Thanks to God, I have the ability to handle worse sights. I can't blame you for everything that these people did,"" he said. ""But, at the end, the American people are responsible for everything that happened,"" Abu Ahmed said, referring to the war that he believes turned his life upside down. Abu Ahmed spent a total of 20 months in U.S. custody, between Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, outside Basra in southern Iraq. He then returned home, where he spent less than five months with his family before being arrested again, this time by the Iraqi army in yet another sweep through his neighborhood. He says his treatment inside Iraqi facilities was even worse than what he faced at the hands of the U.S. military. His Iraqi captors, Abu Ahmed says, beat him with cables and pipes; he even had a cement block hung from his genitals. Documents issued to him by the U.S. military corroborate many aspects of his story, showing that he was in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca during the time he says he was. He asked us not to contact the Iraqi army to confirm details of his detention, fearing that they might arrest him again. He does not want any restitution and now works with the Iraqi government, trying to rebuild his life. Abu Ahmed has never been charged with a single crime.","Man says he was held naked in Abu Ghraib prison during 2003 abuse of inmates .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least six militants -- strapped with explosives-laden vests -- stormed a provincial governor's compound in central eastern Afghanistan Sunday, killing at least 19 other people, officials said. The six militants also died, bringing the death toll to 25. As many as 37 others were wounded as militants, one of whom was disguised as a police officer, battled security guards and police in and around the high-security complex that houses Parwan governor Abdul Basir Salangi, according to provincial council head Ahmad Zaki Zahid and Mer Alam, a local hospital spokesman. Salangi is alive and the gun-battle between insurgents and security forces has ended, said Roshan Khalid, the governor's spokesman. Five of the militants detonated their vests and the sixth was gunned down by police. One of the attackers -- riding atop a motorbike -- detonated his vest at the building's main security gate, allowing the remaining militants to enter the compound in an attack the Taliban has since taken responsibility for. NATO gunships circled overhead as Afghan security forces responded to the strike, according to Capt. Justin Brockhoff, a spokesman for the NATO-led International Assistance Security Force. But the helicopters, he said, did not open fire. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned Sunday's attack, saying 14 civilians had been killed along with five other police officers. ""This is another example of the despicable behavior by insurgents,"" said Rear Admiral Hal Pittman, an ISAF spokesman. ""Violent attacks that wound and kill civilians are not acceptable in any religion or culture."" The strike is the latest in a series of high-profile Taliban attacks in the group's near decade-long war against NATO and Afghan forces. It comes just as international forces are drawing down and transferring security responsibilities over to local and national control. Suicide attacks -- along with roadside bombs -- have increasingly become a hallmark of Taliban-style strikes. Last month, the governor of Uruzgan province narrowly escaped an insurgent attack after militants penetrated his compound. NATO helicopters also supported local security forces in responding to that incident, which left 19 people dead and 37 wounded. Ten children and a local journalist were among those killed in that attack. Also last month, the mayor of neighboring Kandahar City was killed in a suicide attack. High-profile assassinations in recent weeks have targeted allies of President Hamid Karzai's government. Kabul is still reeling from the July slaying of the president's half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, who was reportedly killed at the hand of a longtime bodyguard. The Taliban took responsibility for his death, though reports have since circulated suggesting his killing may have been the result of the gunman's personal grievance.

"Editor's note: Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, is a fellow at the New America Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that promotes innovative thought from across the ideological spectrum, and at New York University's Center on Law and Security. He's the author of ""The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader."" This commentary is adapted from a longer article . Peter Bergen says the evidence is that coercive interrogations likely did more harm than good. (CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview Friday that just-released CIA documents demonstrate the effectiveness of coercive interrogation techniques. ""My sort of overwhelming view is that the enhanced interrogation techniques were absolutely essential in saving American lives and preventing attacks on the Unites States,"" Cheney told FOX News Sunday. ""I think they were directly responsible for the fact that for eight years we had no further direct attacks on the United States."" So what do the newly-released CIA documents show, in combination with the other records on the matter already in the public domain? The first al Qaeda member to be subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" was Abu Zubaydah, a Palestinian al Qaeda logistician in his early 30s. Zubaydah was captured in March 2002 in a shoot-out in Faisalabad, Pakistan. He was the subject of intense interest from American officials as they believed he was the first al Qaeda insider whom they could interrogate who might know the form of the next terror attack. And so Zubaydah was the first prisoner to be placed in a secret overseas CIA prison, this one located in Thailand. There he was interrogated by Ali Soufan, one of the FBI's few Arabic-speaking agents. Zubaydah described Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al Qaeda's operational commander, as the mastermind of 9/11, and he confirmed that Mohammed's alias was ""Mukhtar,"" an important clue in helping to track him down. Abu Zubaydah's confirmation of Mohammed's role in the attacks on Washington and New York was arguably the single most important piece of information uncovered about al Qaeda after 9/11 and it was discovered during the course of a standard interrogation without recourse to any form of coercion. Soufan told Newsweek that ""we were able to get the information about Khalid Sheik Mohammed in two days."" Later, over Soufan's vociferous objections, a CIA contractor stepped in to take over Abu Zubaydah's interrogations. The FBI's standard, non-coercive techniques were jettisoned and Abu Zubaydah was stripped naked, deprived of sleep, subjected to loud noise and wide variations in temperature and he was later ""waterboarded"" 83 times. Following his arrest in Pakistan in March 2003, Mohammed was also subjected to intensive coercive measures. He was taken to a secret CIA prison in northern Poland where he initially proved resistant to interrogation. In the words of the 2004 CIA's inspector general report on detainees that was also released this week, Mohammed was an accomplished resister, provided only a few intelligence reports prior to the use of the waterboard, and analysis of that information revealed that much of it was outdated, inaccurate or incomplete."" Following his defiance, Mohammed was subjected to a number of coercive interrogation techniques including being waterboarded 183 times. But did Mohammed's coerced interrogations really lead to any substantive plots against the American homeland being averted? The short answer is no. A document the government released in 2006 around the time Mohammed was transferred from his secret CIA prison to the prison camp at Guantanamo offered details on the plots he had hatched against the United States: . ""KSM [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed] launched several plots targeting the U.S. Homeland, including a plot in late 2001 to have ... suicide operatives hijack a plane over the Pacific and crash it into a skyscraper on the U.S. West Coast; a plan in early 2002 to send al-Qaeda operatives to conduct attacks in the U.S.; and a plot in early 2003 to employ a network of Pakistanis ... to smuggle explosives into New York and to target gas stations, railroad tracks and a bridge in New York."" The newly-released CIA documents merely rehash the range of anti-American plots cooked up by Mohammed that the government already made public three years ago. And while this ""second wave"" of attacks all sounded very frightening, there is no indication that these plots were ever more than just talk. The chances of success, for instance, of al Qaeda's plan to attack the skyscraper on the West Coast -- since identified as the 73-story U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles -- were described by Mohammed in one court document to be ""dismal."" Of the terrorists, alleged and otherwise, cited by the CIA inspector general that Mohammed fingered during his coercive interrogations, only Ohio truck driver Lyman Faris was an actual al Qaeda foot soldier living in the United States who had the serious intention to wreak havoc in America. However, he was not much of a competent terrorist: In 2002 he researched the feasibility of bringing down the Brooklyn Bridge by using a blowtorch, an enterprise akin to demolishing the Empire State Building with a firecracker. If that was the most threatening plot the United States could discover by waterboarding the most senior al Qaeda member in American custody, it was thin stuff indeed. And when the English journalist David Rose asked FBI director Robert Mueller last year if he was aware of any attacks on America that had been disrupted thanks to intelligence obtained through ""enhanced techniques,"" Mueller replied: ""I don't believe that has been the case."" Historians will likely judge the putative intelligence gains made by abusive interrogation techniques were easily outweighed by the damage they caused to the United States' moral standing. That is certainly the view of Adm. Dennis Blair, the director of national intelligence, who wrote in April 2009, ""These techniques hurt our image around the world, the damage they have done to our interests far outweighed whatever benefits they gave us and they are not essential to our national security."" Quite. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.","Bergen: Dick Cheney says coercive interrogations saved lives and stopped attacks .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A Somali militant group wanting to rid the war-torn country of an al Qaeda-linked movement welcomed Saturday the African Union's decision last week to expand its peacekeeping presence in the country. Members of the Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama militia -- showing off their power by brandishing a small arsenal of light and heavy weaponry -- denounced Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab during a press conference in the capital, Mogadishu, and announced their support of the AU's decision to add at least 2,000 more troops to the 6,000-strong force targeting such groups. Al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al Qaeda, controls much of southern Somalia and portions of Mogadishu. Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama, which follows the Sufi form of Islam, turned against it after Al-Shabaab fighters destroyed the tombs of several revered leaders of the Sufi Muslim group in 2008. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for bomb blasts earlier this month in Uganda, which came just two weeks before an African Union summit there. More than 70 people were killed in the attacks. The group said the attacks were in retaliation for Uganda's troop contribution of the AU's peacekeeping operations in Somalia, known as AMISOM. Al-Shabaab follows the strict Saudi Arabian-inspired Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, rather than the Sufi Islam of many Somalis. Al-Shabaab and Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama, which have a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, are rivals and have battled each other for nearly two years. The United States is backing the African Union's mission in Somalia. Some observers say Somalia needs a political, rather than military, solution. The AU patrols just a few streets in Mogadishu and protects facilities belonging to the weak central government, including the presidential palace. The country has been virtually lawless since 1991, when the government of President Siad Barre, was overthrown.","Group favors African Union deploying more troops in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- The number of Americans fighting off hunger stayed level last year, though food insecurity rates remain the highest they have been since the federal government began keeping track 15 years ago, a Department of Agriculture report released Monday found. About 14.7 percent of U.S. households were ""food insecure"" in 2009, meaning they had difficulty feeding one or more of their members at some point last year due to a lack of financial resources, according to the report. That equates to 17.4 million households total, or roughly 45 million people. This year's rate marked a slight increase in percentage from 2008, when 14.6 percent of American households had trouble putting food on the table. The situation was especially dire for more than one-third of those households -- 6.8 million total, equating to 5.7 percent of all U.S. households -- that the report's four authors classified as having ""very low food security."" This number, too, changed little in 2009 compared to the previous year. A lack of resources prompted one or more members of these households to eat much less or otherwise adjust their eating patterns. The typical household in this category struggled with food issues for at least a few days a month over seven months of the year, the report said. Households headed by single parents were more likely to struggle with food insecurity than those with two parents at home. Hunger-related issues were more prevalent among African-American and Hispanic households than white ones, the study found. Access to food was also more common in large cities than in rural areas, exurbs or suburbs. Most of those classified as ""food insecure"" reported getting benefits from the federal government's three main anti-hunger initiatives: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the National School Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as WIC. In a press release, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that 18.7 percent more people had participated in the former program in 2009 over 2008. Rates also rose for the ""free lunch"" program (up 5.4 percent) and WIC (up 5.8 percent). ""This report highlights just how critical federal nutrition assistance programs are for American families,"" USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services Kevin Concannon said in a statement. The annual report from the Economic Research Service extrapolated from surveys of 46,000 households conducted on the Department of Agriculture's behalf by the U.S. Census Bureau. People responded to questions such as their ability to afford balanced meals, whether they adjusted the size of meals due to lack of money, or if they ever went hungry due to a lack of financial resources.","""Food insecurity"" rates in the U.S. changed little from 2008 to 2009, a report says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is proposing rules to govern the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate, a potentially explosive substance that was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and reportedly was a component in the July bomb attack on a government building in Oslo, Norway. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced proposed rules for an Ammonium Nitrate Security Program that would affect anyone who buys at least 25 pounds of the material. Those who want to buy or sell ammonium nitrate would be required to register with the federal government and their names would be run against the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database of known or suspected terrorists. ""In today's ever-evolving threat environment, we must continually reinforce the security of substances, such as ammonium nitrate, which can be used for legitimate purposes or exploited by terrorists,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement on the proposal. Napolitano said the government wants to secure potentially dangerous amounts of the chemical while not hampering legitimate use. Ammonium nitrate is commonly used in farm and landscaping fertilizers as well as in already-regulated commercial explosives for construction and mining. Under the new program, those who sell the chemical would be required to keep their records and report any instances of theft or loss within 24 hours of discovery. The 200-page proposal for the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program has been posted on the Federal Register and the public now has 120 days to comment. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program already regulates facilities that possess more than 2,000 pounds of fertilizer-grade ammonium nitrate or 400 pounds of the explosives grade of the material, according a Department of Homeland Security official. In addition, in recent years, sellers and the government have participated in voluntary programs to protect ammonium nitrate. In 1995, Timothy McVeigh rented a Ryder truck and filled it with ammonium nitrate and fuel oil to construct a vehicle bomb he then used to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. The blast killed 168 people.","The Department of Homeland Security wants tighter control of ammonium nitrate .

"Samalut, Egypt (CNN) -- A policeman fatally shot a Christian man and wounded five other Christians Tuesday in an attack on a train in Egypt, officials said. The incident occurred at about 5 p.m. when a man walked onto the train, which was stopped in the station at Samalut, about 200 kilometers south of Cairo, said Maryanne Nabil Thaki, 29, one of the victims. She said she was seated with her sister, Maggie Nabil Thaki, 25, their 52-year-old mother, Sabah Sinot Suleiman, and Maggie's fiance, 26-year-old Ehab Ashraf Kamal. They were en route to Cairo to buy an engagement ring, Maggie Thaki said. Seated near them was an older Christian couple, Maryanne Nabil Thaki said. The gunman walked up and down the length of the train, then walked back to two groups of people who were seated near each other and were both Coptic Christians, she told a reporter at the Good Shepherd Hospital in Samalut, where she was being treated for gunshot wounds to the leg and the chest. The man said in Arabic, ""There is no God but God,"" and opened fire, she said. The shooter fled the train, but was captured later, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. The suspect, a deputy policeman, was identified as Amer Ashoor Abdel-Zaher Hassan. He boarded the train in Asiut and was en route to Bani Mazar, Menya province, where he works. The older man, Fathi Saeed Ebaid, 71, of Cairo, was killed, a local security source told the state-run Egyptian news agency MENA. His wife, Emily Hannah Tedly, 61, was in critical condition, as was the mother of the two younger women, said Dr. Petra Kamal. All five were to be flown to Cairo for further treatment, a hospital employee said. In front of the hospital, about a dozen Copts demonstrated in support of the victims but were dispersed by police who fired a tear gas canister that broke through a fifth-floor hospital window, said hospital employee Mina Farouk. The attack comes 10 days after a bombing killed 23 Coptic Christians outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria, Egypt, an attack that unnerved Christians and led to increased security. Relations between the Christian minority and Muslim majority within Egypt have been tense since that New Year's Day bombing. Those troubles were evident last Friday -- the day Coptic Christians, who follow the Julian calendar, celebrate Christmas -- when police staged a large-scale security operation outside the same church. In a show of solidarity, some Egyptian Muslims attended the Christmas services. Still, protests have erupted almost nightly in many Christian areas of Egypt since the bombing. Egyptian authorities have released a sketch of a man they think was the suicide bomber in the church attack. The Interior Ministry used forensic technology to re-create the face. About 9 percent of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ.

"(CNN) -- Norwegian massacre suspect Anders Behring Breivik's purported 1,500-page manifesto paints a picture of a deliberative, driven killer -- not a rambling crazy person, criminologists said Tuesday. Speaking to CNN after Breivik's attorney said his client ""may be"" insane, Brian Levin, a criminologist with California State University, San Bernardino, rejected the suggestion. Based on what is known at this point, ""he's not crazy,"" Levin said; he is a ""sociopath,"" but ""not crazy."" Criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University echoed those sentiments. ""The behavior is crazy, but not necessarily the state of mind of the person committing it,"" he said. ""Mass murderers rarely are psychotic. They know what they're doing. They don't hear voices in an empty room. They're mad, but (mad) in terms of bitter and resentful -- not how we often use 'mad' to describe mental illness,"" he said. Both said a ""crazy"" person can be commonly understood as someone who cannot tell the difference between right and wrong and does not understand the nature and consequences of his actions. Breivik, 32, has acknowledged carrying out a bombing and a shooting rampage Friday, a judge said Monday. Authorities say eight people were killed in the bombing of an Oslo building that houses Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's offices, and 68 were killed at a youth summer camp run by his ruling Labour Party.  Breivik said the attacks were necessary to prevent the ""colonization"" of the country by Muslims, the judge said. Experts -- who have not met Breivik but have examined materials purported to be from him -- had different takes Tuesday on whether the manifesto suggests he was motivated more by ideology or by a desire for infamy. But several agreed that he seems to have more in common with mass killers, from ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski to Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, than with many terrorists and typical right-wing extremists. ""If you see this killer as only a terrorist, you might see him as exceptional,"" said Jack Levin, also a criminologist with Northeastern University. ""If you see him also as a mass killer, he fits the mold."" Levin said Breivik's purported manifesto and the ""Hollywood-type photos of himself"" -- including one in which he is dressed in a wetsuit with a patch that reads ""Marxist Hunter"" and holding a high-powered rifle -- suggest a ""personal pathology, the need to be a celebrity, to achieve worldwide infamy may have been the real motive for this crime,"" more than an effort to cause terror among a specific population. Cho, who killed 33 people at Virginia Tech in 2007, also had a manifesto and took photos and a video of himself, Levin said. Fox, Jack Levin's colleague at Northeastern, had a similar view. ""I think this is more about vanity than insanity ... and in fact more self-promotion than promoting any particular ideology,"" he said. ""The posed photographs, video, and of course the manifesto -- it seems to be all about him. And when you consider his background, (he was) fairly unsuccessful, which is something you find commonly among mass murderers. They see, through their crimes, the opportunity to feel like a big shot."" The manifesto vows that a ""European civil war"" will lead to the execution of ""cultural Marxists"" and the banishing of Muslims.  At one point, the writer states that his ""European Declaration of Independence"" took him nine years to complete. The document contains a link to a video. The writer identifies himself as Anders Behring Breivik. CNN could not independently verify that Breivik wrote the document or posted the 12-minute video, and Norwegian authorities would not confirm that the man in their custody wrote the manifesto, saying it was part of their investigation. Breivik says that he was in touch with two terror cells in Norway and in contact with other cells abroad, but that he acted alone in carrying out the attacks, his attorney said Tuesday. Fox noted that ""mass murders are typically well-planned executions."" Fox added that Breivik's apparent manifesto suggests similarities to U.S. domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people in the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, and to Kaczynski, who killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of bombings from 1978 to 1995. The FBI dubbed him the ""Unabomber"" because of his early targets: universities and airlines. ""McVeigh had his own grudge against the government.  And the Unabomber had his issues with technology.  And in these cases and many more, they used murder as their means of filing a complaint,"" Fox said. Magnus Ranstorp, research director of the Center for Asymmetric Threat Studies at the Swedish National Defence College, wrote in an editorial for CNN.com that Breivik ""represents the exception rather than the norm in right-wing extremist circles. ""Traditionally, right-wing extremism has been disorganized and impulsive, and it has often been manifested through localized hate crimes against immigrants. ... Breivik was the polar opposite. His nine-year preparation for creating the lengthy manifesto and the violent action that he argues for and documents in minute detail contradicts our traditional view. He argues against impulsive acts of harassing foreign immigrants in favor of spectacular, well-prepared attacks."" Levin of California State University, San Bernardino, said Breivik is ""much more deliberative"" than people ""like the impulsive neo-Nazi"" who goes out and attacks people, and seems to be more similar to McVeigh, who planned his attack deliberately. Levin said he believes ideology was probably Breivik's chief motivation -- and seeking personal benefit took a back seat. ""We're seeing the rise of the aspirational extremist,"" Levin said, describing someone who ""perceives society as careening out of control off a cliff."" ""This guy Breivik had a very tight ideological argument for what he was doing,"" the criminologist said. Setbacks in Breivik's life certainly played a role as well, Levin said. ""When people face a ruthlessness and some kind of personal setback and they've already been accustomed to an ideology that gives them comfort, they can ramp it up to violent forms of it."" Levin warned against writing off Breivik, with his ""Islamophobic"" writings, as a lone exception who does not reflect broader thinking around him. ""While the violence was extreme, the actual sentiments are sentiments that are widely expressed in some form throughout the mainstream of Europe,"" he said.","He's a sociopath, but ""not crazy,"" a criminologist says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three Pakistani men linked to Faisal Shahzad, the 30-year-old Pakistani-American who has pleaded guilty to the botched Times Square terror attack, were arrested and have confessed before a judge, authorities said Wednesday. This was not the first time that Shoaib Mughal, Humbal Akhtar and Muahammed Shahid have been the targets of Pakistani police operations. The three were arrested in May in connection with the same plot, but they appear not to have been charged and were released. The three were arrested as they traveled in a car on the outskirts of Islamabad, police said. They appeared before a judge where they confessed, Islamabad Deputy Police Chief Bin Yamin said. A 23-page confession statement was submitted for each defendant, he said. Police also said they found Pakistani Taliban literature and maps of the parliament building and the houses of the president and prime minister. Police say Shahzad stayed with Mughal during a visit to Pakistan last year. The three confessed to having received training from the Pakistani Taliban and to having had contact with senior members of that organization, including Hakimullah Mehsud and Qari Hussain, police said. According to their confessions, they took Shahzad to northwest Pakistan to meet with the Taliban leadership and to take part in training at least four or five times, Yamin said. Police said the men had wired $13,500 to Shahzad from Pakistan to the United States, and that they also helped him in the preparation of explosive materials. Prosecutors will present their case in court in 15 days, Yamin said. The three ""preached jihad and had strong hatred against normal people, including Americans,"" he said. Shahzad is accused of attempting to set off a vehicle bomb in Times Square on May 1. The device failed to detonate. He was arrested two days later while trying to leave the country on a flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Shahzad's arrest heightened concerns about the Pakistani Taliban, who authorities believe directed the Times Square plot. U.S. intelligence officials fear that the Taliban are plotting to strike within the United States and are targeting American interests overseas.","Three Pakistanis were arrested in connection with helping the suspect in the Times Square plot .

"(CNN) -- Exactly 10 years ago Wednesday, the first batch of terrorist suspects seized in Pakistan and Afghanistan arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on board a C-141 transport plane. From freezing nights in the depths of the Afghan winter, the 20 detainees stepped into a tropical breeze looking dazed and bedraggled. As more arrived over the next weeks, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described them as the ""the worst of the worst."" And a few weeks after GTMO (as it quickly became known) opened its doors, President George W. Bush said the detainees were not entitled to the protection of the Geneva Conventions -- because they were not part of a regular army. Guantanamo's population grew rapidly to a maximum of 680 the following year, and expanded beyond ""Camp X-Ray"" to other blocks. In those early days, Human Rights Watch says, detainees were subject to ""painful stress positions, extended solitary confinement, threatening military dogs, threats of torture and death"" and other abuses. The Bush administration, while insisting enhanced interrogation techniques did not amount to torture, contended that exceptional methods were legitimate in the face of an ongoing threat from terrorism. Over the past decade, the very word Guantanamo has become a touchstone in the debate over how democracy can protect itself from terror while not denying access to justice. It has also become a byword for political point-scoring and the subject of bitter argument in federal court over the principle of habeas corpus. It has found its way into popular culture, featured in Michael Moore's film ""Sicko"" and a Patti Smith song. Administrative reviews of detainees obtained and published by WikiLeaks indicated that in many cases interrogators knew little about those first groups of detainees. The evidence against them was often anecdotal and anonymous, and in April 2003 Rumsfeld complained that the military was ""populating Guantanamo Bay with low-level enemy combatants."" Many detainees have been released or transferred to third countries over the past decade. But it has often been difficult for the United States to find governments willing to take them. In 2009, four Uighirs from western China, who maintained they had fled to Afghanistan to escape persecution by Beijing, were suddenly transferred to Bermuda. Another 13 ended up on the Pacific Island of Palau, and yet another is now a pizza cook in Albania. But some of that first batch to arrive at Guantanamo are among the 171 prisoners held to this day. Several high-value detainees are likely to face trial by revamped military commissions. In addition, 46 are deemed too dangerous to be released -- but too difficult to prosecute, in either a military or civilian court. Another 89 have been cleared for release by multiple federal agencies, but they remain in limbo. (The last detainee to leave Guantanamo was a 50-year-old Algerian, exactly one year ago.) On New Year's Eve, President Barack Obama signed into law new provisions that bar the transfer of detainees currently held into the United States. for trial. The law also extends restrictions on the transfer of detainees to home or third countries -- including those cleared for release by the administration. And it reaffirms the executive's authority to detain anyone determined to be a member of al Qaeda, the Taliban or associated forces ""without trial until the end of hostilities."" Apparently without irony, the remaining detainees are offered classes in ""time management."" Attitudes have hardened in part because a significant minority of GTMO detainees who were released or transferred -- perhaps as many as 25% -- have returned to jihad. Some are now senior figures in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The prevailing climate is a far cry from the executive order Obama signed two days after taking office that pledged to close Guantanamo by January 2010, as he declared that the ""existence of Guantanamo Bay likely created more terrorists around the world than it detained."" Human rights groups have consistently criticized Guantanamo's very existence, the mistreatment of detainees and their lack of access to legal recourse. Attorneys specializing in human rights issues have devoted thousands of hours to petitions in federal court to win the release of detainees. But the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., has invariably ruled in the government's favor. The latest case reached the U.S. Supreme Court this week. Some on the political right argue that by their actions, detainees have forfeited their right to legal protections. In 2008, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska mocked Obama's promise to close the prison. ""Al Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America and he's worried that someone won't read them their rights,"" she said. Mitt Romney's view at the time was that ""Guantanamo is a symbol of our resolve. It's also just frankly smart to keep these people not on our soil and not to have them having access to our legal system."" And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said last year of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: ""We're at war. ... He did not rob a liquor store, he attacked our country."" Not all Republicans agree with such an approach. In 2008, Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) suggested bringing all the GTMO inmates to military tribunals at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Still, a 2010 CNN poll found that 60% of Americans favor keeping the prison open. Unable to fulfill his election pledge to close Guantanamo, Obama explored the option of trying more accused terrorists in federal court, only to run into a political firestorm. A plan announced in 2009 to try Mohammed in federal court in New York was dropped after complaints about cost and security. Mohammed and four others accused of some role in the 9/11 the attacks will now face military tribunals at Guantanamo, but have yet to be formally arraigned. The American Civil Liberties Union has opposed the tribunals, saying they ""are sure to be subject to continuous legal challenges and delays, and their outcomes will not be seen as legitimate. That is not justice."" Saudi-born Abd Al-Rahim Al-Nashiri, a suspect in the USS Cole bombing, is the first detainee to face one of the new military commissions, but his trial won't begin until late this year -- and the prosecutor in the case has said there is no guarantee he would be released even if acquitted. Al-Nashiri's case is emblematic of much of the controversy swirling around Guantanamo. The CIA inspector-general found in 2004 that he was water-boarded and had a power-drill revved close to his head while being interrogated in 2002 at a ""black site"" in Thailand, which may complicate the task of prosecuting him. The new commissions prohibit admission of evidence obtained by cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. According to human rights groups, the fate of the prisoners left at Guantanamo is only a small part of a more troubling picture, with nearly 3,000 alleged enemy combatants held without trial in Afghanistan. More than a third of them, including ""high-value"" Taliban, are held in a detention facility at the Bagram Air Base, dubbed ""the new Guantanamo"" by human rights lawyers. The Afghan government is now demanding it take over the prison, saying detainees have alleged torture, strip searches and freezing conditions (though these appear to have occurred in the part of the prison already under Afghan control). Under international law, the United States cannot hand over any detainees likely to suffer torture, and the United Nations reported last year that detainees in Afghan custody are routinely subject to such treatment. As the allied military presence in Afghanistan winds down, the fate of the detainees at Bagram seems certain to grow in importance, especially if no political solution that includes the Taliban is reached. The fate of the nearly 200 prisoners still held in a corner of the Caribbean may exercise some of the best legal minds in America and produce reams of paper from human rights organizations. The future of thousands more in the unforgiving mountains of the Hindu Kush may have a greater bearing on America's future security.","171 prisoners are now held at Guantanamo, including some from the first batch 10 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The health of Yemen's wounded president is improving, but doctors are recommending that he stay in Saudi Arabia for a ""longer time"" to recover, an adviser said Friday. This came as thousands of anti-government protesters demonstrated across Yemen and five people died in an explosion at a military checkpoint in Aden. Yemeni ruling party officials had been saying that President Ali Abdullah Saleh would return home Friday from Saudi Arabia, where he was taken for treatment after he was wounded in a June 3 attack on the country's presidential palace. ""Doctors recommended that President Saleh stays in Saudi Arabia for a longer time. They said that Saleh's health is improving,"" said Ahmed Al-Soufi, a senior presidential adviser in Yemen. ""The health of President Saleh is important to us, and we hope he will be here within days."" The biggest demonstrations are taking place in Sanaa, Taiz, Hodieda, and Ibb provinces, witnesses said, and the protesters condemned U.S. and Saudi interference in Yemeni political affairs. Demonstrators chanted, ""The people reject U.S. interference"" and ""the revolution will prevail."" ""We want the revolution to succeed, and the U.S. is not making this possible,"" said Sabreen Ariki, a leading figure in the Youth Revolutionary Movement in Taiz. ""It is killing the revolution, but we want to tell them that we will continue protesting until our demands are met."" Members of the Revolution Youth Organizing Committee, one of the groups in the Youth Revolutionary Movement in Yemen, condemned Saudi Arabia and the United States for what they said was the negative influence both countries are having on Yemen and promised that the countries' stance against the revolution will not be forgotten. ""It has become clear that the Saudi stance is against the will of the people and they are seeking their own interests while ignoring the interests of the Yemeni people,"" said Waseem Qirshi, a committee representative. In Sanaa, tens of thousands of Saleh followers gathered in support of him, demanding that the international community respect its constitutional president and not violate the Yemeni Constitution. In New York, members of the U.N. Security Council expressed ""grave concern"" Friday about the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Yemen. ""They urge all parties to show maximum restraint and to engage in an inclusive political dialogue,"" the council said in a statement after receiving a briefing on the situation. The Mission of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights will visit Yemen from June 27 until July 6. Investigators are probing the June 3 attack on the mosque in Yemen's presidential palace, which occurred when Saleh and other senior officials were attending Friday prayers. There were deaths and injuries in the attack, and Saleh was among several people taken to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment. Meanwhile, four soldiers and a civilian were killed when a bomb-laden vehicle exploded Friday at a military checkpoint in Aden, a security official there said. The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The official said the attack took place about 500 meters from a military compound where many of the army's tanks are located. Yemen has been wracked by unrest for months as protesters have demanded an end to Saleh's rule. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. The violence has led many people to flee their homes. Close to 45,000 people in southern Yemen have been displaced, particularly in Aden, Lahj and Abyan provinces, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated this week.","NEW: U.N. Security Council expresses ""grave concern"" about situation in Yemen .

"(CNN) -- Italy and Spain have become the second and third nations to secure qualification for the Euro 2012 finals after wins over Slovenia and Liechtenstein respectively on Tuesday evening. Germany were the first country to book their tickets for the finals in Poland and Ukraine on Friday. And they have now been joined by Italy, after a goal five minutes from time from Inter Milan striker Giampaolo Pazzini gave them a 1-0 Group C success over Slovenia in Florence. Should UEFA put weaker nations out of their misery? A defensive mix-up between Marko Suler and Bostjan Cesar left Pazzini to smash the ball home from five yards out to secure victory for Cesare Prandelli's side. The result means the Italians now have an eight-point lead over Serbia with just two matches remaining. Serbia beat Faroe Islands 3-1 and Estonia thumped Northern Ireland 4-1 in the other two group matches played on Wednesday. That leaves second on 14 points and one win from their final two matches will see them reach the play-offs. And, later in the evening, world champions Spain made it three teams to seal qualification after a 6-0 hammering of minnows Liechtenstein in Group I. David Villa and Alvaro Negredo both scored twice with Xavi and Sergio Ramos also on target for Vicente Del Bosque's side. Spain have a maximum 18 points from their six matches, eight points ahead of the Czech Republic, who are battling Scotland for second place in the group. Scotland kept their hopes of reaching the play-offs alive with a narrow 1-0 win over Lithuania in Glasgow. Meanwhile, Netherlands need just a point from their last two matches to secure qualification from Group E after a 2-0 victory over Finland in torrential rain in Helsinki. The World Cup finalists went ahead in the 29th minute when Wesley Sneijder set up Kevin Strootman to score. Haiti soccer's World Cup dream . And the Dutch added a second goal in injury time through striker Luuk de Jong to secure their eighth win from eight matches. Netherlands require a draw against either Moldova or Sweden to secure their place in Poland and Ukraine. Sweden kept their faint hopes of pipping Netherlands alive with a 5-0 thumping of San Marino, while Hungary won 2-0 at Moldova. England have also edged closer to qualification after a narrow 1-0 Group G win over neighbors Wales at Wembley. Manchester United winger Ashley Young scored the only goal, but Wales can consider themselves unlucky not to get something from the match after dominating the second half. England need a point from their final two matches to reach the final. Montenegro lie second on 11 points and they still have to play Fabio Capello's side at home. Switzerland beat Bulgaria 3-1 in the other group match to keep alive their hopes of finishing second. Group H is the closest of the nine groups, with three teams locked together on 13 points after Denmark beat Norway 2-0 thanks to a double strike from Sunderland forward Nicklas Bendtner. Portugal are level with those two nations, although Norway only have one match remaining while the other two have two each. It is also close in Group B with the top four teams separated by just three points. Russia and Republic of Ireland drew 0-0 in Moscow and remain first and second on 17 and 15 points respectively. But Armenia put themselves into contention with a stunning 4-0 success in Slovakia, leaving both teams a point behind on 14 points. France remain top of Group D despite a disappointing 0-0 draw in Romania. Laurent Blanc's side are a point clear of Bosnia, who beat Belarus 1-0, while Romania still retain faint hopes of qualifying. It is now down to a two-horse race in Group F between Croatia and Greece, with Croatia leading by a point with two matches left. A double from Eduardo da Silva helped Croatia defeat Israel, while Greece were held to a costly 1-1 draw in Latvia. In Wednesday's friendly matches, Poland and Germany drew 2-2 apiece with both sides scoring in injury time, while Argentina beat Nigeria 3-1 and Belgium had a 1-0 success over the United States.","Italy become the second country to qualify for the finals of Euro 2012 .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama took a key step in cementing his judicial legacy Monday, nominating Solicitor General Elena Kagan to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. If confirmed, the 50-year-old Kagan will become the 112th Supreme Court justice. She would be the third woman on the nine-member bench and the fourth in the history of the court. At its discretion, the court decides cases on the Constitution or federal law that may begin in federal or state courts. Her confirmation also would mean that the Supreme Court would have no Protestant justices for the first time in its history. Kagan, who is Jewish, would join six Catholic and two Jewish justices; Stevens is Protestant. Kagan, a native New Yorker, was widely reported to be the front-runner for the nomination. She was a finalist for the high court vacancy last year, when Justice Sonia Sotomayor was selected to replace the retiring David Souter. Kagan received her law degree from Harvard University, where she later served as dean of the law school. She served in the Clinton administration as associate White House counsel. Fast Facts: Elena Kagan . Kagan is a ""trailblazing leader"" who is ""open to a broad array of viewpoints"" and is a proven ""consensus builder,"" Obama said at the White House. ""While we can't presume to replace Justice Stevens' wisdom or experience, I have selected a nominee who I believe embodies that same excellence, independence, integrity and passion for the law, and who can ultimately provide that same kind of leadership on the court."" Kagan, in turn, said she was ""honored"" and ""humbled"" by what she called ""the honor of a lifetime."" ""The court is an extraordinary institution in the work it does and the work it can do for the American people,"" she said. It enables ""all Americans, regardless of their background or their beliefs, to get a fair hearing and an equal chance at justice."" Obama did not have to look far when considering Kagan. As solicitor general, she is the administration's top lawyer before the Supreme Court and has argued several high-profile cases before the justices since taking the job in spring 2009. She also helps prepare legal briefs for cases the Justice Department argues before the Supreme Court. That work won't stop immediately with her nomination to the high court. ""She will continue to work on matters with which she has been dealing, but will not participate in any new matters,"" said a senior government official familiar with Kagan's plans. Kagan is expected to abstain from participation in cases on which she has worked that may come before the high court next term, the official said. She was confirmed for her current job by a 61-31 vote. While most Republicans ultimately voted against her at the time, Sen. Orrin Hatch, a top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, called her ""a brilliant woman."" Jeffrey Toobin on his former law school classmate . Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said Monday that Kagan is a ""superb nominee"" who is ""the best this country can offer."" ""She will be confirmed,"" he predicted. He dismissed likely GOP criticism of the choice, saying Obama ""could nominate Moses the lawgiver"" and still face Republican opposition. Hatch, in turn, promised in a statement Monday to examine Kagan's ""entire record to understand her judicial philosophy."" ""My conclusion will be based on evidence, not blind faith,"" he said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, reacted to the nomination by citing a traditional GOP concern with ""activist"" judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Another top Republican, however, indicated that the Senate GOP would probably not try to block a vote on Kagan's nomination. ""The only reason she would be filibustered is if members come to believe she could not put aside her own personal views on cases in which she wanted to see a particular outcome rather than decide the case on the basis of the facts and the law,"" Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl said. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said Monday that Kagan's confirmation hearings could wrap up by early August, but noted the timing depends on the White House's willingness to work with the GOP. Republicans may try to use Kagan's own words against her in pushing for greater specificity on her views during her confirmation hearings. In 1995, she dismissed the hearing process as a ""vapid and hollow charade."" Kagan's position on gays in the military is virtually certain to generate controversy during her confirmation hearings. She has been strongly criticized by conservatives for her efforts to block military recruiters from Harvard because of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. The policy, enacted during the Clinton administration but opposed by Obama, prohibits homosexuals from serving openly in the armed forces. While serving as dean at Harvard Law, Kagan said she ""abhorred"" the military's ""discriminatory recruitment policy."" She called it ""a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order."" Also in the spotlight will be Kagan's views on the politically hot-button issue of campaign finance reform. She was the government's lead attorney in arguing against a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in January that eased long-standing restrictions on campaign spending by corporations and unions in federal elections. A number of conservatives praised the ruling as a victory for First Amendment free speech rights; most Democrats blasted it, arguing that it will tilt the political landscape favor of Republicans and traditional GOP allies in the business community. Some liberal organizations have expressed concern over Kagan's views on executive power. As chief defender of the administration's anti-terrorism strategy, Kagan has articulated a more robust defense of the White House than many civil rights and human rights groups would like. Vincent Warren, head of the left-leaning Center for Constitutional Rights, said Kagan's record ""indicates a troubling support for expanding presidential powers, something we must be vigilant about at this time."" ""President Obama would appear to be seeking to appoint a Supreme Court Judge who will endorse his policies and appease conservatives,"" he argued. ""This is not the way to make a decision that will affect our nation for decades to come."" Observers on both sides of the political aisle have noted that Kagan has a relatively short paper trail compared to other recent Supreme Court nominees. Kagan grew up in a Jewish household on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She went to Princeton University and Harvard Law School. She served as a law clerk for federal judge Abner Mikva and then for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the high court. Marshall affectionately called the diminutive Kagan ""Shorty."" Kagan later went into teaching, starting at the University of Chicago, where one of the part-time faculty was Obama. President Clinton later named Kagan associate White House counsel and then appointed her to the influential Domestic Policy Council, where she earned a reputation for articulate and well-reasoned statements on tricky political issues. Clinton picked her in 1999 for the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. But no Senate confirmation hearings were held, and the nomination lapsed. The seat was later filled by John Roberts, who quickly used the appointment as a springboard to chief justice. Named Harvard's dean in 2003, Kagan earned a reputation for soothing longstanding tensions over a perceived liberal tilt to the faculty and curriculum. She began pushing for the appointment of conservative professors, including Jack Goldsmith, who had been a lawyer in President George W. Bush's Justice Department. Such hires eased ideological unrest on the Harvard campus. CNN's Bill Mears, Alan Silverleib, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: Kagan hearings could wrap up by early August, GOP senator says .

"London (CNN) -- John Terry, one of England's biggest soccer stars, testified as his trial entered its second day Tuesday that he was upset and angry when he thought he had been accused of racial abuse by another player. The normally staid chambers of Westminster Magistrates' Court got an earful of shockingly foul language Monday, as the court heard what the Chelsea captain allegedly said to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Early in the session Tuesday, jurors heard an interview the Football Association conducted with Terry after the October 23 match. Terry said he was upset because he thought Ferdinand had accused him of racism. ""I was really angry and cross about him calling me a racist,"" he said in the interview. Terry made that point again as he was questioned before the court Tuesday. ""When he's accused me of that, I couldn't control my emotions,"" Terry said. The prosecution suggested Terry couldn't keep his temper because Ferdinand had taunted him over his alleged affair with a teammate's girlfriend. ""You couldn't, could you? You're not a racist but you used racist language. You snapped, didn't you?"" the prosecutor asked. But Terry rejected the argument, saying: ""It's two years on, I've heard that a 100 times, a million times. If I was going to snap I would have snapped long before."" The Chelsea captain told the court he was repeating what he mistakenly thought Ferdinand had accused him of saying as they traded insults in a heated game. In the interview with the Football Association, Terry said he spoke with Ferdinand after the match to ask him if the defender had accused him of making a racist comment. ""I said to â€ªAntonâ€¬, 'was you accusing me of calling you a black c---?' and he said 'No, not at all.'"" In the interview Terry said: ""If I had something to hide I would have whispered it into someone's ear."" Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle earlier rejected a request by Terry's legal team to dismiss the case due to ""insufficient evidence."" A lip reader watching a video of the incident on Monday told the court what Terry said, including two extremely obscene words. Terry does not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as ""black,"" but he denies engaging in racist abuse. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Liverpool player Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches when the Football Association, the English sport's governing body, found he had racially abused Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across Europe. The Crown Prosecution Service is pressing charges against Terry for a ""racially aggravated public order offense"" because of the comments during the match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. Prosecutors played a video of the incident, without sound, as the case opened Monday morning. The alleged abuse came after Ferdinand knocked Terry down during the game, the jury heard. When he got up, Terry made a gesture as if Ferdinand's breath smelled, and he called Ferdinand a ""c---,"" prosecutor Duncan Penny told the court. Ferdinand responded with the same word, saying it described Terry, not him, because Terry had had sex with a teammate's partner, the prosecutor said. Ferdinand also made an obscene gesture related to sex as Terry ran back into position, Penny said. Ferdinand testified that he did not hear the comments Terry made at him, but that he would have been ""hurt and disappointed"" if he had heard Terry call him a ""black c---"" ""When someone brings your color into it, it takes it to another level and it's very hurtful,"" Ferdinand said. Terry maintains that Ferdinand knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged ""normal football verbals."" He told Football Association officials that he then repeated to Ferdinand words he thought the opposing player had said to him, Penny told the court Monday. The maximum penalty for the offense is Â£2,500 (about $3,900). That would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions, but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or England's Football Association. Terry was captain of England's national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February. He remained captain of Chelsea, which went on to win the prestigious European Champions League this year. The trial could last up to five days, court officials say.","NEW: John Terry says he was angry because he thought Ferdinand had called him a racist .

"(CNN) -- Wikipedia once again is diving into Internet politics. The free encyclopedia on Tuesday temporarily shut down access to most of its Russian-language site in protest of proposed legal action in Russia that it says would result in Internet censorship. Visitors to ru.wikipedia.org on Tuesday saw a black censorship bar over the Wikipedia logo and a message asking them to imagine a world without free access to knowledge. In January, Wikipedia shuttered its English sites for 24 hours in protest of anti-piracy laws that were being discussed in the U.S. Congress. That action was cited as evidence of a new wave of political power for the technology and Internet industries. Google and others joined in that protest, which essentially derailed two anti-piracy bills in the United States. The Russian Wikipedia site compares proposed amendments to an ""On Information"" law to China's hyper-restrictive firewall. If implemented, the changes to the law could result in access to Wikipedia being cut off permanently, the group says. ""Lobbyists and activists who support the given amendments are claiming that they are directed exclusively against content like child pornography 'and the like,' but according to presented reports and statements, a prototype of 'The Great Firewall of China' will be created in Russia,"" Wikipedia says in a statement on its site, which was translated from Russian. ""The practice of implementing existing Russian laws suggests a high chance of a worse scenario, in which access to Wikipedia will be denied across the country. ""Given the precedent, there's a good chance access to Wikipedia will be denied across the country."" The bills, according to news reports, would allow the government to blacklist certain websites. The aim, the government says, is to protect Internet users from harmful content like child pornography and websites that promote substance abuse. ""The Russian bill currently under discussion in parliament seeks to introduce a non-governmental Internet watchdog, which would monitor the Web for potentially harmful content and request hosting companies to restrict access to the marked pages,"" reports RT.com, a Russian news site that receives government funding. ""If this is not done, the page would be blacklisted. The bill also has stricter provisions for parental guidance ratings for content."" The updates do not have universal support in the Russian government, the news site says. The country's information minister, for example, has ""voiced doubt"" about the changes, saying they would be difficult to enforce. Another Russian site, however, reports that the bill has broad support in the Duma, Russia's parliament. The state-owned news agency RIA Novosti elaborates on the bill's provisions: . ""According to the draft document, submitted to the State Duma on June 7, the unified roster of banned websites will be run by a federal agency to be appointed by the government,"" that news site says. ""The agency will have the right to add items to the blacklist, as will the courts, which already have the authority to ban extremist and other types of content that violates Russian legislation."" On Twitter, Russia's communications minister appeared to say the criticism from Wikipedia was healthy. ""I don't support Wiki's intentions to close,"" Nikolay Nikiforov wrote in a message translated from Russian. ""But this step is an important reaction of our society and a sign that we need to improve."" Wikipedia's political stance and temporary shutdown could be viewed by some as hypocritical. The digital encyclopedia, run by a nonprofit, is dedicated to the spread of free information. In January, however, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told CNN that it is the encyclopedia's role to stand up when free speech and Internet freedoms are threatened. ""Free speech includes the right to not speak,"" he said. ""We are a community of volunteers. We have written this thing that we believe to be a gift to the world. We don't charge people for it. It's freely available to anybody who wants to (use it). We are a charity. And I think it's important for people to realize that the ability of our community to come together and give this kind of gift to the world depends on a certain legal infrastructure that makes it possible for people to share knowledge freely.""","The Russian-language Wikipedia site shuts down in protest of a law .

"(CNN) -- Spain is to be offered an initial 30 billion euros (US$36.9 billion) to bail out its troubled banks following an emergency meeting of Eurozone finance ministers. The agreement followed nine hours of talks in Brussels that concluded early Tuesday. It was aimed at preventing Spain, the eurozone's fourth largest economy, from needing a full bailout itself. In June, European finance ministers agreed to set aside $150 billion to shore up the capital base of Spain's banks. Madrid was also given an extra year to meet its steep budget deficit target, according to Jean Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and the head of the Eurozone finance ministers group. Spain had been told to cut the difference between its income and spending to within 5.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2012. But it will now be given until 2014 instead of 2013 to cut its deficit to below 3% of GDP. Spain given extra time to cut deficit . ""We are aiming at reaching a formal agreement in the second half of July, taking into account national parliamentary procedure, allowing for a first disbursement of 30 billion euros by the end of the month to be mobilized as a contingency in case of urgent needs in the Spanish banking system,"" Juncker said in a statement to reporters after the meeting. The ministers from the 17-nation bloc met 10 days after their heads of government agreed to use its temporary bailout funds to recapitalize Spain's ailing financial system and to set up a joint supervisory body for the area's lenders. Under the terms of the deal, this supervisory body will oversee the eurozone's banks and use the single currency area's rescue funds, the European Financial Stability Facility or European Stability Mechanism, to aid banks directly without adding to governments' debt. However, the first cash injection will be filtered through Madrid's existing bailout fund. Audits commissioned by the Spanish government recently showed its banking sector -- beset by bad debt in the aftermath of the country's property market crash -- is likely to need 60 billion to 70 billion euros in extra cash to stay solvent. Meanwhile, Spanish and Italian borrowing costs continued to rise to unsustainable levels Monday, with Spain's 10-year bond topping the critical 7% level. CNN's Nina Dos Santos contributed to this report.","Euro ministers agree 30 billion euro (US$36.9 billion) bailout package for Spain's banks .

"(CNN) -- The major tunnel between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was scheduled to reopen at 5 p.m. ET Thursday following a shutdown because of a bomb threat, Windsor police said. Police ""fully inspected"" the tunnel before reopening it, Windsor authorities said. The bomb threat led to traffic backups as drivers on both sides of the border were rerouted. Employees at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel received an anonymous phone call around 12:30 p.m. from someone saying there was a bomb in the tunnel, Sgt. Matthew D'Asti with Windsor police told HLN. Authorities were working together on both sides of the border to investigate and search the tunnel for any possible device, D'Asti said. Neal Belitsky, president and CEO of Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, said the threat was called in to the Canadian side. Authorities treated the matter ""as a nonspecific, anonymous bomb threat,"" said D'Asti. The tunnel was evacuated. The tunnel is one of two international crossings between the cities of Windsor and Detroit. Traffic was being routed to the other, a bridge about two miles away. Approximately 27,000 to 29,000 vehicles pass daily through the tunnel, which opened in 1930. The Coast Guard said it set up a safety zone in the Detroit River in order to keep vessels away from the tunnel. CNN's Chandler Friedman, Devon Sayers and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Windsor police reopening ""fully inspected"" tunnel .

"(CNN) -- Moammar Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound is the heart of his nearly 42-year rule, a symbol of his defiance of the West. The sprawling complex houses modern government offices, the Bedouin tent in which Gadhafi received visitors and stands of palm trees. A bombed-out building remains as a monument to a 1986 U.S. airstrike that killed one of Gadhafi's daughters, along with a statue of a Libyan fist crushing an American jet. And Tuesday evening, after rebel fighters who have battled Gadhafi's forces for six months punched into the compound, it was wreathed in smoke. Rebels posed around the statue and fired hundreds if not thousands of rounds of ammunition into the air in celebration, spurring the occasional rebuke from senior fighters. The rebels picked through the compound in search of Libya's longtime strongman, but one fighter told CNN that neither Gadhafi nor any members of his family had been found. Bab al-Aziziya appeared to have been abandoned so quickly that a teakettle remained heating on a stove in one building, he said. ""They ran away, all of them,"" he said. ""They have gone underground."" Bab al-Aziziya, located near Tripoli's Mediterranean shore, is believed to be undergirded by a network of tunnels. Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, told CNN that at least one of the older buildings on the site was built atop a bunker four stories underground. But he said it was unlikely that Gadhafi had been in the complex before it was overrun Tuesday, since it had been targeted by repeated NATO airstrikes during the last few months of fighting. ""You have to remember that he is a military man,"" Saad said. ""He knows they have weapons that could penetrate those bunkers."" In addition, he said, the poor quality of the audio messages Gadhafi delivered on state television Sunday suggests Gadhafi ""is speaking from a distance."" CNN National Security Contributor Frances Townsend had what she called an ""absolutely bizarre experience"" meeting there with the eccentric Libyan leader in the summer of 2007, when she served as President George W. Bush's chief counterterrorism advisor. Townsend said she was required to ride to the compound in a car sent by Gadhafi, and the Libyans tried to separate her from her U.S. security detail, but one agent was able to jump into the car before it departed. Once through a series of checkpoints, Townsend said, the driver stopped in front of the bombed-out museum -- an echo of a U.S. raid in retaliation for the bombing of a Berlin disco that killed two American servicemen. She then waited in one of the many spacious rooms decorated in traditional Arab fashion, with couches lining the perimeter, for her audience with Gadhafi. The Libyan ruler's tent was surrounded by a field of knee-high grass, as well as both uniformed and plainclothes guards. Inside, it was filled with numerous rugs and couches. Other visitors say the compound includes a mosque, a library and the residences of other government officials. CNN's Sara Sidner, Thomas Evans and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","The Bab al-Aziziya compound includes Gadhafi's home and government offices .

"(CNN) -- The Bangladeshi government has called on Nobel laureate and microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus to retire from the bank he founded nearly three decades ago to help the poor, but he has said no. ""It's not possible, and if I withdraw myself from Grameen Bank, it'll collapse,"" Yunus said, according to Bangladeshi Finance Minister Abul Mal Abdul Muhith. Yunis, the target of three recent lawsuits, was not available to comment directly. Muhith told CNN on Tuesday that Yunis is too old to continue as managing director of the bank. ""Normally the retirement age of a bank's managing director in Bangladesh is 65, and professor Yunus is now 70,"" Muhith said, adding Yunus could continue as a director. Muhith said the move had no link to politics, but many analysts said Yunus was still under fire at home for criticizing politicians and trying to form a political party four years ago during an interim, unelected government that was backed by the military. That party was later abandoned. In the last few months, two criminal cases and a defamation suit were filed against Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize along with his Grameen Bank in 2006. The government formed a committee to probe into Grameen activities in January over charges by Norway of an unauthorized aid fund transfer. The Norwegian government cleared him of any wrongdoing last month. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused Yunus of playing a ""trick"" to evade taxes and charged last month that microlenders suck ""blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation."" The most recent of his lawsuits, filed Tuesday, is a fraud charge brought by a villager, who says bills for his mobile phone were inflated. Grameen Phone, a joint venture with Norwegian Telenor, is a leading phone company in the country. The defamation charge was brought against Yunus by a politician for his comments in a 4-year-old interview in which he reportedly criticized politicians and said they were only in ""power to make money."" He was also sued last month by the Dhaka City Corporation for producing ""substandard"" yogurt meant for the poor. The yogurt is produced by a joint venture between French food giant Danone and Yunus' Grameen Bank.","Grameen Bank founder refuses to step down .

"London (Financial Times) -- Samsung successfully fended off a legal move by Apple to block the sale of its tablet computers in the UK but only after suffering the indignity of a judge ruling that its Galaxy Tabs were ""not cool"" enough to be mistaken for iPads. Apple had claimed three models of the Galaxy Tab too closely resembled the design of the iPad. But Judge Colin Birss ruled that there were noticeable differences between the tablets in terms of their thickness and the designs on the back. ""They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design,"" the judge said of the Samsung gadgets. ""They are not as cool."" The ruling is the latest skirmish in a global patent battle that Apple has been waging since 2010 against companies like Samsung and HTC which produce tablet computers and mobile phones using Google's Android operating system. Such devices are the biggest commercial threat to Apple, and rivals have accused the US company of using its patents aggressively to disrupt their sales. Last month Apple persuaded a San Jose court to put a temporary block on sales of Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets in the US, pending a full court trial over patent claims at the end of July. Last week an appeals court lifted the ban on smartphone sales while upholding the block on sales of the tablet. Apple shipped 11.8m iPads during the first three months of the year, giving it a worldwide market share of 68 per cent, according to IDC, the technology research company. Samsung devices have started to gain traction, however, taking the South Korean company to second place in global market share in the first quarter. Despite the legal wrangling, Samsung reported record operating profits last week, largely on the back of sales of its Galaxy smartphones. The company has said it expects to have sold more than 10m units of its latest smartphone, the Galaxy SIII, by July. Apple has been given 21 days to appeal against the UK ruling. It said: ""It's no coincidence that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface and even the packaging. This kind of blatant copying is wrong and, as we've said many times before, we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas."" Samsung welcomed the ruling and said: ""Should Apple continue to make excessive legal claims in other countries based on such generic designs, innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited."" © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","UK judge rules Galaxy Tabs ""not cool"" enough to be mistaken for iPads .

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut group home employee has been put on administrative leave without pay after a video that appears to show her abusing a woman resident with an intellectual disorder was sent to the operators of the group home, the state and CNN affiliate WFSB. The video appears to show the caretaker at the group home kicking the woman in the gut, whipping her with a belt and kicking and dragging her across the floor by her hair. The DVD was titled ""The Perfect Employee"" and labeled as having been shot at an East Hartford group home. It was sent anonymously and came with no other details. Options Unlimited Inc., the privately held nonprofit that operates the home under contract with Connecticut's State Department of Developmental Services, said in a statement: ""We are deeply saddened and appalled by this incident. As soon as we became aware of it, we took prompt action and placed the employee on unpaid administrative leave."" Terrence W. Macy, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Developmental Services, said he was outraged by the video. ""Why would one human being do this to any other human being?"" he asked. ""This is a person who requires a lot of support, bathing and assistance eating,"" he told WFSB. WFSB's reporting went on to say that state officials have examined the other residents in the East Hartford group home but ""found no bruises or other signs of recent abuse."" Macy confirmed that the employee depicted is no longer working at the group home. ""This person was immediately put off duty with no pay and pending an investigation, which now will be conducted by the East Hartford Police,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Most of the Supreme Court justices piled up a lot frequent flyer miles in 2007, jetting to such exotic locales as Austria, India and Hawaii, according to financial disclosure reports released Friday. The U.S. Supreme Court justices at a shoot for their 2006 ""class photo."" And they generally have a good bit of spending money for their travels, based on reported investment income. The records, which were released Friday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, confirm what has been known for some time: that most of the justices are relatively well-off financially. The eight associate justices make $208,100 in annual wages plus income from a variety of resources. Federal judges are not required to publicly release exact income figures, just a general range. The wealthiest justice may be David Souter, with a wise investment he made years ago in a Vermont bank paying off handsomely. His assets in Chittenden Corp. are valued from $5 million to $25 million. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's asset totals are boosted by the fact that her husband, Martin, is a respected private tax attorney in Washington. Justices Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia are also millionaires. Justice Samuel Alito, the newest member of the high court, also reported income ranging from $700,000 to $2 million. In the area of reported gifts, Alito cited about $500 in ""Italian food and wine"" given to him by a friend, about whom the justice helpfully noted it ""is not likely that he will appear before this court."" The latest financial records continue to show Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas reporting assets under $1 million, not including homes and judicial salaries. Thomas received a one-time boost to his income when his best-selling memoir was released in October. He received the remaining half of a reported million-dollar book advance and traveled extensively on a book promotion and signing tour. Scalia also received an advance for his book on how to be a better appellate lawyer. The amount was relatively paltry compared to his colleague's: $33,000. The annual records show that Breyer, Ginsburg, Kennedy and Scalia were the busiest travelers. Each made multiple visits overseas to teach, give speeches or attend judicial seminars. Airfare, lodging and meals were generally paid for by the organizations that invited the justices, but under federal law, they must report it. Europe was a favorite destination for several justices. Breyer reported 21 out-of-town trips for which he was reimbursed, including to Paris, France; Rome, Italy; New Delhi, India; and Palm Springs, California. Ginsburg went overseas to France, Belgium, Ireland and Canada and made at least nine other domestic trips. In the same week in July, Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts were in France and Austria, respectively. But the Most Traveled Award goes to Scalia, who made 33 expense-paid trips, including eight overseas, and visited at least 17 states. Only Souter and Stevens reported no trips for which they were reimbursed by sponsoring groups. Souter also reported no outside teaching gigs, trustee or board memberships, or any gifts received. The 68-year-old bachelor generally spends his extended time away from the high court at his isolated farm in rural New Hampshire. Chief Justice John Roberts may have the most diverse investment portfolio. He recorded 63 investments and trusts, including stock in Time Warner (parent company of CNN), Citicorp, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. The estimated value is from about $2.4 million to more than $6 million. Before becoming a federal judge, Roberts was a high-paid Washington lawyer. His judicial salary is $217,400. Roberts, 53, continued to sell off small amounts of common stock, including in Cisco and Citigroup. When he took over as chief justice in 2005, he was forced to sell stock in several companies. A bill passed two years ago in Congress allows federal judges to defer paying capital gains taxes on securities they sell to avoid conflicts of interest. High-level executive branch employees had enjoyed that privilege for years. The issue of judges holding such diverse investment portfolios has resulted in several conflicts of interest, prompting calls for reform. The high court last month refused to accept an appeal from a group of South Africans seeking to sue U.S. and foreign firms for allegedly helping keep the white-led apartheid government of their country in power for decades. Four members of the high court were forced to remove themselves from consideration of the cases. No reason was given for their recusal, but financial disclosure reports showed that Roberts, along with Breyer and Alito, owns stock in several of the companies being sued. Kennedy's son Gregory is a top manager in one, investment bank Credit Suisse. Under federal rules, at least six justices must hear a case that is accepted for review. With four of the nine recused, the high court had no choice but to uphold the lower court ruling, tossing out the lawsuit. Some reform advocates say that judges should be allowed to own only mutual funds instead of individual stocks. Mutual funds involve a range of investments whose identities are disclosed to the fund's shareholders several times each year. Federal law allows judges to own mutual funds without having to recuse themselves from a particular appeal.","Reports show David Souter may be the wealthiest member of Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- Fired Florida lifeguard Tomas Lopez was honored with the key to the city Monday and got a chance to meet the man whose life he saved. Lopez made national news last week when he was fired for leaving his post so he could save a swimmer outside his coverage zone at Hallandale Beach. ""It is a big honor. I don't believe I deserve the key in general. All our guards would have done this,"" Lopez told the crowd assembled at Hallandale Beach City Hall on Monday, according to CNN affiliate WFOR. ""All I did was what I was supposed to do."" The incident occurred July 2 at the beach on Florida's Atlantic coast, north of Miami. A beachgoer rushed to Lopez's lifeguard station to alert him to a man who was drowning. Lifeguard offered his job back, turns it down . Company policy said lifeguards cannot go beyond the perimeter of the beach they are responsible for overseeing. The man was some 1,500 feet outside the zone, in an area where signs warn visitors to swim at their own risk. Even though he was violating policy, Lopez ran into the ocean toward the struggling man and pulled him ashore. ""At that point I knew I was going to be fired. I knew I had broken the rule,"" Lopez told CNN. ""In those cases, we are supposed to call 911 and hope they get there in time."" The company fired him shortly afterward. At the ceremony Monday, Lopez met the man he saved. ""I would like to say a big thanks to this man. He saved my life,"" said Maksim Samartsev, 21, shaking Lopez's hand and smiling. Jeff Ellis Management, the company that fired Lopez, later offered him his position back. ""Clearly, he should not have been terminated for what had occurred,"" Jeff Ellis said last week. ""I know that he has tried to do the right thing."" Lopez told CNN he does not plan to return to work at his $8.25-an-hour job that he started four months ago. ""It's another chapter in my life closed, and I am just going to continue to get my schooling finished and get on with my career,"" Lopez said. Meanwhile, Jeff Ellis Management announced Monday that it will no longer be providing lifeguard service for Hallandale Beach after the controversy. The company had provided the service for nine years. ""I take full responsibility for how this situation was handled by our company,"" Ellis said in a written statement. ""I can't change what happened, but when we took this job I promised accountability. I am taking this action to fulfill my promise."" What your lifeguard won't tell you .

"(CNN) -- Florida election officials will have access to a federal law enforcement database to challenge the eligibility of a person to vote as part of its effort to purge non-citizens from its voting rolls, state officials said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security will allow state officials access to the SAVE -- Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements -- database in an agreement that was announced Saturday by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner and the Florida Department of State. The announcement follows weeks of legal wrangling between the federal and state officials, a fight being closely watched in Colorado, Nevada, Michigan and North Carolina -- states that could ultimately swing November's presidential election -- where officials are advocating for similar access. ""Florida voters are counting on their state and federal governments to cooperate in a way that ensures elections are fair, beginning with ensuring the voter rolls are current and accurate,"" Detzner said in a statement. ""Now, we have a commitment to cooperate from DHS and we look forward to a partnership that improves our election process."" Details of the agreement were not immediately available, and it was not clear when Florida would begin checking its voter rolls against the database, which lists those who are legally in the United States on either visas or ""green cards"" but not eligible to vote. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond late Saturday to a CNN request for comment. The SAVE database, which contains alien registration numbers, is a web-based service that was created to help ""federal, state and local benefit-issuing agencies, institutions, and licensing bureaus determine the immigration status of benefit applicants so only those entitled to benefits receive them,"" according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Florida officials sued last month to gain access to the database after an effort this year to purge the state voting rolls -- using driver licenses and birth dates -- went awry because of faulty state records. A Florida Department of State spokesman, Chris Cate, told CNN in June that the state identified roughly 100 people who are not citizens but registered to vote. CNN found, though, that some of the names on the potential purge list were, in fact, legitimate voters -- newly minted Americans recently granted citizenship. DHS and Florida struck a deal over the database just weeks after a federal judge rejected a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit aimed at preventing Florida from moving forward with a voter registration purge. Proponents of the plan say purging the rolls protects the integrity of the voting process, while critics say it targets the poor and minority voters who may be disenfranchised by the process. The poor, voting and civil rights groups say, can not afford to pay for documentation that may be required, while minorities would likely be among the groups whose voter registration records are examined. A number of states are moving to institute and tighten voter identification laws, and many are finding themselves in direct conflict with the federal government. A key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 grants the federal government open-ended oversight of states and localities -- many in the South -- with a history of voter discrimination. Any changes in voting laws and procedures in those pre-determined areas must be ""pre-cleared"" by Washington. Today, 32 states have in place varying degrees of voter identification laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the states with the most stringent requirements are also regions that have seen large increases in their minority population. Florida has the nation's third largest Hispanic population, behind Texas and California.

"(CNN) -- North Korea defended Thursday its right to explore outer space after reports that a rocket, believed by the United States to be a long-range missile, had been positioned on its launch pad. Replicas of South and North Korean missiles are displayed at the Korea War Memorial in Seoul. North Korea recently informed a pair of U.N. agencies that it plans to launch a satellite. The launch is believed to be slated for sometime between April 4 to 8, according to Yonhap, South Korea's state-sponsored news agency. North Korea's announcement has triggered international consternation. U.S. and South Korean officials have long said the North is actually preparing to test-fire a long-range missile under the guise of a satellite launch. Pyongyang lashed out against critics on Thursday in a commentary reported in the state-run KCNA news service. ""This is nothing but a groundless outcry of the political philistines ignorant of any legality of the study of space science for peaceful purposes,"" the commentary said. ""Outer space is not a monopoly of a few specified powers but an asset common to mankind and the space development is promoted worldwide at present."" Should anyone have the right to explore space? The United States has no plans to shoot down the North Korean rocket, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday in an interview with CNN's Jill Dougherty, but will raise the issue with the U.N. Security Council if Pyongyang carries out a launch. ""We are doing our best to dissuade the North Koreans from going forward, because it is provocative action,"" Clinton said. ""It raises questions about their compliance with the Security Council Resolution 1718. And if they persist and go forward, we will take it up in appropriate channels."" North Korea is technically capable of launching a rocket in as little as two to four days, according to Kim Taewoo, an expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, but who doubts a launch will come that soon. It would not make sense for Pyongyang to make such a move after going through official channels with its plans, Kim said. ""The North could delay the launch if they experience problems with the weather, or within the leadership, but I don't see any reason why they would fire it ahead of time,"" Kim said. What the North Koreans would be testing may not be known until an actual launch, U.S. officials have said. A U.N. Security Council resolution in 2006 banned North Korea from conducting ballistic missile activity. Japanese officials said they could shoot down the object whether it is a missile or a satellite. ""As the U.N. resolutions prohibit (North Korea) from engaging in ballistic missile activities, we still consider it to be a violation of a technical aspect, even if (the North) claims it is a satellite. We will discuss the matter with related countries based on this view,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said this month. South Korea echoed Clinton's statements. ""The South Korean government believes that if the North conducts its launch despite continuous warnings of the South Korean government and the international community, it is a provocative action that constitutes a serious threat to the security of northeast Asia and the Korean peninsula,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Moon Tae-Young. ""The launching of the long-range rocket is a clear violation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1718, and we strongly urge North Korea to immediately stop such measures."" The North Korean Taepodong-2 missile is thought to have an intended range of about 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles) that -- if true -- could strike Alaska or Hawaii. -- CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report.","N.

"Paris (CNN) -- A French cyclist taking part in the prestigious Tour de France race has been arrested, a national police official said Tuesday, leading his team to suspend him while claims of doping are investigated. Cofidis, a professional cycling team, said its cyclist Remy di Gregorio ""had allegedly attempted to resort to the use of doping substances to improve his performance"" and therefore it was suspending him as a precaution. Di Gregorio, 26, is being questioned in police custody but has not been charged, according to the national police official who has been briefed in detail on the matter. Police raided the hotel where some members of the Cofidis team were staying in Bourg-en-Bresse, in eastern France, Tuesday morning, he said. Two other people were detained in Di Gregorio's hometown of Marseille in connection with the ongoing investigation, the police official said. Judge tosses out Armstrong suit against anti-doping agency . The office of the Marseille prosecutor, Jacques Dallest, said in a statement that an investigation into the use of illegal substances had been opened against ""a professional cyclist"" as well as person ""practicing naturopathy."" One of the people involved was carrying, in a vehicle, products of which the exact nature is still being determined, the statement said. If proven, the crime carries a maximum penalty of seven years of imprisonment and a fine of â‚¬150,000 ($184,000). Cofidis manager Yvon Sanquer told CNN: ""In France, there is the presumption of innocence, so until proven guilty, we cannot say he (Di Gregorio) is guilty."" Cofidis said in a written statement that it had ""very little information"" at present, but that the suspicions weighing against Di Gregorio ""lead us to apply the current sanctions in a strict and immediate manner in our team, concerning the violation of ethical rules."" ""Remy di Gregorio is therefore suspended, from now, as a precaution, as we wait for more ample information concerning the reality of the crimes of which he is accused. If these crimes are established, he will be dismissed immediately as per the terms of his contract and the ethical policy of the team."" Cofidis said what it called an ""isolated case"" should not affect the rest of the team and that its other riders would be ready to start the next stage Wednesday as planned. The team has had a long-standing commitment to fighting doping and will be reinforcing its prevention efforts, the statement said. ""Those who cheat do not have a place at Cofidis,"" it added. The investigating judge in the case is Annaick Le Goff, who is a judge for the health division, the national police official said. Tuesday's arrest was made in a joint operation with the division of public health of the Marseille Gendarmerie, he added. Di Gregorio is currently ranked 35 out of 178 competitors, according to the Tour de France website, trailing British cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who holds the lead by just over 18 minutes ahead of Wednesday's resumption of the competition. Tuesday was the first rest day for the riders taking part in the world's best-known cycling race, which began June 30. In the course of the race, which consists of a short time trial prologue followed by 20 longer stages, the cyclists will cover 3,497 kilometers (2,173 miles), including grueling mountain climbs, before they cross the finish line in Paris on July 22. Di Gregorio joined the Cofidis team this year, having previously competed with the Astana professional cycling team, which is backed by Kazakhstan. He came in 78th in the Tour de France in 2010 and 59th in 2008, and has won three stages in the eight years he's been competing in the race. Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador was part of the Astana team when he won the Tour de France in 2010. Later, after he failed a drug test, he was stripped of the title and banned from competing for two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The issue of alleged doping in professional cycling was thrust into the spotlight last month, when the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency accused U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong, who denies the allegations, faces a lifetime ban and could be stripped of his seven Tour de France victories if found guilty by the USADA. He won the Tour each year from 1999 to 2005. A lawsuit filed by Armstrong which sought to halt the USADA's legal case against him was thrown out by a federal judge Monday.

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno wrote a letter before his death saying the sex abuse scandal involving his assistant coach was ""not a football scandal."" Read the full text of the letter . His family authenticated the letter, written late last year, after it emerged Wednesday. ""This is not a football scandal and should not be treated as one,"" wrote Paterno, who died in January. ""It is not an academic scandal and does not in any way tarnish the hard-earned and well-deserved academic reputation of Penn State."" Anticipation builds ahead of Sandusky report . Family spokeswoman Mara Vandlik said the letter was intended to be published as a guest editorial, but that never happened, and it was probably released by one of the former players who had received a copy. Former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted last month for sexually abusing young boys over a 15-year period. Joe Paterno, a flawed hero? Paterno and former Penn State President Graham Spanier were fired after the Sandusky scandal broke in November. The findings of an internal review into the sex scandal are scheduled to be released Thursday. The lengthy report is expected to focus on school officials, what they knew about Sandusky's behavior and whether they tried to cover it up. Despite scandal, Penn State draws $208.7 million in donations .

"(CNN) -- Security at the G-20 summit in London, England, is tight as protesters fill the streets. CNN anchor Kiran Chetry spoke Wednesday with Frances Townsend, who was Homeland Security adviser under the Bush administration, about the security. Townsend now is a national security contributor on CNN. CNN national security contributor Frances Townsend says  police have three objectives in terms of G-20 security. Kiran Chetry, CNN anchor: Thanks for being with us this morning. And as we look at those pictures, it's very interesting to hear what police officers are saying, because usually they try to downplay these types of events, right? And say things like, it's under control, they're keeping things calm. In this case, they're calling it almost an unprecedented level of activity and something that really took them. They called it one of the most challenging and complicated public order operations that Scotland Yard has ever devised. What are they looking at today as they try to make sure that these protests maintain a peaceful nature? Frances Townsend, CNN national security contributor: Well, there's no question, Kiran, that it is unprecedented in London. But remember, going back several years ago to the G-8 summit in Genoa where Italian police confronted protesters, it turned violent. There was an investigation about the use of force by police. The police were ultimately cleared there. But after that, all the G-20 countries looked at how they handle civil disobedience and protest.  Watch more about the protests » . I don't think there's -- other than American authorities, I can't think of anybody better prepared than Scotland Yard to deal with this sort of level of interest and involvement by protesters. The key here is to keep everybody safe and for it not to turn violent, for nobody to get hurt, none of the dignitaries and none of the protesters. And I think what the British police, Scotland Yard, are trying to signal to folks is, this is complicated. They take it seriously, but the idea is to let world leaders get together, have their discussions without the distraction of violent protests. And I think the British are likely very well prepared to deal with this. Chetry: We're looking at these pictures, Fran. We've seen the crowds grow actually just in the past hour or two. And at one point, protesters pushed against these police barricades that were set up outside of the Bank of England, shouting things like ""abolish money."" They've arrested six people so far, but how do they -- I mean, I know they planned for this, but as the crowds start to swell, what are the biggest challenges and how do you protect the public? Townsend: Well, Kiran, what you saw when these crowds began to surge was the police, the Scotland Yard police officers linked arms, which is a common technique. They train for this. And they train for crowd surge. The idea is they have three primary objectives in any major protest. One, protect the dignitaries, the safety of the dignitaries. Two, keep transportation routes open so the dignitaries can get their business done. And third, what you're seeing now is, allow peaceful protests, and do everything you can to prevent them from turning violent. They're right to worry about that. Remember when Prime Minister Tony Blair hosted the G-8, you had the terrorist attacks on the train bombing in London, which was very disruptive. So what they're looking for is, in these crowds of peaceful protesters, is there someone -- are those in those crowds that would take, look to take advantage to disrupt it, a terrorist attack and that sort of thing? So I think the London police are right to worry about this, but they've got thousands of police officers to try and control the surging crowds. And this will be their challenge today, to allow the leaders to be safe, conduct their business, but to permit peaceful protests that don't turn violent. Chetry: Right ... You spoke about just how orderly and prepared Scotland Yard is. You gave them major kudos for the fact that they really did put together a really challenging and complicated public order/operation here to make sure things did not get out of hand. What do you see as we're watching these pictures and we're seeing the protests grow as their biggest challenge today, Fran? Townsend: Well, as I said, Kiran, three objectives. Remember, they've got to protect the dignitaries. Two, they've got to keep transportation routes open so the dignitaries can get back and forth and conduct their business. And third is to allow these peaceful protests to continue without turning violent. And one of the ways you do that is with an overwhelming presence. [CNN anchor} T.J. [Holmes] mentioned mobilizing 10,000 police officers. That's the way. That's an overwhelming presence, and what you do is you allow them the freedom to speak and to protest, but you're protecting them at the same time and not letting it get out of hand. It looks, you know, it's good weather. It's a nice day in London. It's a pretty afternoon. And as long as they've got the ability to muster the protesters around the Bank of England, it should remain pretty peaceful, and leaders can get their business conducted safely. Chetry: Fran Townsend, thanks so much.","CNN national security contributor talks about police presence at G-20 summit .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- It was a Republican, Richard Nixon, who laid out the blueprint for getting elected president: In the primary, you court the extremes to please the party's base; in the general election, you race to the center to get as many votes as possible. But nowadays, candidates in both parties tend to follow it. Many voters have probably become used to the idea that candidates go through this moderate makeover. This year, however, there is a twist. Only one of the major candidates is in the center, and it's not the Republican. The candidate on the right is staying put, well, on the right. When Mitt Romney spoke Wednesday to the annual conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee did not sugarcoat his opposition to President Obama's policies, especially the president's health-care overhaul, which Romney promised to eliminate along with ""every non-essential, expensive program"" he could find. That pledge was met with a loud chorus of boos that lasted more than 10 seconds. Still, Romney didn't back down. He deserves credit for addressing a group that is so heavily invested in Obama, and even more credit for not turning himself inside out to be liked. He also maintained his composure a few weeks ago when he addressed the annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Romney didn't apologize for taking a hard-line against illegal immigration during the Republican primary to the point of portraying illegal immigrants as takers who hurt the economy and drain social services. Nor did he say he was wrong for opposing the DREAM Act, which would have given legal status to undocumented immigrants who go to college or join the military. In my opinion, Romney should have said those things. He has a lot for which to apologize. But he didn't. After the NAACP speech, one Romney adviser privately told a reporter for the New York Times that Romney has presented basically the same agenda to every audience throughout the campaign, and he commended the candidate for not backing away from positions that the audience was likely to find unpopular, like repealing Obamacare. Political observers can argue over why they think this is happening. Maybe Romney only knows how to give one generic speech. Maybe he's not comfortable pandering to special interest groups, especially those with an ethnic or racial agenda. From other things I've read, I think that Romney and his campaign advisers are terrified of him being labeled a ""flip-flopper"" and that this dissuades them from making any sharp turns or dramatic course corrections. More than anything, they want to do something that Romney has had trouble doing in the past: appear steady and consistent. Meanwhile, President Obama has had liberal supporters scratch their heads as he claimed for his own a series of conservative positions that they oppose. This is not simply an election year gimmick. It has been going on for sometime. In fact, if you ignore what Obama says and focus only on what he does, you'll see that Obama has actually spent most of his presidency in the center, even, on some issues, following the example of his predecessor. While neither liberals nor conservatives are eager to admit it, they can no longer deny it: Americans are living through George W. Bush's third term. Obama loves to criticize the 43rd president, almost as much as he loves to emulate him. In the war on terror, aspects of foreign policy, education reform, immigration, corporate bailouts and a host of other issues with the exception of health care reform, Obama has taken up the sorts of positions that conservatives usually champion. And the left has noticed, which is why the president now and then gets blowback from parts of the same liberal coalition that helped elect him. They must wonder what happened to the person they helped put in office, and many of these disillusioned liberals now talk about voting for Obama as the ""lesser of two evils."" The president's decision this week to extend the Bush tax cuts for incomes under $250,000 is just the latest example of the president taking his cues from the former president that liberals love to hate. (True, Obama is campaigning against the part of the Bush tax cuts that applied to income above $250,000.) We'll soon know which of these strategies proves more successful in garnering votes: moving to the center, or staying the course. There are advantages and liabilities to each. Of course, what would really be nice and refreshing, is, if just once, someone running for president on a major party ticket took positions not to manipulate the outcome of an election but because he believed they were the correct positions to take. Maybe Obama and Romney are doing that. Maybe what we're hearing is what they really believe. It's hard to tell. And even harder to believe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Navarrette: Presidential candidates typically move to the center after primaries .

"Editor's note: Wayne LaPierre has served as the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association of America since 1991. His latest book is ""The Global War on Your Guns: Inside the U.N. Plan to Destroy the Bill of Rights."" Wayne LaPierre says the Mexican drug war isn't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the U.S. (CNN) -- Here's a summary for the time- or attention-challenged: Never surrender freedom for laws that can't affect criminals; they disobey laws for a living. Nobody is surprised that Attorney General Eric Holder wants to make good on his promise to ban guns. We just didn't know whose tragedy he'd seize to advance his agenda. Now we do. It's the drug-driven death and violence in Mexico at the hands of ruthless criminal cartels. Barely a month on the job, Holder cited the Mexican cartel killings as the excuse to resurrect the Clinton gun ban. Though a new face to some, Holder is a rabid Second Amendment foe from the Clinton administration who helped orchestrate the 1994 Clinton gun ban. America has made this mistake already. So let's learn the lies that led to their gun ban. Even earthworms learn from experience . Ask any anti-gun politician to define an ""assault weapon,"" and the honest answer is, ""I know one when I see one."" When cosmetics alone can infringe constitutional freedoms, we're all in trouble. But that's precisely how the 1994 gun ban came about. The gun-ban lobby and national media lied with lockstep conformity by playing endless footage of fully automatic machine gun fire. They fooled the American people and the U.S. Congress into thinking they were banning ""high-powered,"" ""rapid-fire,"" ""battlefield-bred"" guns designed to ""spray fire from the hip."" None of that was true. Then Sen. Dianne Feinstein convened anti-gun bureaucrats to conduct a firearm beauty pageant. They browsed photos of hundreds of perfectly legal semiautomatic rifles. They picked 19 they deemed most military looking. And they banned them. But the guns aren't designed or used by the military. They're commonly owned semiautomatic rifles that fire one shot when the trigger is pulled. They cannot ""spray fire,"" nor are they designed to be fired ""from the hip."" Nor are they the choice of terrorists in Afghanistan or drug gangs in Mexico. They prefer fully automatic machine guns, which our soldiers use. Congress was so doubtful about the ban's effectiveness, they limited it to a 10-year experiment. So it expired in 2004, and for good reason. It was useless all along. As the study mandated by that Congress found, ""The banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders"" in the first place. The ban had absolutely no effect on gun crime. But what about Mexico? Of course, everyone's rooting for Mexican President Felipe Calderon's government to crush the drug cartels' stranglehold. But our rights are not what's wrong. Nobody can substantiate claims that U.S. guns cross the border ""by the thousands"" or ""account for 95% of weapons used by Mexican drug gangs."" Because it's not true. Replying to Feinstein in subcommittee hearings last week, William Hoover, assistant director of field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said, ""The investigations we have, that we see, for firearms flowing across the border don't show us individuals taking thousands of guns a day or at a time flowing into Mexico."" Yet reporter after politician after news anchor parrot the lie as readily as high schoolers gossip, and with equal disregard for truth. That's how gun abolitionists claim Mexican gun laws are so strict that our ""weak laws"" (read: freedoms) are to blame for ""fueling the violence"" in Mexico. Well, to believe that: . • You have to believe these butchers and beheaders break every Mexican law they want except Mexican gun laws, which they honor -- while they break America gun laws. • You have to believe that Mexico's drug cartels, which possess the wealth and armies of nations, prefer American semiauto target and hunting rifles over fully automatic machine guns and any other military arms they want to crush opposition. • You have to believe Mexican drug lords -- who make Forbes magazine's list of billionaires -- don't get large lots of weaponry on the transnational black market but instead choose to trifle with paperwork at U.S. gun stores. • You have to believe that narco-terrorists who buy fragmentation grenades, grenade launchers, explosives, body armor, biometric security equipment, infrared surveillance technology and intelligence-grade reconnaissance gear will salute and obey a new American gun law -- if only we'd pass one. Get real, get tough, but get away from our rights . Everything Mexico's murderous thugs are doing is already illegal. At issue is not the absence of law, but the absence of political will to enforce the laws that both nations already possess. Even Immigration and Customs Enforcement said, ""We have the laws we need. We just need to more effectively enforce them."" Those that make possible Mexico's colossal corruption wear the garb of not only drug lords and gun runners, but also of too many city mayors and police chiefs, state bureaucrats and military officers. A $40 billion criminal enterprise could not exist without the complicity of these powerful co-conspirators. And these cartels are being abetted by American media and politicians who blame our freedoms for it. We should seal the border. Punish the guilty. And use existing gun and drug laws against violent drug syndicates here and in Mexico. But leave American freedoms alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wayne LaPierre.","Wayne LaPierre: Effort under way to reinstate Clinton-era gun ban .

"Editor's note: Frances Fragos Townsend, a CNN contributor on national security issues, served as President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. Townsend has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations. Townsend is currently a consultant to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Program. Frances Townsend says the priority for the White House must be protecting the American people. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Washington Post recently reported that Gen. Jim Jones, President Obama's national security adviser, is reviewing plans to reorganize the White House National Security and Homeland Security councils. Some, if not all, of the functions of the Homeland Security Council may be folded into an expanded National Security Council. There is no more solemn responsibility that the president bears than to protect American lives. During my 4½ years at the White House, I came to believe that, for this reason, organization must be dictated by effectiveness. How best to maximize effectiveness will inevitably change over time as we as a country continue to weaken al Qaeda and other enemies, as the Department of Homeland Security gains strength, and as our government better integrates the capabilities that have been built since the tragedy of September 11. As the Obama administration considers the most effective means of organizing the White House structure, I respectfully submit that any structure should be judged against three fundamental criteria. First, there must be a single person both responsible and accountable to the president who monitors threat information and who has the authority to marshal all instruments of national power (military, intelligence, law enforcement, economic, diplomatic and public diplomacy) to defeat the threat. This individual cannot wait until threats arrive on our shores, but must have the responsibility and the means to identify those threats where they originate and to ensure a coordinated response to them. The president's homeland security adviser must not be constrained by geographic boundaries that our enemies do not respect. Second, the homeland security adviser must have direct and immediate access to the president. Ultimately, if terrorists successfully strike the United States, it is the president, and not his staff, who will be accountable to the American people for the failure. The homeland security adviser must be able to get to the president quickly without clearance from his or her colleagues on the White House staff. Unfortunately, there will be times when American lives are at stake and the president will need to be advised and operational decisions taken and communicated to the relevant Cabinet secretary in real time. These sorts of crises do not lend themselves to the normal bureaucratic process. Third, the homeland security issues faced by our government are diverse and many. They range from preparedness and response to natural disasters (ice, flooding, fires and wind) to pandemic planning and biological and nuclear threats. These issues are often distinct from the more traditional foreign policy issues faced by the National Security Council and require experienced staff with significant expertise. The staff must understand state and local emergency management policy issues and concerns. They must be organized, not simply to facilitate the homeland security policy process, but also to anticipate and respond to state and local political leaders in a time of crisis. The homeland security adviser requires adequate staffing to deal with the counterterrorism and homeland security issues. We remain a nation at war with a very determined enemy. We have troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the national security adviser has many important responsibilities in addition to those two theaters. For example, he must contend with the Middle East peace process and counter proliferation around the world, but most especially in Iran and North Korea. I worry that increasing the span of control of the national security adviser could dilute the homeland security mission and make it just one more item on a list already overburdened. That said, I wish to be clear. We should judge any reorganization by the substance and criteria that I have suggested above. We must be careful not to assume that a merger means the president cares less about homeland security. We must resist this easy organizational chart test and look to the substance of how responsibilities are allocated and how we are being protected. Let me suggest three questions the administration should ask before deciding on a new White House structure: (1) Is there one person responsible and accountable to the president who looks around the world at threats and advises the president? (2) Does this one person have direct and immediate access to the president? and (3) Does this person have adequate staff to fulfill his or her responsibilities? These are the questions that we should be asking and the criteria against which we should judge the effort. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frances Townsend.","Fran Townsend: White House's top goal must be protecting American people .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese authorities have bowed to pressure to investigate the death of a high-profile dissident who had spent more than 20 years in jail for his support of the Tiananmen Square protests, Hong Kong media reported. Hunan's provincial public security bureau has asked forensic investigators from outside the province to carry out an autopsy on Li Wangyang, a spokesperson for the bureau said, according to Hong Kong China News Agency. Criminal specialists would also be called in, and the findings will be promptly made public, the spokesperson said, adding that the concerns of foreign media and other people were noted, according to the report. Li was found on June 6 hanging in his room at the Daxiang District People's Hospital in Shaoyang, Hunan province. Police said he had committed suicide -- a claim friends of the deaf and blind labor rights activist have described as ""insulting"" and ""ridiculous."" Anger, suspicion over Chinese activist's 'suicide' It is not clear how an autopsy would be conducted, since Li was reportedly cremated on June 9 amid calls for an investigation, according to the South China Morning Post and Kyodo News, which cited friends and a human rights watchdog. The circumstances surrounding his death have led to demonstrations against Beijing in Hong Kong, a Chinese special administrative region where two of its leading political figures have weighed in on the controversy. Rita Fan, a member of the Chinese National People's Congress standing committee, said she had written to the central government in Beijing to convey growing concerns in Hong Kong about the circumstances surrounding Li's death. ""After seeing the response from the local government [in Hunan], I think I needed to do something,"" the South China Morning Post quoted her as saying Thursday. ""There are many suspicions."" In a rare comment, outgoing Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang said he ""understood the views of the Hong Kong public,"" according to the paper. Earlier this week, Hong Kong's secretary for food and health, said in an interview with CNN affiliate i-CABLE News that the weak physical condition of Li made it hard to believe the hospital authorities' claim that he had committed suicide. ""It seems that his character and personality are not of a person who is suicidal and are not of a person who would not have left a suicide note,"" Dr. York Chow said. Read more about what Chow had to say about Li's death . The upcoming visit in early July by Chinese President Hu Jintao to mark the 15th anniversary of Great Britain's handover of Hong Kong, which enjoys greater freedoms than the mainland, is expected to further fuel emotions. Li's death came two days after the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre. Li, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for mobilizing local workers in support of the student democracy movement, would have been under 24-hour watch because of the sensitive nature of the anniversary, his supporters and human rights groups point out. On Wednesday, Amnesty International appealed in an open letter to China to investigate Li's death and protect his relatives and friends after four of them, including a sister and her husband, were detained. Others were put under police surveillance and unreachable, the group said. After serving most of his initial sentence, Li -- by then rendered nearly deaf and blind, allegedly by torture during his imprisonment -- was sentenced to another 10-year prison sentence in 2001 for ""inciting subversion of state power."" He was admitted to the hospital shortly after being released last year. In interviews by friends who had visited him before his death, Li did not appear to be someone who intended to kill himself. Both Amnesty and another group, Human Rights in China, cite relatives' accounts that Li's feet were still on the ground, and that being blind and unable to walk unaccompanied, he would have been hard pressed to find a noose. Appeals by the family for an autopsy in the presence of a lawyer of their choice were refused, and his body taken away, according to Amnesty. In an interview with iCable just before his death, Li said, ""I was just sentenced to jail and am not yet beheaded. Even if I were beheaded, I would not regret it. For democracy and the survival of the country, ordinary man should take responsibility."" Li is among more than two-dozen Chinese political prisoners named in the U.S. State Department's country report on China's Human Rights Practices for 2011. More than 12,000 people have signed a petition calling for an investigation into Li's alleged suicide, according to Wen Yunchao, a Hong Kong-based journalist who drafted the document. Most are from Hong Kong, but the second highest number are from mainland China, followed by the United States and Canada, he said in an email to CNN. Lee Cheuk-yan, a Hong Kong legislator and pro-democracy activist, said that his group, the Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, plan more protests when Hu visits. ""Our aim is to let him know Hong Kong's sentiments, anger and demand for justice,"" he said in a phone call. Lee also called Tsang and Fan's statements cosmetic. ""From our point of view, they are not helpful in making the case known to Hu Jintao,"" he said. Meanwhile, Chinese human rights activists, including Hu Jia, have taken pre-emptive action, declaring online that they ""will not commit suicide.""

"(CNN) -- British businessman Charles Green has agreed a deal to take over Scottish Premier League side Glasgow Rangers, the club's administrators said on Sunday. The former Sheffield United chief executive is leading a global consortium made up of 20 investors from the Middle East, Asia and the Far East. ""We are very pleased to announce that we have accepted an offer from a consortium headed by Mr. Charles Green for the purchase of Rangers,"" said David Whitehouse of administrators Duff and Phelps. ""Mr. Green has secured, via a substantial financial commitment, a period of exclusivity to complete the purchase of the club and this is expected to be finalized at a creditors' meeting on June 6."" Neither Rangers, who have been Scottish champions 54 times, nor the administrators disclosed financial details of the offer from Green's consortium, but reportedly the deal is worth £$13.6 million. ""Mr. Green, through a corporate vehicle, has entered into a binding commitment to inject funds into the Rangers Football Club plc so that the administrators can propose a Company Voluntary Arrangement which, if approved by creditors, will result in their claims being compromised for specific amounts and the company exiting administration free of the historic debt and with new owners. ""If the creditors do not approve the Company Voluntary Arrangement, the agreement obliges Charles Green's purchasing vehicle to acquire the business and assets of the club on agreed terms, through a newco structure. It is Mr. Green's strong preference to achieve a CVA."" The Glasgow team's slide into administration in February was related to an unpaid tax bill of $14 million, incurred after businessman Craig Whyte bought the club in June 2010, but the UK government is also seeking $118 million allegedly owed in back taxes. ""I can assure you that there will not be any investor who owns more than 15%. I don't believe that any one person should own a football club,"" Green said. ""I think when we look around at certain clubs where one individual is in control there is no contingency and things are driven by their ability to sign a check.""

"(CNN) -- World No.1 Novak Djokovic and 16-time grand slam champion Roger Federer have been drawn to meet in the semifinals of the French Open -- setting up the likely prospect of a repeat of their classic 2011 clash at Roland Garros. An inspired Federer ended Djokovic's unbeaten streak and dashed the Serbian's chances of the grand slam before losing in the final to Rafael Nadal. Friday's draw for the second grand slam of the season saw Nadal in the same half of the draw as fourth seed Andy Murray of Britain, again setting up the chance of a re-run of 2011. Spain's Nadal will be bidding for a record seventh French Open title this year and opens against Simone Bolelli while Djokovic also faces Italian opposition in Potito Starace. Federer must get past Germany's Tobias Kamke to earn a potentially tricky second round clash with Argentina's David Nalbandian. Big-hitters Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina or Czech Tomas Berdych could also provide Federer with tough obstacles in his section of the draw. Murray, out of sorts and struggling with injury is drawn to face home hope Richard Gasquet of France, who beat him at last week's Italian Open. The women's draw has pitted second seed Maria Sharapova and old rival Serena Williams in the same quarter and a possible quarterfinal clash. Sharapova, yet to win the French Open, warmed up by taking the Italian Open crown, while Williams has claimed titles in Charleston and Madrid on the clay. But 2002 winner Williams has a tough draw and is seeded to meet Dane Caroline Wozniacki in the last 16. Defending champion Li Na of China, beaten by Sharapova in the Rome final last weekend, faces Romanian Sorana Cirstea in the first round and could meet 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova in the quarters. But Kvitova will probably have to get past 2010 winner and last year's runner-up Francesca Schiavone to progress that far. Top seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus has been paired with Italian Alberta Brianti in the first round as she looks to secure her second consecutive grand slam after her Australian triumph. World No.3 Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland is drawn to face Venus Williams in the second round.

"(CNN) -- The rallying world has paid tribute to promising young co-driver Gareth Roberts, who was killed during a race in Sicily on Saturday. The 24-year-old from Wales was navigating for Irish driver Craig Breen at the Targa Florio Rally, and they were sixth overall when they crashed. Breen was unhurt in the accident, but Roberts died from his injuries according to the motorsport's official website. They won the inaugural FIA WRC Academy title last year, and were leading the Super 2000 World Rally Championship after three races. ""Our thoughts are with Gareth's friends and family. The world of rallying has lost a true talent,"" said M-Sport, the company which built the Ford Fiesta S2000 Breen and Roberts were using in the SWRC. ""I heard the sad news from Italy. Me and Jarmo want to send our condolences and our thoughts to Gareth's family and friends on this sad day,"" top Finnish rally driver Mikko Hirvonen wrote on networking website Twitter. This season's WRC Academy leader Alastair Fisher said: ""I cannot believe what's happened. I'm totally devastated. My thoughts are with Gareth's family and of course Craig."" Tire supplier Pirelli, who worked with Breen and Roberts last year, also offered condolences. ""Words cannot express our shock and sadness,"" said the company's motorsport director Paul Hembery. Last year, Breen acknowledged Roberts' contribution after they sealed the WRC Academy title in November. ""He's kept my feet on the ground this weekend, which is not an easy job. Having to leave service for the last three stages knowing there was no possibility other than to win them all was very difficult,"" Breen said. ""But he's really kept me on the straight and narrow so it's all credit to him. He's the littlest Welsh wizard but the best of them for sure.""","Rally navigator dies after crash in Italian race .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal claimed a seventh Barcelona Open title with a hard fought straight-set 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 victory over David Ferrer on Sunday. The world No.2 completed another convincing display on the clay to notch up a 34th consecutive win in the tournament, seven days after winning his eighth successive title in Monte Carlo. It was the fourth time the Spaniard has beaten Ferrer in the final at the Real Club de Tenis since 2008. But Nadal didn't have it all his own way. The first set lasted 93 minutes with the 10-time grand slam winner having to save five set points in the 12th game before going on to take the tie-break comfortably. ""This was my hardest match since the start of the clay season. David always takes you to the limit. I was lucky when I saved break points. The odds were on my side,"" Nadal said afterwards. Ferrer's resolve continued into the second as he came back from 3-1 down, breaking his compatriot's serve in the fifth and then the ninth game to edge 5-4 ahead. But Nadal broke back immediately and followed it by holding his next service game to love. He carried the momentum into 12th and decisive game, closing out the match with the first of three match points. ""In the second set David played very close, but I had the luck at the end. I'm so happy and I feel sorry for him. I'm starting to feel my game well on the clay,"" he added. The 25-year-old has now won 48 career titles in total and won 34 of 38 finals contested on the clay.

"(CNN) -- Spain's Nicolas Almagro dashed American qualifier Brian Baker's hopes of a fairytale ATP title triumph in Nice when he beat him in straight sets in the final Saturday. The third seed successfully defended his title on the French Riviera with a 6-3 6-2 victory in 70 minutes. ""I played my best tennis in two years here,"" Almagro told the official ATP Tour website. ""I am very happy with my serve and my forehand. I moved on the court very, very well."" Baker has battled back to top form after a succession of injuries and setbacks over the past six years and came into the tournament as world number 216. His heroics in Nice where he beat a string of higher seeded players will see his ranking boosted ahead of the French Open where both he and Almagro are in action later this week. Baker matched Almagro to 3-3 in the opening set but he lost the next three games and the second set also proved testing. ""I didn't feel like I played that poorly. I was a little sore and a little tired, but he was definitely the better player,"" he said. Almagro feels the 27-year-old Baker has a big future on the ATP Tour. ""He lost the final today, but he is back, he is playing very good. I think if he plays as he did this week, then he will win many, many tournaments.""

"(CNN) -- Ana Ivanovic won a battle of former French Open champions as she dispatched Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova in straight sets at the WTA tournament in Rome Monday. Ivanovic claimed her only grand slam win at Roland Garros in 2008 and boosted her preparation for another tilt at the title in Paris later this month with a 6-4 6-3 victory. Windy conditions at the Foro Italico hindered both players during a 73-minute match, but it was Serbia's Ivanovic who adapted the better. ""It was hard to play, especially on the service because of the strong gusts of wind,"" she told the official tournament website. ""I'm achieving a good level thanks to the work I'm doing with my coach,"" she added. Ivanovic took all five of her break point opportunities against Kuznetsova, who succeeded her as French Open champion in 2009. Two breaks of service in the opener gave Ivanovic the advantage and she broke through three more times in a second set, including to love in the final game as she wrapped up victory. She faces either Alberta Brianti of Italy or Spaniard Silvia Soler in the second round and a potential last 16 clash against Russian star Maria Sharapova awaits the 13th seed. The joint ATP/WTA tournament has attracted a stellar field, with the men's event boasting the top four in the world, led by defending champion Novak Djokovic. He beat the 'king of clay' Rafael Nadal in the 2011 final, but both exited early at last week's Madrid Masters on the controversial blue surface. Roger Federer took advantage to leapfrog Nadal for second spot in the rankings with his 20th Masters Series title. But Nadal told the official tournament website that this did not concern him. ""To be number two or three isn't going to change my game. ""I am here in Rome and it is one of my favorite tournaments. I am motivated to play my best,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams powered to her first Madrid Masters title, hitting 14 aces in a comfortable win over Victoria Azarenka in Sunday's final. Williams took just over an hour to take the 41st WTA singles title of her career in a 6-1 6-3 win over the world No. 1. The in-form Williams, who has won all 13 of her matches on clay this year, set the tone for a dominant performance by winning the first four games against an opponent that had lost just one set in the tournament before the final. Williams hit 26 winners past the Belorussian, taking four of her five break-point chances and denying Azarenka's single break-point opportunity. ""I think Victoria is the player to beat,"" said Williams. ""She has won I don't know how many tournaments this year alone. That's an amazing amount. So if you look at the stats, you just have to put her up there as the player to beat. ""I actually love the clay but my results haven't been stellar. I have won the French Open and lots of clay-court tournaments, though. It's really a myth about me not liking clay. I like it more than grass, which is weird. Hopefully I can start doing better."" Australian Open champion Azarenka had been looking for her fifth title this year, but was steamrollered by Williams. ""Being in the final of such a tournament is a good achievement,"" said Azarenka. ""It's disappointing to lose but what can you do, it's done. I have to think about the positive things and take the best out of this week. I've been playing some great tennis."" Both players will be in action as the WTA Tour moves to Rome, where the field features nine of the world's top-10 players.

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray's poor form going into the French Open continued as he lost to Richard Gasquet in the third round of the Rome Masters. After some initial stiff resistance, taking the first set after a tie break, Murray lost the next two 6-3, 6-2. He later revealed he has been suffering with a back injury all year and is now a doubt to play at Roland Garros. ""(It was a) long match and sore back towards the end, but I was expecting that coming to the tournament,"" he told the ATP's official website. ""I didn't take a break from training and playing a lot, but the muscles are more tired and fatigued."" He later told AFP that he will have little chance to rest his back in the run up to the French Open. ""I've felt it for some months, but I haven't had a chance to take a pause,"" he said. ""I've tried not to make it any worse, but the muscles get tired from compensating ... I've got a lot of big events coming and there's not that much time to rest any niggles. Hopefully when the French comes, the goal is to be in peak condition."" Defending champion and top seed Novak Djokovic was given a shock when Juan Monaco of Argentina won the first set of their third-round clash. The wind was causing the Serb some problems -- so much so that he destroyed his racket after the first set -- before coming back strongly winning the next two sets 6-2 6-3. ""It was difficult to play in the wind, but it was the same for both of us,"" Djokovic conceded ahead of his quarterfinal against world No. 5 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who beat Madrid semifinalist Juan Martin del Potro 6-4 6-1. After his problems on the blue clay of Madrid, Rafael Nadal was not in a generous mood beating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6-1, 6-1. ""Conditions were difficult and windy but I think I found rhythm and after third game I played very solid,"" Nadal said. He goes on to play Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals. Madrid champion Roger Federer also reached the last eight, digging deep to beat fellow former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2 5-7 6-1.

"(CNN) -- It's been three years since Tommy Haas has reached an ATP Tour final, and the former world No. 2's wait for a 13th career title was extended on Saturday. The 34-year-old rolled back the years on home soil this week when he stunned top seed Jo Wilfried-Tsonga at the Munich Open, but his tournament has now ended with a straight-sets defeat by 2010 runner-up Marin Cilic in the semifinals. Haas, who has overcome two career-threatening injuries in the past decade, was runner-up in the clay event in 2000 and had been on course to reach his first final since winning another German tournament, the Halle grass-court championship in 2009. But Croatian Cilic triumphed 6-3 6-4 as he won 89% of his service points to set up a clash with Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber on Sunday. ""It was my best match of the week,"" the 23-year-old third seed told the ATP website after beating a player who has reached four grand slam semifinals but needed a wild-card to enter this week. ""I played and served extremely well. I believe he didn't reach deuce on my serve. Tommy played really well this week and I went into the match with thoughts of that. It made good preparation for everything."" Haas had also defeated former Australian Open finalist Marco Baghdatis on his way to the last four, but the world No. 134 lost in 75 minutes to a man seeking to win an ATP Tour title for the fourth successive year, owning six overall. Kohlschreiber, the 2007 Munich champion, will also be seeking his seventh title after beating Spanish second seed Feliciano Lopez in the second semifinal. The 28-year-old, who has also been a winner and runner-up at Halle, won 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 6-4.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova produced a powerful performance to defeat world No.1 Victoria Azarenka in the final of the WTA clay-court event in Stuttgart on Sunday. The Russian took just 84 minutes to blow the Belarusian off court in straight sets 6-1 6-4 and claim her first title of 2012 and the 25th of her career. Azarenka wasn't at her best and needed treatment for a wrist injury in the first set, but Sharapova showed no mercy ramming home the advantage and closing out the set in 30 minutes. The reigning Australian Open champion was more resolute in the second but a break of serve for Sharapova in the seventh game enabled her to go on and take the match without hindrance. ""I am just happy to win, it's a good tournament with very good players. It's a shame she was injured and couldn't play her normal game. I am just happy to have won the tournament,"" the world No.2 said afterwards. ""I came to Europe a bit earlier than normal before the French Open and was just going to use this tournament as a warm-up, but it works for me."" The win was revenge for Sharapova who lost to Azarenka in the Australian Open final in January and more recently in the final of the Indian Wells tournament in California. Azarenka said her wrist had been troubling her all week but wasn't looking for excuses in defeat. ""Congratulations to Maria, she's had a good week here.

"(CNN) -- It will be her second retirement from tennis, but this time former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters insists she is quitting the court for good. The Belgian has announced she will bow out in September after the U.S. Open, the setting for three of her four grand slam titles. Clijsters retired in 2007 to give birth to her first daughter, but returned in 2009 to enjoy the most successful period of her career. The 28-year-old added to her first grand slam in 2005 by securing back-to-back titles at the U.S. Open in 2009 and 2010. She then added the 2011 Australian Open to her roll of honor. It was during this period that Clijsters regained the No. 1 ranking for the first time in five years, but since then a series of injuries have disrupted her career. She told a press conference in New York that a swansong in the Big Apple would be a fitting end to her career. ""As it stands I will end my career at the U.S. Open. That is where I enjoyed my greatest triumphs and it is a very special place for me,"" she said. ""The stadium is only about 45 minutes away from our house in the United States and my parents-in-law will be able to be present."" Clijsters announced last month she would miss the clay court season after suffering a hip injury at the Miami Open. She intends to return for the calendar's third grand slam, at Wimbledon, and will compete in the London Olympics at the same venue later in the year before calling it a day at Flushing Meadows. Meanwhile, at the WTA tournament in Strasbourg, there were victories for 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone and Israel's Shahar Peer. On the men's ATP Tour, world No. 7 Tomas Berdych defeated veteran American Andy Roddick 6-1 6-2 at the World Team Cup in Dusseldorf, Germany. Berdych ensured a point for his native Czech Republic in the team event, while Florian Mayer got defending champions Germany off to a strong start by defeating Croatia's Ivan Dodig 6-1 6-1. Serbian pair Viktor Troicki and Janko Tipsarevic also enjoyed victories over Russian duo Dmitry Tursunov and Alex Bogomolov Jr. respectively.","Former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters announces she is to retire in September .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer came from behind to beat Tomas Berdych to win his third Madrid title and equal Rafael Nadal's record of 20 Masters titles. Federer won 3-6 7-5 7-5 to continue a rich vein of form that has seen him lose just three times in 48 matches over the last eight months and ensure the Swiss will take Nadal's No. 2 ranking on Monday. The 16-time grand slam champion's ranking rise is significant because Federer could avoid playing No. 1 Novak Djokovic and Nadal until the final of the French Open -- the second major tournament of the tennis season, which starts on May 28. ""It's been a great spell and I couldn't be more happy right now coming off a break winning right away,"" Federer following his first ATP Tour tournament after a third-round exit in Miami in March.

""I was worried about getting through the first round and was not even thinking about who was going to be my second round opponent,"" Federer said after claiming his fourth title this year and 74th overall. ""I was very realistic coming into this event. Confidence is coming back. I was away and it didn't take much for me to get my confidence back, especially now that I've been playing so well for the past nine months."" Berdych got off to the best possible start in Sunday's final, breaking Federer straight away for a 2-0 lead. The Czech had a chance to secure the first set when Federer was serving, before Berdych closed it out on his own serve in the ninth game. However Berdych's service let him down at a key point in the second set's 12th game when he double-faulted, allowing Federer to pull level. Berdych squandered two break points at the start of the third set, and Federer sealed victory on his fourth match point after two hours and 38 minutes. Federer has now lost just four times to Berdych in 15 meetings, though the Czech player had won three of their past five matches, including a win in the 2010 Wimbledon quarterfinals. The tennis circuit shifts to Rome next week and a return to the reddish clay for the rest of the clay court season. That is likely to be a welcome relief for Nadal and Djokovic, who had been vocal in their criticism of Madrid's blue clay surface, particularly after their shock exits at the hands of Fernando Verdasco and Janko Tipsarevic respectively.","Roger Federer beats Tomas Berdych 3-6 7-5 7-5 in Madrid final on Sunday .

"New York (CNN) -- Politicians will be barred from speaking at this year's commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks, according to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. According to Joe Daniels, president of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, the foundation ""is focused on honoring the victims and their families in a way free of politics, and this ensures that continues."" In a letter sent to victims' families Wednesday, Daniels said that the reading of victims' names by family members will be ""the exclusive focus of the program"" during this year's ceremony. 9/11, ten years later . Ground zero has a decorative history of politicians' speaking at anniversary ceremonies, ranging from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to former President George W. Bush and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is chairman of the memorial foundation's board of directors. Politicians such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are honorary trustees. At last year's ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the attacks that brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center, President Barack Obama read a psalm. It's been a tradition for victims' family members to lead a solemn reading of the names of their lost ones during commemorations at the memorial site. In post 9/11 America, no one is untouched . The reading of the names ""individualizes the masses of people who were killed. Those people were individuals who had individual lives,"" said Charles G. Wolf, who lost his wife, Katherine, who had been working at the World Trade Center that day. But Bloomberg had publicly considered ending the tradition. ""Some people have said change is good, and the subject's come up a couple times, and I think we've said the foundation board will talk about this,"" he said during a radio show in August 2011. His comments brought much heat from some of the victims' families, who have blamed politicians for delays in construction of the memorial museum. The museum was originally scheduled to open this year, marking the 11th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, but has been held up because of ""disagreements"" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bloomberg said in a news conference last year. Bloomberg's office declined to comment Thursday. Cuomo's office could not be reached for comment. More than 3 million people have visited the memorial since its opening on September 11, 2011. ""We're still dealing with this. Eleven years later, and we're still talking about it,"" Wolf said.

"(CNN) -- While Rafael Nadal enjoys a fishing trip in his native Mallorca, Roger Federer is closing on his Spanish rival's No. 2 ranking and his Masters titles record after reaching the final in Madrid. Nadal, like Novak Djokovic, couldn't wait to get away from the controversial blue clay at the Caja Magica but Federer has made the best of the situation and thrashed Janko Tipsarevic 6-2, 6-3 on Saturday in a one-sided semifinal. Waiting in the final is Tomas Berdych, who beat a tetchy Juan Martin del Potro 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6) earlier in the day. Federer will move above Nadal in the rankings if he wins his third Madrid title, and will also equal the Spaniard's record of 20 Masters titles. ""I didn't even know actually about the No. 2 ranking,"" Federer said. ""I'm focused on what I am doing here this week, trying to play well and get on a bit of a roll and I have played better and better as the tournament went on."" Tipsarevic had knocked out fellow Serb Djokovic a day earlier, taking advantage of his compatriot's dislike of the blue clay surface. But in a match watched by Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, Tipsarevic was no match for Federer, who hit 25 winners to take his head-to-head record over the Serb to 5-0. Federer's possible rise to No. 2 in the rankings is even more significant with the French Open looming. It means the 16-time Grand Slam champion could avoid playing Djokovic or Nadal until the final. The victory also took Federer past the $70m mark in career prize money. Federer will play in his 33rd Masters final on Sunday, while Berdych competes in his third. The Czech sixth seed took advantage of several lapses by Del Potro, who was broken while serving for the first set and then disputed a series of line calls in the second set. ""He was my toughest match of the week,"" Berdych said. Del Potro refused to shake hands with the umpire after the match but said later: ""I lost because Berdych played better, and that's the only reason."" Berdych trails Federer 4-10 in head-to-heads byt has won three of their last five meetings.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The ongoing Penn State scandal reached if not its denouement Thursday at least its climax with the release of the report prepared under the auspices of former FBI Director Louis Freeh. The report answers numerous questions about who knew about Jerry Sandusky's abuse of children as well as how suspicions, rumors and allegations were handled. For many of us the most disturbing element of the report already had been intimated in the press, the role that coach Joe Paterno played in handling complaints against athletes internally and disregarding both Penn State's procedures and also the law. While charitably one could suggest that Paterno saw discipline as his role as a coach and mentor, less charitable interpretations also make sense, particularly a desire to maintain the reputation of the program and the income and prestige it brought. Beyond motives, however, the creation of an environment where discipline took place ""off the books"" was destined to lead to a collapse at some point. Unfortunately when this collapse occurred its victims were children. News: Penn State leaders disregarded victims, 'empowered' Sandusky . Freeh said in releasing his report that the investigation's ""most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims by the most senior leaders at Penn State."" ""The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized,"" he said. ""Messrs. Spanier, Schultz, Paterno and Curley never demonstrated, through actions or words, any concern for the safety and well-being of Sandusky's victims until after Sandusky's arrest."" That remark, which many of us hoped never to read, speaks directly to the findings of the report and to the organizational and moral failures of Penn State. Even more directly, the report directly chastises the university's board of trustees for a failure to exercise its oversight functions and its dereliction in ensuring that it was appropriately and adequately informed of risks to the university. Not only did the university's administration not inform to the board about the suspicions of and allegations against Sandusky, the board failed in its responsibility in establishing a system to seek such information. Most shocking, however, given its legal obligations, was Penn State's complete dereliction in its responsibilities under express laws, including those mandating reporting and protecting those who bring violations to light. News: Reactions to Penn State report flood social media . Freeh's ability to identify and order the moral failings of the university in the most appropriate, empathetic and humane way is admirable. He centers his condemnations primarily on the fact that at every level --the board, the president and Paterno -- no one expressed any concern for the boys whose lives were devastated by the abuse inflicted upon them by Sandusky. Regardless of the structural, administrative and disciplinary failures at Penn State, the central moral failing was that the school cared more about its reputation, its football team, and even Sandusky than about his victims. The school grossly mis-ordered values and failed to meet its duties. What Freeh has found is most disturbing and depressing. A superior institution of higher education and a football program and coach admired for their express commitment to principles proved themselves to have feet of clay and appalling disregard for the safety and security of many innocent children. News: Key players in Penn State report . Penn State's failings should be a warning to every organization and to all of us. We protect our reputations by doing the right thing, not by hiding our failings. Indeed, even amid discovery of error and wrongdoing, reputations are enhanced by acknowledging, dealing with them immediately and directly, and working to minimize their recurrence. If we can draw a salutary lesson from this scandal, it is that. Unfortunately, for the innocent child victims of Sandusky's predation, the lesson has come too late. Maybe, if other organizations take these lessons to heart it will prevent future abuses and save others from becoming victims. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward Queen.","Louis Freeh releases report showing failures by Penn State administrators .

"(CNN) -- It may not be conclusive proof of climate change, but every couple of years brings another ""Ice Age"" to air-conditioned multiplexes across the globe. Each of its predecessors made more money than the one that came before, so there's an inevitability about this fourth venture -- ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" -- even if it bears telltale signs of creative exhaustion and, yes, drift. The franchise started out as a prehistoric, slapstick spin on the old John Ford western, ""Three Godfathers,"" with a woolly mammoth, a sloth and a sabre-toothed tiger (Manny, Sid and Diego, voiced by Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary) delivering an orphaned human baby to safety. It has evolved -- or maybe ""devolved"" -- into a scrappy string of antic adventures interspersed with sitcom-style character notes, all pegged to whatever novelty the writing team can contrive in place of a plot. In part three it was a subterranean dinosaur lair. In this episode, an unfortunate incident with an acorn at the earth's core precipitates tectonic realignment. When the continents part ways, Manny and the guys are trapped on an iceberg heading out to sea with only Sid's nutty grandmother (Wanda Sykes) for company. Manny's quest to be reunited with wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and teen daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) is interrupted by a gang of scurvy pirates, led by a tricorn-headed orangutan, Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage). Whoever thought it was a good idea to spike this tired series with the defining component from a rival, equally over-extended franchise (not to mention the recent Aardman Animation pirate caper), well, here's a thought: maybe you could introduce a web-slinging spider-boy in the next one? You know, just to keep things fresh! The animation is dynamic and crisp, but the story just runs around in circles while we wait for the sky to fall down. Truth be told, it's a kick that Twentieth Century Fox is distributing a movie about the dangers of climate change. ""Doesn't it worry you that this is the end of the world?"" someone asks a particularly unintelligent couple of party-hearty mammals. Uh-uh, they respond. ""I guess we can tell you our secret... We're really, really stupid."" Like the equally stretched-to-the-breaking-point ""Shrek"" series, ""Ice Age"" has accumulated too many characters with too little to do, and all-star vocal stylings (""Continental Drift"" adds Jennifer Lopez, Drake, Nick Frost and even Joy Behar, to name a few) can only do so much by way of compensation. A bigger problem: the trio of reprobates at the center of proceedings have become so domesticated over the years, whatever mild comic edge they used to have has been dulled to a soft nub. The loner, Manny, is now a boringly over-bearing father. The aggressive Diego is just a big pussycat. Only pea-brained Sid has stayed true to type, which will please infants more than their parents. (For the record, everything I disliked about this movie -- the dumb teen mammoth romance subplot, the narwhal-propelled iceberg, and especially the irritating Sid -- were selected as personal highlights by my 7-year-old.) As in the earlier films, the most enterprising comedy features the mute squirrel, Scrat, who's Looney Tunes-inspired misadventures are almost always a welcome distraction -- even if we already saw too much of this material in teasers released last year. Better than any of this is the five-minute 3D Simpsons short (""The Longest Daycare"") that precedes the feature. A starring vehicle for baby Maggie, this is sharp, witty visual slapstick that harks back to the silent era for inspiration. True to form, my kid hated it.","""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is the fourth movie in the series .

"(CNN) -- Agnieszka Radwanska has only lost to one player this season. It's just that she has now been beaten by Victoria Azarenka an incredible six times. World No. 1 Azarenka maintained her complete dominance over her Polish rival with a 6-2, 6-4 win at the Madrid Masters on Saturday. Azarenka will play former No. 1 Serena Williams in Sunday's final after the American beat Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka 7-6 (5), 6-0. Azarenka had already ended Radwanska's title hopes this year in Sydney, Melbourne, Doha, Indian Wells and Stuttgart. Radwanska has won her other two tournaments and withdrew injured in Kuala Lumpur. Asked if she was looking forward to another chance to go up against Azarenka, the No. 3-ranked Radwanska replied: ""Yeah sure, maybe in a couple of months!"" Australian Open champion Azarenka hammered 29 winners on the infamous blue clay in Madrid as she looks for her fifth title of the year, but she faces a very different task against Williams. Azarenka has a 6-1 losing record against the 13-time Grand Slam champion, although they haven't met since the Belarussian rose to the top of the world rankings by winning the Australian Open in January. ""I have always been competitive against her and she is one of the toughest opponents to play against,"" Azarenka said. ""It's going to be a different story this time."" Their last meeting ended in a 6-1, 7-6 (5) win for Williams in the U.S. Open third round last year. Williams didn't face a break point in her semifinal against the big-hitting Hradecka and came through a tight opening set before sweeping through the second in 24 minutes. ""She served amazing in the first set,"" Williams said. ""I came through in tiebreak, and after that I was able to relax, make less errors and make some shots. I was more aware in the second set. I think that helped me."" The 30-year-old Williams hasn't lost a clay-court match this season after winning the title in Charleston last month. She will move up to at least No. 6 in the world rankings on Monday. ""I have been working really hard but I don't want to stop at No. 6 and I want to continue to do better,"" Williams said. ""Victoria obviously has been playing this whole year so consistent, so amazing and just nearly perfect so I am going into the final with nothing to lose.

"(CNN) -- Elaine Barrish Hammond has a schedule that rivals none. In the morning she has an interview with a journalist who seems to have a vendetta against her to be followed by her son's engagement dinner, where she'll meet her ex-husband's buxom girlfriend. Oh, and she has to handle a diplomatic crisis involving three innocent American journalists who are about to be executed by a foreign dictator. All in a day's work for the secretary of state in the fictional world of USA Network's ""Political Animals."" The six-hour miniseries, which will premiere at 10 p.m. ET on Sunday, stars Sigourney Weaver as Elaine, a former first lady who becomes the secretary of state after losing the presidential nomination. With ""Political Animals,"" viewers will get watch as Weaver's character deals with her challenging political role and tumultuous family life. Fans may recall that Weaver once played the first lady in ""Dave,"" a 1993 romantic comedy about a presidential switcheroo. However, her new role as Elaine places the actress in a more powerful leading role. In an interview with CNN, Weaver said her new character is a no-nonsense, powerful politician who is also the head of the household. Why summer is becoming the prime time for prime-time TV . ""It's one of the richest roles I've ever played,"" she said. ""She is kind, such a passionate politician for the right reason and her moral compass is so strong. She is sure-footed."" The Hammond family and their collective storylines are also central to the series. ""Political Animals"" creator, executive producer and writer Greg Berlanti said that while the show has a political theme, viewers will see more scenes featuring the Hammonds sitting around more dining tables than conference tables. ""I was intrigued by writing about a former first family,"" Berlanti said. ""There's this wistful quality of 'Weren't we great when ... ' "" Berlanti, who was also one of the creative forces behind the TV series ""Brothers & Sisters,"" said that the human side of those in politics is often forgotten by the general public and he wanted to capture that in this project. On HBO, art imitating political life? ""One of the things about the show is the duality about our public life, about our noble goals, dedicating our life to something,"" he said. ""But it comes as a sacrifice. There are things that are engaging to them. There are darker elements to each of their characters. The flawed characters are indeed aplenty in ""Political Animals."" Elaine's youngest son T.J. Hammond (Sebastian Stan, ""Kings"") is the first openly gay son of an American president and is secretly a drug addict. Bud Hammond (Ciaran Hinds, ""Munich"") is the charismatic ex-husband of Elaine whose popularity sinks after his affairs are revealed. The miniseries as with other political dramas like ""The West Wing,"" draws some parallels to the present. Elaine as the secretary of state in some ways embodies the years of the only three women to occupy the position; Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and currently Hillary Clinton. And Bud's unfaithfulness and Elaine's run for president before becoming the secretary of state might remind viewers of events surrounding a certain real-life political family. Berlanti said the Hammonds certainly seem to mirror the Clintons, however Elaine's character has other influences. ""I don't want to be coy of Hillary and Bill comparisons."" he said. ""Their resume is sort of the same and I liked the dynamic of a power couple. But it comes more from Madeleine Albright's book. We were trying to draw (on) what it means to be the first female secretary of state."" Berlanti said that he was also interested in presenting how different personalities clash in politics, even when they are playing for the same team. ""Politically speaking, it's not us versus them, or Democrat versus Republican."" he said. ""It's Democrat versus Democrat."" For example, there is Elaine's relationship with President Paul Garcetti (Adrian Pasdar, ""Heroes"") who went from being her opponent in the presidential race to her boss. They clash over foreign policy among other things. ""They pick the best rowers, they all realize that they are the on the same boat,"" Pasdar said. ""They had to do what they did to get to the White House. They realize that politically they enhance each other's political power, but personally they diminish it. There is a respect, begrudgingly, that is fun to play with."" A similar tension exists initially between Elaine and Susan Berg (Carla Gugino, ""Sin City""), the Pultizer Prize-winning journalist who has made her career by following and criticizing the Hammonds. Gugino said her character of Susan grew up idealizing Elaine but was disappointed when Elaine stayed with the philandering Bud for as long as she did. Summertime is a hot time for USA Network . ""They are more birds of the feather,"" Gugino said. ""What their professions are also keeps them at a certain distance. There is something that is connecting them. It is very tricky."" Gugino said that Susan becomes closer to the family in the process of an exclusive interview and the two women slowly form an unspoken alliance in a political world dominated by men. Weaver said that the idea of a woman taking the political helm attracted her to ""Political Animals"" in the first place and she said that the format of the series will give the concept some substance. ""I hope it will encourage more women in politics,"" she said. ""We need more women in politics. We don't stand on ceremony and are not about hierarchy. We are much more practical because we are mothers. ... I am hoping the show will reach women. Women are needed in Washington.""","""Political Animals"" revolves around a fictional Secretary of State, her political and family life .

"(CNN) -- Two American tourists and their guide were kidnapped Friday in the Sinai region of Egypt, authorities said. Bedouin kidnappers want authorities to release a relative who is in detention in Alexandria on drug charges, said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of security in the North Sinai. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. In February, two American tourists were kidnapped and soon released in the Sinai region. The same thing happened in June, when two American tourists were released about a day after being abducted. In the most recent incident, Bedouins stopped a tour bus en route to Taba and kidnapped the two tourists -- a man and a woman -- and their guide, Bakr said. Authorities were trying to negotiate with the kidnappers, he said.","Guide is among three people taken hostage from a tour bus in the Sinai region .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain is expelling the Libyan ambassador to Madrid and three other Libyan diplomats here, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. ""The government of Spain has decided to put an end to the mission of the ambassador accredited in Madrid by the authorities in Tripoli (Libya), because the Gadhafi regime has lost all legitimacy due to its continual repression of the Libyan population,"" the statement said. The Libyan ambassador to Madrid, Ajeli Abdussalam Ali Breni, ""has 10 days to leave"" Spain, the ministry said. The government also is expelling three other diplomats at the Libyan embassy ""who undertook activities incompatible with their diplomatic status,"" the statement said. But Spain has not broken diplomatic relations with Libya, said a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. Spain still has an embassy in Tripoli, although it evacuated its personnel from the city, like many other nations, as fighting between the regime of Moammar Gadhafi and rebels intensified in late March. The Spanish Embassy in Tripoli, staffed only by local Libyan personnel, ""is not closed in a diplomatic sense,"" the spokeswoman said. It was not immediately clear, she added, how many Libyan diplomats or local Spanish personnel might remain at the Libyan Embassy in Madrid, after the expulsion of the ambassador and the three other Libyan diplomats. Spanish Foreign Ministry Trinidad Jimenez on June 8 visited the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi , where she declared that Libya's rebel National Transitional Council was a ""valid interlocutor"" and a ""legitimate representative of the aspirations of the Libyan people,"" the spokeswoman said. Spain has been participating in United Nations-mandated, NATO-led military operations in Libya. Spain has deployed four F-18 fighter jets and a refueling plane to help enforce a no-fly zone, and a frigate, a submarine and a surveillance plane to help impose an arms embargo against the Gadhafi regime.","Spain is telling the Libyan ambassador to leave .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- British officials Saturday warned of terror threats in Kenya as the east African nation battles Islamist militants in neighboring Somalia. ""Kenyan authorities have alerted the public to a heightened threat from terrorist attacks in Nairobi. We believe that terrorists may be in the final stages of planning attacks,"" the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement. It said the attacks may target places where expatriates gather such as hotels, shopping centers and beaches. A Kenyan government spokesman said the threats are not new. ""This threat has been ongoing for maybe the last two weeks, and because of the holiday season we want to make sure people are extra aware. We suspect that Al-Shabaab may be planning to carry out an attack,"" Alfred Mutua said. A spokesman for the Kenyan police, Eric Kiraithe, also downplayed the threat. ""We don't believe that we are under any more threat of a terror attack than London for example,"" he told CNN from Nairobi. ""We believe that there are certain elements of this terrorist organization (Al-Shabaab) here in Nairobi, and we are taking all precautionary measures. People in hotels and shopping should take extra caution. ""But we have so much intelligence on the ground, all over the country, that we don't believe an attack is imminent. We are relatively safe, nobody should cancel their holiday. The caution is just a precautionary measure."" The UK statement did not offer details on who might carry out the attacks, but urged British nationals to be vigilant in public places. Kiraithe also confirmed that arrest warrants have been issued for two people wanted in connection with police investigations into Al-Shabaab activities. One is a British national named Natalie Faye Webb, he said. ""She could be an accomplice or simply have information, but it would be in the public interest if she was taken in by police."" The second suspect -- who according to Kenyan station Capital FM is a dual British and Kenyan citizen called Habib Saleh Ghani, also known as Abu Usama Al-Pakistani -- also now has an arrest warrant out for him, Kiraithe said. He also confirmed Kenyan media reports that police last week issued the photographs of 15 people suspected of having information regarding Al-Shabaab's activities. A spokesperson for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office -- who was not named, per government policy -- acknowledged Kenyan authorities want to talk with some of its citizens. ""We are aware that the Kenyan authorities are interested in speaking to British nationals in relation to possible links to Al-Shabaab,"" the spokesperson said Saturday. U.S. Embassy officials in Kenya issued their own terror alert in October and November, saying they have credible information of an imminent terror attack. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Nairobi said Saturday that it had not changed its travel advice, which urges U.S. citizens already in Kenya and those thinking of traveling there to ""evaluate their personal security situation in light of continuing and recently heightened threats from terrorism and the high rate of violent crime in some areas."" Two grenade attacks in Nairobi in October, one on a night club and another at a crowded bus stop, left one Kenyan dead and 30 injured, the State Department's website on Kenya says. ""Our travel warning is up to date and stands as it is,"" embassy spokeswoman Katya Thomas told CNN. The U.S. warning came after Kenya sent troops across the border into Somalia to pursue Islamist Al-Shabaab militants. The terror group has threatened Kenya with retaliatory attacks, saying it considers the forces' incursion an affront to Somalia's sovereignty. Kenya blamed abductions of tourists and aid workers last year on the terror group. CNN's Per Nyberg reported from London and David McKenzie from Nairobi for this report.","NEW: Britain acknowledges Kenyan authorities want to talk to its citizens, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Chris Robinson's family is used to being a bit ahead of the curve. After selling caskets at a general store in Easley, South Carolina, an ancestor opened a funeral location in a separate building. Most other parlors in town operated in homes converted for the purpose. ""People thought he had overbuilt at the time,"" said Robinson, general manager and vice president of Robinson Funeral Home. ""He was very forward thinking because we utilized that building for years."" Robinson Funeral Home is undergoing its fourth addition and will feature a first for Easley -- Starbucks coffee. A new lobby will lead to an area where baristas hired by Robinson will discreetly serve Frappuccinos to mourners and the public alike. Robinson told CNN Wednesday the family, which operates two other funeral homes in the area, is getting positive feedback from the community. ""When people have visitations, people come out and support families,"" he said. ""This is another way to do that."" Coffee has long been part of the family business. The general store, now selling clothing, featured a potbelly stove where townspeople would drink coffee and ""solve the world's problems,"" Robinson said. The Coffee Corner, he said, will be a respectful distance from the chapel. ""If this provides them a little escape and gives them a break from the stress they are going through, that's what it's all about, to make them feel better,"" Robinson told CNN Greenville-Spartanburg affiliate WSPA. Starbucks is providing training and equipment for the endeavor, which Robinson expects to open in August. There will be no Starbucks signage outside the funeral home, he said. The company recognizes demand in the neighborhood and is supportive because the brand will be presented in an appropriate manner, Starbucks spokesperson Alisa Martinez said. The public will be able to access the coffee area from a patio. Inside they will find tables, a fireplace, television, cash register and Wi-fi. The funeral home will continue offering its own coffee for those not interested in the Starbucks brand. Besides meeting the needs of people who have lost loved ones, the coffee shop can serve another purpose, according to Robinson.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Rescue crews were frantically trying to find survivors possibly buried in debris Wednesday after heavy rain and floods washed through southeastern Bangladesh in the past few days, killing 95 people, police and local officials said. Most of the victims died in landslides caused by torrential rains and flash floods in the port city of Chittagong, the tourist destination of Cox's Bazar and the hilly Bandarban district. ""We've recovered 95 bodies so far, and the death toll may go up as many people, as claimed by the relatives, are still missing,"" Divisional Commissioner of Chittagong Mohammad Serajul Huq Khan said. Khan, who serves as the administrative chief of all districts in Chittagong region, said rescuers from the army, police and fire services are assisting in the operations, which were taking place in many of the affected areas. ""Most of the people died in landslides, while drowning and lightning were the other causes of death,"" Khan said. ""At least 37 died in Cox's Bazar, 36 in Bandarban and 22 in Chittagong city."" Local officials said the flooding cut off the region from the rest of the country, shutting down roads, rail and air routes and communications. Chittagong's Shah Amanat International Airport, one of three international airports in the country, was closed as floodwaters submerged the runway Tuesday. Airport manager Rabiul Islam said all flights were diverted to Dhaka as the runway was still inundated. Tens of thousands of people in the districts were either stranded or displaced, officials said. ""We're marooned even in the city. ... Most of the roads are under water, and in some places, it is waist-deep,"" said Abdul Momen, a businessman in Chittagong. Aslam Alam, secretary of the Disaster Management and Relief Division of the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, said in Dhaka that many people were evacuated and the government was sending food relief to the affected areas. Crews were trying to restore communications to the region, Alam added. In 2007, at least 126 people were killed in a landslide in Chittagong.","As many as 95 people have been killed, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Ask Bruce Springsteen where he gets his ideas, and he's likely to take you back to a house in Freehold, New Jersey, torn by anger and disappointment. It's not the popular image the singer often projects. At various points in his career, he's been the savior of rock 'n' roll, an American hero, a working-class poet and, perhaps above all, the icon of the Church of Bruce (or, if you prefer, ""Bruuuuuuuce""), with fans hanging on to every utterance, every ticket stub. He's a guitar god, a multimillionaire, a family man. But Springsteen hasn't forgotten. ""The deepest motivation comes out of the house that I grew up in and the circumstances that were set up there, which is mirrored around the United States with the level of unemployment we have right now,"" he told European reporters in an intimate discussion about his new album, ""Wrecking Ball."" The conversation -- a rare chat for the often press-shy musician -- was filmed by director and Springsteen archivist Thom Zimny and turned into a short film, interwoven with music and video from ""Wrecking Ball."" Springsteen's publicists approached CNN about premiering the film after discussions about interviewing Springsteen at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. This is its American premiere. Diehard Springsteen fans have certainly heard some of these stories. In concert -- marathons that can run three hours or more -- he frequently transitions between songs with monologues about his life. The ones he's told about his father, Douglas Springsteen, are like closely examined scars. Even at that, the heartfelt way he discusses his childhood in the film may surprise people: He sits on a bare stage with French TV personality Antoine de Caunes in a Paris theater, reporters arrayed in the orchestra seats, answering with measured, thoughtful observations. The relationship between father and son was fraught when Bruce was a teenager. Doug Springsteen, who died in 1998, held jobs in a rug factory, as a cab driver and as a prison guard. None seemed to last long. At one point the Springsteens were forced to move in with Bruce's grandparents; at another, they rented. Doug Springsteen was not a happy man at the time, and his son's late-night activities, playing in clubs and bars along the Jersey shore, didn't help matters. ""Some nights, [Doug] just sat in the kitchen of the South Street house, drinking beer, with all the lights off,"" writes Marc Dolan in a new Springsteen biography, ""Bruce Springsteen and the Promise of Rock 'n' Roll."" Bruce has described his teenage self coming home late, hoping to tiptoe past the elder Springsteen. Often he didn't make it, and their conversation would descend into a furious argument, one that only ended when his mother intervened. ""My father struggled to find work. I saw that was deeply painful [and] created a crisis of masculinity,"" he said in the Paris talk. ""And that results in a house that turns into quite a bit like a minefield."" American reality vs. the American dream . Almost 40 years after his first album, 1973's ""Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.,"" Springsteen remains a source of fascination. ""Born to Run"" (1975) made him a star; ""Born in the U.S.A."" (1984) made him a phenomenon. In the last two decades his albums have ranged from the brooding (""The Ghost of Tom Joad"") to the loose-limbed (""The Seeger Sessions""), with perhaps the best received -- 2002's ""The Rising"" -- meditating on 9/11. His latest album, the pointedly political ""Wrecking Ball,"" debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's album chart in early March, Springsteen's 10th chart-topper. He's also the subject of two 2012 biographies: Dolan's and a forthcoming volume by Peter Ames Carlin (who has written biographies of Brian Wilson and Paul McCartney). Review: ""Wrecking Ball"" has strong moments . Though the new album has generally earned positive reviews, the politics that undergird it -- and Springsteen's determination to talk about those issues, such as joblessness, corporate greed and governmental responsibility -- have received their share of catcalls. ""He should stick to music rather than interviews in which he offers social commentary,"" wrote Peter Wehner in the the conservative journal Commentary, dismissing Springsteen as ""a $200 million poor boy from New Jersey."" Wehner has been an official in Republican presidential administrations going back to the Reagan era. It's not the first time Springsteen has come under fire. He has been considered out of touch, overrated and, especially in our contentious age, a reciter of ""shallow left-wing talking points,"" in Wehner's description. The latter complaints have followed Springsteen at least since 1984, when he bristled at being invoked by Ronald Reagan in a campaign speech. For Springsteen, ""Wrecking Ball"" is of a piece with his other work -- which, as he's said more than once, describes ""the distance between American reality and the American dream."" ""There is a feeling of patriotism underneath,"" he said of ""Wrecking Ball."" ""At the same time it's a very critical, questioning, often angry sort of patriotism."" A call to attention . Anger is the wellspring for plenty of great rock 'n' roll: Chuck Berry's ""Too Much Monkey Business,"" the MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams,"" the Sex Pistols' ""God Save the Queen"" and pretty much every 17-year-old's decision to turn his amp up to 11. As Springsteen himself has said, ""You can never go wrong pissed off in rock 'n' roll."" But anger is usually overlooked in the popular image of Bruce Springsteen. He's often portrayed as a distinctly American bard, passionate and reassuring, celebrating the open road and eulogizing the past, especially if the present consists of boarded-up Main Streets and closed-down factories. But it's there, in lyrics hissing like hot lead: ""You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past"" (""Adam Raised a Cain""); ""I'm 10 years burning down the road / Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go"" (the oft-misunderstood ""Born in the U.S.A.""); ""The road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone"" (""We Take Care of Our Own""). As Springsteen told an audience at SXSW in March, he has taken the message of the Animals' ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"" seriously, both literally and metaphorically. ""That's every song I've ever written,"" he said. ""That's all of them. I'm not kidding."" It's no act, said Dolan. But it has become a means to an end: a way to inspire his listeners and call attention to social justice. ""As he's gotten older, he has come to believe more in the power of bringing people together with that music and sending them out into the world with ideas that need to be acted on,"" Dolan said. Doug and Bruce Springsteen became close in later years, but the early memories never left Bruce. ""I think a lot of the anger that surfaced in my music from day one comes out of that particular [time],"" he told the European reporters. Springsteen added that some people may not want to hear the anger, or any reminders of real-life anguish. They'll have their own interpretations. ""You put it out there and people hear it, and then it's up to them,"" he said. But Springsteen will keep pushing forward and asking questions -- about himself, about culture, about America and the world. It's probably why he is seen in so many different ways. ""It's funny,"" said Dolan. ""When you do readings about Bruce Springsteen, everybody comes up to you and tells you who they think Bruce Springsteen really is. And all of their opinions are different."" There's nothing Springsteen can do about it except be himself -- anger, compassion, hope and all.","Bruce Springsteen's ""Wrecking Ball"" a sometimes angry look at America today .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- The airline tickets Marianne Ellis buys for a family vacation to Tanzania are refundable with a change fee, but her online travel agent fails to tell her that the fee is about a quarter of the cost of the ticket. Now that she has to cancel, will she lose thousands of dollars? Q: We recently bought five tickets for a family vacation in Tanzania through Cheapoair.com, an online travel agency. A few months later, we found out our daughter would be starting a new job and couldn't make the trip with us. So we phoned Cheapoair to cancel our reservation. When we booked the tickets, a Cheapoair representative told us the tickets were nonrefundable and that if we canceled and used our credit to rebook another flight, we would have to pay a penalty. But I was never told how much the penalty would be. Cheapoair consulted with Northwest Airlines, which agreed to a full refund of all five tickets, which had cost us $2,271 each. Cheapoair then charged us $535 per ticket in cancellation fees. I asked the agency for a breakdown, and it said the fees represented $410 to Northwest, $75 to the consolidator and $50 to Cheapoair. A Cheapoair representative said that when you buy this type of fare and have to cancel, the penalty fees are enormous because the airlines want to recoup their lost revenue. We have accepted our responsibility in the cancellation, but think $535 per ticket is excessive. Can you help? -- Marianne Ellis, Sacramento, California . A: This could have turned out much worse. Your airline could have pocketed all of your money, and you would have been out of luck. Cheapoair sells what are known as ""consolidator"" fares that are often less expensive than the tickets you buy through a traditional travel agent or by booking directly. The reason? It works through a ticket wholesaler that buys tickets in bulk at a big discount. Then it marks up the ticket prices enough to make a profit while still undercutting other published fares. But that's not all. Consolidator tickets typically come with more restrictions than the garden-variety nonrefundable tickets sold by airlines. While some can be canceled and re-used for a future purchase after paying a change fee, others are completely nonrefundable and non-changeable. Meaning that if you have second thoughts about your vacation, your ticket's gone. I don't understand why you wouldn't ask your online travel agent for details on the change fees -- particularly if your daughter is either contemplating a new job or looking for work. If there's even a chance you'll have to cancel your ticket, a consolidator fare isn't the way to go. You should have considered a ticket with more reasonable change fees (although ""reasonable"" is relative -- Northwest charged a $150 fee for international reservations at the time you bought your tickets, which is excessive to a lot of people). I also think the Cheapoair representative with whom you spoke should have warned you about the change fees before you bought the tickets. This might have also been avoided by booking the tickets online, where such terms would presumably be clearly disclosed, instead of calling Cheapoair. But not necessarily. I've seen more than my share of confusing booking screens where important details are buried three screens under a hundred offers to rent a car or reserve a hotel room. I wouldn't have phoned the online agency after being asked to pay these cancellation fees. Instead, a quick e-mail to feedback@cheapoair.com may have yielded better results. Trust me on this: don't call -- e-mail. I agree that $535 in cancellation charges is a little rich, so I contacted Cheapoair on your behalf. I heard back from Sneharthi Roy, the company's senior vice president of operations, who verified that this was a consolidator fare and that the fees were in line with what the company charges. Still, Cheapoair asked its consolidator to waive the fees on your behalf. And it did. You've received a full refund -- a total of $11,355 -- from Cheapoair.

"(CNN) -- Today's heart-wrenching, baby-splitting Supreme Court decision illegitimately rewrote the Affordable Care Act in order to save it. It's certainly gratifying that a majority on the court rejected the government's dangerous assertion of power to require people to engage in economic activity in order to then regulate that activity. That vindicates everything that we who have been leading the constitutional challenge have been saying: The government cannot regulate inactivity. It cannot, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it in summarizing his opinion from the bench, regulate mere existence. Justifying the individual mandate under the taxing power of Congress, however, in no way rehabilitates the government's constitutional excesses. As Justice Anthony Kennedy said in summarizing his four-justice dissent, ""Structure means liberty."" If Congress can avoid the Constitution's structural limits simply by ""taxing"" anything it doesn't like, its power is no more limited than it would be had it done so under the Commerce Clause. Opinion: Health care victory, but still a long way to go . While imposing new taxes may be politically unpopular and therefore harder to do than creating new regulations, that political check does not obviate constitutional ones -- and in any event, Congress had avoided even that political gauntlet here by explicitly structuring the individual mandate as a commercial regulation. Nor does the Supreme Court vindicate its constitutional legerdemain by rewriting the Medicaid expansion to tie only new federal funding to an acceptance of burdensome and fundamentally transformative regulations. While correct on its face -- and a good exposition of the spending power and what strings the federal government can attach to its funds -- that analysis is relevant to a hypothetical statute, not the one that Congress actually passed when it passed health care reform legislation. Opinion: Liberty lost? The Supreme Court punts . Moreover, allowing states to opt out of the new Medicaid regime while leaving the rest of Obamacare in place throws the insurance market into disarray, increases costs to individuals, and gives states a Hobson's choice -- different but no less tragic than the one it previously faced. As Kennedy wrote in dissent, while purporting to apply judicial modesty or restraint, the court's rewriting of the law is anything but restrained or modest. In short, we have reaped the fruits of two poisonous trees of constitutional jurisprudence: On the one (liberal activist) hand, there are no judicially administrable limits on federal power. On the other (conservative pacifist) one, we must defer to Congress and presume (or construe) its legislation to be constitutional. It is that tired old framework -- with four justices in the former category and one in the latter -- that produced the Frankenstein's Monster of today's ruling. Gergen: Are voters ready to move on? What judges should be doing instead is applying the Constitution, no matter whether that leads to upholding or striking down legislation. And a correct application of the Constitution inevitably rests on the Madisonian principles of ordered liberty and limited government that the document embodies. In any event, the ball now shifts to another court, that of the people -- the ultimate sovereigns who, in ratifying the Constitution, delegated certain limited powers to the federal government. Many have opposed Obamacare all along and it is they who must now decide -- or not -- to rein in the out-of-control government whose unconstitutional actions have taken us to the brink of economic disaster. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilya Shapiro.","Ilya Shapiro: High Court rejected notion that mandate justified under Commerce Clause .
But it justified it instead under taxation power; this is constitutional excess, he says .
He says in doing this, the court illegitimately rewrote the health reform act to save it .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Iran threatened Wednesday to halt all imports of goods from South Korea in response to Seoul's announcement a day earlier that it would stop accepting Iranian oil. South Korea said Tuesday that it would suspend all Iranian oil imports from the start of July in response to a European Union insurance ban on tankers carrying crude from Iran. The Iranian ambassador to South Korea, Ahmad Masumifar, responded by saying in an interview with the South Korean news agency Yonhap on Wednesday that Tehran ""may decide to fully stop importing Korean goods."" Reached by telephone, an official at the press office of the Iranian Embassy in Seoul confirmed Masumifar had made the comments to Yonnhap but declined to elaborate further. The EU and United States have been widening sanctions against Iran recently to put pressure on Tehran to curtail its nuclear program. Western powers say they believe the program is intended to build nuclear weapons, but Iran insists it is for peaceful purposes. South Korea is the first major consumer of Iranian oil in Asia to suspend all imports. In 2010, it was the fourth biggest importer of Iranian oil, according to an official from the South Korean Knowledge Economy Ministry. Figures for 2011 aren't yet available, the official said. Iran's other big oil customers in the region are Japan, China and India -- none of which have announced plans to stop receiving shipments. The Knowledge Economy Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that it relies heavily on European companies for insurance of its oil imports and has sent representatives to the EU to make the case for continuing insurance coverage. ""The government has been putting contingency plans in place in case Iranian oil imports would be stopped,"" the statement said. Alternative supplies are being sourced from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait. South Korea already lowered its Iranian oil imports by 44% between January and May -- from 7 million barrels to 3.9 million barrels -- to try to lessen its dependence on them, according to government figures. CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","South Korea is the first major Asian consumer of Iranian oil to stop imports .

"London (CNN) -- A stiff upper lip. Show no emotion. Master of the understatement. The stereotypes about the British have been around since our ships first set sail to collect an empire. Certainly the idea of showing public emotion is a very un-British thing to do. We keep our feelings to ourselves ... or at least we did. Walking around London this weekend one is tempted to believe you've arrived in another country. Large men standing outside pubs singing ""God Save the Queen."" Okay, they were a bit drunk. Roads cordoned off so the bunting can be draped in time for street parties ... my local hardware shop has set up a stall selling Union Jack paper plates, napkins and just about everywhere, flags, flags and more flags. I am well used to seeing a fiesta of stars and stripes in the U.S., but to see so many Union Flags fluttering on buildings from the grand museums to the corner shop in London is a very unusual sight. So this is no usual time as the nation rallies behind the queen as she celebrates her diamond jubilee. I am old enough to remember three jubilee celebrations. The first, was Her Majesty's silver jubilee in 1977. I still have the souvenir mirror I bought on a school trip to London. It cost me Â£2 -- funny how we remember the little facts. I don't remember much else about it except we had time off school! And 25 years later for the golden jubilee, I was front and center covering the event outside Buckingham Palace for CNN. I have no shame in saying tears were in my eyes when the crowds massed around the Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Palace singing the national anthem. The royals arrived on the balcony and Concorde took part in the flypast. Concorde has gone the way of the Super Stratocruiser and the Boeing 707 but the queen remains on the throne and, if the latest polls are to be believed, commands up to 80% support from the British people. It is not hard to see why. In a social media era where we count contributions in 140 characters and have Facebook friends by the hundreds and frankly, none of it much matters, the queen stands for something much, more. Stability. Loyalty. Dedication. Commitment. While these concepts might sound old-fashioned in a here-today-gone-tomorrow world they are the backbone for what monarchy represents. In her coronation broadcast in 1953 the queen pledged herself to a life of service, saying ""Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust."" It was a vow she repeated earlier this year before parliament, saying she would ""rededicate myself to the service of our great country and its people now and in the years to come."" How many of us rededicate ourselves to anything, let alone a promise we made six decades ago? The British people may not go gaga very often but when we do, we do it full throttle. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 all national reserve was lost as we went into emotional collapse. And again, after the Queen Mother's death in 2002, hundreds of thousands of people lined up to pay their respects: The authorities had feared no one would show up! While the royal wedding last year showed we like the glamour that a new star joining the royal team brings. Ultimately, for real deep-seated, honestly felt emotion, that goes to the British core, it is usually left to the very top senior royal, the queen. This weekend, those people who call Elizabeth their queen are saying ""thank you."" So, in my coverage on Sunday and on Tuesday I will be taking all this on board as I bring you the majesty of the day, the fun of the moments and the celebration of the times. I know most of you are not subjects of the crown and so I ask you the indulgence of remembering I am British and this is the celebration of 60 years of my head of state. I promise my coverage will be fair, but it won't be neutral. Listen carefully when she goes past and you may just hear me joining in as the crowd sing ""God Save The Queen.""","The idea of showing public emotion is a very un-British thing to do, says Richard Quest .

"(CNN) -- The Washington Monument will remain closed for repairs for at least another year and possibly into 2014, National Park Service officials said Monday. The 555-foot-tall monument has been closed since an earthquake struck the mid-Atlantic region near Richmond, Virginia, in August 2011. Repairs are expected to begin this fall. The service said that huge scaffolding will be needed for the outside repair work, which will take 12 to 18 months to complete. Some of the repair work will include sealing cracks, removing loose pieces of stone and repairing joints. ""The challenge is most of those cracks are at the very top portion of the monument and the ability to get workers up there to successfully repair it requires a major scaffolding effort,"" said Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. ""The monument is in good shape. It's going to be here for years to come, but in order to safely allow visitors to get up to the top, we need to make those repairs."" Where to find exceptional America . At least nine of the marble panels on the exterior near the top are cracked, according to a post-earthquake assessment. Others are chipped but not in danger of falling, the report said. About 700,000 visitors go to the top of the monument in a typical year, Vogel said. ""It's very disappointing,"" he said. ""I hear from people everyday asking how they can get into it."" Isaac Boria came from Port St. Lucie, Florida, with his wife and two children. Seeing the view from the top of the monument was high on their to-do list. ""That's Mother Nature, "" he said. ""Mother Nature did its thing, and I'd rather be safe than sorry."" Indoor repairs are also required. Some interior tie beams as well as some cracked panels will be fixed. A pedestrian walkway will be redirected to make room for a temporary road for construction vehicles. The 5.8-magnitude earthquake may have also caused the structure to sink a little. In September, the monument was declared structurally sound by engineers. David Rubenstein, co-founder of the investment firm The Carlyle Group, has donated $7.5 million toward the repair project. With Rubenstein's donation and congressional funds that were approved in December, Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes said in January there was enough money to begin the repairs. The Washington Monument was built between 1848 and 1884 and has been repaired three times previously, the most recent work done from 1997 to 2000. CNN's Eric Fiegel and Lindy Royce contributed to this report.","NEW: Top official says repair work complicated because damage is so high .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Nigerian man whose wife was among 153 people killed Sunday when an MD-83 aircraft crashed in Lagos, Nigeria, has filed suit against the manufacturer of the plane and its engines, and against the estate of the American who was piloting the aircraft. In a 56-page lawsuit, David Chukwunonso Allison alleges that the plane and its engines were defective and ""unreasonably dangerous,"" leading to the death of his wife of two years, Joy Allison. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, names the Boeing Co. and its subsidiary, McDonnell Douglas Corp., as well as engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. and United Technologies Corp. It also names the estate of Peter Waxtan of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the pilot of the plane. Dana Air Flight 992 slammed into a two-story apartment building in Lagos' Iju-Ishaga district, killing all 153 people on board and at least 10 people on the ground. Nine Americans were among those killed, the U.S. State Department said. At a news conference Thursday in Lagos, Dana Air CEO Jacky Hathiramani said, ""There are absolutely no words to accurately express our grief and sorrow over this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families and friends of the departed, the Iju-Ishaga community and all Nigerians in this difficult time. We will continue to do our best to assist them in every way possible."" Pratt & Whitney said it wouldn't comment amid an ongoing investigation but ""is cooperating fully with investigating authorities."" ""We are deeply saddened by the lives lost in the recent Dana Airlines incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of all those involved in this incident,"" the company said in a statement. See also: Nigerians demand answers after crash . On the plane's final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport on Sunday, Waxtan issued a mayday call, saying the plane's two engines had failed. A National Transportation Safety Board investigator is assisting Nigerian officials to determine the cause of the crash. Such investigations typically take about a year. While acknowledging that it is not yet known if the pilot, the aircraft, or some other factor was to blame, Allison's attorney Gary Robb said it was essential to file suit early so he could seek to have his investigators -- which include a former NTSB investigator -- inspect wreckage at the scene, and to place the case at the beginning of the lawsuits. Cases are heard in the order they are filed, Robb said, and David Allison ""didn't want to be No.153; he wanted to be No.1,"" Robb said. ""Ultimately, it may turn out that the pilot did everything possible and was not at fault. But these are things that the court system is charged with finding out,"" Robb said. ""What we do know with absolute certainty is that Joy Allison, David's wife, was not a fault."" The suit seeks unspecified damages and requests a jury trial. Robb said Joy Allison worked for the Federal Express licensed office in Lagos, and her husband was with the Nigerian Brewing Co., which distributes Heineken beer products. They had a 1-year-old daughter. Inquiries by CNN to Boeing for comment were not immediately returned. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers contributed to this report.","NEW: Pratt & Whitney says it's ""cooperating fully with investigating authorities""

"(CNN) -- The release of a scathing report on how Penn State University dealt with a sexual predator who for years abused young boys on and off campus is far from the end of the school's troubles. The university is still under scrutiny by the Department of Education and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), inquiries that could further tarnish Penn State's reputation and that of its storied football program. The organization that grants the school's crucial academic accreditation is keeping a watchful eye on the unfurling scandal that centers on university officials' handling of Jerry Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator convicted in June of sexually abusing children over a 15-year period. Two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal, and more charges are possible as the state's Attorney General's Office investigates what Penn State may have known about Sandusky's behavior. Opinion: After Penn State report, it's time to look at Second Mile . Then there's the possibility of a rash of costly civil lawsuits after former FBI Director Louis Freeh's finding that Penn State's most powerful leaders showed ""total and consistent disregard"" for child sex abuse victims and covered up attacks by the school's former assistant football coach. ""The university hired their own executioner when they hired Louie Freeh,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. ""They are going to get pounded in civil litigation,"" likely for millions of dollars by victims who use Freeh's report as ""a roadmap"" in their case. Though in some ways, Callan added, Penn State should be commended for ""hiring an investigator who was so brutally honest"" in his review. Freeh's report was so scathing that some say it could be the nadir of the university's reputation. ""In the public minds, yesterday was the moment that everyone remembers about Penn State, the higher ups and Paterno,"" said Callan. ""You didn't hear it to that extent in even the Sandusky trial. This was likely the biggest moment of adverse publicity the university will endure."" Freeh released the results of the university-funded probe on Thursday, reporting that his team of investigators had found that several school officials had ""empowered"" Sandusky to continue his abuse. More storms looming for Penn State in wake of report . Legendary head football coach Joe Paterno also could have stopped the attacks had he done more, Freeh concluded. ""Our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims by the most senior leaders at Penn State,"" Freeh wrote. ""The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized."" He blamed Paterno, former Penn State President Graham Spanier and administrators Gary Schultz and Tim Curley for having ""never demonstrated ... any concern for the safety and well-being of Sandusky's victims until after Sandusky's arrest,"" while the board of trustees failed to perform its oversight duties. That collective failure ""to protect against a child sexual predator harming children"" lasted ""more than a decade"" and allowed Sandusky to further harm his victims, the full report says. Freeh's 267-page report is separate from a grand jury investigation into charges of perjury and failure to report abuse against Curley, a former athletics director for the school, and Schultz, a former vice president. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno . Trustee Kenneth Frazier, head of the committee addressing the Sandusky scandal, said Thursday that the school's board of trustees is ""deeply ashamed"" by its lack of oversight identified in the report. The board met again on Friday for a regularly scheduled session, and again pledged to make good on implementing the changes. They made some changes Friday including reducing the term of board members from 15 years to 12 years. This change applies to board members elected this year. The board also voted to add 30 minutes of public comment during future board meetings. It has not gone unnoticed that the school has been up front and cooperative with investigators from various organizations since the scandal surfaced last year, said Richard Pokrass, a spokesman for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which issues the school's academic accreditation. Because university leaders have acknowledged a problem and have been up front, it seems unlikely the school will risk losing that accreditation, Pokrass said. ""That being said, the commission certainly feels there are problems that need to be addressed."" Read the report here (PDF) It is less clear what the Department of Education and NCAA inquiries will bring the school. In November, the Education Department notified Penn State that it was looking into the school's compliance with the Clery Act, a federal law that requires universities to report crimes on or near campus and provide timely warnings if reported crimes threaten the campus community. In his report, Freeh said top university officials forged an agreement to conceal Sandusky's sexual attacks more than a decade ago, outlining a culture of secrecy while pointing to an incident in which janitors aware of the abuse took no action, out of fear. ""They witness what I think in the report is probably the most horrific rape that's described,"" Freeh told reporters. ""And what do they do? They panic."" One janitor, a Korean War veteran, said it was ""the worst thing he's ever seen."" He and other janitors were ""alarmed and shocked,"" but were afraid that if they reported it, they'd be fired. The law carries fines of up to $27,500 per violation, but more critically, schools that fail to comply can be suspended from the federal financial aid program, according to the Department of Education. A department spokesman did not immediately return a telephone message left Friday seeking an update on the investigation. Key passages from the report . The NCAA said Thursday that it is reviewing Freeh's report and is awaiting the school's response to a November 17 letter seeking answers to questions about Penn State's institutional control and ethics policies. That letter called the allegations ""deeply troubling"" and said that, if confirmed, appear to show conduct ""starkly contrary to the values of higher education, as well as the NCAA."" The organization has not said what penalties the university could face, and the media relations office did not immediately return a message left Friday. Common penalties include public reprimands and censures, according to the NCAA website. A ban on participation in postseason tournaments and television appearances are less commonly applied. Recruiting restrictions, fines and scholarship reductions are also possible penalties. The NCAA also has the authority to completely shut down participation in a particular sport for repeat violations, the so-called death penalty. Clery Act at center of Penn State probe, 26 years after young woman's murder . The report also could play into the criminal trials for Curley and Schultz, who are accused of failing to report abuse and of lying to investigators looking into the allegations against Sandusky last year. Their attorney said Thursday that Freeh did not have access to critical witnesses and came up with an incomplete report. Curley's attorney termed it a ""lopsided document that leaves the majority of the story untold."" In his report, Freeh said he was asked by the Pennsylvania attorney general not to interview former coach Mike McQueary, instead using information from his testimony before a grand jury in November. Criminal defense attorney Ted Simon said it was ""very, very important"" to note that he wasn't interviewed again because there are still questions about what McQueary specifically told Paterno. ""I think there may be an overstatement with respect to what Paterno knew or did not know,"" he told CNN. ""And I think one has to be very careful about that. Keep in mind, also, McQueary claims he made specific allegations, criminal in nature, to Curley and Schultz. But Curley and Schultz out -- completely deny that. So there's a contest with regard to those facts."" Tom Farrell, Schultz's attorney, said at trial the jury will learn that there was no effort among the four leaders to conceal Sandusky's behavior. Whether anyone else will face criminal charges remains to be seen, but Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Thursday that an investigating grand jury is continuing its work. The university is already facing three civil lawsuits, and Tom Kline, the attorney for one Sandusky victim, said Freeh's report documents a ""colossal, monumental"" failure by Penn State leaders that provides a road map for further legal actions in the scandal. Penn State community still admires Paterno, wants to move forward . Penn State leaders disregarded victims, 'empowered' Sandusky . The shower and locker room in the campus Lasch Building will be remodeled, according to university spokesman David La Torre. Some of the sexual assaults occurred in those showers. The plans were drawn up after Sandusky's arrest last fall, but the work won't be done until legal proceedings in the case are completed. La Torre provided no further details. Penn State President Rodney Erickson said substantial security changes have been made in the building and other athletics facilities.

"Hollywood, Florida (CNN) -- Connor Boss appears to be just like any other contestant waiting to sign into the Miss Florida USA pageant until it is her turn to fill out the registration sheet. Boss, with her nose almost touching the paper, has trouble reading the form. Boss, 18, is the first legally blind contestant to compete for Miss Florida USA.

"(CNN) -- Spain's Dani Pedrosa continued his hot streak by claiming pole for the Italian MotoGP Saturday on his Repsol Honda. Pedrosa, who won last weekend's German round of the championship, clocked one minute 47.284 seconds on the Mugello circuit to edge out compatriot Jorge Lorenzo on his Yamaha. It was the 26-year-old Pedrosa's 21st pole in MotoGP and he benefited from a mechanical problem with Lorenzo's bike at the end of the session. On his last flying lap, Lorenzo came to a halt and had to settle for second quickest. ""I had engine problems in the final corners and I had to stop,"" said Lorenzo, who leads Pedrosa by 26 points in the title standings. ""We have to correct this problem before tomorrow,"" he told the official MotoGP website. Reigning champion Casey Stoner, who crashed out in Germany on the last lap when in second place, could only manage fifth place behind teammate Pedrosa. It left the way clear for Hector Barbera of Spain on his Ducati to take third on the grid and start on the front row Sunday with Pedrosa and Lorenzo. Nicky Hayden of the United States was fourth fastest, outqualfying his Ducati teammate Valentino Rossi, who was only 10th best. Pedrosa was delighted with his performance, but warned that he faced tough opposition from Lorenzo in particular on race day.

"Hollywood, Florida (CNN) -- Connor Boss, the first legally blind contestant to compete for Miss Florida USA, was a top five finalist at the pageant Saturday but fell short of the title. The crown went to Michelle Aguirre, Miss Broward County Fair USA. But Boss, 18, who was diagnosed 10 year ago with a hereditary eye disease, isn't likely to lose too much sleep. Before the contest, she said the older she gets the less importance she places on winning the crown. ""I've come to learn that it's not even about winning the pageants,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The recent announcement by the United Nations that 89% of the world's population (6.1 billion people) now has ""sustainable access to safe drinking water"" was described by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon as a ""great achievement for the people of the world."" Meeting part of the target of one of the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead of the 2015 deadline was ""a testament to all those who see (them) not as a dream, but as a vital tool,"" he added. But the goal of universal access to clean water is far from complete says Stef Smits, program officer for IRC International Water and Sanitation Center. ""Reaching the last 10% of the population -- those living in remote rural areas and on the fringes of big cities -- will become increasingly difficult and expensive,"" Smits said. Furthermore, he says, the MDGs on basic sanitation are unlikely to be met before 2025. It's an area which the U.N. concedes is ""lagging far behind"" the millennium commitments, with 2.5 billion people (including one billion children) still exposed to poor sanitation and one child dying every 20 seconds as a consequence, the U.N. estimates. But hope that this horrifying statistic can be eradicated is being fueled by technology which is helping monitor water supplies more quickly and efficiently. U.S.-based NGO Water for People is helping lead the charge in this area with the development of a new system called FLOW (Field Level Operations Watch). Opinion: 'The Washington Well of Hope' The mobile technology android-based system uses camera and GPS to collect information on wells and pumps. These then link to a web-based dashboard where survey data can be tracked on Google Maps and Google Earth, according to Water for People. ""Lots of organizations do monitoring and that's great, but it tends to be a very slow process,"" said Keri Kugler, Water for People's senior manager of programmatic data. ""This is something that (can be done in) real time. You can look at the data as soon as it's collected, allowing organizations to make really quick decisions,"" she added. The Liberian government, in partnership with the World Bank's Water and Sanitation program, has already put it to good use Kugler says, mapping 10,000 water points during 2011. Various countries are experimenting with mobile monitoring, which could play a vital role in solving long-term sanitation issues, IRC's Stef Smits says. The secret life of drinking water . ""It reduces the cost of data collection and hopefully reduces the downtime. I think the U.N. estimates that one in three water pumps are not working at any given moment -- that's a shocking number,"" Smits said. Water for People recently teamed up with Akvo, a Dutch open source software company, to help develop the FLOW's (now officially called Akvo FLOW) features and international reach. Twelve years ago, when it inaugurated its MDGs for Ensuring Environmental Sustainability, the U.N. stated: ""Improvements in sanitation are bypassing the poor."" Today, little appears to have changed. ""Water sanitation is a harder goal to get to. There just aren't enough NGOs out there to put a latrine in every household,"" Kugler said. But efforts to shift the emphasis away from traditional methods of improving sanitation to simple technology-based ones might pay dividends. ""Traditionally, there have been a lot of reasons why organizations don't want to monitor -- too expensive, too time-consuming and too difficult to do,"" Kugler said. ""The aim of FLOW is to remove some of those barriers and create something that is easy to use.""","Despite improvements in clean water supply, U.N. says sanitation still ""lagging far behind""

"(CNN) -- Passengers on an American Eagle flight arriving at Chicago's O'Hare airport got an unexpected jolt Wednesday when the right wing of a Boeing 747 cargo plane taxiing for departure clipped the tail of the commuter plane. None of the 18 passengers and three crew members was injured, an American Eagle spokeswoman said. American Eagle Flight 4265, an Embraer-140, had just arrived from Springfield, Missouri, and was taxiing to the gate when the incident occurred around 1 p.m. The 747 cargo plane involved in the collision, operated by EVA Airways, was heading to Anchorage, Alaska. All passengers got off the smaller plane while officials inspected the damage to both, according to American Eagle spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan. O'Hare airport is the sixth busiest passenger airport in the world, according to the latest data available from Airport Council International, a trade organization representing airports. The Chicago Tribune reported last year that federal officials launched an investigation focused on O'Hare airport after numerous mistakes made by air traffic controllers. The paper said the majority of errors involved failing to keep proper distance between planes on the ground and in the air.

"(CNN) -- Fourteen months to the day after an earthquake devastated Christchurch's 19th century cathedral, work is starting on a new center of worship reflecting the spirit of 21st century design. The ""cardboard"" cathedral designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban is a temporary structure which will accommodate 700 worshipers while a new permanent cathedral is built. ""The Transitional Cathedral is a symbol of hope for the future of this city as well as being sustainable and affordable,"" Richard Gray from the Transitional Cathedral Group said in a statement. The A-framed structure, which uses cardboard tubes along with timber, steel and a concrete base, is also the most stable shape for buildings in earthquake zones, according to Ban. Designed by English architect George Gilbert Scott, Christchurch Cathedral was badly damaged in the earthquake which struck the city on New Zealand's south island on February 22 2011 claiming 185 lives. The initial 6.3-maginitude shock toppled its spire with aftershocks in the following months causing further destruction, including the west wall and its ornate rose window. In March this year, Bishop Victoria Matthews announced the cathedral would be demolished because of the ""staggering"" costs of repair estimated to be up to NZ$100 million ($82 million). The new building will go up on the site of St John's Latimer Square, another church nearby which also collapsed in the earthquake. Shigeru Ban's cardboard creation builds on previous work using the material, including paper log houses which provided emergency shelter following the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan and a ""paper bridge"" which was erected on a site near the Pont du Gard in southern France. The cathedral is the largest emergency structure he has designed and will cost around NZ$5 million ($4 million) to complete. ""It's a symbol of life. New life in Christ for Christians, and it's right beside a place of death, and life is stronger than death,"" Bishops Matthews told TVNZ. The building will also be used for concerts, exhibitions, civic and community events according to the Christchurch Cathedral web site and is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.","A ""cardboard cathedral"" has been given the go-ahead for construction in Christchurch, New Zealand .

"(CNN) -- Journalism can be an unforgiving profession. Mistakes are easy to make, and they're usually made publicly, which means red faces and awkward apologies all around. The only comfort is that everybody -- EVERYBODY -- makes them at some point. We'll prove it to you. Here are nine CNN journalists -- including anchor Brooke Baldwin, in the video above -- sharing their most embarrassing professional moments and what they learned from them. Actually record . It doesn't matter how awesome your interview is if you don't have a record of it. Steve Goldberg, a CNN senior producer, learned that one the hard way. ""I was covering UGA for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and had a big interview lined up with the university president,"" he says. ""I went in with my tape recorder, took only brief notes, only to get back to the office and discovered that the batteries had died and I didn't have a recording."" So Goldberg had to swallow his pride and go back to the university. ""I asked sheepishly if I could redo the interview and, much to my surprise, he said yes. Lesson learned: Make sure I put in fresh batteries before the big interview!"" It's critical to make sure you're intimately familiar with your equipment before you go out in the field to avoid such mistakes.(Mistakes, by the way, that many a CNNer have admitted to making.) And along those lines, make sure you actually, you know, hit record. (Yup, we've done that, too.) Check your facts -- and your geography . CNN.com designer Ken Uzquiano single-handedly ceded Wales to England. True story. He created a map of the UK to go along with a crime story on CNN.com. The only problem was, he left off Wales, instead marking the country as part of England. ""Within two minutes, it was all over the blogs,"" Uzquiano remembers. And indeed it was. The UK-based tech blog The Register wrote: . ""We have some bad news for those of you who woke up this morning thinking you were Welsh: As of right now, you're English, and you'd just better get used to the idea. ... Although the offending map has now been removed, when we rang the Welsh Assembly this morning a very glum spokesperson admitted, 'If CNN says we're English then it must be true.' "" Always have someone -- preferably someone with knowledge of the subject -- look over your stories before you make them public. And double-check your locators, because there's a Decatur in almost every state, and you want to make sure you're talking about the right one. Name (the right) names . CNN video producer Jo Parker had painstakingly checked her facts. She'd gotten both sides of the story. She'd included fantastic, descriptive quotes. Only one problem: She was writing about the wrong guy. ""As a fairly new reporter, I was covering my first town council meeting. I was really proud of the way I'd balanced the story and included terrific quotes,"" Parker remembers. ""I was trying hard to gain credibility, since the previous reporter had irritated local officials by being careless with balance and fairness issues."" ""The next day, the story came out. Before I could finish patting myself on the back, I realized that I'd written about a town council member -- but used the local district attorney's name."" Oops. Parker says the mistake taught her to immediately admit the error, take responsibility and apologize as soon as possible. But, perhaps most importantly, ""triple-check the things you 'know,' "" she says. Listen up . If you work in TV, you know that live segments have incredible potential for embarrassing screw-ups. CNN iReport producer Rachel Rodriguez was getting ready to present a somber story when she heard the anchor give her an unexpectedly lighthearted intro. ""It was Memorial Day, and I was doing a piece about soldiers we'd lost, so it was a really sad, serious story,"" she says. ""I don't know how the anchor got the wrong information, but she gave me an intro along the lines of 'It's a beautiful Memorial Day outside, and everyone's picnicking and enjoying the lovely weather! CNN iReport's Rachel Rodriguez has more on how people are taking advantage of this gorgeous day! Rachel!' "" Rodriguez remembers the pit in her stomach growing as she heard the intro on her earpiece. ""There was no graceful way out of it,"" she says. ""I just had to take control and turn the conversation around as best I could without making it sound like we were making light of the deaths of soldiers."" The key to recouping? Listen. Whether you're conducting an interview or narrating a segment, make sure you're paying attention to the other person and not just mindlessly reading your notes (or the teleprompter). Chances are, you'll need to react to something they say. Put everything in context . CNN iReport producer David Williams found a creative -- if entirely unintentional -- way to combine two hot entertainment topics in 2006: Madonna and ""Snakes on a Plane."" He was filling in for the entertainment producer, and it was ""at the height of the 'Snakes on a Plane' hysteria,"" Williams remembers. ""We ran a story about snake handlers having to deal with large amounts of snake poop during production. I gave it the brilliant but juvenile headline 'Poop on a Plane' and went on with my day."" His fatal flaw? ""I didn't really think about how this would look on the CNN.com homepage,"" he says. ""The headline above it was about Madonna causing a stir in Germany,"" says Williams. ""It looked sort of like this: German authorities watching Madonna poop on a plane. The fine folks at Gawker had a good time with it."" Amusing, but whether you're writing headlines or choosing quotes to go in a story, the lesson is the same: Take the time to think about the context for your words. Often, that will shape how you use them. The devil is in the details . ""When CNN first started going to a system of running videos off of computer codes, it was easy to get the eight-digit numbers mixed up,"" says CNN senior producer Tricia Escobedo. I think you can tell where this story is going. ""One day, when I was a TV writer for CNN International, two of the top stories were the annual 'running of the bulls' in Pamplona, Spain, and some sort of violence in the Middle East,"" Escobedo recalls. ""I wrote the story for the anchor to read on CNNI over the video of the deadly violence, but inadvertently put in the number for the running of the bulls. I was horrified when I heard the anchor read about mayhem in the Middle East -- and saw the video of a bunch of crazed bulls chasing after some nutty tourists!"" ""So the lesson is: Check those minor details and logistics,"" she says. ""They can lead to major mess-ups."" Relax . Ah, internships. Time and scene of so many mistakes. Well, let's call them ""learning experiences."" Toward the beginning of his career, CNN video copy editor James Dinan interned with the news department of a radio station in Newton, New Jersey. ""After a couple of days learning the ropes and staying out of trouble, I was offered the chance to cover one of the World Cup soccer games from Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey,"" Dinan recalls. ""It was a simple task -- do a live spot about the game itself, as well as record one or two features about the sights and sounds surrounding the game."" Remember what we said earlier about live segments having excellent potential for mess-ups? Yeah. ""It was time for my live shot, and I was prepared. Or so I thought,"" Dinan says. ""The first words out of my mouth... ""Italy rebounded from its opening match defeat by upending Norwegia, 1-0. ""Norwegia? Wasn't that a fictitious country featured in 'Duck Soup' or a Three Stooges short?"" he jokes. ""I was supposed to say Norway, but I had Norwegian on the brain and, somehow, the two managed to fuse together into a made-up word."" Luckily, Dinan's boss let him cover another game, Ireland vs. Norway, and he pronounced the country's name perfectly the second time around. His slip-up is a reminder not to psych yourself out before going on camera -- and not to worry too much about the little things. Read it out loud . Here at CNN, we get our fair share of prank phone calls with super-fun fake names. But even if it's not a prank name, it helps to stop and think about -- and pronounce out loud -- any name you come across. ""In my first job in journalism, among the many things I had to do at a teeny-tiny paper was edit an advice column written by the newsroom staff,"" says CNN senior editor Jan Winburn. ""People called in questions, and the newsroom secretary transcribed them and handed them around to staffers to track down answers."" One day, someone called in the following question: ""I would like to find out why Jack Hammers and his equipment are allowed to work at 4 a.m. on Clinkscales and Worley and disturb people's sleep."" See where this is going? ""The reporter who got this question dutifully called the city public works department and wrote an answer something to the effect that no one at the department was aware of anyone working at that intersection,"" says Winburn. ""The joke, of course, is that she transcribed the question off the phone as Jack Hammers instead of jackhammer ... and I didn't catch it!"" Winburn has kept the clip for more than 10 years. Pro tip: It always helps to read your stories out loud, even if you're writing for print. Not only does it help make the writing flow, it makes it easier to catch embarrassing errors. And always have a second person read over your story.","CNN's iReport Boot Camp challenges iReporters to improve their storytelling chops .

"(CNN) -- The African Union has elected Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to lead the 54-nation bloc after a hotly contested election. The 63-year-old South African home affairs minister is the first woman to hold the post and is the ex-wife of South African President Jacob Zuma. Sunday's election, which took place in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, follows a stalemate in January that left 69-year-old incumbent Jean Ping of Gabon in power after neither side could secure the necessary two-thirds majority. The run up to the election largely split the continent in two, with West and Francophone Africa firmly behind Ping, while Zuma's counterparts in the Southern African Development Community firmly backed her bid. Challenges are likely to come quickly for the new head of the AU as she deals with the aftermath of recent coups in Guinea Bissau and Mali. Ping was criticized as being slow and ineffective in his response to last year's coup in Cote D'Ivoire and the revolution in Libya. Zuma is a more ""professional, more accountable and more proficient"" person than Ping, said Mehari Maru with the Institute of Security Studies in Addis Ababa, but warned it would likely take months for a change in leadership strategy to take place.","Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is South Africa's home affairs minister .

"London (CNN) -- The red carpet is fashion's grandest stage where stars line up to see and be seen. But who you are wearing is as important as who you are. If Livia Firth, wife of Academy Award-winning actor Colin, gets her way, the kind of fabric you are wearing will be just as essential. Now in its third year, the Green Carpet Challenge was established to persuade top designers to dress the world's most famous faces in clothing that is ecologically friendly and socially responsible. ""First of all, you want to wear something that is made with non-toxic materials and dyes and also that it's made by people who are happy fundamentally,"" Firth says. She has worn yarn made from recycled plastic bottles to the Golden Globes, material from repurposed thrift store finds for the Oscars and discarded fabric to meet Queen Elizabeth II. Now she is persuading some of the biggest names in film and fashion to follow suit including designer and film director Tom Ford, Hollywood legend Meryl Streep and rising star Michael Fassbender. ""A designer will create a gown for an actress anyway. So what we do is to work with the designers to switch the fabric to eco-alternatives,"" Firth said. One of Firth's own ""green carpet"" triumphs was an emerald green gown made of upcycled fabric created from scratch by British designer Henrietta Ludgate who produces her designs out of a small workshop/showroom in London. ""We source from mills in Scotland and England. We upcycle fabrics and we produce everything locally. It's zero clothes miles,"" Ludgate said. Sourcing fabrics this way allows Ludgate to oversee every step of the production process which she says leads to a superior product but not perhaps superior profits. ""People buy for design rather than sustainability. When they find out about it, I'm hoping that they will buy more!"" But fashion journalist Lucy Siegle would like to see people buying less. She started the Green Carpet Challenge with Firth in 2009 in the hope it would encourage people to try new things with uncommon materials and clothes already in existence. ""Innovation, as it's told by mainstream fashion, is about wearing the latest look from the latest celebrity or whatever,"" Siegle said. ""Ironically, we are working with celebrities, but we're showing that it's not just about imitating a trend. It's actually about techniques, about tailoring and heritage fabrics. It's about the narrative of a piece,"" she added. It's a trend that Livia Firth hopes will continue. ""Next year we hope to have a dedicated lane at the Oscars for the Green Carpet Challenge people,"" Firth said.","Livia Firth's Green Carpet Challenge puts ethical fashion in the spotlight .

The very last Truffula Tree of them all! A community where the last tree is cut down to make a ""Thneed"" that no one needs. Where real trees have been replaced by artificial ones with disco lights. A plastic city where people pay for clean air. That's the smoggy setting of ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,"" the country's No. 1 movie for the second weekend in a row. Based on the Dr. Seuss 1971 classic, the environmentally themed movie has attracted children and adults to the theaters, earning $121.7 million in its first 10 days, according to Hollywood.com. The movie made $70 million on its first weekend in release, the biggest opening weekend for a movie this year and about double what Hollywood.com box office division president Paul Dergarabedian had estimated. Even midweek ticket sales for the film, produced by Illumination Entertainment and released by Universal Pictures, have been high. "" 'The Lorax' exceeded expectations by a mile, it was crazy,"" said Dergarabedian. ""The visuals are irresistible, and it was a powerful draw for people. It's a terrific movie at the end of the day, entertaining to parents as much as to the kids."" Mother Megan Kalweit agrees. ""We went the day that it opened, and my 3-year-old sat through the entire movie completely interested,"" said Kalweit, an Arlington, Illinois, stay-at-home mom of two boys. ""We were talking about it on the way home, and for a 3-year-old, he got a lot of the concept. It had a strong message that unfortunately is something that all of us are going to need to be more aware of moving forward."" Audiences want family-friendly fare . Any Dr. Seuss movie will have a built-in audience among adults who remember the books from their childhood and the children who are reading those classics now. And although every major movie studio now has an animation unit, they haven't released much this year to satisfy the demand for family-friendly fare, according to Thom Geier, senior editor at Entertainment Weekly. ""The last big family film hit was 'Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,' way, way back in December, so there's been a pent-up demand for family films as a lot of schools head into spring break,"" said Geier. ""Two other factors in the Lorax's huge opening: A really successful marketing campaign by Universal -- the voice cast was all over sister network NBC in the week before the opening -- and the fact that it's in 3-D, which means higher ticket prices and profits for the theaters and the studio."" The movie is not without its critics. While not objecting to the movie itself, some parents claim that some of the movie's commercial tie-ins with IHOP, Mazda and other companies ignore the Lorax's essential green message. (The studio also has partnerships with Seventh Generation, Whole Foods and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others.) ""In the movie, the corporate 'bad guy' puts up billboards for products saying 'Lorax Approved,' and the message was that co-opting the Lorax's image and brand is a bad thing,"" said Jennifer Taggart, a blogger and author of ""Smart Mama's Green Guide: Simple Steps to Reduce Your Child's Toxic Chemical Exposure."" ""To me, the compelling message of the book, and the movie, was that slick advertising can make us want things we don't need, and producing them can result in catastrophic environmental harm,"" said Taggart. ""And yet, Universal Pictures has completely ignored that message, as have the launch partners, by slickly advertising Lorax-approved products -- products that we don't need."" ""We tried to look for partners who provided some sort of a good environmental choice for consumers,"" said a Universal Pictures spokesperson, declining to comment further on the debate over the commercial tie-ins. ""We are absolutely thrilled at the response to 'The Lorax.' "" Companies want you to ""buy, buy, buy"" That's why parents like Hannah Laurison, who lives in Oakland, California, are refusing to take her children to the movie. Laurison reads the book to her daughters, 2 and 4, to teach them about how their actions and the things they buy affect the environment. ""This kind of corporate green-washing is the antithesis of the Lorax's message,"" said Laurison. ""The Mazda ad in particular upends the Lorax's message in order to sell cars. Instead of taking my (4-year-old) daughter to see the movie, we are having conversations about how some companies just want you to buy, buy, buy, without thinking about what that means for the trees, the animals and people."" Movie experts say tie-ins are a fact of life for many movies, and especially children's animation flicks. Without added revenue from movie-themed toys, fast-food tie-in deals, DVDs and related books, family-friendly fare won't get made, says Entertainment Weekly's Geier. (Universal didn't order up a Lorax-themed Happy Meal.) The movie's marketing efforts and its success at the box office is helping multiple Dr. Seuss books get back onto the best-seller lists, according to John Sellers, children's reviews editor at Publishers Weekly. ""His books are perennial favorites, of course, but the film and all the marketing muscle behind it certainly have a hand in that kind of sales bump,"" says Sellers. ""And while companies like Mazda have drawn fire for their ties to the Lorax film, publishers routinely publish numerous book tie-ins to capitalize on upcoming movies. Random House has published Lorax activity books, early readers and a pop-up book this spring. They aren't just banking on the original book."" Erin Moya, whose 3-year-old son has spina bifida, prefers to focus on the movie's message that one person can make a difference -- and must try even if no one else agrees. ""It's not only about caring for your environment, but also about speaking up for those who can't speak for themselves,"" said Moya, who lives in Gainesville, Florida. ""Whether we're talking about trees or children with disabilities, it's important to me that my son knows from an early age to always try to do the right thing -- even if you're the only one trying."" And that's the Lorax narrator's message to all his little readers. UNLESS someone like you . cares a whole awful lot, . nothing is going to get better. It's not.

"(WIRED) -- Passing earwax-tainted earbuds between friends is nobody's favorite way to share iPod tunes. An integrated speaker in the smaller iPod nano and iPod shuffle models could end that practice for good, and provide opportunity for a host of new iPod possibilities. A newly published Apple patent describes how Apple could add a teeny speaker dome to the clip on the iPod shuffle or iPod nano. It's a sneaky way to add some extra functionality to Apple's smallest media players -- all without adding any extra bulk. According to the patent, which was broken down by Patently Apple, the addition of a speaker would be a ""natural evolutionary step for their media players."" The addition of a speaker -- along with Apple's embrace of the iPod nano as a wrist-worn device and the integration of Nike+ exercise software -- would also position Apple well for targeting the same fitness market that's home to the Motorola Motoactv, NPD analyst Ross Rubin says. Over the past two years, several signs have pointed to one or more iPod lines being discontinued. Indicators include lackluster sales (last quarter, Apple sold 6.6 million iPods, a 27 percent decline from the same period in 2010), and a dearth of product refreshes for the shuffle and classic models. Nonetheless, Apple continues to support its beloved line of media players. And now it seems new energy may be breathed into the line. CEO Tim Cook said iPod is a ""large and important product"" for the company at Apple's 2011 iPhone event. And Apple recently dropped the prices of its nano and touch iPod models, making them more competitive and more accessible to a wider market. Current iterations of the nano and shuffle have no external speaker, but the larger iPod touch does have one. The iPod nano-like Motoactv, a wearable fitness-tracking music player. Rubin sees the addition of a speaker to, say, an iPod nano as a gateway to a slew of new use-case scenarios. ""One thing it might point to is the nano being used to interface with an iOS device,"" Rubin says, much the way the Motoactv can sync with an Android device, and be used to relay the arrival of calls or text messages on its small screen. Rubin says future nanos could be worn on your wrist, displaying social media updates relayed from an iPad stowed away in your backpack or messenger bag. A nano with a small speaker could also feature an audible alarm, making timed work-out tracking all the more convenient -- useful when you want to use Nike+ without earbuds. Rubin also points out that you could activate Siri requests using the small screen on your wrist and have answers relayed to you through the speaker. If the speaker only ended up being used as a music playback mechanism, Rubin says, ""It wouldn't make a radical difference"" in how we use or perceive iPods. True, but not needing to share earbuds anymore? Still a plus. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(WIRED) -- Gerald ""Jerry"" Lawson, creator of the first cartridge-based videogame console, died Saturday morning in a Mountain View, California, hospital, WIRED.com has learned. Lawson was 70. As an engineer at Fairchild Semiconductor, Lawson designed the electronics of the Fairchild Video Entertainment System, later renamed the Channel F, in 1976. Predating the release of Atari's Video Computer System by a year, the Channel F was the first videogame machine that used interchangeable game cartridges, which Fairchild sold separately. Previous game machines like Atari's ""Pong"" and the Magnavox Odyssey had all their games built into the hardware. Lawson's pioneering design set the standard for the game consoles of today. ""Jerry was an amazing personality,"" said family friend David Erhart, who broke the news of Lawson's death Monday on the Digital Press website. ""He created part of the videogame industry history in Silicon Valley and it was always a pleasure to hear his stories about back in the day."" Much of Lawson's background is discussed in a wide-ranging interview he gave Vintage Computing and Gaming in 2009. A lifelong engineer and tinkerer, Lawson was born in 1940 and grew up in a federal housing project in Queens, New York. As a kid, he operated a ham radio; as a teenager he earned money by repairing his neighbors' television sets. In the 1970s, living and working in Silicon Valley, he joined the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of early hackers that included Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Lawson's contributions to videogames began with ""Demolition Derby,"" a coin-operated arcade machine that he created in his garage while working at Fairchild. ""Fairchild found out about it -- in fact, it was a big controversy that I had done that. And then, very quietly, they asked me if I wanted to do it for them,"" Lawson said in the Vintage Computing interview. Although similar machines were in development at Atari and RCA at the time, the console Lawson's team built for Fairchild was the first cartridge-based gaming system that came to market. Although it seems simple now, making the technology work wasn't easy. ""There was a mechanism that allowed you to put the cartridges in without destroying the semiconductors.... We were afraid -- we didn't have statistics on multiple insertion and what it would do, and how we would do it, because it wasn't done. I mean, think about it: Nobody had the capability of plugging in memory devices in mass quantity like in a consumer product. Nobody."" Only 26 cartridges were ever released for Channel F, all simple games like ""Blackjack,"" ""Space War"" and ""Bowling."" When Atari released its cartridge-based system, Channel F was quickly rendered obsolete. Years later, Lawson started his own company, Videosoft, to produce Atari 2600 cartridges, but only released one, a technician's tool called ""Color Bar Generator."" Last month, the International Game Developers Association honored Lawson's pioneering efforts at Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. ""The whole reason I did games was because people said, 'You can't do it,'"" he told the San Jose Mercury News last month. ""I'm one of the guys, if you tell me I can't do something, I'll turn around and do it."" In later years, Lawson had suffered the severe effects of diabetes. He lost sight in one eye and lost one of his legs to the disease, leaving him confined to a wheelchair. On Wednesday, not feeling well, he was admitted into El Camino Hospital Mountain View. ""He continued building devices to control telescopes, lasers, tools, etc. up until the day he went to the hospital,"" said friend Erhart. ""His workbench had more tools than most people would even know what to do with. He taught me quite a bit and I'll miss him sorely."" At 6:15 a.m. Saturday, Lawson died after apparently suffering a heart attack. He is survived by his wife, son and daughter. The family is planning a memorial service in mid-May.

"(CNN) -- For the past week, the political fireworks surrounding the landmark decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the Affordable Care Act rivaled the excitement of Independence Day pyrotechnics. President Obama is facing heavy criticism from Republicans that he has raised taxes on working- and middle-class Americans because the court upheld the individual mandate based on Congress' power to tax. The president and the Democrats are arguing that the mandate is not a tax but rather a penalty, since those who do not buy health insurance are paying a penalty in the form of a tax. Meanwhile, on Monday a top adviser to Mitt Romney raised consternation among Republicans by saying that the individual mandate is not a tax, countering the prevailing conservative view. Soon after, Romney himself made his much anticipated statement on the issue on TV, saying that since the Supreme Court has declared that the individual mandate is a tax, then it must be a tax. Tax? Not a tax? What's going on? The fact of the matter is this: As for who wins the White House, there is probably very little at stake for either Romney or President Obama in the debate over the tax status of the individual mandate. However the mandate is enforced -- as a tax or as a penalty -- it is a rounding error in the total tax increases in the Affordable Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the individual mandate will raise $17 billion in revenue for the Treasury between 2015, when the first taxes or penalties would be collected under the provision, and 2019. Aside from the individual mandate, the health care law includes numerous tax increases, for a total of more than $400 billion between 2010 and 2019, according to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation. About half that amount, $210 billion over 10 years, comes from the increase in the Medicare payroll tax and a new Medicare tax on interest, rent and other investment income for individuals who earn more than $200,000 or families that earn $250,000 annually. But other changes that raise Americans' tax bills include the reduction in the maximum annual contribution -- now capped at $2,500 -- to Health FSAs (your employer might call it your ""cafeteria plan"" to help pay for medical expenses). There is also an increase in the percent of your income that you must spend on medical expenses before those expenses are tax deductible, up to 10% from 7.5%. These two provisions taken together will raise taxes by about $28 billion over the law's first decade. By 2019, the year when all the health care law's tax increases will be in effect, the taxes raised by the Affordable Care Act are estimated to be 0.49% of GDP. That is the 10th largest tax increase since 1950. In 2019, it will be the largest tax increase in the 26 years since Bill Clinton's 1993 tax increases. Whether the $17 billion from the individual mandate is a tax is hardly necessary for the Republicans to argue that President Obama raised taxes. Nor does the mandate being a penalty clear the president's record on taxes. The Obama administration and Democrats point out that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the health care law will reduce total annual budget deficits between now and 2021. There is considerable controversy over the estimate of the effect of the health care law on deficits, but that aside, it will raise taxes -- and a lot of them. Some Republicans insist that campaigning against the president on the individual mandate as a tax is still important. Because while most of the taxes are levied on employers, corporations and high-earners (including small businesses), the individual mandate is a direct tax on low- and middle-income Americans. If the mandate is a tax, they argue, the president has broken his pledge not to raise taxes on working- and middle-class Americans. But, in the court of public opinion, conservatives have already won on the issue of the individual mandate. Time and time again, when polled over the last two years, a majority of Americans have opposed the national requirement to buy health insurance. Looking at self-identified independent voters, those swing voters who decide elections, a March 2012 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that only 32% supported a mandate with a ""penalty"" for noncompliance. While the charge that ""you raised taxes on hard-working Americans"" is a good go-to move in American politics, it might not be possible for Republicans to gain more political advantage off the individual mandate than they already have. So what will matter to voters on Election Day? How about principled arguments about what ""good government"" looks like and the proper balance between personal economic security and individual liberty? And what about a clear, concrete vision for returning prosperity to working- and middle-class America? Those can be winning issues. For one of the candidates and for all Americans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tammy Frisby.","Tammy Frisby: Republicans, Democrats argue if the individual mandate is a tax or penalty .
Frisby: Debate over the tax status has little effect on who wins the White House .
She says the health care law includes tax increases much higher than the mandate .
Frisby: Conservatives have already won on the mandate issue, as indicated by polls ."
"Atlanta (CNN) -- A large fire at the southwest Atlanta film studio of Tyler Perry on Tuesday night damaged the backlot facade of one of Perry's sound stages, according to a statement from the studio Wednesday. ""We are grateful that there were no injuries and that 99% of the damage is limited to the backlot facade,"" the studio statement said. The building's interior, which was protected from the flames by concrete masonry construction, did suffer some water damage, according to a statement from the Atlanta Fire Department. Officials do not know what started the fire, said Atlanta Fire Capt. Jolyon Bundridge. Perry uses the facade to shoot city street scenes for his movies, including his successful ""Madea"" franchise. When he opened the studio for production four years ago, Perry named the backlot 34th Street, ""as in Miracle on 34th Street."" Each sound stage is named after legendary African-American actors, including Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee and Cicely Tyson. The sound stages are where Perry shoots his TV sitcoms, including ""Meet the Browns"" and ""House of Payne."" Perry was at the complex Tuesday night but did not speak to reporters, CNN affiliate WSB reported. ""Mr. Perry wishes to express his heartfelt thanks to the Atlanta fire department for their professionalism in their quick response and limiting the damage,"" the studio said. The multimillion-dollar studios sit on 60 acres and include five sound stages, a 5-acre pond, a theater, a chapel, a commissary, a gymnasium, Perry's office, an art department where sets are designed, hair and makeup facilities, a wardrobe department, set decoration, a post-production facility and the backlot, according to the studio website. Perry's credits include work as director, writer, producer, actor and playwright. Last year, Perry topped Forbes' ""Entertainment's Highest-Paid Men"" list, raking in $130 million in 12 months beginning in May 2010. CNN's Alan Duke, Jane Caffrey, Joe Sutton and Justin Lear and HLN's Mike Brooks contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Damage is limited to the backlot facade,"" Tyler Perry Studios says .

"Jacksonville, Florida (CNN) -- Republican presidential hopefuls headed into the homestretch of the critical Florida primary campaign Friday after a riveting debate that analysts believe gave Mitt Romney a boost over fellow front-runner Newt Gingrich. Florida voters will decide Tuesday who gets the biggest delegate haul so far of the GOP presidential race, and the CNN/Republican Party of Florida debate provided the four candidates with their final chance to face one another on the same stage in the increasingly vitriolic contest. Romney and Gingrich entered Thursday's debate in a statistical dead-heat for the lead, according to recent polling, with former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Texas Rep. Ron Paul trailing well back. Paul, who concedes he has no chance of victory in Florida's winner-take-all primary, heads to more moderate Maine on Friday to campaign for the caucus that begins February 4, while Romney, Gingrich and Santorum all planned events in Florida to begin their final push for Tuesday's primary. Needing a strong showing to try to blunt Gingrich's harsh attacks of recent days, Romney was forceful and had the former House speaker on his heels on some issues. At the same time, Santorum had his strongest debate performance so far, coming across as a sincere and committed candidate who would best represent conservative principles. ""Romney won two ways tonight,"" said CNN contributor and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. ""One, by having a good debate and two by having Santorum have his best debate yet."" Romney appeals to the more moderate wing of the Republican Party while Santorum and Gingrich are competing for the conservative vote. If Santorum can build support, it would hurt Gingrich as the primary process continues. Paul also had a good night, repeatedly prompting laughter and applause with self-deprecating one-liners and clear messaging about his libertarian policies that excite young supporters. The focus, though, was on the two leaders. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, provided his most forceful and unapologetic statement so far about his vast personal wealth, saying Republicans such as Gingrich shouldn't criticize him for being successful. Romney released his tax returns this week under pressure from Gingrich and others, revealing he paid a rate of less than 15% on income in the millions, mostly from investments including some holdings in offshore accounts. Gingrich had disparaged Romney's wealth on the campaign trail, saying he lived in a world of ""Swiss bank and Cayman Island bank accounts"" and did nothing for his money. Romney previously seemed uncomfortable discussing his finances, initially stalling on releasing his tax records, but he was ready Thursday. ""I think it's important for people to make sure we don't castigate individuals who have been successful and try to suggest there's something wrong with being successful and having investments and having a return on those,"" Romney said. Addressing Gingrich directly, he said: ""You indicated that somehow I didn't earn that money."" ""I have earned the money that I have,"" Romney continued. ""I didn't inherit it. Those investments lead to jobs being created in America. I'm proud of being successful. I'm proud of being in the free enterprise system. I'm not going to run away from that."" On the tax rate issue, Romney noted that combining taxes paid and charitable contributions equaled about 40% of his income, and added to applause: ""Let's put behind this idea of attacking me because of my money and lets get Republicans to say, you know what, what you've accomplished in your life shouldn't be seen as a detriment but an asset to help America."" Other exchanges were just as compelling. Asked to address the housing crisis, one of the major problems facing Florida voters, Gingrich began by claiming that Romney was knowingly and ""unfairly"" attacking him on his consulting record for mortgage giant Freddie Mac, sparking a fiery back-and-forth over which candidate has had a closer relationship with troubled lenders. Gingrich claimed Romney had profited off of investments in both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In turn, Romney explained his holdings were in a blind trust and involved mutual funds that included bonds of the mortgage lenders. Then he turned the tables on Gingrich, pointing out that Gingrich also had similar investments involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which prompted a crowd response. CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen gave that round to Romney, saying Gingrich threw a punch and Romney ""came back and caught him unexpected."" Trying to widen what was becoming a two-man debate, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Santorum and Paul if they believed any profits earned from investing in the government-backed entities should be returned. ""That subject doesn't really interest me,"" Paul replied to laughter, while Santorum sounded exasperated in calling for a halt to what he labeled ""petty personal politics"" that distracted from more important issues. ""Can we set aside that Newt was a member of Congress and used the skills that he developed as a member of Congress to go out and advise companies -- and that's not the worst thing in the world -- and that Mitt Romney is a wealthy guy because he worked hard and he's going out and working hard?"" Santorum said. Later, though, Santorum launched the toughest attack of the night on Romney in an extended back-and-forth over the health care plan Romney got passed in Massachusetts that in some ways served as model for the federal health care reform under the Obama administration. Positioning himself as the strongest opponent of the health care law, Santorum insisted both the Romney plan and the federal plan included a mandate to own health insurance or face a fine -- a concept detested by conservatives. He repeatedly returned to that point when Romney tried to argue the difference between a state plan for Massachusetts and a federal plan for the entire country, saying at one point: ""Your mandate is no different than Barack Obama's mandate."" Throughout the debate, the audience was more vocal than during the previous Florida debate on Monday, when attendees were asked to hold their applause. Gingrich complained after the Monday debate against denying spectators the right to express themselves. Also in contrast to Monday was Romney's approach, standing casually with a hand in his pocket for most of the two hours while responding with force to Gingrich salvos. Afterward, Romney pronounced himself delighted with the debate, saying he thought it would give him a boost. ""When I'm shot at I'll return fire,"" he said. ""I'm no shrinking violet."" Early in the evening, Romney drew frequent applause when he pushed back attacks by Gingrich over immigration. Gingrich called Romney the most anti-immigrant candidate on the debate stage, repeating a charge in a campaign ad Gingrich eventually pulled after a complaint it was unfair by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Romney responded with outrage, accusing Gingrich of using ""highly-charged epithets"" irresponsibly and denying he wants to deport all of the nation's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. However, Gingrich and Santorum also agreed with Romney that at least some illegal immigrants would be likely to ""self-deport"" if the government were to crack down on employers who hired illegal immigrants. All three men advocated a system of identification for immigrants that would help employers verify an employee's legal status. Before the debate, Gingrich told an audience on Florida's Space Coast, hit hard by the end of the space shuttle program, that he would build a colony on the moon by the end of his second term in office -- a plan that found little support among his rivals on stage. Santorum said the nation's debt crisis was too severe to consider such proposals, while Romney called the idea deeply flawed. Citing his business experience, Romney said that if an executive had come to him suggesting spending ""billions"" of dollars on a colony on the moon, ""I'd say 'You're fired.'"" Earlier in the day, Gingrich lashed out at Romney, accusing him of engaging in sleazy negative politics and being part of a fragile establishment desperate to stop the former House speaker from winning the GOP nomination. One of Romney's most prominent supporters, former GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, released a statement through the Romney campaign that characterized Gingrich as erratic, unreliable and certain to lead the Republican Party to defeat in November. When Gingrich was in Congress, he ""was a one-man-band who rarely took advice. It was his way or the highway,"" said Dole, a former U.S. senator from Kansas. As speaker, Gingrich ""had a new idea every minute and most of them were off the wall. ... Democrats are spending millions of dollars running negative ads against Romney as they are hoping that Gingrich will be the nominee."" According to a CNN/Time/ORC International survey released Wednesday, 36% of people likely to vote in Tuesday's primary say they are backing Romney, with 34% supporting Gingrich. Romney's margin over Gingrich is well within the survey's sampling error. Santorum was at 11% and Paul at 9%, with 7% undecided. Gingrich received a boost in the polls after his double-digit victory in Saturday's South Carolina primary, but Wednesday's CNN poll and another by the American Research Group indicate that his momentum might be waning.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman, a former Democrat who sits with Democratic caucus, said Tuesday that he would not rule out running for re-election in 2012 as a Republican. Lieberman angered his colleagues in the Democratic caucus this week by threatening to torpedo health care legislation if it contains a government-run public health insurance or an expansion of Medicare. Lieberman said he wasn't sure which party, if any, he would represent in his next election. ""I like being an independent, so that's definitely a possibility,"" the Connecticut senator said. ""But I'd say all options are open."" He called running as a Republican ""unlikely"" but added that he wouldn't ""foreclose any possibility."" ""I've reached the stage in my career where I'm not measuring every step I take based on how it's going to affect the next election,"" Lieberman said. ""I think if you do that, you end up compromising the quality of your service."" In 2000, Lieberman was Al Gore's running mate when Democrats lost the closest presidential national election in U.S. history. Six years later, he was defeated in the Democratic primary and then ran as an independent to win re-election to the Senate. Lieberman still sits with the Democratic caucus, which holds 60 seats in the 100-member Senate, the minimum amount necessary to overcome a filibuster. That dynamic allowed Lieberman to assert his will in the health care debate by threatening to join a Republican filibuster if the health care bill contained the public option or Medicare expansion he opposes. He acknowledged that his stance angered Democratic colleagues but said he acted on principle, not politics. ""I knew some of them were upset about positions I'd taken,"" Lieberman said. ""But like each of them, I didn't get elected by telling my voters in Connecticut that I would follow the majority of my caucus even if I thought on some things they were wrong. We each have to do what we think is right."" Taking a stand in the polarized political environment means ""a bunch of people will think you've done something great and a bunch of people will think you've done something awful,"" Lieberman said. However, Lieberman's stance on the health care bill could prompt a backlash from liberal Democrats. He was criticized by liberal groups, and even his wife -- who formerly worked for a pharmaceutical company -- was targeted. ""I've done what I thought was right, but it's no fun to have your colleagues be angry at you,"" Lieberman said. ""It's no fun to have your wife attacked. But, you know, you got to do what you think is right.""","Independent senator's stance on health care has angered some Democrats .

But he left behind something unusual and -- in the annals of politics -- somewhat extraordinary. Lugar had his aides distribute a prepared statement that was part detailed defense of his ill-fated and often maligned campaign strategy, and part stark warning to both parties about the divisive state of American politics -- starting with Richard Mourdock, the Republican who beat him. ""His embrace of an unrelenting partisan mindset is irreconcilable with my philosophy of governance and my experience of what brings results for Hoosiers in the Senate. In effect, what he has promised in this campaign is reflexive votes for a rejectionist orthodoxy and rigid opposition to the actions and proposals of the other party,"" Lugar wrote of Mourdock, . Read Lugar's statement . Mourdock appealed to Republican voters by arguing Lugar's tolerance for compromise should be replaced by stand-your-ground confrontation. ""He has pledged his support to groups whose prime mission is to cleanse the Republican party of those who stray from orthodoxy as they see it,"" said Lugar of the GOP opponent who beat him. ""This is not conducive to problem solving and governance. And he will find that unless he modifies his approach, he will achieve little as a legislator. Worse, he will help delay solutions that are totally beyond the capacity of partisan majorities to achieve,"" said Lugar. Lugar, a senior Republican statesman who briefed President Dwight Eisenhower as a young naval officer, offered a shot across the bow to today's GOP. He said if Republicans continue to make it difficult for legislators to find compromise, ""we will be relegated to minority status. Parties don't succeed for long if they stop appealing to voters who may disagree with them on some issues."" And he didn't stop there. His stinging words about today's divisive politics were reminiscent of moderate Republican Senator Olympia Snowe's open disgust for what the process has become when she announced she was retiring. ""I don't remember a time when so many topics have become politically unmentionable in one party or the other. Republicans cannot admit to any nuance in policy on climate change. Republican members are now expected to take pledges against any tax increases. For two consecutive presidential nomination cycles, GOP candidates competed with one another to express the most strident anti-immigration view, even at the risk of alienating a huge voting bloc,"" said Lugar. The six-term Republican was hammered by Mourdock and outside groups for voting for President Obama's two Supreme Court picks and supporting other parts of the president's agenda from immigration to energy. Lugar cast some votes and took positions - like defending earmarks - that he knew would be unpopular with the GOP base and could even lead to a primary defeat. Many Republican strategists -- including close allies and longtime supporters -- were perplexed that he didn't tack right and alter his rhetoric in order to better position himself. In his unusual departing treatise, Lugar said he believes his votes for Wall Street and auto industry bailouts, and immigration reforms were ""the right votes for the country."" ""I stand by them without regrets,"" said Lugar. ""Ideology cannot be a substitute for a determination to think for yourself, for a willingness to study an issue objectively, and for the fortitude to sometimes disagree with your party or even your constituents,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a Lugar supporter who avoided his own Senate primary defeat two years ago with scorched earth strategy against his opponent, told CNN he believes a lesson from a Lugar loss is not to play defense. McCain was saying out loud what many GOP strategists had said in private: that Lugar allowed opponents to define him and did not adequately prepare a re-election campaign in today's anti-incumbent environment. Lugar tried to dispel that. ""The truth is that the headwinds in this race were abundantly apparent long before Richard Mourdock announced his candidacy. One does not highlight such headwinds publicly when one is waging a campaign. But I knew that I would face an extremely strong anti-incumbent mood following a recession,"" said Lugar. To people who whispered loudly that Lugar simply didn't work hard enough to get back to Indiana and prove he hasn't lost touch, he insisted that ""there never was a moment when my campaign took anything for granted."" With so many of Lugar's moderate colleagues in both parties deciding to call it quits this year rather than face bruising re-election campaigns, it has been perplexing why the octogenarian didn't choose to cap off a stellar career by retiring on his own terms. He had a carefully-crafted answer for that too, saying his goals on domestic and foreign policy ""would benefit from my continued service as a Senator."" ""These goals were worth the risk of an electoral defeat and the costs of a hard campaign,"" he said. In the end, Lugar did this the way he wanted -- the way so many of his former aides and supporters say he has always done things: his way. Not always politically expedient or strategically smart, but, from his perspective, principled.","Lugar delivers a statement that is part defense and part warning .
Mourdock's stand-your-ground approach is not conducive to problem-solving, Lugar says .
He says he stands by his votes ""without regrets"""
"(CNN) -- During the weeks Jerry Sandusky's trial unfolds in Centre County, Pennsylvania, 12 jurors and four alternates will be able to eat dinners with their families and sleep in their own beds. While they won't be isolated and watched by law enforcement, they also won't be able to lurk on Twitter, casually watch TV or even talk about the sexual abuse case that careened the Penn State University community into a media storm. ""If I were on the bench, there's no way this jury wouldn't have been sequestered,"" CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said. ""I think it's so much more difficult for jurors to stay away from the 24-hour news cycle, and a case like this, that touches on societal taboos and famed football."" Sandusky, 68, has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years. Prosecutors allege the former Penn State football coach met some of his accusers through Second Mile, a charity he created for underprivileged kids. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Opening statements are expected to begin Monday, Judge John Cleland said, and the trial is likely to last about three weeks. The trial will be held in Centre County as prosecutors wanted. Jurors are from the 150,000-person county, too, as Sandusky wanted -- some of the 220 prospective jurors that reported Tuesday had ties to the case's key players, Penn State or Second Mile. Not sequestering the jury ""was pretty shocking,"" Hostin said. ""Because this is rural Pennsylvania, this is a really small town with so many interconnections, it strikes me as imprudent not to at least keep them away from media reports."" By keeping an explosive case in a small place, the judge is already placing a lot of trust in jurors -- seven women and five men -- and they'll get clear directions on what they can and can't do, said Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant on the Casey Anthony, O.J. Simpson and Heidi Fleiss cases. Jerry Sandusky's 'make-believe world' Sequestered jurors know they're protected from ""media hordes and potential influences,"" which lets them focus on the evidence, instead conversations around them at the grocery store, Gabriel said. But the stress of being away from family, home and work can affect how they deliberate, too: A closely bonded jury might have an easier time coming to a verdict, whether guilty or not guilty, but small personality conflicts could become major obstructions, he said. Then, there's the money: It's not cheap to shelter, feed, transport and protect 12 jurors and four alternates for weeks. ""It's tough on state budgets because it's darn expensive,"" Gabriel said. Last year, a judge denied a request to sequester the jury in the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was accused in Michael Jackson's death. The judge said the $500,000 cost didn't play a role in his decision, although he acknowledged ""the state of California is undergoing severe financial problems."" The jury found Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The estimated cost to sequester the jury for Casey Anthony's trial was $361,000, including transportation, lodging, security and meals. Jurors had access to certain TV channels and could go online to pay bills or order prescriptions, but their actions were closely monitored by sheriff's deputies, and they saw their families only one afternoon every week. The jury found Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder and most other charges in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter. Judges sometimes sequester juries while they're deliberating, and Cleland could backtrack on his decision if jurors couldn't avoid the case outside the courtroom, Hostin and Gabriel said. But Cleland would be walking into a logistical nightmare of quickly arranging a weeks-long, sheriff-monitored sleepover for 16. ""Judges, when they make a ruling like that, are going to stick by it,"" Gabriel said. ""Jurors in these high-profile cases are pretty careful about not talking to anybody, and judges get severe with news organizations -- 'You even come close to any of these jurors before this trial, and the wrath of God will come down.' ""Unless the courts are prepared, they can get really messy.""","Jurors for Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse trial won't be sequestered .

"(CNN) -- John Brennan says he did not go to the Portland International Airport intending to get naked. But after feeling harassed by airport screeners Tuesday, the 50-year-old Portland, Oregon, man stripped off his clothes in a protest that brought him even more attention from airport authorities, national headlines and a short stint in jail. ""I just took off my clothes and said 'See, I don't have any explosives,'"" Brennan told CNN on Wednesday. ""The individuals at TSA are just doing their job and the whole organization needs to find a balance between safety and privacy . They use fear and intimidation and it's got to stop somewhere."" The Transportation Security Administration had a different take on the incident. ""TSA partners with the traveling public to screen all passengers safely and efficiently. When a passenger chooses to be purposefully disruptive, we notify law enforcement,"" the organization said in a statement. Brennan said he lives in Portland and was traveling to San Jose, California, for business. After he went through the metal detector and was patted down, a screener told him he tested positive for explosives, he said. Brennan said he felt ""humiliated,"" and decided to take off all his clothes. He is no stranger to naked protest as he has participated in a nude bike ride in Portland, he said. ""I am aware that's a tool I can use for free speech,"" he said. ""I know that as an Oregonian and as a citizen, one of my ways of expressing myself is being naked. It gets people's attention."" And it did. Police said some passengers shielded their children's eyes, while others laughed and snapped photos. TSA officials called police. Brennan was handcuffed and walked back to a holding room while officers draped a blanket on him. He was taken to a county jail, and now faces charges of disorderly conduct and indecent exposure. Brennan says it was worth it.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against the studio that produces ""Desperate Housewives"" will be retried in September, a Los Angeles judge ordered this week. The first trial ended without a verdict as jurors deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of the actress after three days of deliberations. They needed nine jurors to agree on a verdict. The judge set aside 12 days on her calendar for the jury trial, which is scheduled to begin on September 10. In her lawsuit, Sheridan claimed her character was killed -- and her acting job eliminated -- in retaliation for her complaining that show producer Marc Cherry hit her during a rehearsal for the ABC comedy-drama. Sheridan lawyer Mark Baute has previously said he did not expect an out-of-court settlement. ""My view is that Disney is the unhappiest place on Earth, so why would there ever be a settlement offer?"" Baute said. ABC lawyer Adam Levin said the retrial will be ""far more narrow than the previous case"" since the judge tossed out Sheridan's battery complaint against Cherry, leaving only the wrongful termination issue against the ABC. Lawyers for Cherry and ABC's Touchstone Television argued the demise of Sheridan's character was a creative decision unrelated to the workplace complaint. ABC executives testified that Cherry gained their permission to have Edie Britt -- the sassy blonde played by Sheridan -- die in May 2008, four months before the incident in which Cherry allegedly struck Sheridan. The hit during a rehearsal was just ""a light tap on the head"" intended to demonstrate ""a piece of physical humor"" that Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements. Sheridan testified that Cherry hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene. ""It was a nice wallop to my head,"" she said. One juror who voted for Sheridan's case said afterward that the defense story ""just didn't hold water for me."" Beverly Crosby, a retired elementary school principal, said her decision to find the studio liable was based on her doubts about the credibility of several defense witnesses, which included high-level ABC executives. ""There were a lot of people that some of the jurors found not too credible,"" Crosby said. Juror Johnny Huynh, who also voted for Sheridan's side, said it seemed to him that ABC executives scripted their stories ""just a little bit."" ""I don't say they was scripted,"" Huyhn said. ""It's more like the story don't match for me."" Although the show's line producer reported the hitting incident to the studio's human resources department, there was no investigation until an ABC senior executive saw a National Enquirer story about it at a grocery store two months later, according to testimony. What followed was a ""fake"" investigation designed ""to protect the money machine known as 'Desperate Housewives,' "" Baute said. ""Nobody wants the 'Desperate Housewives' applecart turned upside down."" The human resources investigator did not interview Cherry or Sheridan, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said. Five months and 11 episodes after the rehearsal incident, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on ""Desperate Housewives."" ""To my estimation, it wasn't handled correctly,"" juror Crosby said. ""It wasn't handled the way it should have been handled."" Sheridan was asking for $5.7 million in damages from ABC and Cherry, although the actress was paid $4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series.","Actress Nicollette Sheridan sued the show's creator and ABC for wrongful termination .

"(CNN) -- As millions prepare to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, her official jeweler has created a three dimensional artwork inspired by her long reign -- and many diamonds. Asprey teamed up with acclaimed light artist Chris Levine to create ""The Diamond Queen,"" an evocative portrait of the monarch which features a real tiara made up of 1,000 diamonds. It is based on Levine's seminal 2004 Queen portrait ""Equanimity."" The tiara is an Asprey re-creation of the Queen's diamond diadem which she wore on the way to her coronation in 1953. ""We realized that we could collaborate together on this project and create something really unique,"" said Paddy Byng, managing director of Asprey, which has been supplying the royals with bespoke jewelry and silver ware for the past 225 years. The glowing portrait is currently on show to the public at the company's flagship store in London, but will be auctioned for charity later this year. ""We are hoping to raise as much money as possible to go to two charities that have a jubilee focus this year,"" said Byng. The tiara's value is estimated at Â£800,000 to Â£1.2 million. Despite the current economic climate, luxury goods remain in demand -- and the tiara is expected to sell at value. In part, the luxury market has been protected from the European downturn by the continued demand out of countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. Although many luxury brands remain based in Europe, the continent's purchasing power is under strain as it struggles to emerge from the eurozone crisis. According to Byng, Europe's economic headwinds create challenges, but ones which are offset in part by the popularity of London and Paris as travel destinations. That attraction, he said, remains ""one of the keys that are driving the growth of the market."" Byng added: ""I think we can all sit here and go 'this is a nightmare', but the fact of the matter is there are Europeans that are still extremely wealthy, and Europeans who still want to buy the best and it comes down to the individual brands to be able to compete amongst themselves on distinctive design, great quality products, and impeccable service.""

"(CNN) -- The body of Mary Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was moved to ""a sunny hillside"" in a separate section of the Cape Cod, Massachusetts, cemetery where she was originally interred two months ago, her family said. Kennedy, who had been battling depression, was found dead May 16 in Bedford, New York, a small town north of New York City where she lived. The medical examiner's office determined Kennedy died as a result of asphyxiation due to hanging. She was 52. The decision to move her grave in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery was made because the original plot was closely surrounded by other graves with no room for expansion, Kennedy family spokesman Ken Sunshine said. Toxicology results: No alcohol in Mary Kennedy's system . ""The grave is now on a sunny hillside, shaded by an oak tree in an area with room for her children and other family,"" Sunshine said. Kerry Kennedy, Mary's best friend and sister-in-law, and two of Mary's children selected the new gravesite last week, he said.

"(CNN) -- Boston University mourned three study-abroad students killed in New Zealand while visiting locations where ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies were filmed. A van in which the students were traveling swerved off a road and rolled over about 7:30 a.m. Saturday near the resort town of Taupo in the center of North Island, the school said. The university, quoting a U.S. vice consul in Auckland, identified the victims as Daniela Lekhno from Manalapan, New Jersey; Roch Jauberty, who lived in Paris; and Austin Brashears of Huntington Beach, California. Five other students were injured in the crash, including one in critical condition after being flown by helicopter to get medical treatment. Two of those were later released from a hospital. Twenty-six Boston University students organized the trip and were riding in three vans, the school said. They were headed for Tongariro Crossing, a World Heritage site known for its mountains and volcano. ""This is a horrible tragedy,"" Boston University President Robert A. Brown said in a statement. ""Our prayers go out to the students and their families. ""We will do all we can to provide comfort and assistance to those who have been injured and to the families and friends of the victims.

"(CNN) -- A long time ago a great three-time governor of Louisiana, Earl Long, said about Jimmie Davis, the two-time not very good governor of Louisiana, ""You couldn't wake up Jimmie Davis with an earthquake."" As I go around the country and see various Democrats and talk to them on the phone, honestly I'm beginning to think that we have become the party of Jimmie Davis. My message is simple: WTFU. Translated -- wake the you-know-what up, there is an earthquake. You think that Democrats around the country are going to win -- as I hear time and time again from people on the street. Democratic fundraisers, activists, supporters, and even politicians alike have somehow collectively lapsed into the sentiment that the president is going to be reelected and that we have a good shot to take the House back while holding the Senate. I ask: What are you smoking? What are you drinking? What are you snorting or just what in the hell are you thinking? Look around the world -- do you see any governments or incumbents winning any elections out there? Did it happen in small elections in Germany or Britain, big elections in France and Greece or how about huge elections in the United States in 2008 and 2010? Please folks -- wake up! The polling? Not that encouraging. The latest Democracy Corps poll was 47-47. The Real Clear Politics average of polls has the president up a whopping three-tenths of a percentage point. And I am hearing the garbage that Democratic donors are telling Democratic fundraisers ...""Obama has it in the bag."" Newsflash: Nothing is in the bag. Nothing can be taken for granted. Everybody from the precinct door-knocker, to the Chicago high command, to the White House, to the halls of Congress, to the Senate and House committees, to congressional leadership, here is a simple message: If we don't get on the offense, reconnect with the American people, talk about how the middle class is in a struggle for its very existence, hold the Republicans accountable and fight like the dickens, we are going to lose. You can shoot five Bin Ladens, you can save 10,000 banks and 20 car companies, even pass the most sweeping legislation in modern American history; if people don't think that you are connected to their lives and are fighting for their interests they will vote your tush out of office in a nano-second. For historical reference see Winston Churchill election of 1945 and President George H.W. Bush in 1992. So, fellow Democrats -- we've got a fight on our hands. We've got to fight in the same way that the people we care most about have fought for quite some time. They have been crushed by high health care costs, soaring education costs, stagnant wages and financial bailouts for irresponsible firms. Combine all of this with the fact that the Republicans are raising not millions, not tens of millions, but potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from the pollution industry as result of Citizens United v. FEC. There is a full-fledged legislative agenda in many states to keep Democrats from even voting. We are literally being attacked from every side while simultaneously being lulled into some self-induced stupor thinking that this thing is somehow in the bag. It is not. Oh I know what you are going to say, ""Look at Mitt Romney, look how pathetic he is..."" Actually pathetic is a kind word for Romney and this campaign. Mitt Romney is to presidential campaigns as the Delta House grade point average was to Faber College -- the worst in history. I mean, my God, when you hold a press conference to rebut charges that you have a Cold War mentality and then you have foreign policy ""experts"" talk about Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union in ""contemporary"" terms -- really? I know that the Swiss and Cayman Island bank accounts drive swing voters and independents over the edge. I've gotten all of the reports from focus group moderators as to how devastating this is to Romney. Why a man who knows he is running for president (who claims to know something about the American economy) would for any reason keep money in offshore accounts, I have no idea. And I know that we are going to take him out to the cornfield (like at the end of the movie ""Casino"") on the Ryan budget. However, I fear that all of this will not be enough unless we have a real change of attitude about the difficult campaign ahead of us. It has been said that, ""Nothing so focuses a man's attention as the prospect of being hanged."" Look around Democrats -- Come November let's make sure that it's Mitt and his bunch at the end of that figurative rope and not us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville: Democrats are expressing confidence they will beat Romney easily .

Aleksandr Suvorov, 28, had previously entered guilty pleas in two separate schemes. One involved hacking into a computer system belonging to the Dave & Buster's restaurant chain to steal the credit card numbers of 81,000 customers. The second illegal operation involved a conspiracy to sell more than 160,000 stolen credit card numbers to a buyer in San Diego. The buyer turned out to be an undercover agent with the U.S. Secret Service.

"(CNN) -- Philippines boxing icon Manny Pacquiao's fellow countrymen were left reeling Monday after their hero's controversial defeat to American boxer Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas at the weekend. It was his first loss in seven years, and a contentious one as well, especially compared with Pacquiao's previous defeat in March 2005, to Mexico's Erik Morales in a unanimous decision. ""Pacman,"" as he is affectionately known by fans, appeared to dominate Bradley during the 12-round match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas but the judges decided otherwise. Two ruled the fight 115-113 for the American boxer, while the other judge gave the score 115-113 for the Filipino champion. Shock upset in Pacquiao bout . ""People were in shock and disbelief,"" said Lito Tacujan, sports editor of the Manila-based Philippine Star daily. ""Everybody felt furious with the result. They thought the match result was set up or scripted."" After the scores were announced, most of the crowd in the packed arena booed -- a sentiment that was echoed in Pacquiao's homeland where streets in towns and cities across the Philippines were deserted as people tuned in to watch the fight at home, in shopping malls, cinemas, parks and even army bases (Pacquiao is a lieutenant colonel in the Philippine Army Reserve Command.) In a nation that worships the 33-year-old sports hero cum lawmaker, there were accusations of foul play. ""Rigged,"" Congressman Joseph Victor Ejercito, a fellow legislator in the House of Representatives, told the local media. ""It's obvious that Pacquiao was ahead. I can't see how he lost."" Another congressman, Ben Evardone, voiced his displeasure too, saying: ""It is the biggest highway robbery, not only against Manny Pacquiao, but against the Filipino people as well."" Even the Malacanang presidential palace felt compelled to issue a statement in the aftermath of the stunning upset. ""Manny is still our one and only people's champ, and we are proud of him,"" the deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said in the statement. ""For a lot of people, including myself, Manny won the fight,"" Tacuja said. ""He carried the fight well, he put on lots of pressures, he landed more powerful blows than Bradley. He's trying to be the old Manny."" 'Local hero' Bradley's win shocks . According to media reports, a Pacquiao-Bradley rematch may happen later this year, possibly in November at a venue to be decided. Tacujan believes the rematch with Bradley will influence whether a much-anticipated showdown between the Filipino boxer, whose retirement is said to be on the horizon, and America's Floyd Mayweather Jr., who is serving a three-month jail sentence for a domestic violence conviction in Las Vegas, will happen. ""If Manny can give a knockout or win convincingly with a decisive victory, I think there would be a match between him and Mayweather,"" the sports editor said. For now, it seems little has changed in the way his country sees Pacquiao. ""For us, he is still a No. 1 hero, not only in boxing, but in sports too,"" Tacujan said. ""He is the best thing that has happened in the Philippines for many years.""","Manny Pacquiao loses his WBO welterweight crown to American Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- What rules must a turkey sandwich follow in order to board an airplane? With the six needles found in sandwiches on four international Delta Air Lines flights from the Netherlands to the United States, it's a question already stressed travelers are starting to ask. Assuming you get any food on your flight these days, how do you know it's safe to eat? Each country is responsible for setting its own in-flight catering rules, says Perry Flint, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association, an airline industry group. The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization also has standards and guidance on catering security. The Transportation Security Administration declined to specify its catering rules ""so as to not violate the integrity of these measures,"" TSA spokesman David Castelveter wrote in an e-mail. ""TSA conducts ongoing inspections to ensure airlines and contractors comply with these security requirements."" At foreign airports, the TSA's role ""is as an evaluator of those programs."" Tainted food: A sticky situation for airline travelers . None of the U.S. airlines contacted by CNN.com, including Delta, would comment on specifics of how food moves from manufacturing plants and commercial food kitchens to their airplanes. Nor would two of the largest airline catering companies, including Gate Gourmet, which supplied the turkey sandwiches under investigation. Gate Gourmet said it is ""cooperating fully with investigations by local and federal authorities and by our customer. As such, further details of this matter must remain confidential"" and referred to its website for information on safety procedures. To learn more, CNN.com turned to Peter Jones, a professor with a specialty in airline catering at the University of Surrey's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management in England. The following is a transcript of that interview, edited and condensed for clarity: . CNN: What threats does a company screen for? Peter Jones: Random sampling of food items is to test for pathogenic organisms to ensure against food poisoning. This is typically outsourced. Visual inspection of trays and trolleys is just for quality assurance purposes rather than to protect against threats. X-ray is designed to reveal weapons and bombs. CNN: Is every food item that goes on a plane screened? Or do catering companies and government agencies do spot inspections? Jones: Spot testing and inspection (are conducted) mostly by supervisors, rarely by outside agencies. Three things could be screened -- the items put on the tray; the tray once it is laid up; and the trolleys once they are full of trays. In most cases across the world, such screening is simply visual and random sampling. In some high-threat countries (for example, in the Middle East) trolleys are X-rayed (like luggage is), but this is not commonplace. CNN: What is done when an apparently deliberate act of malice is discovered? Jones: Such an isolated, one-off incident like this is extremely difficult to prevent. It could happen not just in a flight kitchen but in any food preparation operation, where a malicious person could tamper with food. In this instance, it is likely that the sandwiches would be labeled and coded so that it would be known when they were made, and possibly by whom. The most likely perpetrator is the employee who made the sandwiches, but this is not necessarily the case. The needles could have been inserted after the product was made and packaged -- during transportation to the plane. Close inspection of the packaging will reveal this (and the loaders will be known). It is also possible that the needles were placed in the products used to make the sandwiches (the bread and filling), further up the supply chain. This is less likely as the sandwich maker should have detected such tampering. Again close examination is likely to reveal if this were the case. Such analysis narrows down who might have done the tampering, and hence further steps can be taken to monitor the suspects and potentially prove their guilt. CNN: Will airlines or their caterers change any procedures as a result of this incident? Jones: Neither the airline nor flight caterer will change their suppliers because of this one incident. Millions of airline meals get served every day and billions in a year. Hence the likelihood of this happening is the equivalent of winning the lottery or aliens landing in Nebraska. No system is completely risk-free and to suggest that this, or any other incident like it, can be completely eliminated is fantasy.

"(CNN) -- Savvy Android users tend to be wary of installing apps that request seemingly unnecessary permissions. When an app wants access to data or functions on your phone, such as your contacts list or the ability to send text messages, it can signal potential security or malware risks. But Android apps that request no permissions at all (such as this Magic 8 ball app) are generally considered pretty free of security risks. But are they? Earlier this month, a test conducted by the Leviathan Security Group showed that even ""no-permissions"" Android apps can access potentially sensitive data on your phone -- and transmit that data elsewhere via your phone's Web browser. Specifically, Paul Brodeur of Leviathan created a test app that requested no permissions and installed it on some Android devices. He was able to scan the phone's memory card (SD card) and display a list of all non-hidden files on it. ""While it's possible to fetch the contents of all those files, I'll leave it to someone else to decide what files should be grabbed and which are going to be boring,"" he wrote. He also could see which apps were installed on the phone, and list some files belonging to those apps. He observed that this might allow nefarious people to find and exploit permission-related vulnerabilities in certain apps. Last year the Skype Android app presented this kind of problem. (Skype fixed that problem.) And for phones that operate on GSM cell networks (in the U.S., that's AT&T and T-Mobile), Leviathan's test app was able to read identifying information about the phone from the SIM card, plus some other information. Finally, since no-permissions apps can launch the phone's Web browser, that provides a potential route to transmit some data from the phone. While Brodeur's test app was designed to seek out such security lapses. ""It's trivial for any installed app to execute these actions without any user interaction,"" he wrote. While this may sound worrying, don't panic. What Leviathan discovered probably should concern Android app developers and Google, rather than consumers who use Android phones and tablets. ""What this research found is really little cracks in Android -- not great big security holes you could drive a truck through,"" said Kevin Mahaffey, co-founder and chief technical officer of Lookout Mobile Security, a leading provider of security apps and services for Android devices. ""That's why this kind of research is so valuable -- it ultimately helps make Android more secure."" According to Mahaffey, the bigger problem is not that people might maliciously exploit these security cracks to steal from users or compromise their phones -- but rather that many app developers are ""sloppy."" For instance, developers sometimes build apps that store user data (such as usernames and passwords) in ways that could be easily accessed through the security cracks Leviathan found. Or the app might open the phone's Web browser to allow functionality that could be handled other ways. For instance, TheVerge.com reported that the photo gallery that comes pre-installed on Android phones by Samsung, LG, and some other manufacturers stores unencrypted copies of complete addresses associated with photos. They found in a completely unencrypted file ""a list of locations which matched those of our home, work, family, significant other, friends, and even holiday destinations."" These were not GPS coordinates, but rather full addresses: door number, street, town, zip code, and country. TheVerge noted that this address data apparently was generated by Picasa Web Albums. Google acquired Picasa in 2004. ""There is no reason for the application to be caching locations of private photos completely unencrypted,"" wrote Aaron Souppouris for The Verge. ""This was information that we'd never given Google, either on a phone or within Picasa. To make matters worse, Picasa Web-Album syncing had been switched off a week before the information was found."" There's not a lot that the average consumer can do in terms of spotting whether apps are storing unnecessary data in insecure ways. The best practice is still to notice which permissions apps require before installing them, don't install apps that seem to require too many permissions, and report to the developer any suspicious activity by an app. If the developer is not responsive or seems evasive or shady when you report suspicious app behavior, Mahaffey advises alerting Google's Android security team by sending an e-mail to security@android.com. ""That channel is mainly used by developers, but it's worth letting them know if you have concerns about an app and you aren't getting useful responses from the developer,"" he said. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","""No-permission"" Android apps can access potentially sensitive data on your phone .
The bigger problem isn't malicious exploitation, but rather that app developers are ""sloppy""
Don't install apps that require too many permissions, and report any suspicious activity ."
"(CNN) -- A recent Oral Roberts University graduate was the only one of five people en route to a Christian youth conference to survive a plane crash in southeastern Kansas, officials said Saturday. The twin-engine Cessna 401 went down Friday afternoon about nine miles west of Chanute, the Kansas Highway Patrol said on their website. The small aircraft landed in a field and skidded about 200 feet before hitting a treeline. A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board on Saturday said the pilot had been in contact with air traffic controllers, but there was no distress call. ""There was an altitude change and that was the last transmission,"" said spokesman Peter Knudson. The aircraft caught fire after the crash. Texas-based Teen Mania Ministries said the eight-seat plane, manufactured in 1991, was headed for the Acquire the Fire conference in Council Bluffs, Iowa. It had taken off from an airport near Tulsa, Oklahoma, said Elizabeth Cory, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman. Oral Roberts University is based in Tulsa. Killed were the pilot Luke F. Sheets, 23, of Ephraim, Wisconsin; Austin G. Anderson, 27; Stephen J. Luth, 22, of Muscatine, Iowa. All three were recent Oral Roberts graduates. Garrett V. Coble, 29, of Tulsa, a former instructor in the College of Business and a participant in mission trips, was also killed. Anderson, of Ringwood, Oklahoma, survived the crash, but died of his injuries early Saturday. He had served two tours of duty with the U.S. Marine Corps in Iraq. Hannah Luce, 22, daughter of Oral Roberts trustee and Teen Mania founder Ron Luce, was hospitalized in Kansas City, Missouri. The Garden Valley, Texas, resident was in serious but stable condition, with burns on 28% of her body, according to Teen Mania. ""Please pray for all of the families that lost loved ones and for Hannah in the hospital. Pray for God's peace to be with all of them and pray for Hannah's healing,"" Oral Roberts President Mark Rutland said on the university's Facebook page. Anderson and Luth recently had been hired onto the marketing staff of Teen Mania Ministries, a youth ministry organization. ""We are so saddened by what has happened and ask for all those who have been touched by this ministry in some way to rally around the families of all involved in the crash, especially the four young men who passed away. Please lift them up in prayer, and ask for the Holy Spirit to surround them with God's love and peace,"" Ron Luce said in a statement. ""They all had a heart for this generation, and were passionately pursuing God's call on their lives."" Investigators have not yet identified any witnesses, Knudson told CNN. He did not have information on weather conditions at the time of the incident. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","The pilot did not make a distress call, an NTSB official says .

"(CNN) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has signed off on a bill that will prevent abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving public funds in most cases, her office said. ""This is a common sense law that tightens existing state regulations and closes loopholes in order to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, whether directly or indirectly,"" the governor said in a statement. ""By signing this measure into law, I stand with the majority of Americans who oppose the use of taxpayer funds for abortion,"" Brewer said. Kansas, North Carolina and Texas have enacted similar legislation, while Indiana, New Jersey and Wisconsin have used their budget processes to bar funding for abortion providers, according to her office. Before Brewer signed the bill into law, the political arm of Planned Parenthood Arizona slammed the measure, which it says will put the health of thousands at risk. Besides operating clinics where abortions are performed, Planned Parenthood provides a range of health services including cancer screenings, birth control, vaccinations, sexual health education and health counseling. ""Many in the legislature will never know what it's like to feel a lump in their breast and have to worry about the cost of a doctor's visit,"" said Bryan Howard, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Arizona. ""This is the reality with which many Arizona women are faced, at the hands of a legislature determined to reduce access to prevention care while pursuing its ideological political agenda,"" he said.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- Formula One is a sport where tiny margins can be the difference between success and failure, so it is no surprise a small hole in Red Bull's Monaco Grand Prix winning car has got rival teams reexamining the sport's regulations. Mark Webber clinched the Austrian-owned manufacturer's third consecutive win in the principality on Sunday, but questions have been asked about the legality of Red Bull's RB8 car. The debate centers around the floor of the car, specifically the area in front of the rear wheel. The FIA, the body which regulates the sport, states the floor of an F1 car must be impervious, a rule many teams presumed meant it must be free of holes. The official rule is as follows: ""All parts lying on the reference and step planes, in addition to the transition between the two planes, must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous, rigid (no degree of freedom in relation to the body/chassis unit), impervious surfaces under all circumstances."" Webber wins Monaco Grand Prix . But the RB8's design, which has been cleared by FIA scrutineers and has been running since April's Bahrain Grand Prix, features a rectangular slot in front of the rear wheel of the car. ""In Monaco there was much discussion about the legality of the Red Bull's floor, with speculation that rival teams were considering lodging post-race protests (none ultimately did),"" read a statement on the sport's official website. ""Despite the fact that Red Bull have been running the design since Bahrain with the blessing of the FIA scrutineers."" The slot increases downforce at the rear of the vehicle by offsetting the negative impact the rear wheel has on airflow over the car. Latest F1 standings after Monaco GP . And the Red Bull is not the only car to feature a modification aimed at tackling this problem. Both the Ferrari and Sauber cars feature slots in front of the rear wheel. But on both designs the slot it is placed at the edge of the body, rather than being an isolated hole in the floor. The design tweaks have clearly paid dividends. Red Bull currently lead the constructors' championship, with its drivers Sebastian Vettel and Webber second and third respectively in the drivers' standings, while Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso is top. With no team launching an official protest, the RB8, complete with slot, can be expected on the grid for the Canadian Grand Prix on June 10.","The design of Red Bull's RB8 car has been questioned by other teams .

"(CNN) -- ""When you and I went to dinner in Arizona in the spring of 2011,"" I say to Ned Colletti, general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, ""you thought your team might be a lot better than it turned out to be."" ""It tells you that I don't know what I'm doing,"" he jumps in, finishing my thought. ""And when we went to dinner in L.A. before this season,"" I remind him, ""you sure as hell weren't sure your 2012 team had a shot to be the best team in baseball."" Colletti is cool about being kidded because he's been around long enough to know how high and low and fast and slow and screwy and curvy and uncontrollable baseball can be. Bankruptcy court approves sale of Los Angeles Dodgers . He says, ""Well, how's that saying go, 'The whole is greater than the sum of its parts?'"" Everything that goes wrong one year can go right the next. Every guy who hit .200 can hit .300. Every guy on the DL can be an MVP. Every team's owner who files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection can sell that same team for $2 billion and change. Well, OK, not EVERY team. But maybe the Dodgers are too big to fail. Maybe you can't keep a franchise this strong down too long. Maybe the bum breaks even out. Maybe a new owner and a new cash infusion and a new attitude can create a new mood. I don't know. Call me maybe. I can tell you this much: For years and years before the last owner owned the Dodgers, the Dodgers owned this town. The seats were filled. The team took five World Series championships and nine National League pennants after bolting Brooklyn to go west. If you count the Brooklyn years, these boys of summer won six Fall Classics and 22 pennants. Something happened to the club that brought you Jackie Robinson and Duke Snider and Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, alas. Something unfortunate. Something unforeseeable. Rare photos of Jackie Robinson . An organization that oozed success and epitomized class was being abandoned by some of its fan base. The seats WEREN'T filled. The team wasn't succeeding. Its owner was in divorce court and its financial statements were in bankruptcy court. A lawsuit and a criminal investigation were pending over a parking lot incident in which a Northern California man was beaten into a coma. Dodger Stadium attendance in 2011 was down more than 627,000 from the year before. Unthinkable. Unacceptable. I wondered what it would take for the Dodgers to straighten this out. Would it take years? Would thousands of fans who once jammed the freeway near Stadium Way now steer clear for good? Well, they aren't totally back, the team or the fans, but you've got to admit, it's getting better. For much of this season, Los Angeles (that famous ice hockey town) has owned the best record in all of ball. I know quite a few folks who thought the Los Angeles team of ANAHEIM might become a dominating one in 2012, what with having signed the Sultan of St. Louis Albert Pujols to a contract through the year 2022 or 2032 or 2525 or whatever it was they did. But the Dodgers? No way. After all, what did they have? They had a hard-hitting hitter, Matt Kemp, who might have been his league's legitimate Most Valuable Player last season, having come in second in a vote to a guy who later was accused of using a banned substance. They had a hard-throwing thrower, Clayton Kershaw, who was indeed his league's most valuable pitcher, having racked up a record of 21-5. They had a left-handed swinger, Andre Ethier, whose production had tapered off sharply in 2011 after a hot start. And .... and ... ? They had a team that ended up 11.5 games out of first place. They had an owner fans resented, with a big ""FOR SALE"" sign in the yard. A much-loved ballclub and ballpark suddenly had five popular people -- Kemp, Kershaw, Ethier, a certain redheaded gentleman in the radio-TV booth (initials V.S.) and a nice lady named Nancy Bea who plays the organ. How low would they go? It wasn't as if the Dodgers hadn't been down on their luck before. On October 29, 2005, the owner fired his general manager. He was Paul DePodesta (aka the true identity of the Jonah Hill character from ""Moneyball""), who, for all his calculations and acumen, had just fielded a Dodgers team that won 71 of 162 games. Colletti was hired. His teams proceeded to go to the playoffs of 2006, 2008 and 2009. He had money to spend. He tinkered, he tweaked. Ethier was acquired in a December 2005 trade. Kershaw was drafted in June of 2006. There were signings and experiments that did not pan out, but there was also Manny Ramirez, who was acquired by Colletti from the Red Sox in mid-2008 and turned the whole left field pavilion into his own personal ""Mannywood."" In the first rounds of the '08 and '09 playoffs, the Dodgers not only beat the Cubs and Cards, they swept them. That 2009 team had a record of 95-67. It was the first Dodger club since the championship run of 1988 to win that many. Ah, but prior to that 2009 NL championship series, snap, things changed. It was announced that owners Frank and Jamie McCourt were kaput. They had separated. As soon as the Dodgers were eliminated, Frank McCourt eliminated Jamie McCourt as the club's CEO. That same month, she filed for divorce. A day after she did, Frank McCourt's side claimed Jamie McCourt had a guy on the side. Husband gets Dodgers in McCourt divorce deal . What a mess. And it got messier. There were good players (Randy Wolf, Orlando Hudson) who were not offered new contracts. There were players (Juan Pierre) who got traded, players (Ramirez) who got put on waivers and permitted to leave. You couldn't help but interpret it as the Dodgers cutting costs. Their catcher (Russell Martin) was not offered a new deal, even though no heir-apparent was apparent. Rafael Furcal ($13 million salary in 2011), Hiroki Kuroda (nearly $12 million), Jonathan Broxton ($7 mil) ... those guys, too, had to go. Critics and skeptics no longer saw the Colletti who landed productive guys like Ted Lilly and Juan Rivera without giving up much in return. They focused instead on risks like Andruw Jones and Juan Uribe who didn't produce. I told people that the GM, given resources, could field a team that true-blue Dodger followers were proud of again. Some of them scoffed. Excitement didn't return until Magic Johnson and associates laid their billions on the table, making McCourt green but gone. Happy days were here again. Soon, these solvent Dodgers would surely solve all of the fans' woes, from finding a new third baseman to fixing the long traffic jams and the long lines for a hot dog. Snap, just like that. And on the field? Well, there was no waiting. Colletti did what he could. There were new arms, like those of Chris Capuano and Aaron Harang. There were the unrelated Ellises (catcher A.J. and infielder Mark) who were much better than anyone anticipated. There was a battle-tested bat (Bobby Abreu's) that the GM went out and got. Best team in baseball? Maybe not. Best record in baseball? You bet. As I watched a victory parade Thursday morning through the streets of Los Angeles, the ice skate guys were kings for a day, I looked at the baseball standings in the paper. Only one team had won 40 games already in 2012. It wasn't the Yankees. It wasn't the Angels. It wasn't the 2011 World Series champion Cardinals, who had lost Pujols. (See how quickly fortunes can change?) It was the Dodgers. ""I wouldn't even use words like 'best team in baseball' because there's no such thing,"" Colletti tells me on the phone, grateful for a good start but understandably cautious. ""In our case, we're a good example of a bunch of guys who get out there and give you everything they've got."" Oh, and there's something else some of them got: Kemp's got a big new contract. Kershaw's got a big new contract. Ethier's got a big new contract. Now THAT's moneyball. L.A. is a player again in the baseball business. It might not be a hockey town for very long. How do you feel about the L.A. Dodgers? Let us know in the comments below.","The Dodgers have new owners and are in first place .

"(CNN) -- Texas Rep. Ron Paul is making his third bid for the White House armed with the same libertarian-leaning stances that cultivated a dedicated following during his 11 terms in the House of Representatives. Those positions -- calls for limited government, reduced federal spending and less U.S. involvement overseas -- are now in the fore of national politics with the rise of the Tea Party and the country's financial situation. Paul is perhaps most famous for his calls to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Reserve and return to a gold standard, views he often advocates as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. And as a member of the International Relations Committee, he has consistently voted against authorizing military action overseas and opposed U.S. support for the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. He has also called for constitutional amendments to abolish personal income, estate and gift taxes. But those are some of the same issues that made him and his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, darlings of the Tea Party movement and especially popular among young conservatives whom he visits on college campuses across the country. He often says he was fighting for those issues before they were popular. More Ron Paul coverage on the CNN Political Ticker . ""Mainstream is now thinking about these things. Before, mainstream was deficits don't matter, print money when you need it, endless wars, personal privacy that didn't mean anything,"" Paul said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" recently. ""But believe me, mainstream is moving in the direction that I have been talking about for a long time, and therefore nobody knows what the outcome will be in this election."" Although he raises significant campaign funds, fundraising success doesn't necessarily translate to electoral wins. While running for the 2008 GOP nomination, Paul raised $20 million in the last quarter of 2007, mostly through individual contributions, which was twice as much raised by eventual Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But he barely breached 10% in the early presidential voting states. After he dropped out of the race in June 2008, he used his remaining funds to form Campaign for Liberty, designed to support candidates who agreed with his policy stances. An early champion of virtual campaigning, Paul coined the term ""money bomb"" for setting a fundraising goal over a set period of time on his website. He raised more than $1 million during his most recent ""money bomb"" in June but fell short of the $2 million goal. The Pittsburgh native first ran for the White House in 1988 as the Libertarian Party candidate against Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, ultimately receiving 0.5 percent of the vote, or 432,000 votes, in the general election. But don't expect him to seek a third-party bid in 2012. ""We don't have a democracy in this country. It's so biased,"" Paul told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""If you're a third party, you can't -- I can't get into debates as a third-party candidate. When I did it as a third party, I spent over half my money just to get on the ballot."" As a GOP candidate he will also promote more socially conservative stances, popular with Republican voters in many of the early nominating states. He has said he believes marriage is the union between a man and a woman, but voted in 2004 and 2006 against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, something he said is an increase in federal power. Paul also told Wolf Blitzer in May that he supports the ""protection of all human life."" ""I'm for repealing Roe v. Wade. And it's not an attack on women's rights,"" Paul said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""Women have rights, but they also have a responsibility if they're responsible for life."" Paul has a unique perspective as a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology who has delivered more than 4,000 babies. After graduating from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, he served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force before moving to Texas with his wife Carol and eventually representing the 14th District that includes the cities of Victoria and Galveston. He will be 77 in 2012, but Paul, a father of five and grandfather of 18, said he doesn't feel old. ""Where do I get my energy and where do I get my support and the enthusiasm? It comes from the young people,"" Paul told Blitzer. ""That really excites me because this issue is so important. It's important to my kids. It's an important point to all the kids of America.""","This will be Rep. Ron Paul's third presidential run .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Incredible"" is how John Frisina remembers the moment he logged on to Fantasy Premier League and discovered he was beating nearly two million other competitors. Tough task: Managing a fantasy football team can be hard when you want to get ahead of the rest. It's the stuff dreams are made of for the millions of people managing fantasy football teams in online leagues around the world every year. But in most players' experience, for one reason or another, the glory of victory always remains just out of reach. It's hardly surprising, given that this year alone 1.9 million fiercely competitive fans played the game billed as ""the ultimate Fantasy Football."" So, then, what separates the players who get to the top from all the rest? Is it instinct, or, maybe knowledge, or is it simply old-fashioned good luck? Frisina, who is Australian, went on to win the Fantasy Premier League in 2007/2008, beating hundreds of thousands of would-be managers both from England and around the globe in the process. It was the fourth year he had played the game and he says he was surprised to remain so competitive through the season. ""Really only in the last couple of years I have been in the top 200 or so. I was nowhere near the leaders before that."" Frisina felt striking a balance between superstars and cheaper players was crucial to his fantasy football success -- as was a bit of luck. ""Having a well balanced side with not too many superstars is important. I think you need to pick three or four players who you feel are undervalued and take a chance on them."" Do you have any Fantasy Football tips? Share your ideas in the Sound Off box below. For Frisina, taking a chance on players like Sunderland's Kenwyn Jones and Ryan Taylor of Wigan paid off -- and he found himself still around the top 100 by mid-season. There were a couple of other tactics that helped Frisina rise to the top. ""I think it happened after I started watching a few more games on television. I got to see first-hand who was playing, what form they were in and I learned a lot from there. Having a good knowledge of all the players across all of the teams is really important."" Checking teams for injuries and selections close to the deadline was also important, he said. Seven weeks out from the end of the 2007/2008 season, Frisina hit the lead and managed to hold on for the rest of the season. ""I came out of nowhere really. There was one week where I just logged on to check my team and I found myself in front. It was incredible."" From out in front, Frisina said the tactics were slightly different during his once-a-week team assessment. ""I kept having a look at the guys below me and tried to keep a similar sort of team so they couldn't catch me."" Creator of the Fantasy Premier League game, Mark Hughes of ISM Games, said he had never done well in the game, but it appeared those that won followed the game very closely. ""You tend to see the same players up there year after year. They would follow the fixtures closely and know all of the players. Hughes, despite being the brains behind the game, says he doesn't have any answers to the question of how to play world-beating fantasy football. ""I don't know if I have any secrets, though, because if I knew them I'd be a lot better at the game,"" Hughes said.","Get tips on how to win fantasy football competitions .

"(EW.com) -- When she gets a look at the latest list on Forbes.com, Drew Barrymore won't be smiling anymore. The magazine ranked her first on its list of ""Hollywood's Most Overpaid Actors,"" reporting that her films only bring in 40 cents for every dollar she is paid as an actress -- and that's without taking into account the fall TV bust ""Charlie's Angels,"" on which Barrymore served as an executive producer. Eddie Murphy had the unenviable fate of taking second place, though his return ($2.70 for every dollar he's paid) was significantly higher than Barrymore's. While the jury is still out whether ""Tower Heist"" (opening today) and his stint as Oscars host will bring Murphy the gold in 2012, his fate for 2011 is sealed. See what other big names made the list after the jump. For this list, Forbes analyzed Hollywood's 40 top-earning actors and their respective compensation for their starring roles in the last five years and compared it to the operating income on those films. Nicolas Cage (#6) might be the person on the list who is simultaneously the most predictable and unexpected entrant. As a go-to guy for huge action flicks, it seems like he'd generate healthy revenue stream. Then you remember his recent films include ""Season of the Witch,"" ""Drive Angry,"" and more recently ""Trespass,"" which earned a paltry $16,000 in its first weekend. Yes, friends, that's roughly the going rate for a Honda Fit. Cage's ""Trespass"" co-star Nicole Kidman also didn't fare well, landing in tenth place. Her ex Tom Cruise -- another tentpole action star with a questionable ability to return on his asking price -- took ninth place, though perhaps December's ""Mission: Impossible"" -- Ghost Protocol can turn things around for him next year. It was a tough year for funnymen, as Will Ferrell (#3), Adam Sandler (#7), and Vince Vaughn (#8) all landed in the top 10. A silver lining for Ferrell: He took first place in 2009 and 2010, so dropping to third is actually an improvement. Kidman and Cage's fellow Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and Denzel Washington rounded out the pack in fourth and fifth place, respectively. Perhaps it was less of a surprise for Witherspoon, whom Forbes.com also ranked in this year's list of highest-paid actresses. She brought back $3.55 for every dollar she was paid. It seems even the high-profile fan draw of co-star Robert Pattinson in April's ""Water for Elephants"" couldn't bring her back from romcom flop ""How Do You Know."" See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- There is a little good news for mothers in the United States. The U.S. has moved up six places -- from 31st to 25th -- in the annual Save The Children State of the World's Mothers report. That puts the U.S. right between Belarus and the Czech Republic. Norway is No. 1, just ahead of Iceland and Sweden. The report's ranking of 165 nations factors in measures of education, health and economic status as well as the health and nutrition of children. ""There's still an awful lot that we need to do,"" said Carolyn Miles, the president of Save The Children. The U.S. has made strides with respect to better care for teen moms and also in electing more women to government positions, which the organization sees as an important measure of how society values women. But it has to do more, Miles and others stress. ""We valorize parenthood and in particular, motherhood, while at the same time we offer very few supports,"" said Robin Simon, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University. So while the U.S. recognizes mothers for their incredibly important role as the primary caregivers to children, it still hasn't done enough to help raise the kids. It's no secret: Raising a child is stressful and really expensive. A new mother needs a lot of help, Simon said, and other countries provide more government assistance than the United States does. ""Unlike other industrialized nations, we lack the kind of state-level protections and policies that would reduce some of that stress,"" she said, speaking of ""family-friendly entitlement programs"" like universal health care. Another place the United States could start improving is with maternity leave. Thanks to the 2-decade-old Family and Medical Leave Act, new mothers get 12 weeks of unpaid leave. In Canada, it's 52 weeks, 50 of which are paid. Canada, by the way, is 19th in the rankings. Kirsten Swinth, a professor of history at Fordham University who is working on a book on the cultural history of the working American mother, said companies that do offer paid leave do so more for professional middle- and upper-ranked workers. ""That tends to leave lower-paid and less-skilled workers behind so there's an inequality in the distribution of those benefits,"" she said. The poor around the world are victims of growing inequality, the Save The Children report shows. The gap between the level of care and commitment to mothers and children in the top 10 nations -- all developed countries -- and the bottom 10 is growing, Miles said. Here's a statistic that jumps right at you: In bottom-ranking Niger, almost every mother will lose at least one child in her lifetime. It is the opposite in Norway, where every birth is attended to by a health professional. Miles, a mother of three, said she has talked to women in the poorest countries who had no other person present at the birth of their children. She said her organization has been working hard for the past five years to make sure there are more health workers to attend to births in those countries. ""Forty percent of children that die under the age of 5 die in the first month,"" she said. ""And the most dangerous day for a child is the day they are born."" The report isn't entirely deflating. There is good news from perennial last-place Afghanistan, which moved up one notch. It doesn't look significant in the report's black and white type, but it is, Miles said. ""It reflects some real progress in that country,"" she said, pointing to the fact that there is a much higher rate of education for girls there. Education is one vital component in improving the lives of mothers, Swinth said. ""There's very clear evidence for people who do this kind of work that when you provide women access to education, that when you provide them access to independent abilities to support themselves, and then when you provide them with health care, maternal and infant health go up in correspondence with each other,"" she said. She said it happens in industrialized nations too where consistent, reliable programs for prenatal and maternal health care are provided. ""You can see a correlation for better outcomes for mothers and children,"" she said. Some of the solutions don't have to be hard, Miles said. ""We talk about the 'lifesaving six' things in nutrition, and one of those is breast-feeding practices,"" she said. And everyone needs to pitch in, she said. Certainly moms need to take the lead, but governments also need to establish friendly policies toward breast-feeding and companies need to welcome it. It's one of the most important things that can save kids' lives, along with providing clean water, Miles said. ""It has to be everyone saying, 'This doesn't have to happen in our country.'""","U.S. lands at No. 25 on the annual State of the World's Mothers report .

"(CNN) -- The NHL on Saturday suspended Phoenix Coyotes forward Raffi Torres for 25 games for launching himself into an opponent during a playoff game earlier this week. That means Torres -- who already sat out the fourth game of the Coyotes best-of-seven first round series with the Chicago Blackhawks -- will be out for the next 24 games. The suspension will be over the current postseason and, if there are any games left to be served, will carry over into the 2012-2013 regular season, according to the NHL. Phoenix ""accepts the NHL's decision,"" Coyotes General Manager Don Maloney said in a statement. About halfway through the first period of last Tuesday's game in Chicago, Blackhawks forward Marian Hossa gave up the puck near center ice. Moments later, Torres's skates left the ice and he slammed his shoulder and elbow into Hossa's head, knocking him down hard. The Coyotes ended up winning that game 3-2 in overtime. Up 3-1 overall in the series, they could clinch the series with a win Saturday night in Phoenix. Hossa, who was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital that night for evaluation, according to a statement from the Blackhawks, remains sidelined indefinitely. The 33-year-old Slovakian tallied 29 goals and 48 assists over the regular season. Brendan Shanahan, the NHL's senior vice president of player safety and hockey operations, explained in a statement that Torres violated three rules with the hit -- interference, charging and an illegal check to the head. The abnormally long suspension for Torres was also due, in part, is because he is defined by the league as a ""repeat offender"" with a history ""mainly of acts very similar to this one -- including two this season,"" Shanahan said. Maloney described the ruling as ""very severe"" for Torres and the Coyotes. At the same time, he thanked NHL officials for their ""thorough review"" of the incident and acknowledged the seriousness of the violations. ""Raffi plays a hard, physical game, yet this contact crossed the line on what is acceptable in our game today,"" the general manager said.","Phoenix's Raffi Torres injured Chicago's Marian Hossa during a playoff game Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- In this dark and dismal year for college sports, when each scandal seems worse than the next, inspiration arrives in a motorized wheelchair. In a month when Penn State is dealing with child sex abuse charges against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, the fallout bringing down longtime head coach Joe Paterno and the university president, a reason to still believe in what's good about college football will never play another down again. His name is Eric LeGrand, and you'll find him Saturday on the field at Rutgers Stadium in New Jersey. He will be honored at the team's annual Senior Day before a game against Cincinnati, and the expected crowd of more than 50,000 will no doubt save the loudest cheers for him. On October 16, 2010, he collided with Army kick returner Malcolm Brown while making a tackle. The collision left him paralyzed from the neck down, and when he awoke in the hospital, he was connected to a respirator that doctors said he would need for the rest of his life. ""I could barely turn my head,"" LeGrand said. ""They had to roll me to change my position. It felt like I was going to die. That's what it felt like."" But now, 13 months later, he can move his head and shoulders when he talks, his long braids moving as he does. He has attacked therapy the way he once went after weight-lifting records in the gym, and believes it is only a matter of time before he is walking back on the field at Rutgers. SI: Why LeGrand thinks he will walk again . No one can say for sure if that will happen. But his belief that it someday will not only fuels him, but also has become a rallying cry that has spread from the Piscataway, New Jersey, campus across the country. LeGrand, 21, has a way of touching people he's met, from professional athletes to his teammates to the more than 26,000 fans who follow him on Twitter. ""Just right away, he had this positive energy and positive outlook on life,"" said Alex Morgan, the breakout star for the U.S. women's soccer team who became friends with him at a professional game in July. ""That's what inspired me. I feel I'm lucky to get to know him because he's such an inspiring person."" He has inspired Bart Scott, the New York Jets linebacker, to support his ""Believe Fund"" with T-shirt sales. He has spent time with nearly all the professional teams in the New York area, including Yankees stars Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. Erin Andrews, the ESPN sideline reporter, reached out to LeGrand a few weeks after the accident. He caught her on a bad day when he called. ""Here I am, feeling sorry for myself and this sweet kid calls me,"" Andrews said. ""It really put a new perspective on my life. I get emotional just thinking about it now. I thank him for that."" But he hasn't just met celebrities. LeGrand has made inspiring others a goal for his life, regularly speaking to youth and school groups around New Jersey. Last month at a Jersey City middle school, students cheered from classroom windows as his wheelchair motored up to the entrance, waving signs with his name and No. 52, his uniform number. He told the kids that he believes this is only the beginning of his journey, how any time life gets him down, he remembers there is always someone who has it worse than he does. ""I take this as a responsibility to get better,"" he said. ""I don't want to let everybody down who's been behind my back. That's what keeps me going every day. Even though I can't control when I'm going to get up, but what I can control I take as a responsibility to do what I've got to do to get better."" Near the end of the question and answer period that followed his speech, one shy girl walked to the front of the stage and asked him a blunt question: ""Did you ever ask God why this happened to you?"" ""I don't ask God why, because I truly believe this happened for a reason,"" he told her. ""I believe I've been called upon to help other people out. I don't ask God why this happened to me, because I know that question will be answered down the road when I am walking again, and I've helped a lot more people believe in themselves."" That word -- believe -- has become his rallying cry. Spend time with him, and it's easy to see how frustration could take over. LeGrand has no movement below his shoulders. It takes two hours, with his mother, Karen, and a physical therapist, to get him out of bed and dressed in the morning. His rehab sessions at Kessler Institute in West Orange are grueling. His occupational therapist places LeGrand's left arm in a harness that suspends it. The therapist then uses electrodes to stimulate LeGrand's pectoral muscles to move the arm toward his body, then LeGrand must hold it there for 30 seconds. His face will strain from the effort. ""This is my workout now,"" he said. ""It's crazy. I go from squatting 605 pounds to just trying to hold my arm up."" But LeGrand is smiling even when he makes that observation. The smile is almost always present. He calls 2011 ""the fastest year of my life,"" and he keeps himself as busy as possible. He is back taking two classes at Rutgers, sports labor relations and criminal procedure, and is part of the school's radio broadcast team at home games. LeGrand always thought he would try to get into broadcast after a career in the NFL. Now, he has accelerated that timetable, doing spots on both ESPN and CBS Sports recently in addition to his regular work during the pregame and halftime shows at Rutgers. Exactly one expert picked Rutgers to win the Big East title this year: LeGrand. If the Scarlet Knights, pegged to finish last in the preseason poll, win their final two games against Cincinnati and Connecticut, they'll do just that. If they do, LeGrand will find himself in the national spotlight again. Rutgers finished 4-8 last season, and the devastating injury to LeGrand cast a pall over the entire campus. Now, his presence does the opposite. When he motors around the stadium on game days, fans call out his name and cheer, or stop him to explain how he's touched their lives without knowing it. He is, in a dark time with scandal after scandal in college sports, a ray of light. ""It's crazy,"" said his sister Nicole. ""He can't even lift a finger but he's touched an entire world.""","Football collision left Rutgers player Eric LeGrand paralyzed .

"(CNN) -- This week, President Obama announced policy measures to enhance the surveillance of oil futures markets. The president stressed that the new measures would not bring down gasoline prices overnight, but implied that they would lower gas prices in the long run because more oversight would deter market manipulation. There is universal agreement on the need to prevent the manipulation of oil prices, but the premise of this proposal could not be more mistaken. There is no evidence that rising crude oil prices were caused by market manipulation, and there is no reason to expect increased oversight to lower gas prices across America. This policy initiative confuses the increased financialization of oil futures markets in recent years with illegal activities such as market manipulation. Market manipulation occurs when traders herd the market into positions from which they can profit, resulting in excessively high oil prices. There is no evidence that the bulk of the financial investors taking positions in oil futures markets since 2003 have engaged in such activities. More generally, the Obama administration is mistaken in attributing high oil and gas prices to the presence of financial investors in oil futures markets. A popular view among pundits and policymakers has been that the sustained oil price increase between 2003 and mid-2008 could not possibly be explained by economic fundamentals, but must have been brought about by financial investors taking speculative positions in oil futures markets. Recent research has not been kind to this hypothesis. A large number of scientific studies have failed to produce any credible evidence that high oil and gas prices were caused by the presence of financial investors in oil futures markets. For example, seemingly compelling and widely cited data regarding the relative size of the financial market for oil and the physical volume of oil being consumed has been shown to be misleading. All indications are that the financial market is smaller than oil consumption when measured correctly. Equally importantly, studies based on financial data provided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows that financial investors did not take the positions in oil futures markets commonly ascribed to them. For example, changes in index funds' positions do not precede changes in the price of oil futures, but prices predict positions. Nor is there a systematic relationship between commonly discussed measures of speculation and movements of oil prices. Finally, price increases in commodity markets for which there are no futures exchanges are as large as price increases in the oil market. In fact, there are strong indications that recent oil price fluctuations were mainly associated with changes in the global business cycle. Notably, between 2003 and mid-2008, global demand for oil increased faster than global oil production, resulting in a sustained increase in the price of oil. Much of the additional demand for oil came from emerging Asia. No nefarious speculators are required to explain this surge in the price of oil. Indeed, oil futures prices responded to much the same economic forces as prices in the physical market . Notwithstanding widespread agreement on this explanation among oil market experts, policy makers have remained intrigued with the speculation hypothesis. The apparent reason is that this hypothesis seems to provide an easy alternative to less popular policies of energy conservation. In fact, the Obama administration's approach to lowering gasoline prices is as impractical as the Republican proposal of bringing gasoline prices down by increasing U.S. oil production. Neither proposal recognizes that oil prices today are determined by the highest bidder in global oil markets. The unpleasant truth is that high prices at the pump are not likely to go away, short of another global recession. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lutz Kilian.","Obama announced proposal to increase surveillance of oil futures markets .

"(CNN) -- A 24-year-old woman in a hospital bed fighting off flesh-eating bacteria has to be told repeatedly -- each time she wakes up -- what has happened, her parents told CNN on Monday. The medication Aimee Copeland is given leads her to forget each time she falls asleep. ""It's scary to her,"" said her mother, Donna Copeland. She asks where she is and ""doesn't understand."" Yet Aimee Copeland -- who has lost a leg and part of her abdomen to the virulent bacteria and may lose more, including her fingers -- is keeping her spirits strong, her father said. Can I get this flesh-eating bacteria? ""We really don't see the suffering side of it. We see the miraculous survival,"" Andy Copeland said. ""I think that's the story that's inspired us, that's the story that's inspired, I think, the nation at this point."" On Facebook, he wrote that doctors have used words like ""astonishing,"" ""confounding"" and ""mind-boggling"" to describe the young woman's recovery. The master's student in psychology at the University of West Georgia was out with friends on May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a homemade zip line. It snapped. The accident left her with a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, when the pain continued, a friend took her to an emergency room, where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and flown to Augusta for surgery. She had contracted the flesh-devouring Aeromonas hydrophila. The bacterium is ""remarkably common in the water and in the environment,"" according to Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. ""When it gets into those deeper tissues, it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition,"" he said. ""When it does that, those tissues die, and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control."" In most cases, people contract the bacteria by swallowing them, resulting in diarrhea. Aimee Copeland's case was much more rare. Her wound became infected, ""and the infection (ran) wild,"" Creech said. A blog set up by the University of West Georgia psychology department said Aimee Copeland will suffer the loss of her fingers. ""However, physicians have hope of bringing life back to the palms of her hands, which could allow her the muscle control to use helpful prosthetics. They are awaiting a safe time before embarking on surgery for this."" Speaking to CNN on Monday, her father said doctors were assessing ""day by day, or even hour by hour."" Copeland has told his daughter that one day, the family will celebrate Aimee Day -- when she will be able to breathe on her own. ""We're going to celebrate that day forever for the rest of your life,"" he told her. ""It's the day that my daughter was delivered from this horrible, horrible disease."" If there's anything to be learned, Andy Copeland said, it's not to use homemade zip lines. Aimee Copeland's parents say that when she wakes up, she expresses concern about finishing her thesis. In her studies, she has focused on eco-psychology -- the idea that harmonizing with nature can be a powerful tool in ensuring one's psychological health and vitality. CNN's Josh Levs, Greg Botelho and Brooke Baldwin contributed to this report.","The medication Aimee Copeland is given leads her to forget what has happened .

"(CNN) -- A young woman, her face wet with tears, stares into the lens of a video camera. ""Believe me when I tell you,"" she says, her voice breaking, ""that if this wasn't necessary, that if my dad knew that he could make us survive in Mexico, he would have never brought us here."" She and two other young people, all of whom live in Los Angeles, are the subjects of Eliot Rausch's new film ""Limbo."" The 19-minute film was to premiere Friday in New York as part of the 2012 Vimeo Festival + Awards. Held every 18 months, the event is hosted by video-sharing site Vimeo to celebrate the Internet as a medium for film and bring together members of the Vimeo community who interact regularly online but rarely meet. Vimeo reports more than 8 million users and more than 65 million unique visitors per month. ""So much in our daily lives now, we only meet people online,"" said festival co-director Jeremy Boxer. ""We wanted to do something that was a hybrid between a conference and a film festival."" An emerging showcase for online film, this year's festival features lectures by industry veterans like filmmaker Ed Burns and Academy Award-nominated documentarian Lucy Walker plus workshops and screenings. Thirteen films were selected for top awards out of a pool of 14,567 submissions from 147 countries. A panel of judges, including Rausch and actors Aziz Ansari and James Franco, chose which films received the $5,000 prizes. The festival's $25,000 grand prize was awarded Thursday night to directing collective Everynone for its lyrical three-minute film, ""Symmetry."" All the award winners -- films must be no longer than 20 minutes -- can be viewed online. ""Limbo"" will be posted on Vimeo within the next few days, said Deborah Szajngarten, the site's global communications director. From 'Oden' to 'Limbo' Rausch won the grand prize at the first Vimeo Festival + Awards, held in late 2010, for his short film ""Last Minutes with Oden."" The film documents ex-convict Jason Wood's emotions as he must euthanize his beloved dog, Oden, who had been suffering from cancer. A poignant chronicle of love between human and pet, it has been viewed on Vimeo 2.5 million times. But after winning the award, Rausch felt guilty. ""I think the project was exploiting the life of a friend and his suffering,"" he said. So, in the months that followed, Rausch came up with the idea to use his $25,000 prize money to create a film that might empower his subjects instead of simply chronicling their struggles. Rausch, 30, was working with students who benefit from the California DREAM Act when he stumbled upon the spark for ""Limbo."" The DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors), a legal means of providing paperless illegal-immigrant youth access to higher education and financial aid, was signed into California law in October 2011. The federal version of the bill, which has stalled in the Senate, may become a divisive issue in the presidential election. Three ""Dreamers"" caught Rausch's attention when they shared their life stories with him last year in a private meeting. All three are undocumented teenagers from Mexico who are living with family members in East Los Angeles, Rausch said. ""All three of them came over the border [between Mexico and the United States] illegally at a very young age where they didn't have a choice,"" he said. He declined to reveal names or other personal details about his subjects, who risk deportation. Rausch saw a film taking shape from the narratives of the man and the two young women but couldn't figure out how to construct it. Then he noticed the first-person video being posted online during last year's Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere, and it occurred to him that he could give his three subjects the tools to tell their own story. Last September, Rausch gave them point-and-shoot video cameras and asked that they use them to document their lives. ""I quickly realized that the technology is there, that each individual is becoming his or her own journalist,"" Rausch said. ""I thought, could there be a chance to empower the subject matter themselves to capture the story? Could they present their own film? And I could just step out of the way and be there as a teacher?"" This approach, Rausch believes, is in keeping with our mobile digital age, in which every person with a smartphone or a Flip camera is a potential journalist. ""We're in a time where all these resources and tools are available to everybody,"" agreed Boxer, the festival director. 'Giving the voiceless a voice' After an introduction to filmmaking and three months of daily shooting, the three apprentice filmmakers presented Rausch with more than 100 hours of intimate, sometimes gut-wrenching footage. One young narrator used her video camera to document her family's painful search for her father after his arrest and deportation to Mexico. Since he was deported, she and her family members have been trying to support themselves by baking and selling bread. ""I know that under the law what we're doing [being in the U.S. illegally] is a crime,"" says the teary young woman in the film. ""But we're just trying to survive."" She said the ordeal has given her new respect for her mother. ""She's the strongest woman I've ever known. No matter what life throws at her, she's always been able to get up."" The woman, who wants to be a lawyer, said that documenting herself on video was a learning process. ""It was hard,"" she said. ""I didn't want to take the camera at times."" The other young woman in the film also hopes to become a lawyer, while the man aspires to be a journalist, Rausch said. He and producer Mark Schwartz spent countless hours pruning down the trio's footage to make the film. Rausch said he didn't make ""Limbo"" as a political statement about the hot-button issue of immigration. ""It was more about giving the voiceless a voice,"" he said. While he ceded control of the narrative to the students, Rausch still assigns his own meaning to the final cut. ""It's ultimately a social experiment,"" he said. Rausch said he hopes ""Limbo"" can represent a new, unfiltered form of cinematic storytelling. ""We're at a point in time now where myself, documentarians and filmmakers should start finding ways to actually empower the story to tell itself rather than putting our own spin on it,"" he said. ""So let's find ways to purify, simplify and get to the core of the experience rather than waiting for the perfect production or perfect way to articulate it."" After ""Last Minutes with Oden,"" his conscience has been appeased. ""I know for a moment in time, [these] three teens felt valued,"" he said. ""Their voices were heard and I can sleep OK tonight.""","""Limbo"" was to premiere Friday in New York as part of the 2012 Vimeo Festival + Awards .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Legendary hairstylist Vidal Sassoon died of ""apparent natural causes"" at his Los Angeles home Wednesday morning, a Los Angeles police spokesman said. He was 84. Police were called to Sassoon's Bel Air home on Mulholland Drive at 10:30 a.m., spokesman Kevin Maiberger said. ""When officers arrived, there were family members at the residence,"" Maiberger said. Sassoon, a British native, is credited with revolutionizing women's hair in the 1960s after a childhood that included several years in a London orphanage. His father had left, and his mother could not afford to care for him. Later, after his mother dreamed of her son being in a barbershop, she apprenticed him to a local barber. That began a career that saw him develop two classic hairstyles of the 1960s, the bob and the even shorter five-point cut, along with an eponymous hair care line, a range of hair care tools and a chain of salons. ""At the very beginning, the only thing I was truly interested in was changing the craft of hairdressing into a cutting art form, where we created shapes to the body structure and bone structure to bring out the very best that we could, that I knew how, in an individual face,"" Sassoon told CNN in a 1998 interview. After ""a sucession of lucky breaks"" starting in the early 1960s, Sassoon found himself in a 1964 show in New York. The following day, he met with Richard Salomon, CEO of the beauty product company Charles of the Ritz, who brought him to the United States. ""He said, 'I'll tell you what: I'll buy a building on Madison Avenue, you go home train a team, send me your architect, we'll open next year.' And we did, on a handshake,"" Sassoon recounted. ""So those lucky breaks do happen, but obviously, he liked what I did."" Queen Elizabeth made Sassoon a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2009 for his services to the British hairdressing industry.

"Shiner, Texas (CNN) -- Shiner is a place you can raise your cattle and chickens under the hot Texas sun, cool off with a bottle from the Lone Star State's oldest independent brewery, then go to bed knowing all your neighbors and believing that you'll be safe. But a few days ago, one of its trademark ranches turned into a crime scene. That's when a father spotted a man sexually assaulting his 5-year-old daughter, then beat the alleged abuser to death. In a community that prides itself as being peaceful, a place where things like this just don't happen, there is a sweeping consensus that justice was served. ""Any father would have done that,"" Michael James Veit, whose son graduated with the father from Shiner High School in 2007 and who now lives across the road from the ranch where the killing took place, said Thursday. ""Everybody is saying the father is justified."" According to the Lavaca County Sheriff's Office, the 23-year-old father and his family were enjoying a barbecue last Saturday at their ranch on Shiner's outskirts where they keep horses and chickens. His young daughter had gone off toward the barn, to feed the chickens, the child's grandfather -- who isn't being named, to protect the identity of his granddaughter -- told CNN affiliates KSAT and KPRC. Then her father heard screaming and ran. He found a 47-year-old man in the act of sexually abusing his daughter, according to Sheriff Mica Harmon. The father stopped the alleged abuser, then pounded him repeatedly in the head. ""I jumped the fence and saw the man on the ground,"" the grandfather said of what he first saw. ""At that point, I didn't know if he was dead or not."" Authorities did, in fact, pronounce the alleged abuser dead. Lavaca County Precinct Judge Alene Lyons said Monday that a preliminary autopsy report shows he ""died from blunt-force head and neck injuries,"" adding toxicology report results should be back in six weeks. Harmon described the victim as an acquaintance of the family, known for his horse-grooming abilities. He has not been publicly identified by authorities. The father himself called 911, telling them that his daughter's alleged abuser was lying, beaten, on the ground. Afterward, the sheriff said that the admitted killer appeared ""very remorseful"" and didn't know the other man would die at the scene. Asked whether authorities would press charges against the father, the sheriff responded, ""You have a right to defend your daughter. He acted in defense of his third person. Once the investigation is completed, we will submit it to the district attorney, who then submits it to the grand jury, who will decide if they will indict him."" Neighbors portrayed the father as hard-working, friendly and polite, the type of guy who reliably addresses others as ""Sir."" ""He's not a violent guy. He's never been in any trouble in his life,"" Veit said of a man he described as a single father who worked nobly to make ends meet. ""He's a good, honest, hard-working kid."" Most any violence is unexpected in Shiner, a community between Houston and San Antonio that has about 2,000 people within its city limits and another 1,500 or so on its outskirts, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Billing itself as the ""Cleanest Little City in Texas,"" Shiner is known for the Spoetzl Brewery, a wire and plastics company, not to mention its acres upon acres of plains and farms. Veit calls it ""a small-town community,"" filled with folks who may not be wealthy but who work hard and look out for one another. ""Nothing ever happens. There's never any murders here,"" Veit said. ""Everybody knows everybody and gets along with everybody. (This killing) is a real big shock.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- She was remembered in her last Olympics 16 years ago -- a near lifetime in an athlete's career -- as a diminutive figure whose size belied her big ambitions and ability to win Olympic gold. Janet Evans, at 5-foot-6 and 108 pounds, is now 40 years old, and just as Dara Torres made an extraordinary comeback at age 41 to be the oldest swimmer in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, Evans is now seeking her own Act 2. Evans has qualified to participate in late June's trials to make the U.S. Olympic Team, and if she makes the cut, she will go on to compete in the London Games in July. When she retired following her last Olympics in 1996, she was considered one of the greatest distance freestyle swimmers of all time, winning four gold medals. In all, she competed in three Olympic Games -- Seoul in 1988, Barcelona in 1992 and Atlanta in 1996. She was known for her ""unorthodox windmill"" stroke, as she puts it. Now the Olympian who began swimming at age 2 and competing at age 4 is seeking her fourth Games over a 24-year period. Can she conquer the biggest adversary of all -- aging? In a recent interview with CNN at her Huntington Beach, California, training facility about 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Evans said she has been working out five hours a day -- with her husband spending more time taking care of their two small children. But she still drops the kids off at day care with her hair wet and puts dinner on the table every night, she says. ""This time has been so much more fulfilling,"" she said of her latest Olympics attempt. She has spent the past 16 years as an author, reality TV personality and a motivational speaker. ""Of course, the competitor in me wants to make the Olympic team, but I also feel like if I don't, it's been an amazing journey,"" Evans added. Her return to long hours in the pool has agreed with her. She swims 10 miles daily, plus 45-minute workouts in the weight room. ""It didn't take me as long as I thought to get into a groove,"" she said. ""My family really supported me. My husband said he would be home to take care of the kids, and so I found a routine."" The Laguna Beach, California, resident expects supporters in her quest to make the 2012 Olympic team, but she also expects her share of skeptics. ""The hardest part of this comeback wasn't physical and wasn't scheduling,"" Evans said. ""It was the critics. And I knew there would be critics out there, and I always had critics in my career."" Those critics will say things like ""You know, she's 40. She has children. What is she thinking? She already had this success. Leave it for someone else now. Someone else deserves it. You've had your time,"" Evans said. She has a simple answer to those critics. ""Well, if I swim fast enough, who says it's not my time."" Evans says she's proud of the fact ""that at 40, I can come back and actually swim with 17-year-olds and keep up with them."" But she admits to having an occasional bad night of sleep because her daughter or son is up at night. Her trainer, Mark Schubert, said returning to swimming shape wasn't easy for Evans. ""I think for her at 40, the physical is the more difficult. You know she was always in good shape. But it was getting back into swimming shape. Her mental attitude has not changed. Not a bit,"" he told CNN. ""Predictions in swimming are difficult, but I think Janet is going to amaze everybody with how fast she can swim,"" Schubert added. Evans' husband, Bill Wilson, said his admiration for his wife has grown. ""I understand why 20-year-olds do this, because I think when you are not in the pool training, you are resting, right,"" he said. ""And for Janet at 40 with two kids and working and a mom, she doesn't get as much rest as she would probably like, and I respect that even more."" CNN's Chuck Conder contributed to this report.","Janet Evans, one of the greatest distance freestyle swimmers, has won four gold medals .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man has launched a website to publicize what he calls ""a culture of bullying"" by teachers in his son's Cherry Hill classroom after sending the boy -- who has been diagnosed with autism -- to school with a covert recording device. Stuart Chaifetz said he placed the recorder in the pocket of his 10-year-old son, Akian, in an attempt to find out why staffers at Horace Mann Elementary School had reported that the boy had been acting out and hitting his teachers. What surfaced was more than six hours of recordings of what he says are teachers and aides apparently talking about alcohol and sex in front of the class, punctuated by yelling at his son to ""shut your mouth."" Chaifetz posted the recording online Monday, which has since led to disciplinary actions, including the removal of at least one teacher, school officials said. At one point, an adult female voice can be heard saying in the recording, ""I had a bottle of wine with my girlfriend last night."" The second female voice asks if she spent the morning ""heaving."" ""Oh my God, so bad,"" the first woman responds. ""The wine won."" Chaifetz said he reached out to school officials to report the alleged actions of the teacher and her aides. ""The school district was as horrified as I was,"" he said. In an online statement, Cherry Hill Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Maureen Reusche said that the district investigated the recordings and ""responded swiftly and appropriately."" ""I want to assure our parents that the individuals who are heard on the recording raising their voices and inappropriately addressing children no longer work in the district and have not since shortly after we received the copy of the recording,"" she said. Chaifetz -- who said he didn't think the disciplinary action went far enough -- posted a video on YouTube of himself denouncing the incident, interspersed with the recordings. He also launched a website called ""No More Teacher/Bullies,"" with additional audio clips of the incident. He said his son can be heard screaming and crying in the recording. Chaifetz said an earlier meeting with school officials about his son's behavior prompted the decision to place the recording device in the boy's pocket. He wasn't getting answers as to why Akian had been acting out, so he decided to bug the boy, he said. It was unlike his son to misbehave and hit his teachers, Chaifetz said, though he had difficulty getting answers from Akian because he struggles with speaking. ""He wasn't able to come home and say, 'Dad, they called me a name today.'"" Chaifetz says he wants an apology from the teachers and claims one of them apparently has been transferred to a local high school in the same district. CNN cannot independently confirm that claim. School officials said they would not comment on personnel issues. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","Stuart Chaifetz said he placed a recording device in the pocket of his son, Akian .

"(CNN) -- Five bodies were found Saturday in a burned-out vehicle in the southern Arizona desert, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said. Border Patrol officers originally spotted the white Ford Excursion around 4:30 a.m. off the side of Interstate 8 in western Pinal County, about 60 miles south of Phoenix. When the agent turned around, the SUV ""fled at high rates of speed,"" Babeu told CNN. Aided by daylight, authorities spotted ""numerous tracks off the road"" and followed them for two to three miles before coming across a smoldering vehicle. ""That's when the Border Patrol agents went up to the vehicle with fire extinguishers and realized there were bodies inside, clearly deceased,"" the sheriff said. None of the five killed was in the SUV's front seat. One was in the second row and the other four bodies were found ""laying down flat in the cargo area,"" Babeu said. A cause of death for the victims, who have not been identified, is not yet known. The charred vehicle was the same make and model as the one spotted by the Border Patrol agent hours earlier. Authorities are investigating whether the bodies found are linked to violence by Mexican drug cartels. The incident took place in the Vekol Valley, a hotbed of drug- and human-smuggling activity, according to Babeu, who said his department conducted 350 high-speed chases in the area last year in an effort to curb such crime. ""It looks like it's a cartel hit, where they exact revenge on people,"" the sheriff said, calling a drug connection ""very likely"" while noting there's been no definitive conclusion yet. ""It happens all the time in Mexico; our fear and concern is that this violence is spilling over deep into the heart of Arizona.""

"(CNN) -- With frizzy hair still standing to attention, North Korea's Kim Jong-Il drops dead, narrowly missing the nuke button as he slumps face-down onto his desk. Welcome to the world of Patrick Chappatte -- a cartoonist whose knack for summing up major global events in a few simple brush strokes this week saw him become the first ever non-American to win the Overseas Press Club of America's international cartoonist award. Chappatte will be familiar to regular readers of the International Herald Tribune, the global version of the New York Times, which prints his works of satire, slapstick and political comment on a daily basis. But while his day job is producing illustrations to match the headlines, Chappatte is one of a new breed of cartoonists who do their own reporting; taking their sketchbooks and pens on to the front line of news gathering. Such ""graphic journalism,"" says Chappatte, is often the most effective way of telling a story in a digital age where people are bombarded with information from all directions. ""Cartoons in their simplicity can help tell news stories and I think we will be using them more and more because they have a very special effect on people,"" he told CNN by phone from Geneva, shortly before flying to New York to accept his prize. See a high-res gallery of Chappatte's prize-winning cartoons . ""I personally feel the need to report and I feel that cartoons will help us in a world that is overwhelmed with videos and images where we're dealing with so much information every day."" Among the dozen or so cartoons for which Chappatte is being honored is ""Ground Zero of the Revolution,"" a striking example of graphic journalism for which he traveled to Tunisia to record the story of Mohammed Bouazizi, the man whose suicide sparked the Arab Spring uprisings. Chappatte also recently completed ""Death in the Fields"" a powerful animated film, produced with the International Committee of the Red Cross, that documents victims of cluster bombs in southern Lebanon. It is a project he hopes will lead to other similar work. ""People react very strongly in an emotional way in that kind of storytelling, so I see a lot of hope for that genre in the future,"" he said. Born in Pakistan to a Swiss father and Lebanese mother, Chappatte says he became an international cartoonist because he was an avid reader of newspapers in the numerous countries he grew up in. After placing his first cartoon (about a man who broke out of jail for the seventh time) in a local Swiss newspaper at the age of 20, he worked his way to America, where he was employed first by the New York Times as an illustrator, then by Newsweek, which hired him to write a comic strip. Chappatte then landed the IHT job in Geneva just a few days before the attacks of September 11, 2001, an event which tested his ability to ""convey the feeling of America and the sense of the moment."" He must have done something right because, as he points out with typical deadpan humor: ""They kept me."" Chappatte puts his own success down to the ability to ""translate into a simple idea and a few brush strokes the gravity or the reality of things... to show things as they are. ""When you look at it and say, that's exactly it! That's the best compliment people can give me."" This is no easy task, particularly when the internet exposes cartoons to global scrutiny, as was the case in 2005 when the Danish newspaper Jyllens-Posten sparked controversy and demonstrations throughout in the Muslim world by printing a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed. ""That was the 9/11 of editorial cartooning,"" says Chappatte. He says he is wary about causing outrage with his own work. ""We don't all agree where the line is or where the balance is,"" he adds. ""I have a simple rule for myself. When I do a cartoon that can be seen as shocking for people, I want to be able to defend that cartoon eye-to-eye with the person that feels offended."" While he describes the Jyllands-Posten episode as a ""controversy of the internet age,"" Chappatte -- who has just returned from a graphic reporting assignment on urban violence in Guatemala -- remains enthusiastic about the potential of cyberspace. ""The internet is full of possibilities in the language of cartoonists. You can do animated stuff and you can do multimedia stuff -- a whole new range of creativity.""","Patrick Chappatte is the first non-American to win Overseas Press Club international cartoonist award .

"(CNN) -- The wife of a U.S. Army captain in Afghanistan watched a live link for two hours of her husband slumped over a computer keyboard with a bullet hole in a closet behind him as she tried to summon help for him, she said. The account by Susan Orellana-Clark offers new details about what she saw happen some 7,500 miles away, while raising fresh questions as to how he died and why, according to her, it took two hours for anyone to come to his aid. Orellana-Clark, in a statement released Sunday, recounted the details surrounding the death of her husband, Capt. Bruce Kevin Clark, who died April 30 at Tarin Kowt, about 85 miles (140 kilometers) north of Kandahar. She said the two were chatting on Skype, and there was no sign that he was in any discomfort, ""nor did he indicate any alarm."" ""Then CPT Clark was suddenly knocked forward,"" the statement said. ""The closet behind him had a bullet hole in it."" Orellana-Clark said several other people -- one of them a member of the military -- who rushed to her home after she called for help saw the hole in the closet and agreed it was a bullet hole. ""After two hours and many frantic phone calls by Mrs. Clark, two military personnel arrived in the room (in Afghanistan) and appeared to check (Clark's) pulse, but provided no details about his condition to his wife,"" the statement said. Orellana-Clark was releasing details ""to honor my husband and dispel the inaccurate information and supposition promulgated by other parties."" Two U.S. military officials with knowledge of the investigation conducted in Afghanistan confirmed that it took two hours from the time Clark collapsed while on Skype with his wife to when military personnel responded. They explained part of the issue was that the wife's request was routed through several commands in the United States before it was relayed to Afghanistan. Clark was assigned to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, but deployed with a medical unit from Fort Hood. No wounds were found on Clark's body, according to one of the officials, who said the death has been determined to be ""non-combat"" and suicide has been ruled out as a cause. An official determination of cause of death is pending autopsy and toxicology results, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is still under investigation. The official could not reconcile Orellana-Clark's account with the ongoing investigation. Clarence Davis, a spokesman for the Beaumont Army Medical, said Friday that it had not been determined how Clark died. A call to the medical center Sunday was not immediately returned. In addition to his wife, Clark is survived by two daughters. Known by many as Kevin, Clark was a chief nurse in the Army who amassed many honors in his military career, according to his family. Those include an Army Commendation Medal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and an Army Service Medal. The longtime resident of Spencerport, New York, joined the Army in September 2006 and served, among other places, at the Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, according to a Beaumont Army Medical Center statement. More recently, he was based at that medical facility in southwest Texas and assigned to the Army's A Company, Troop Command. ""He loved being in the military,"" his sister-in-law Mariana Barry told CNN affiliate WHAM in upstate New York. ""He was absolutely willing to make any sacrifice, and it's just horrible that this is the sacrifice he ended up making."" His commander described Clark, 43, as ""awesome,"" ""professional"" and ""a great asset, leader and friend,"" the family said. After his death, special operations troops from the United States and Australia lined up to give him his final send-off from Afghanistan. On Thursday, his casket was wrapped in an American flag as it was transported off a military plane onto the tarmac of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, according to the U.S. Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operation. While no dates have been given, the family said that Clark's funeral will be in Spencerport and a memorial service will be held in Addison, Michigan. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered all flags at state government buildings be flown at half-staff Monday in Clark's honor, as he's done with other troops from the state who have died in combat zones.

"(CNN) -- We began breakfast one recent morning delivering this news to Luna: Rosanna, her caregiver, was going on a two-week vacation. ""Who is going to take care of me?"" she asked. And then she gave me ""the look."" I call it pouty face. Her dime-sized brown eyes squeeze together, the lower lip rolls out, the hands ball up. Every time she looks like that, my crazy Mama Head empties of sugarplum fairies and fills with fears of pedophilia and child snatching. Previously on CNN: I'm her mom, not the nanny! We have had the same babysitter since Luna was born. Rosanna would step in front of a train for Luna. She is not easily replaced. But when Luna was a baby, we figured we had options. There is a reason God gave us mothers, tias (aunties), abuelitas (grandmothers) and the occasional BFF you call ""co-madre"" regardless of whether they are actually your kid's godmother and hence your ""co-mother."" The problem is every Latina in New York works until death. There is no cotton-topped Grandma on standby sitting in her house-dress feeding chickens. I don't think all Latinas are so overprotective of their kids. But this one is. Luna was just a baby the first time Rosanna went on vacation. I called my mother who lives in DC and laid on the guilt. I recited the CDC statistic that 1 in 4 girls is sexually abused before age 18 (it's all about sexual abuse with the Mamas). She hopped on a train and I left for work. She called me an hour later with Telemundo blaring in the background. Luna had early pouty face. She must be malnourished by my lousy parenting and in need of chicken soup. I told my mother she drinks only breast milk and to look in the fridge. Luna began throwing up at 3 a.m. I called the pediatrician, who yelled through the speakerphone to call 911. ""You ate soup when you were a week old,"" my mother admitted sheepishly. Arce: My nanny's sadness is also my own . Rosanna demanded to vet her next replacement. She hangs out with a legion of sitters representing all the nations of Central and South America, and they have their special ways. Children should be stuffed with comfort food; pock marked by lipstick kisses, wrinkled from hugging and rocking, and wear fuzzy socks because their feet can never be too warm. I'm not saying other ethnic groups don't coddle their kids, but Latinas just seem to excel at it. I remember being handed a worksheet at a Mommy and Me group that mapped out three goals for toddlers: adaptation, separation, and integration. My sitter and her gang laughed at me. Adaptation? Baby will do it when she's ready. Take potty training. For months my toilet was surrounded by Latina sitters staring at Luna, waiting for poo. Separation? Never happens. Mamas, grandmas, nanas, your 400 tias and most particularly your girlfriends are in this with you cradle-to-grave. Integration? Yes, they are allowed to play with children being raised by their friends. That's plenty. I wasn't going to be drawn into this kind of ethnocentricity. My employer offers a service providing bonded, certified, triple-A, recommended, backup babysitters. My sitter threatened to pull my Latina card. ""You're leaving your/my child with a total stranger in a strange land?!"" I reminded her I was born here. The next morning ""Grace"" arrived. Luna gave me pouty Face, but I walked out the door with my head high. I got a call an hour later. One of Rosanna's snitches was at my apartment. ""She's feeding her cold plantains,"" she whispered in Spanish. I told her to butt out. Then came call No. 2, this time from my neighbor. ""The Spanish nannies are icing the replacement,"" she warned me. ""Luna has pouty face."" Call No. 3 came from the sitter herself. ""Luna doesn't want to take a nap or eat her porridge,"" she said. ""Luna no longer naps, and what is porridge?"" I asked. I came home after Call No. 5 to a troupe of nannies staring down this poor woman from ""a Caribbean country where they don't even speak Spanish."" I accused everyone of bigotry and got that stare that says ""new mom."" Grace revealed she had never cared for a child ""this particular age"" and said she had to go. The specter of Grace reigned over our household for months. If you don't behave, Grace will be coming for the weekend. Clean up your toys, or Grace will pick you up from preschool. If only I could find that woman, I'd hire her one more time just to revive the memory. The next replacement sitter was an aging woman sent by an agency with hearts and fairies dancing across their logo. Not an hour after her arrival came phone call No. 1. ""Mama, it's Luna. I'm on the phone upstairs."" Let's start with the fact that Luna had never dialed the phone on her own. ""Why are you upstairs?"" I inquired. ""I don't nap. I don't want bath."" I could feel pouty face through the phone. Then came call waiting. The nanny was on the other line complaining that Luna wouldn't bathe at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I clicked to Luna. ""Mama come!"" I was home in an hour. Rosanna had won. During her next vacations, she outsourced Luna to her tribe -- Monica from Chile, Delma from El Salvador, Jaime from Guatemala. It was a brilliant solution for about a year, until all their kiddies started school. Suddenly, mamas were ditching their Latina sitters left and right in exchange for grimy after-school programs and college students trying to make an extra buck toward tuition. Those who didn't soon lost their sitters to more fulltime jobs. We clung to Rosanna. But her next vacation left us in a lurch. We requested a Spanish speaker from an agency, and they sent a woman from Puerto Rico. An hour later, my building superintendent called. ""Your baby sitter is a freak,"" he said. ""Luna told me to call. And she's not Puerto Rican."" Who pretends to be Puerto Rican to get a job? I couldn't come home. I posted a cry for help to my faux friends on Facebook, which elicited only sympathy. The super called again. ""Would you like me to take her?"" he asked, he of the four kids who've scampered our halls chatting in Albanian since they were toddlers. Great! He even has the keys! I expressed my glee on Facebook and the replies poured in. In short order, my super was accused of being a pedophile, a child trafficker, a canonize-able saint, and a shyster looking to rob me. I got home to find Luna with his daughter, Ana, all grown up, making paper bag puppets. Pouty face no more! Ding Ding Ding -- sitter Lotto! I had found an unemployed college graduate who lives down the hall and is great with kids. I was all set until I got altruistic and recommended her to a friend. Less than a year later she had a fulltime job. That brings me back to this week. As soon as I mentioned back-up care, Rosanna sprung into action and ran it all by Luna who now talks in full sentences. They announced a girl named Yomaris would be monitoring Luna. I also hired a lovely girl from back-up care who they allowed to hang out with them. I still had Luna cruising from play-date to play-date. Rosanna somehow managed to monitor the entire thing from the Dominican Republic. By week's end, everyone had it covered. I was out of it, sitting totally detached at work, sporting my own pouty face.","Rose Arce was lost when her regular baby-sitter, Rosanna, took a vacation .

"(CNN) -- Every time I hear Mitt Romney protest that he's being attacked for his success, my head goes to that Pantene shampoo commercial from the early '80s where the actress opens with, ""Don't hate me because I'm beautiful."" Even as a kid, I remember being confused by this opening line when everything I saw around me celebrated beauty like hers. No one hated that woman for being beautiful, although in retrospect maybe we should have harbored some animosity for the shoulder pads and big hair that passed as fashion at the time. And just as Americans celebrate beauty, we also celebrate success, despite Mitt's protestations. We're a hopelessly optimistic bunch, and we love nothing more than to project ourselves into the rags to riches narratives that pervade our media, our business world, and our politics. So let me just address this to Mitt directly: Mitt, can we get this straight once and for all? With the exception of the people who watched their jobs fly overseas and their communities decimated when you shut down their factories to make a profit for your private equity firm, Bain Capital, no one hates you for your ""success."" But taunting voters with your self-serving tax plan and your taste for expensive vehicles may not be the best way to instill confidence that you'll help people have the chance at their own success someday. In fact, your single-minded insistence that this is at the root of any concern with your candidacy only reinforces the discomfort of many voters envisioning you in the White House. Indeed, as May Day protests once again call out growing economic inequality in our country, it's hard to imagine these cries falling on more deaf ears than Mitt Romney's. The problem is Mitt's tendency to remind us at every turn that he spent some of that wealth on blinders that shield him from the facts of life as most Americans know them. Nowhere was this more apparent than the speech last week at Otterbein University in Ohio. As parents and kids huddle together around kitchen tables to consider whether college is even a possibility and Ohio continues to lead the nation in job losses, Mitt's suggestion to the crowd of students was if they want to buy a business, they should borrow money from their (tapped-out) parents. From the $10,000 wager in the middle of a political debate to his insistence that $374,000 for speaker's fee is ""not very much,"" he continually demonstrates a fiscal consciousness orders of magnitude off from the average voter. The cumulative impact of these statements is not envy but flat-out astonishment that a presidential candidate could have so little knowledge of the typical economic conditions in our country. It almost feels like if Mitt Romney were to become president, he might have to spend the first couple years in language immersion classes in order to accurately grasp the situation on the ground. And no one is in a waiting mood. A recent report from the Fed shows some economic improvement but not by the rate we hoped and unemployment declining but not by much. Every time Mitt unmasks his inner privilege by ribbing guys at a NASCAR rally about their Walmart rain ponchos -- ""I like those fancy raincoats,"" Mitt said to a group of men outside in the downpour, ""Really sprung for the big bucks!"" -- he reinforces a growing unease that if this guy can't see the same picture as the rest of us, he can't possibly change it. Against, this backdrop, Romney's tax plan could sink his candidacy. His most recent plan would cut his own taxes by a projected $4 million while raising taxes on the poorest Americans through a repeal of the earned income tax credit. Tough sell when he's worth $250 million and over half of American workers try to get by on less than $27,000 a year. Voters want to believe that success is within their reach, but equal opportunity is a key part of that equation. Ninety-seven percent of Americans think that everyone in our country should have equal opportunity to get ahead. So when Romney says he is ""not concerned about the very poor"" while charging them to lower his own taxes, the problem is not that he has a lot of money, but that he's going to make sure other people people can't. Only one president got away with a similarly distorted tax plan, because he was uniquely able to speak the language of the average Americans. His name was George W. Bush and most folks aren't keen for a repeat, even if Romney could wrap it in the folksy tone of his Republican predecessor. American presidents have almost always come from wealth, although no doubt Mitt Romney would rank up there at the top end of the spectrum. But our most revered leaders never lost sight of their own privilege and the responsibility that comes along with that. Franklin D. Roosevelt famously said, ""We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals. We know now that it is bad economics."" The Pantene girl knew that in the end we didn't hate her because she was beautiful -- otherwise, she wouldn't have sold any shampoo. The more Romney believes his problem is his success, the slimmer his chances of convincing Americans he might be the one for the job.

"(CNN) -- Three British troops were shot and killed by a man wearing the uniform of an Afghan national police officer in violence-plagued southern Afghanistan, the British Ministry of Defence said Monday. They were serving with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force when they were killed Sunday. The attack is under investigation, the NATO-led force said. The British said two of the soldiers were from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, and the third was serving with the Royal Corps of Signals. It was unclear whether the attacker was an Afghan police officer or an infiltrator wearing the uniform. The problem of members of the Afghan forces who have turned their weapons on allied soldiers -- so-called ""green on blue"" attacks -- has repeatedly occurred this year. In February, a top U.S. lawmaker cited at least 42 attacks by Afghan security forces on their international allies in the past five years. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said 39 of the attacks were by members of the Afghan National Security Forces and three were by contractors. There was at least one more green-on-blue attack in March when two Americans were shot and killed after reports emerged that Qurans had mistakenly been burned by American troops. In March, Gen. John Allen, commander of the NATO-led force, noted ""an erosion of trust that has emerged from this."" But he said that the systems the Afghans and coalition had put in place to help stop these attacks before they happen were having an effect. Allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force, and the Afghans ""have taken a lot of steps themselves."" In May, a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform shot at coalition service members in eastern Afghanistan, killing one of them.

"London (CNN) -- Singer Robin Gibb has ""confounded"" his doctors by emerging from a coma just days after they thought he might not survive it, his physician said Sunday. Days ago, Bee Gees star Gibb was in a coma and battling pneumonia, the latest turn in health issues that include a recent battle with colon and liver cancer. Now he is ""fully conscious, lucid and able to speak to his loved ones,"" Dr. Andrew Thillainayagam said in a statement. ""He is breathing on his own, with an oxygen mask. He is on intravenous feeding and antibiotics. He is of course, exhausted, extremely weak and malnourished. Our immediate goals are to ensure that Robin's swallowing mechanism is safe enough to allow him to eat and drink, and that he recovers enough strength to breathe effectively, without needing high levels of oxygen by mask."" When that happens, he may be moved out of the intensive care unit at the London Clinic, the doctor said. ""It is testament to Robin's extraordinary courage, iron will and deep reserves of physical strength that he has overcome quite incredible odds to get where he is now,"" Thillainayagam said. The good news comes just three days after Thillainayagam warned Gibb's family ""that I feared the worst.,"" he said. ""We felt it was very likely that Robin would succumb to what seemed to be insurmountable obstacles to any form of meaningful recovery. As a team, we were all concerned that we might be approaching the realms of futility."" ""The road ahead for Robin remains uncertain but it is a privilege to look after such an extraordinary human being,"" Thillainayagam said. Gibb's wife Dwina and children Robin-John, Spencer, and Melissa have been at his bedside every day, the doctor said. Robin Gibb's twin brother, Maurice, died in 2003 of a twisted bowel. His brother Andy died at age 30 from a heart infection in 1988. The Brothers Gibb -- calling themselves the Bee Gees -- soared to renown as one of the most successful British groups after the 1977 film ""Saturday Night Fever"" starring John Travolta was built around the group's disco songs. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, the Bee Gees have sold more than 200 million albums, and their soundtrack album to ""Saturday Night Fever"" was the top-selling album until Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" claimed that distinction in the 1980s. While often in the background as brother Barry sang lead vocals, Robin Gibb stepped forward on several top tunes, including ""I Started a Joke"" and ""I've Gotta Get a Message to You."" He also recorded several solo albums during his career.","Gibb is fully conscious and lucid, his doctor says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A massage therapist who accused John Travolta of sexually assaulting him at the Beverly Hills Hotel hired high-profile attorney Gloria Allred to represent him a day after he withdrew from a lawsuit filed by another lawyer. ""We are in the process of conferring with him regarding the next steps, which he may wish to take,"" Allred said. The original federal suit against Travolta is still pending, but it involves just one male therapist who says the actor groped him during a massage at an Atlanta hotel. Attorney Okorie Okorocha, who filed the lawsuit last week, dropped John Doe #1, who made the Beverly Hills allegation, from the complaint Tuesday because of the Texas man's confusion over the date of the alleged incident. Travolta lawyer Martin Singer called the charges from both men ""ridiculous"" and said the dismissal of John Doe #1 ""completely vindicated"" the actor on that allegation. ""We fully expect that my client will similarly be vindicated with respect to Doe #2, as well as with respect to any other person who makes meritless claims against John Travolta,"" Singer said. That dismissal was ""without prejudice, which means that he is still legally entitled to file a lawsuit against John Travolta if he chooses,"" Allred said Wednesday. Okorocha apologized last Friday for putting the wrong date of the John Doe #1 incident in the lawsuit, saying his first client initially told him it was January 16, 2012. Singer produced a restaurant receipt and a time-stamped photograph that showed the actor was in New York, not Los Angeles, on that date. Instead of just changing the date on the filing to January 15 -- the day John Doe #1 later decided was when it happened -- Okorocha decided to withdraw the allegation from the lawsuit. Otherwise, it would have hampered the chances of John Doe #2's case, he said. Okorocha also said he had ""personality conflicts"" with John Doe #1 that contributed to his decision. The lawyer insisted in a CNN interview Tuesday that he would ""mop up"" in the courtroom with the allegations made by John Doe #2. ""I can guarantee that John Doe #2 has a truckload of witnesses to back up what he's saying,"" he said. His case is also bolstered by a series of e-mails in which the Atlanta plaintiff complains to his supervisor about Travolta's advances, Okorocha said. Singer attacked one e-mail published in some online reports that purportedly supports the Doe #2 claims. ""Various media outlets are reporting on an e-mail that Doe #2 allegedly sent to his bosses, which significantly does not refer to my client at all, nor does it make any mention whatsoever of any of the things outrageously alleged in Doe #2's lawsuit,"" Singer said. ""Instead, Doe #2 voiced complaints about his co-workers gossiping and being insubordinate."" The e-mail's lack of Travolta's name ""says it all,"" Singer said. ""Nothing that is alleged in Doe #2's lawsuit was mentioned in the e-mail he sent to his bosses, making his claims even more unbelievable."" ""The allegations in 'Doe #2's' lawsuit are unraveling, just like 'Doe #1's' ridiculous allegations, which were proven false and impossible,"" he said. Okorocha disagreed. ""I think I can show a custom, habit and practice,"" Okorocha said, referring to his allegation that the actor has sexually assaulted dozens of other massage therapists over the years. ""If I bring in 100 people that don't have an ax to grind, don't want any money, they're in 50 different states, they don't know each other, they're all massage therapists, they all have dates, they're at different spa resorts and they say this exact same thing happened, it's pretty hard to refute,"" Okorocha said. His client ""ain't going nowhere,"" and is looking forward to a trial, he said. ""He means business, and he is absolutely determined and he's as solid as they come as when it comes to character, history, reputation,"" Okorocha said. ""He's everything you would want in a client."" The second plaintiff was a staff massage therapist at the Atlanta hotel where he claims he was assaulted by Travolta on January 25, the amended lawsuit said. Travolta, 58, has been married to actress Kelly Preston for 20 years. The oldest of their three children, Jett, was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas in January 2009. CNN's Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.","John Doe #1 ""is still legally entitled"" to sue John Travolta if he wants, she says .

"(CNN) -- Israel, by necessity, has developed one of the most able security and intelligence apparatus in the world. There has been no necessity to develop a world-class political apparatus, however, and it shows. In a single week, the Israeli army's chief of staff, the former head of internal security and the former head of external security have all publicly questioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judgment on Iran. While the current army chief spoke narrowly about the Iranian government, the former security officials directed their fire at Israeli politicians. On Friday, the former internal security chief told an Israeli audience, ""I don't believe in a leadership that makes decisions based on messianic feelings"" -- and he was speaking not of Iran, but of Israel. Last week was Israel's independence day, traditionally an occasion of pride and celebration. Instead, Israelis are in a deep funk. At its founding in 1948, Israel seemed an improbable state. An ingathering of Jews from Eastern Europe, the Arab world and beyond had no real economy, no common language and no common idea of what it was to be an Israeli. Tensions between religious Jews and secular Jews, European Jews and Oriental Jews, and Jews and Arabs simmered for decades. They made accommodations in the name of survival, but few conceded the fight for control of the state. To hear many Israelis tell it now, their nation has become an impossible state. Politics are more contentious than ever. The Israeli welfare state is in full view, as the religious, the poor and the religious poor make increasing demands on the state. Prices are skyrocketing, and the public feels squeezed. A diminishing number of Israelis serve in the army, which once prided itself on universal conscription. Although the old distinctions between Polish and German Jews have faded, many Oriental Jews continue to feel disenfranchised, the rising political prominence of recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union has created another tribe in Israel, and the poor and disempowered Ethiopian Jews yet one more. Politics in Israel has always been a contact sport, but rather than battle to win over the center, an increasing number of political battles are conducted entirely on the fringes. Small religious parties seek greater social spending for their constituents, while a party representing secular Russian Jews focuses on undermining a law exempting ultra-Orthodox Israelis from military service. In election after election, the major parties' share of the vote diminishes, leading to weak coalitions that are ideologically incoherent and that are forced to dole out Cabinet posts and largesse to their members to stay in power. Governments become tentative and fragile. The problems call for decisiveness, but the politicians rarely feel they can afford to be. For Israelis, Iran is an excruciating problem. They rely on intelligence that is never as good as they wish it to be, try to assess accurately actions of people they don't know well and do so with potentially devastating consequences for a wrong move. Israelis also debate Iran with a clarity few other countries can muster: If bombs fell on Israel, how many people have access to fallout shelters? Are the disastrous forest fires of 2010 a sign that Israel's disaster response is simply not up to the task of a military confrontation? What would a military confrontation look like anyway, and could it be won? Israel's last war against another state's army was almost 40 years ago. Its subsequent confrontations have had less clear results. The Israeli political class struggles to consider these issues and more. Should Israel do more to seek peace with the Palestinians? Can it reverse increasingly hostile relations with Turkey? Is a wealth of recently discovered natural gas in the Mediterranean the country's economic salvation? Can Israel do anything about shifting politics in Egypt and the rest of the Arab world that are sidelining pragmatists who sought an accommodation with Israel? And more fundamentally, what is it to be a Jewish state when Israelis themselves cannot agree on who is the arbiter of Jewishness? None of these problems is especially new, but the political forces in Israel seem increasingly unable to confront them. Israelis have traditionally sought political salvation from former generals. Many of Israel's greatest political personalities, from Yitzhak Rabin to Ariel Sharon, came out of the military establishment. For more than a decade, former leaders on the security front have tried to step forward to consolidate Israeli politics toward the middle. Former Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai formed the ill-fated Center Party in 1999, and Sharon formed the centrist Kadima Party in 2005. The security veterans' recent critiques fit into the same pattern, and they may boost the political aspirations of newcomer Yair Lapid, whose background is in media rather than the battlefield. Yet tactics communicated at high volume are not the same as strategy, and Israelis increasingly complain that the former keep substituting for the latter. It is a sign of the vibrancy of Israeli political life that authoritative voices can come out and critique government policy. It is a sign of the weakness of Israeli politics that so many of Israel's same problems persist and so many coalitions remain fragile. For many outside of Israel, it is Israel's position on Iran that is truly consequential, and the rest is commentary. For Israelis, the roiling debate on Iran is just another example of the way Israeli politics work. Israeli politics are not likely to change quickly, and the challenges Israelis feel from Iran are not likely to go away quickly either. Therein lies the rub. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jon B. Alterman.","Jon Alterman says Israel has strong security system, but its political structure is fragile .

"(CNN) -- The six-point peace plan for Syria proposed by Kofi Annan is doomed to fail for one simple reason: Neither President Bashar al-Assad nor the government opposition is interested in making it work. For al-Assad, full implementation of the plan, which includes a political settlement through dialogue and respect for the rights of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, will bring an end to his regime. From the onset of the uprisings, his government knew that a repeat of the protests in Egypt's Tahrir Square or Bahrain's Pearl Square in Damascus or Aleppo will mean regime change. Al-Assad and his inner circle are not about to create conditions that are conducive for such sit-ins just because the Annan plan calls on them to do so. For the opposition groups, Annan could spend all the time he wants on negotiations, but any talks not predicated on al-Assad's stepping aside will not be acceptable. The activists who are spearheading Syria's revolution insist that the opposition exile leadership has a limited mandate and that is to discuss details for the transfer of power from the Assad family to the opposition. The bottom line is that the two main protagonists in the conflict look at the Annan plan as a means to achieve their respective, mutually exclusive objectives. By agreeing to the Annan plan, al-Assad pursues a dual-track strategy: He appeases his Russian and Iranian allies, who have been pressuring him to accept a political solution, while working to kill his way out of the crisis under the pretext that he is confronting ""armed terrorists and gangs."" The opposition wants the cease-fire in order to field mass protests. As one activist from Hama put it to me recently: ""We don't need military intervention, we don't need humanitarian corridors, we don't need safe areas. Enforce the cease-fire and millions will march toward the presidential palace demanding Assad's ouster."" After more than a year of uprisings, Syria is still stuck in a violent stalemate. Al-Assad has not been able to crush the opposition, and opposition seems nowhere near to dislodging al-Assad. Increasingly, the conflict is being framed in existential terms, with some involved becoming more radicalized. The majority of Alawites believe their physical survival is at stake, because they are convinced al-Assad's demise will engender wide-scale revenge killings on them. Hence, they will not accept a solution that will produce a new regime in which they are not guaranteed a leading role. Similarly, the opposition groups believe that if they stop now and al-Assad remains in power, he will hunt them down. Absent a game changer that will tip the balance in favor of one side or the other, the crisis in Syria will become a full-blown sectarian war pitting Sunnis against Alawites, which will likely spill over into the neighboring countries of Iraq and Lebanon. Although military options have been considered by the West, it's hard to say whether that would make a difference in reversing the dynamics in the country. A military operation might cause a regional war involving Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran, with each country supporting its allies in Syria. For now, Iran's Supreme Leader has cast his support firmly with al-Assad. A well-informed Iranian source told me that the Iranian regime will support al-Assad no matter what until the end. On the other hand, Russia's Syria policy seems to be in flux judging by its vote in the United Nations recently. It's too early to tell whether Russia will ease al-Assad out the way Saudi Arabia did in the case of Yemen's Abdullah Saleh. Russia and Iran will probably not abandon al-Assad until they are part of the deal-making process about Syria's future government. One possible game changer is if the protest movement in Syria becomes widespread and covers large stretches of the country. To date, only four of Syria's 14 governorates constitute the major hubs of the protest movement: Homs, Hama, Idlib and Daraa. While we have seen protests in other regions, they have not been as sustained and extensive as those in the four governorates. This is partly due to the state of fragmentation in the opposition ranks, especially among the exile groups, which do not inspire confidence among fence-sitters. Although large segments of fence-sitters including businessmen have come around to supporting the opposition, many remain ambivalent because they doubt the opposition will succeed in overthrowing al-Assad. This perception is reinforced by the fact that Annan's plan does not call for al-Assad to step down -- a detail that is not missed by the Assad regime propaganda machine. While the exile opposition remains divided, there are hopeful signs that the opposition ranks within Syria are becoming better organized, better trained and gaining legitimacy. The future leaders of Syria will not come from the Syrian National Council or the National Coordination Committee for Change; they will emerge from the ranks of the revolutionary councils that are forming in different parts of the country. These councils bring together an eclectic mix of the most active local coordinating committees, independent activists, community and business leaders and military defectors. They are putting in place an administrative infrastructure that is akin to a local provincial council, handling everything from media affairs to helping families who lost their homes to providing legal aid to jailed activists. They are also coordinating with each other to protect relief supply lines that cross their respective territories. In the process, the leaders in these councils, who hail from Syria's different religious and ethnic groups, are developing political skills, cultivating local constituencies and learning through trial and error the business of governing. In a country that is increasingly polarized along sectarian and ethnic lines, these councils can perhaps provide the glue that keeps the country stitched together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Randa Slim.","Randa Slim: The peace plan for Syria proposed by Kofi Annan is doomed to fail .

"Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN) -- Prosecutors wrapped up their case in the John Edwards corruption trial Thursday, detailing hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses used by his former mistress, whose concealment during Edwards' failed presidential run remains at the heart of the scandal. They say the expenses ranged from luxury hotels to private jets to high-priced rental homes largely paid for by Fred Baron, a now-deceased Texas lawyer who was Edwards' finance chairman. Prosecutors did not call to the stand Rielle Hunter, the North Carolina Democrat's ex-mistress and the mother of his youngest child. Speechwriter: Edwards knew about affair cover-up . They say Edwards used donor funds to hide Hunter and their daughter, Quinn, in an effort to keep his candidacy viable. Edwards broke federal law, they allege, by accepting about $725,000 from heiress Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon for that purpose and more than $200,000 from Baron. Edwards' defense team has argued that Andrew Young, a political aide, had largely used the money for his own personal gain, also paying for Hunter's medical expenses during her pregnancy to hide the affair from Edwards' wife. Donations for that purpose, the defense has argued, cannot be considered in violation of campaign finance laws. Edwards faces six felony courts, including conspiracy and making false statements. Young admitted earlier during questioning that he used some donations for his own personal benefit -- particularly to fund construction of a home that included a pool and a theater. On Tuesday, an Edwards donor testified that he told the Barack Obama campaign to believe rumors of Edwards' affair as early as June 2008. Prosecution witness Tim Toben, a developer and green energy entrepreneur, said during cross-examination that during a dinner with Edwards, the candidate was optimistic about his chances of his being selected as Obama's running mate. The message from Edwards was that if he were to be offered the position, he would take it, Toben testified. The witness said he found the idea ""astonishing,"" given the then-rampant rumors of Edwards' affair and child with Hunter. After the dinner, Toben testified, he called the North Carolina director of the Obama campaign, saying reports about Edwards' affair were true and encouraged the campaign to vet the information thoroughly as it decided on its pick. If convicted, Edwards could face up to 30 years behind bars.","Prosecutors wrapped up their case in the John Edwards corruption trial .

"London (CNN) -- After rumblings across the financial markets in the last few months, art dealers from around the world have gathered in London for the city's premier contemporary art fair Frieze in hopes of shifting an estimated $350 million USD (according to art insurers Hiscox) worth of art. Some impressive sales were clocked Wednesday, with a painting by German artist Neo Rauch selling for $1.35 million, according to a spokesperson for New York dealer David Zwirner, who sold the piece. But Frieze -- one of the world's foremost contemporary art fairs and a good barometer of the market -- is expanding its borders and developing another fair dedicated to art throughout history for next year's edition. ""The fact of it is that the art fair world is highly competitive and it's actually overcrowded,"" said Georgina Adam, art market Editor-at-Large for the Art Newspaper. ""The view from the outside is that the Frieze organizers obviously feel that they need to occupy that (older) space,"" she continued. Victoria Siddall is the director of the new fair, which is called Frieze Masters. She explained that it will feature presentations from a select group of around 70 dealers, and will showcase art from antiquity all the way through to the year 2000. ""I think London has traditionally been the international center for historical arts and a big center of that market, which is why it makes sense for us to have (Frieze Masters),"" she said. But while the art fair world is highly competitive, Siddall stressed that Frieze Masters will be different from more traditional fairs of arts and antiquities, such as Masterpiece in London and TEFAF in Maastricht, the Netherlands. ""I think the key differentiator will be that Frieze Masters will be a very contemporary presentation of historical works,"" she said, adding that architect Annabelle Selldorf will be designing a clean, modern environment in which to house the fair and that contemporary artists will give talks about the influence of old masters on their own work. It is hoped that the new fair will open up fresh perspectives on both historical and contemporary arts while emphasizing the links between the two, said Siddall. It will also, according to Adam, introduce a new set of art collectors to the annual fair. ""They'll bring in galleries who are outside the contemporary art field, and those galleries invite their clients,"" said Adam. ""The (organizers) are presumably hoping it might go the other way as well, that collectors of contemporary art might cross over to collecting more traditional art,"" she said. And established, historical art is often a surer outlay for those looking to invest in art as a tangible asset, Adam explained, though she stressed that investors are different from collectors, who buy art in theory because they love it. ""If you were taking about people buying art as an investment, there's an overall feeling in the art market that an artist who has got an established track record, presence, has had museum shows, publications written about them, is a better investment because it's safer,"" she said. ""On the other hand, you can also take a punt on a completely unknown contemporary artist and hope they'll go up in value,"" Adam said. ""But that is far more risky,"" she added. Both collectors and dealers are behaving cautiously at this year's fair, she said. ""Dealers are playing safe and not bringing anything challenging to this year's Frieze,"" she opined, remarking on the lack of art dealing with issues including sex, politics and the economic situation. While there were some big sales on preview day, she said, there hasn't yet been a buying frenzy. Neil Wenman is a director at Hauser & Wirth gallery, which has spaces in London, Zurich and New York, and represents young, emerging artists alongside the estates of more established ones. Its President, Iwan Wirth, is on the committee for Frieze Masters. Wenman said that despite the gloomy financial outlook, the gallery clocked impressive sales of works by some of its younger artists. ""I found it a very serious crowd, I thought (the buyers) were committed, very focused on what they were looking for, I think the galleries that showed more interesting material that was posing an alternative to art fairs of the past did well,"" he said. As for Frieze Masters, he is confident that it will add an exciting dimension to the nearly ten-year-old fair, which launched in 2003. ""For us, it's a very natural thing and (collectors) will find it an added benefit to come to London and have that new dimension in the way in which they look at work and re-evaluate the contemporary,"" he said. Frieze Art Fair, London 2011 takes place in London's Regent's Park, 13--16 October.","London's premier contemporary art fair, Frieze, clocks million dollar sales .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- George Zimmerman was booked into jail Sunday after surrendering to authorities before an afternoon deadline, the Seminole County sheriff said. Zimmerman met two members of the sheriff's office in a business parking lot about 1:25 p.m. Sunday and was taken into custody, Sheriff Donald Eslinger told reporters. Zimmerman was required to return to central Florida and turn himself in after a judge revoked his bail Friday, saying Zimmerman misled the court about his finances. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, is accused of shooting unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in a gated community in Sanford in February. Zimmerman argues he acted in self-defense. Police: Martin's death 'ultimately avoidable' Eslinger said Zimmerman, who will be housed in administrative confinement at Seminole County's John E. Polk Correctional Facility, was ""quiet and cooperative."" He was being held on a no-bail status, the sheriff's office said. Video from the jail showed Zimmerman exiting a white minivan, wearing handcuffs, jeans and a long-sleeve shirt, escorted by authorities. Zimmerman's cell is designed to hold two inmates and is about 67 square feet, the sheriff's office said. It is equipped with two beds and a toilet. Inmates are not provided access to televisions, authorities said. It was not clear from the sheriff's office whether another inmate would be in the cell with Zimmerman. After being booked, Zimmerman will be given an opportunity to purchase items at the commissary. His balance in the commissary account, posted on the sheriff's web site, was $500. ""While out on bond, Mr. Zimmerman has been living in a secure, undisclosed location as there are significant threats against his life,"" his attorneys said Sunday on the official website for his defense. Documents shed light on Florida killing . Asked how his client spent the weekend, attorney Mark O'Mara told reporters, ""travel."" He said Zimmerman was worried about coming out of hiding, ""but I think he also realizes the judge's concerns."" O'Mara said he will be filing a motion Monday asking Seminole County Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. for a new bond hearing to revisit Zimmerman's status and allow the defense to ""explain why what happened seems to have happened."" Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the case that sparked anger across the country. Martin's family contends that Zimmerman racially profiled the 17-year-old who was walking home from a convenience store. Martin was black; Zimmerman his white Hispanic. His family has said Zimmerman did not act out of racial bias. Opinion: Trayvon Martin shooting wasn't a case of racial profiling . Lester ordered Zimmerman back to jail, saying the 28-year-old was not truthful about how much money he had access to when he was freed on bond in April. Lester's ruling on Friday followed allegations by prosecutors that Zimmerman had $135,000. At the time, his wife told the court under oath that the family was indigent. Zimmerman's attorneys said they will request a new bond hearing to address the issue. ""The defense team hopes that Mr. Zimmerman's voluntary surrender to Sanford police will help demonstrate to the court that he is not a flight risk. Furthermore, the vast majority of the funds in question are in an independently managed trust"" which Zimmerman and his attorneys cannot access directly, the statement on his defense website said. Asked about the possibility that Zimmerman's wife could be charged with perjury, O'Mara said that statement was out of his control. He said his client is worried about himself, his wife and his family -- everyone who had to go into hiding because of the ""enormous anger and hatred"" the case has generated. Zimmerman's trial is not ""anticipated"" to commence until some time in 2013, the defense statement said, and the next bond hearing will determine whether he waits ""those many months in jail or not."" Zimmerman was charged in April after the case was referred to a state attorney for a review. The money in question appears to have been donated to Zimmerman through a website he set up to help with a legal defense fund. Citing recorded jailhouse conversations between Zimmerman and his wife, prosecutors alleged the two spoke in code when discussing the money in a credit union account, according to a court documents filed Friday by State Attorney Angela B. Corey. HLN: Zimmerman wife talks publicly for the first time . In light of that, Lester revoked Zimmerman's bond and ordered he turn himself in no later than Sunday afternoon. Zimmerman ""fully controlled and participated in the transfer of money from the PayPal account to defendant and his wife's credit union accounts,"" Corey said in court records. ""This occurred prior to the time defendant was arguing to the court that he was indigent and his wife had no money."" O'Mara said in April that the money raised by the website was put into a trust account that the attorney controls. But in court documents, Corey said the money still belongs to the defendant. The judge ""relied on false representations and statements"" by Zimmerman and his wife when the court set his bond at $150,000, Corey said. Zimmerman was required to post only 10% of that amount. Corey argued that the court should revoke the bond or increase it. Lester appeared angry that the court had not been told about the money. ""Does your client get to sit there like a potted palm and let you lead me down the primrose path?"" he asked Zimmerman's lawyer. ""That's the issue."" Judge in Zimmerman case no 'soft touch' O'Mara said he had discussed the judge's decision with Zimmerman, who was not in court. ""He's frustrated because he now has to come out of hiding,"" O'Mara said in an interview with CNN. ""You need to realize we're still talking about a 28-year-old who's being charged with a crime he does not believe he committed, and his whole life has been turned upside down, so I think that it all needs to be kept in context.""","Man who shot Florida teen met authorities in a parking lot, sheriff says .

"New York (CNN) -- The search for Etan Patz, a 6-year-old New York boy who disappeared more than three decades ago, is expected to resume on Monday after being suspended for ""operational reasons,"" an FBI spokesman said. A law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said no evidence of human remains has been found so far in the basement of a building in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood where investigators are looking. Around 2 p.m. Sunday, investigators searching the basement abruptly folded up a tent they had erected to shield them from a nasty rainstorm. Moments later, two large New York Police Department vans rolled in, obstructing most of the view of the scene. Through a small break between the vehicles, photographers were able to catch a glimpse of something being loaded into the side of an unmarked blue van. FBI spokesman Peter Donald declined to discuss the reasons behind the search's suspension. ""We'll be back in the morning,"" he said. Sunday's developments came a day after investigators discovered a possible blood stain on a concrete wall while tearing apart the basement in their search for clues in the case, a second law enforcement source told CNN. FBI agents, assisted by the NYPD, discovered the stain by spraying the chemical luminol, said the second source, who was also briefed on the investigation. The chemical can indicate the presence of blood, but is not always conclusive, according to that source. At this time, the stain is described only as an area of interest. Investigators used chainsaws to dig out the portion of the wall with the stain, which will be sent to the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia for analysis to determine whether the substance is blood and, if so, whose it is, the second law enforcement source said. The basement is about a half-block from where the boy's family still lives. Etan vanished May 25, 1979, as he walked to a bus stop by himself for the first time. A carpenter whose former Manhattan basement is the scene of the search said through his lawyer Friday that he had no involvement in the disappearance. Othniel Miller, 75, who has not been charged with a crime, has long cooperated with authorities and plans to continue to do so, his lawyer said. ""Mr. Miller has been cooperating with this investigation for over 30 years,"" attorney Michael Farkas said. ""He has continued to cooperate on multiple occasions. And I am going to assist him in cooperating to the fullest extent possible."" Miller's daughter, Stephanie Miller, told CNN affiliate WCBS that her father had cooperated with federal agents, saying he ""doesn't have anything to do with it."" Investigators recently relaunched their probe of the cold case, often described as a milestone effort that helped draw the plight of missing children into the national consciousness. Missing child case 'awakened America' Authorities said both new and old information led them to Miller, a part-time handyman, who met Etan the day before he disappeared and gave him a dollar. Miller faces no charges in connection with the disappearance. It was interest in the carpenter that prompted authorities to bring a cadaver dog about 10 days ago to a SoHo basement, where Etan apparently had encountered the carpenter, then 42, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The dog picked up a human scent in the basement, where the man had a workshop. When agents interviewed the man about his connection to the basement, the source said the carpenter blurted out, ""What if the body was moved?"" Farkas, the attorney, said he will speak to authorities about that alleged remark. ""I don't know that he asked that,"" Farkas told reporters. Late Thursday, authorities set up a grid in the basement and planned to rip up the concrete floor. They also took out part of the back wall of the basement, an unoccupied area beneath what was once a restaurant. The floor was ""newly poured"" at the time the boy disappeared, according to another law enforcement source. It was not dug up during the original investigation. Miller was picked up by the FBI again Thursday, but is not in custody. He was questioned and returned to his Brooklyn apartment, the source with knowledge of the investigation said. ""We're looking for human remains, clothing or other personal effects of Etan Patz,"" NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said of the current investigation. ""It's a very painstaking process."" In 2010, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said his office decided to take another look at the decades-old mystery. FBI leads were then culled from that case file, sources said. The investigation garnered national headlines as authorities splashed the child's image on the sides of milk cartons in the hopes of gathering more information, then a novel approach. Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter, Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with his babysitter. A judge found Ramos responsible for the death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million. He never paid the money. Though Ramos has been considered a key focus of the probe for years, he has never been charged in the case. He is serving a 20-year sentence in a Pennsylvania prison for molesting a different boy and is set to be released later this year. A source said investigators want to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond Ramos. Stan and Julie Patz, Etan's parents, still live a block away from the scene and wouldn't comment on the new developments. A notice on the apartment building said, ""To the hardworking and patient media people: The answer to all your questions at this time is 'no comment.' Please stop ringing our bell and calling for interviews."" Authorities have reason to think the new search could lead to the discovery of the boy's remains at that location, though they remain wary after past leads in the case failed to pan out, according to two sources familiar with the probe. ""I hope they find something,"" said resident Sean Sweeney, who says he's lived in the neighborhood since 1976. SoHo, a Lower Manhattan neighborhood now known for its boutique shops, art galleries and loft apartments, at the time was considered a grittier locale, where abandoned storefronts dotted the city streets. The boy's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. President Ronald Reagan named May 25, the day Etan went missing, National Missing Children's Day. CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","NEW: No evidence of human remains has been found, says a law enforcement source .

"(CNN) -- The International Tennis Federation honored Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova for breakthrough years on Tuesday, as the duo were named the governing body's men's and women's world champions for 2011. World number one Djokovic began the season with a 43-match winning streak before claiming three of four grand slam titles in 2011. Kvitova headed off top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki after securing the first grand slam triumph of her career at Wimbledon in July and triumphing at the season-ending WTA Championships in October. The 21-year-old also helped the Czech Republic win the Fed Cup final against Russia last month as she rose to second in the standings. Bryan brothers break McEnroe's record . The world champions are decided by a system which lends greater weight to grand slam and Fed or Davis Cup success than world rankings or ATP and WTA Tour tournaments. ""I am proud to have been named the ITF world champion for 2011,"" said Djokovic, who usurped last year's winner Rafael Nadal at the top of the world rankings in July. ""Starting with victory in last year's Davis Cup final, this has been an almost perfect 12 months for me. I have always dreamed about becoming the best in the world, and to have won three grand slam titles and finished the year as No. 1 is very special."" The 24-year-old Serbian clinched the Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open crowns to become the first player outside of Spaniard Nadal and 16-time grand slam winner Roger Federer to claim the award since American Andy Roddick in 2003. Kvitova won six WTA titles in a year which saw her rise from 34th in the world rankings. ""I will cherish this award, which is the cherry on top of a wonderful year in which I managed to win Wimbledon, the WTA Championships,"" she said. ""It was a dream year and something I will never forget."" ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti added: ""Both Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova have managed to combine strong performances for their country with outstanding individual records. ""Novak's achievements this year are remarkable in such a strong era for men's tennis, while Petra has made a major breakthrough on the women's tour."" American twins Bob and Mike Bryan won the men's doubles award for the eighth time in nine years after a season in which they lifted the Australian Open and Wimbledon trophies. Those victories brought the 33-year-olds level with Mark Woodforde and Tood Woodbridge's Open era record of 11 grand slam titles, and they have now broken John McEnroe's record of 270 weeks as the top-ranked doubles player. Kvitova's Fed Cup teammate Kveta Peschke, 36, and Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik, 30, won the women's doubles honor after claiming their first grand slam title at Wimbledon. The duo, ranked second and third respectively behind Liezel Huber, won six other events.","Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova awarded title of ITF world champions for 2011 .

"London (CNN) -- On the steps of St Paul's Cathedral, tourists gaze out over a tent city within the City, an impromptu encampment in the shadow of one of London's most enduring landmarks. Below, the colorful canvas of more than 150 temporary shelters fills the gray sidewalk, and bright posters and banners festoon the statue of Queen Anne. Hundreds of protesters began camping out near the cathedral on Saturday, after their attempts to occupy the London Stock Exchange failed. Like many others which have demonstrated across the world in recent days, the group was inspired by the actions of the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States, which took to the streets of New York more than a month ago. The London collective was given a boost on Sunday when Giles Fraser, Canon Chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral, welcomed the protesters to the church grounds, after police blocked them from entering neighboring Paternoster Square. The police are still here -- their vans line up alongside London's famous red double-decker buses in a nearby street. The officers inside are poised for action, but the peaceful nature of the protests so far means they have little to do but watch. Finance workers in sharp suits wander past the protests, staring -- some bemused, others amused -- at the makeshift campsite which has sprung up in recent days. Others ignore the flyers, placards and protesters as they hurry along, apparently assuming the fuss is nothing but a flash in the pan -- something those camped out are keen to disprove. ""We're staying forever,"" insists Bryn Phillips. ""We're staying until the rector says we have to go, and he says we can stay, so we're staying until our demands are met."" Asked what those demands are, Phillips reels off a list which veers from the idealistic to the jokey, which his friend, artist and fellow protester Laura May, says ""sounds like a Christmas wish list"" -- and which suggests the campers may be here until well into the new year. ""We're a solidarity movement. We want to replace the G7 with the G-seven-billion, we want a global democracy: Government by the people, for the people, not by governments acting for the big banks,"" he says. CNN Open Story: Occupy Wall Street protests go global . Historian Farhan Rasheed, who has been part of the protests since Saturday, and camped out at the site overnight, told CNN he was taking action to call for a new financial system. ""It's not that the system is broken -- it's going on exactly as it is supposed to: People buy, buy, buy, until they have homes full of stuff and no money, so they stop buying, sales go down, companies get into trouble and the economy crashes -- it happened in the 1990s, in the 1980s, in the 1970s. It's happening now, and it's going to get worse. ""The system needs to change. We need to focus not on big profits, not on the headline figures, but on what they mean to people's lives. ""I work in schools, and the kids are terrified -- they really don't like the generation above, they think 'You've screwed us.' They are left with no opportunities, but they are the ones who are having to pick up the costs. ""It is manifestly unfair, but the mood seems to be changing. This morning we greeted the people coming to work at the Stock Exchange, and there were lots of people saying ""We're with you."""" ""We are part of a global movement of people who are fed up with the current system,"" says session musician and builder James Banks, who traveled from his home in Birmingham to take part in the protests. ""We have a sickening feeling in our stomach at the way things are, and at the way humans are enslaved."" Banks plans to stay at the camp for at least a week, and says he has been pleasantly surprised by the reactions of passers-by to the camp. ""There is a real atmosphere of fun and of camaraderie not just between us, but between us and the public. There's been hardly any hostility, people have been donating food -- one guy told me ""I just wish I had the balls to do this."""" German tourist Anja Kloos, who stopped by the tent village after visiting St Paul's Cathedral with her family, said she was impressed by the protests. ""I know England has been badly hit by the economic crisis, and people here have lost their jobs, so I think it's great that people have come out onto the streets. ""It is becoming a global thing, thanks to the internet and YouTube and Facebook -- and it is in America too, though they aren't so famous for demonstrating -- we're normally better at it in Germany."" Not everyone is so positive. ""They've obviously got a lot of time on their hands,"" says one city worker, dismissively. ""I don't think a lot of it, but at least they're peaceful."" ""I'm just amused by it really,"" says another, who has been watching the protesters discussions. ""They've got nothing better to do, I suppose."" But 71-year-old retiree David Norman told CNN that taking part in the protests was a question of ethics, saying that protesters across the globe were calling world governments to account. ""The U.S. started this, and now it's gone global, to more than 80 countries. God bless America for that! But get your act together, for goodness sake, or else the people will make you.""","Protesters have set up a tent city in the shadow of St Paul's Cathedral in London .
