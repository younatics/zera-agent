Rows about money during the recession triggered a rise in divorces, new figures suggested today. Money worries, the threat of redundancy and cutting back on life’s luxuries lead to more relationships breaking up. Divorce rates had been falling in the years since 2004, but as the economy emerged from recession in 2009 there was a surge in couples heading to the courts. In 2010 the number of marital break-ups rose by 4.9 per cent, before levelling off. In 2011, 117,558 couples decided to go their separate ways and this rose to 118,140 in 2012. The Office for National Statistics today linked the rise to fall-out of the 2008-09 recession. ‘One . theory suggests that recession could contribute to a rise in . partnership break-ups because of increased financial strain, changes in . employment and related lifestyle changes,’ the ONS said. ‘Social . research in Britain has shown that unemployment and downturns in the . housing market may be associated with family instability.’ There were 13 divorces an hour in England and Wales in 2012 . Almost half of these divorces occurred in the first 10 years of marriage. The statistics also show a rise in double-divorcees. In 1980 just one in ten men and women who divorced also had their previous marriage end in divorce. This figure rose to almost one in five by 2012, the ONS said. Some . people may also choose to divorce during an economic downturn because . they think they will get a more favourable divorce settlement if their . income is currently low. There is a conflicting theory that an . ‘unfavourable economic climate’ can lead to an increase in family . solidarity during difficult times, with people postponing marital . break-ups until the economy, and the value of their home improves. The ONS suggested that ‘recession is associated with an increased risk of divorce, but with a delayed impact’. ‘This . perhaps reflects a couple’s wait for an economic recovery to lift the . value of their assets or the time lag between separation and obtaining a . decree absolute.’ A similar . trend was seen after the 1990-92 recession, when divorce rates . increased more markedly in 1993 than during the recession itself. Estimates suggest that 42 per cent of marriages end in divorce, the . report states. The ONS said a third of marriages are expected to end in divorce before the couple reach their 20th wedding anniversary. And the average marriage is expected to last for 32 years. In 2012, the median length of time that couples stayed married before officially separating was 11 and a half years. Family Justice Minister Simon Hughes said: 'Mediation works.  We are committed to making sure that more people make use of it rather than go through the confrontational and stressful experience of going to court. 'These figures show thousands of people are sadly still divorcing each year. We want them to do it in the least damaging way for everyone involved, especially children. 'That is why we want them to use the excellent mediation services available to agree a way forward, rather than have one forced upon them.' In 2012 divorce rates among men aged over 50 and women over 45 were higher than a decade earlier. The average age of men getting a divorce is now 44.7 years and for women 42.2 years. In 2012, 9,703 men and 6,026 women aged over 60 got divorced. The ONS said: 'The mean age at divorce generally declined for both males and females during the mid to late 1970s and generally remained stable in the early 1980s. 'Since 1985 the mean ages at divorce for men and women have increased, rising by 7.3 years for both men and women. 'This trend is consistent with increases in the mean age at marriage. 'The difference between the mean age of husband and wife at divorce has remained relatively unchanged over the last four decades, with a difference of around 2.5 years except for the years 1974 to 1976 when it was 2.0 years.' Marilyn Stowe, the senior partner at Stowe Family Law, said: ‘I believe the economic situation, with the UK falling in and out of recession, has played a key role: a greater number of businesses go into liquidation when a country emerges from recession, and in my experience this principle applies to marriages too. ‘Couples will struggle through times of adversity as best they can, but eventually find that despite their best efforts, they simply can't go on any longer.’ Almost 16,000 marriages ended in 2012 because of adultery. In 2012, the mean age of a divorcee was 44.7 for men and 42.2 for women. The ONS said that the mean age for divorce has been steadily rising since the mid-1980s, coinciding with a rise in the age at which people wed. Provisional marriage statistics suggest that in 2011 the average age for men to marry was 36.3 and 33.8 for women. Vicki McLynn, partner at law firm Pannone, added: 'The fact that there has been a slight increase could be attributed to couples believing that they can finally afford to divorce now the recession appears to be coming an end. 'Commonly, they feel that in a healthier economy, they may be more likely to find jobs and financial security to sustain them after they separate.' Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of relationship charity Relate, said: 'We are saddened by the news that the number of divorces has risen slightly in 2012, especially as they had been in decline for the past few years. 'What matters to us is the quality of a relationship, rather than status. Ultimately, people's happiness and wellbeing is of paramount importance and strong couple relationships are proven to be an important part of that.'","There were 13 divorces an hour in England and Wales in 2012 .

A hit-and-run driver mowed down a woman on a pedestrian crossing as he rushed to sign on and collect his benefit money. Balram Singh sped through a red light and ploughed into Kate Allan as he raced to the job centre in Brentry, Bristol. The 23-year-old victim narrowly managed to move her head from out of the path of the VW Polo’s wheels - but Singh drove off and left her screaming in agony on the road on December 29 last year. However he has dodged a prison sentence after a judge accepted that Singh, 21, showed 'genuine remorse'. Bristol Crown Court heard that Singh ignored witnesses’ pleas to stop and drove off to a benefits office where he was late to collect a job seeker’s allowance payment, which is £67.50 a week. And when police finally caught up with them, he said he drove off because he wanted to search the internet and see what would happen to him. Prosecuting, Nadeem Aullybocus told the court Singh took the car from outside the family home without permission. He only had a provisional licence at the time, meaning he was not supposed to drive unsupervised, and therefore was uninsured. Miss Allan was waiting at a pelican crossing near the Crow Lane roundabout in Henbury. When the traffic lights went red and the green light for pedestrians lit up, she started to cross - before Singh ploughed into her with such force the windscreen of the car cracked. In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said: 'If I had not moved my head out of the way of the car, he would have driven over me.' As the Polo was driven away a pedestrian and a driver who witnessed the crash both looked Singh in the eye and signalled for him to stop but he carried on. Meanwhile, Miss Allan was 'screaming out in pain', Mr Aullybocus added. The court heard he carried on to the benefits office, but was too late to collect his payment. Police soon tracked Singh down and when they spoke to him he asked 'how is the lady?'. Crow Lane Roundabout in Bristol: Kate Allan was crossing the road at traffic lights when Singh ploughed into her . When asked why he had not stopped after the crash, Mr Aullybocus said Singh told police: 'I wanted to come home and look on the internet to see what would happen to me.' Miss Allan suffered pain in her right leg, neck, ribs and down the left side of her body. She was off work for two weeks but was still getting pain two months later. Her anxiety medication had to be increased following the incident and she was nervous about leaving her house for a couple of weeks. In her victim impact statement, she said: 'The incident has left me really shaken and I’m anxious about crossing the road in the future. All in all, the incident has caused me a lot of pain and problems. Singh admitted aggravated vehicle taking, failing to stop at a road accident, driving without insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. Mitigating, Rodney Wilson accepted it was 'sheer luck' that Miss Allan had not been seriously injured. He submitted a number of positive character references and said his client had shown genuine remorse. He told the court Singh had been expecting a lift to the job centre from his brother, but his brother had been called into work. Singh then borrowed the family car to drive the three miles himself. When he saw the crossing lights changing he sped up to try to get through before they went red. Mr Wilson said he did brake momentarily after the collision, but drove off 'in panic' and in fear of what those who witnessed the incident might do to him. Recorder of Bristol, Judge Neil Ford QC spared him from prison because of his lack of previous convictions, early guilty pleas and 'genuine remorse'. He imposed an eight-month sentence, suspended for two years. Judge Ford disqualified Singh from driving for two years, ordered one year’s supervision, 300 hours of unpaid work, a four-month curfew and Singh must pay Miss Allan £1,500 compensation.","Balrram Singh left Kate Allan screaming in agony as he drove off to sign on and collect £67.50-a-week payment .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:06 EST, 4 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:42 EST, 5 November 2013 . One of America's most critically important and breathtakingly beautiful natural wonders may actually have Canadian origins. James W. Sears of the University of Montana proposes that the mighty Colorado once fed into a 'super river' that was the ancient equivalent of a mega Mississippi that drained much of North America. And with his proposal dawns the realization that America may actually have Canada to thank in a way for its most treasured splendor, the Grand Canyon. Super River: A new theory by geologist James W. Sears proposes that the Colorado River once flowed into a super river called the Bell River that drained much of North America and ended in a massive delta in Canada's Labrador Sea . According to Sears, the Colorado River, which now provides water to 80 million Americans in the Southwest once flowed northeast into the now defunct Bell River. In fact, the proposal appears to have been fueled, at least in part, by the discovery of microfossils in Canada's Labrador Sea that likely come form the American Southwest. The scenario, which appears in the November issue of GSA Today, posits that the river actually flowed southwest, as it does now, first, but was turned northward thanks to lifting continental plates. Eh! Sears' proposal would mean that two of America's most splendid natural wonders--the Colorado River and its surrounding Grand Canyon--have Canadian roots . Shifting plates, faulting, and volcanic activity are actually at the root what's been pushing the Might Colorado around for millions of years. Around 16 million years ago, the the paleo-river began to be segmented by faulting a volcanism. And until around 6 million years ago, the day's budding Grand Canyon was actually a large lake thanks to faulting that dammed the river. After around 6 million years ago, the Colorado was cut off in Idaho by the volcanism of the Yellowstone supervolcano hot spot. River in flux: The super river persisted until around 6 million years ago, at which point it was destroyed by the encroaching continental ice sheet. The Colorado was cut off at Idaho by the the Yellowstone hot spot after fracturing and volcanic activity shifted it to the Gulf of California, where it drains today . The lake persisted until the Colorado was finally captured by the Gulf of California, which it flows into to this day. The resulting 'short-cut to sea level,' Sears writes, helped to increase erosion that created the Grand Canyon we know today. So where's the Bell River? The super river that was once the continent's largest was destroyed by encroaching ice sheets during the Ice Age.","New study proposes that the Colorado River once flowed northeast, meeting the 'Bell River,' which flowed through Canada and drained into the Labrador Sea ."
"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 16:57 EST, 30 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:02 EST, 30 January 2014 . Researchers have revealed a major breakthrough in treating anxiety disorders. A California team has discovered the region of the brain that controls how anxious we are - and found it wasn't where they had thought. The team now say it could now be targeted with drugs, leading to far more effective treatments within a decade. Researchers say the discovery could lead to new treatments for people suffering from anxiety disorders . According to the National Institute of Mental Health, over 18 percent of American adults suffer from anxiety disorders, characterized as excessive worry or tension that often leads to other physical symptoms. Previous studies of anxiety in the brain have focused on the amygdala, an area known to play a role in fear. However, a team of researchers led by biologists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) had a hunch that understanding a different brain area, the lateral septum (LS), could provide more clues into how the brain processes anxiety. Their instincts paid off—using mouse models, the team has found a neural circuit that connects the LS with other brain structures in a manner that directly influences anxiety. 'Our study has identified a new neural circuit that plays a causal role in promoting anxiety states,' says David Anderson of Caltech, who led the study. 'Part of the reason we lack more effective and specific drugs for anxiety is that we don't know enough about how the brain processes anxiety. 'This study opens up a new line of investigation into the brain circuitry that controls anxiety.' The team's findings in the January 30 version of the journal Cell. In the new study, the team used optogenetics—a technique that uses light to control neural activity—to artificially activate a set of specific, genetically identified neurons in the LS of mice. During this activation, the mice became more anxious. The researchers also found that even a brief, transient activation of those neurons could produce a state of anxiety lasting for at least half an hour. This indicated that not only are these cells involved in the initial activation of an anxious state, but also that an anxious state persists even after the neurons are no longer being activated. What really makes us anxious: A brain schematic shows the neural circuit found by Caltech researchers to play a role in anxiety. The lateral septum is circled in red, and controls the process . 'The most surprising part of these findings is that the outputs from the LS, which were believed primarily to act as a brake on anxiety, actually increase anxiety, say the researchers. Knowing the sign—positive or negative—of the effect of these cells on anxiety is a critical first step to understanding what kind of drug one might want to develop to manipulate these cells or their molecular constituents. If the cells had been found to inhibit anxiety, as originally thought, then one would want to find drugs that activate these LS neurons, to reduce anxiety. However, since the group found that these neurons instead promote anxiety, then to reduce anxiety a drug would have to inhibit these neurons. 'We are still probably a decade away from translating this very basic research into any kind of therapy for humans, but we hope that the information that this type of study yields about the brain will put the field and medicine in a much better position to develop new, rational therapies for psychiatric disorders,' said Anderson. 'There have been very few new psychiatric drugs developed in the last 40 to 50 years, and that's because we know so little about the brain circuitry that controls the emotions that go wrong in a psychiatric disorder like depression or anxiety.' The team will continue to map out this area of the brain in greater detail to understand more about its role in controlling stress-induced anxiety.","Discovery could have major implications for treating anxiety disorders .

Samsung’s Mini version of the Galaxy S4 performed well, too, managing 746 minutes (12 hours and 26 minutes) in call tests and 394 minutes (6 hours and 34 minutes) in web browsing tests. Which? did explain that because the Samsung Galaxy S4 is a larger phone - it has a 5-inch screen compared to Apple's 4-inch devices - there's more space for a higher capacity battery. This gives the S4 a 'huge advantage'. Last month Which? researchers independently tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from Apple, Samsung, HTC and LG.

In his memoirs, former Defence  Secretary Sir John Nott describes France as Britain's 'greatest ally' during the Falklands War. But behind the scenes, the relationship between the two countries was strained almost to breaking point over the sale of French Exocet missiles in 1982, newly released documents reveal. Declassified files show that prime minister Margaret Thatcher warned France that if the weapons fell into Argentine hands, the consequences for British-French relations would be 'disastrous'. Sir Michael Havers, the . Attorney-General, even wrote a memo on July 1 proposing the hijack of . aircraft carrying missiles to Argentina by infiltrating a cargo airline. HMS Antelope was bombed by Argentine forces in the bay of San Carlos, East Falkland Island, on the May 6, 1982 during the Falklands War . There was an increasingly strained relationship between Mrs Thatcher and then French president Francois Mitterrand during the Falklands, documents reveal . The elaborate MI6 operation was designed to convince the Argentines that the cell was buying Exocets on their behalf. He said: 'The risk of resupply to the Argentines of further air-to-sea missiles justifies consideration of all options to prevent this — even the most way-out which may be thought to be more appropriate to a James Bond movie! 'The profits [of an arms shipment] can be enormous and will attract the cowboy carriers in circumstances where the exporting country will not want to risk its own aircraft for publicity reasons. 'If we can discover a situation where the freight is being offered to the cowboys... [My friend can] get the job but with the condition (not unusual) that the 'loadmaster' is a man whom he nominates. 'If this can be agreed, the loadmaster has total control over the flight and, therefore, could redirect the aircraft in transit to (for example) Bermuda. This will cost money (this is an expensive dirty business) but would, in my view, be cheap at the price.' However, Mrs Thatcher appeared unimpressed, writing on the document: 'Can we have a word? MT.' The files, released today under the . 30-year rule by the National Archives in Kew, document the increasingly . strained relationship between Mrs Thatcher and then French president . Francois Mitterrand. At the start of the conflict, Mitterrand had declared an embargo on French arms sales and assistance to Argentina and allowed the British fleet to use French port facilities in West Africa. He also aided British efforts to stop Argentina acquiring Exocets on the world's arms market and provided detailed information about planes and weaponry France had sold to Argentina. But when Argentina used the French guided missiles against the British Task Force to devastating effect, relations between Mrs Thatcher and Mitterrand soured. On May 4, 1982, a pair of Argentine navy French Super Etendard fighter planes attacked British ships heading towards the Falklands with air-launched Exocet AM39s missiles. One hit the Type-42 destroyer HMS Sheffield, crippling the ship which sank six days later, killing 20 crew and bringing home the full magnitude of what the Task Force was up against.

Controversial: An Argentian Super Etendard fighter with Exocet missiles . A Wessex helicopter hovers overhead as HMS Antelope, still burning fiercely, slips beneath the water of Ajax Bay . HMS Sheffield after being hit by an Argentine Exocet missile in the South Atlantic. The vessel sank whilst being towed back to safe water . Three weeks later, on May 25, two . more Exocets sank the Atlantic Conveyor which was carrying vital . supplies, including Chinook helicopters which were supposed to transport . troops and equipment. Twelve lost their lives in the attack and the news badly affected the nation's morale. The force commander Admiral Sandy Woodward later admitted that if one of the aircraft carriers Invincible or Hermes had been hit the mission would have effectively been over. Tensions increased still further when the French were initially reluctant to reveal how many Exocet missiles they had supplied to Argentina. It was only on May 11, a week after the attack on HMS Sheffield, that the British embassy in Paris was told that an order for ten missiles had been agreed, of which five had been delivered. The files reveal that although France . agreed to delay the completion of the deal, there was concern that they . had agreed a deal to send four Exocets to Peru. As there was every indication that . they would end up in the hands of the Argentines, Mrs Thatcher raised . the issue with Mitterrand on May 17. Although he assured her the delivery . would be delayed 'as long as necessary', he phoned Mrs Thatcher on May . 29 to say that he was in a 'difficult position' over the deal. Antelope was a Type 21 frigate which was sunk in the Falklands War on May 24, 1982 . The files state: 'Peru had made it known to other Latin American countries that France was declining to execute the contract. Consequently, France's contracts with other Latin American countries were in danger.' He then demanded a 'precise estimate' of the date by which the missiles would no longer endanger the British Task Force. The rebel Dean of St Paul’s Cathedral wanted the Lord’s Prayer to be read in Spanish during a thanksgiving service after the Falklands, the papers reveal. A memo from Mrs Thatcher's private secretary Clive Whitmore on July 2, 1982, also said the Very Rev Alan Webster wanted the order of service to contain a printed translation of the prayer. Mrs Thatcher responded by underlining almost the entire paragraph and scribbling 'why?' next to it. Although the translation was prevented, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, provoked controversy by telling the congregation they should remember the Argentine casualties as well as the British. The following day, she sent him a strongly worded telegram which said: 'If it became known, as it  certainly would, that France was now releasing weapons to  Peru that would certainly be passed on to Argentina for use against us, France's ally, this would have a devastating effect on the relationship between our two countries. 'Indeed, it would have a disastrous effect on the alliance (Nato) as a whole. This is the last thing that either of us would wish.' The next day the French backed down and said the Peruvians would be told the missiles could not be sent for 'political reasons'. It was thought the French had supplied around 100 Exocets to air forces around the world, of which 30 to 35 could be available for sale on the international market. To prevent the missiles ending up in the hands of the Argentines, the Ministry of Defence set up a secret arms traffic cell to prevent the sale of any Exocets.

Law enforcement officials in Rochester New York say colleagues of convicted pedophile Matthew LoMaglio were uncooperative during the investigation. LoMaglio, 37, an elementary school gym teacher, was convicted last month of sexually molesting an eight-year-old boy between 2006 and 2007. Many teachers and administrators who had worked with LoMaglio, who was sentenced last week to four years prison for second degree sexual conduct against a child and endangering the welfare of a child, refused to speak to investigators. Supported: Matthew LoMaglio, 37, had the support of many staff members from his Rochester, New York school, despite the accusation he molested a second-grader - a crime he was later convicted of . According to EAG News, 22 of LoMaglio's co-workers wrote to the judge in support of the teacher during the case, some of whom said they would trust him with their own children and others who said they considered him a good role model for kids. The community was surprised and disappointed by the support of LoMaglio and lack of sympathy for the young victim. 'Some of the people [on the school staff] who were cooperative told us there was talk at school, sort of like ‘Are you for the teacher or for the student,’” Kyle Rossi, the assistant district attorney who tried the case against LoMaglio, told EAGnews. 'It was very disappointing to make contact with teachers who wouldn’t give us the time of day until they were instructed to. 'I would say that, being in that position, they have a special duty to recognize issues and protect kids. I would think it has more do to with ignorance than anything else.' In court: LoMaglio seen in court during his sentencing last week while people hug behind him . The victim told his mother he had nightmares about being raped by his gym teacher, LoMaglio. The mother approached the school about her son's growing fear of gym class and the unsettling descriptions of his dreams. Susan Hasenaur-Curtis, the assistant principal at School 19 at the time, testified in court that she met with the second-grader and his mother to discuss the issue but she didn't report the case to Child Protective Services because she did not believe there was credible evidence of abuse. The abuse finally came to light when the boy's brother found a letter in his bedroom in 2012, explaining how he had been abused by LoMaglio and another sibling showed it to the boys' parents. But building a case against the teacher was difficult when many close to the case who knew both the boy and the teacher refused to speak. 'Reprehensible': Prosecutor Kyle Rossi says the actions of LoMaglio's colleagues in supporting him and ignoring the victim were inexcusable . Silence: Many staff members at the Rochester school where LoMaglio taught refused to speak to investigators and prosecutors . 'I would say that many teachers and administrators at several schools where this guy had taught wouldn’t talk to us at all,' Rossi told EAG News. 'We ran into cold shoulders all the way around. They would say things like ‘nothing happened here’ and ‘I don’t know anything, I don’t want to talk about anything. 'One person even told a police investigator ""Don’t call me again."" Some were even rude.' According to Fox News, LoMaglio maintained his innocence during the trial but during sentencing acknowledged his guilt to a counselor. 'They would say this never could have happened,' Rossi said. 'This is why children don’t disclose sexual abuse, because they believe the people who can help them won’t believe them. I found it reprehensible that teachers would behave this way. 'To have so many teachers come out in favor of a man who admitted he did this, it was terrible to see. Who can a kid go to?'","Matthew LoMaglio was sentenced to four years in prison last week for the molestation of an eight-year-old boy .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . PUBLISHED: . 16:09 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:16 EST, 12 December 2013 . A teacher's union in Michigan is fighting to force a city school district to pay a teacher convicted of molesting a student a $10,000 severance buyout, outraging the family of the young victim. The Michigan Education Association is planning to take the case to arbitration in an attempt to force the West Branch-Rose City School District to pay former math teacher Neal Erickson - who was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison for repeatedly molesting the student - the buyout, a move the victim's family calls 'ludicrous.' The money, the victim's father, John Janczewski, says any money owed to Erickson by the district should be given to his son, who is 'out there trying to make it in this world all messed up.' Monster: Neal Erickson was convicted of raping one of his students. Now he wants the district to pay him a severance fee . 'Are they nuts in . the head? How can the union file a grievance and back a child molester? We’re very upset about it,' Janczewski told EAGnews. Erickson was convicted over the summer of raping the young student over a three year period - from 2006 to 2009. The community was outraged when several other teachers in the district wrote letters supporting Erickson, and urging the judge to give him a more lenient sentence. Adding to the outrage was the fact that a school board member, Mike Eagan, sat with Erickson's family during his sentencing after he pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor on May 8. Many members of the community rallied behind the victim's parents and urged the school board to fire teachers who were supporting Erickson. The district, however, opted to keep Erickson's supporters rather than deal with the potential legal consequences of firing them. Outraged: The victim's parents,  John and Lori Janczewski, are furious that the union is seeking severance for their son's rapist . The union's claim for Erickson stems from an offer the school district made to teachers in March, which offered the $10,000 buyout to teachers to encourage them to quit rather than being laid off as the district needed to reduce staff due to budget cuts. The union's plan to seek the $10,000 for Erickson suggests that he was still on the payroll when it was offered, and that he accepted it - despite having already been indicted for molesting the boy. The district, however, declined to pay him the money, which is what prompted the union's action. 'You had to qualify for the buyout, depending on your years in the . district,' district Superintendent Dan Cwayna EAG News. 'We’ve done it in the past. It was a little . different this last year in that we offered the buyout in two $5,000 . payments.' Ally: School board member Mike Eagan supports Erickson and sat with his family during his sentencing . Cwayna added that 'When the first payment was sent out...and the union discovered we did . not make the payment to Mr. Erickson, they filed a grievance on his . behalf.' Cwayna says the decision to not pay the convicted child molester was his, but would not give a specific reason as to why. 'That was something I as superintendent, with some consultation with the president of the board,' decided, Cwayna said. 'That was a decision the superintendent makes and at this point … I prefer not to get into the reasons.' However, as EAG News notes, the reasons not pay Erickson the severance 'seems pretty obvious.'","Parents of the victim call the union's actions 'ludicrous'

Powerful backbench critic: Bernard Jenkins fears that the Tories are sleepwalking to an electoral doomsday as dissatisfied voters turn to UKIP . A senior Tory MP has warned that the party is set to lose 50 seats at the next Election, giving Ed Miliband the keys to No 10. Tory grandee Bernard Jenkin claims the Tories are sleepwalking to an electoral doomsday, with many MPs unaware they face being turfed out by voters. And Mr Jenkin said that instead of attacking UKIP leader Nigel Farage, the Prime Minister should be copying his policies on issues such as immigration – because grassroots Tory supporters back them. In private remarks to fellow Conservatives, leading Eurosceptic Mr Jenkin said: ‘On present trends we are going to lose 50 seats – and most of them don’t even realise it. 'It has got to the ridiculous position where Nigel Farage is telling us what our policy on immigration should be – and he is right.’ If the Conservatives were to lose 50 seats, that would almost certainly result in Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister. Polling experts say that it is the switch of Tory voters to UKIP that will allow Labour to grab key Conservative seats in marginal constituencies. Mr Jenkin, MP for Harwich & North Essex, told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘I have been quite open about what I believe. 'We must reclaim control of our immigration laws so that British Ministers and Parliament can decide who enters our country, on what terms, how long they can stay and what benefits they are entitled to receive. ‘Nigel Farage says many things which many voters and many Conservative supporters agree with. We should adopt them as our policies.’ Asked if he had forecast the Conservatives would lose 50 seats, he said: ‘If the General Election took place today, based on current opinion polls, yes, the Conservatives would lose seats. But we have every opportunity to put things right and I will be campaigning flat out for a David Cameron victory.’ Mr Jenkin, the son of Patrick Jenkin, who served in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet, is emerging as one of Mr Cameron’s most powerful backbench Tory critics. Last month he organised a letter signed by more than 90 Conservative MPs calling on the Prime Minister to push for a national veto on all current and future EU laws. Write caption here . If Mr Jenkin’s forecast is correct, high-profile figures in the firing line include: Environment Minister George Eustice (Camborne & Redruth, the second most vulnerable Conservative seat); James Wharton, the MP behind the EU Referendum Bill (Stockton South, 8th most vulnerable); Defence Minister Anna Soubry (Broxtowe, 9th); and Ben Gummer (Ipswich, 35th), son of former Cabinet Minister John Gummer. Mr Cameron came under further attack last night from another Right-wing Essex Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell (Clacton). Mr Carswell said George Osborne’s economic policy would lead to another Gordon Brown-style cycle of boom and bust. Mr Carswell writes in today’s Mail on Sunday: ‘Strong though the economic rebound might be, the Coalition is making some serious mistakes. ‘Mr Osborne has adopted much the same monetary approach as his predecessor. This “Osbrown” economic policy means Britain is now more dependent on consumer spending and mortgage debt than ever before.’","Tories are sleepwalking into electoral doomsday, says Bernard Jenkins .

The world's most technologically advanced bin being trialled with a London council that thinks despite its hefty price tag, it could save them money . The world's most  technologically advanced bin has gone on trial, with a London council believing that despite its hefty price tag, it could save them money. The BigBelly Solar bin harvests energy from the sun and uses it to compact waste to an eight of its size. The cost of leasing the high-tech bin is an eye-watering £1,000 a year when leased for five years but because of its huge capacity, it could save councils money in vehicle journeys and fuel to collect waste. The solar-powered unit runs on a 12v battery. It needs just eight hours of sunlight per month to function as intended and is currently on trial in Merton, south west London. According to the distributors of the BigBelly Solar bins, Kyron Energy & Power, the compactor technology increases the capacity six to eight times that of a normal street bin. Consequently the company says the bin has been proven to reduce the number of waste collections needed by 86 per cent. Each compactor comes equipped with a wireless monitoring system. This enables the refuse collection teams to view fullness of each bin on computers and smart phones. The system sends a text or email when the bin is 85 per cent full and in need of emptying. The cost of leasing the high-tech bin is an eye-watering £1,000 a year when leased for five years but because of its huge capacity, it could save councils like Merton money in vehicle journeys and fuel to collect waste . Merton council invested in 30 bins and if the year-long pilot is successful, it predicts savings of £15,000 per year could be made on expenditures such as vehicle journeys and fuel costs. Merton Council cabinet member for performance and implementation, Councillor Mark Betteridge said: 'These new bins are great and a fantastic example of Merton’s business-like approach to running our services. 'Not only will they assist in keeping our parks clean, they should also help us be more efficient, delivering better value for our residents. 'We want to see local people and their families out and about in our parks this summer. There’s so much to enjoy from paddling pools to great play areas, walks and picnics - there’s something for everyone.' The system sends a text or email when the bin is 85 per cent full and in need of emptying and the information (pictured) helps customers reduce collection and disposal costs by 70 per cent, if the number of collections, staffing and fuel costs are taken into account . Two bins will be placed in Wimbledon Park, while Dundonald Rec, Sir Joseph Hood, Colliers Wood and South Park will each get one. The company also makes recycling bins that are used by many councils. Just like the compactor bins, the recycling units send details about real-time fill levels to computers and smartphones, to eliminate 'milk-round collection rounds. The company said its products reduce collection and disposal cost for its customers by 70 per cent, if the number of collections, staffing and fuel costs are taken into account.","The BigBelly Solar bin harvests energy from the sun and uses it to compact waste to an eight of its size .

British national football squads were almost pulled out of the 1982 World Cup by the Government as war broke out with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, newly released documents reveal. In the aftermath of Argentina's invasion of the Falklands, sports governing bodies were urged to pull out of competitions with Argentinian teams both in England and in Argentina. But despite the directive from Sports Minister Neil Macfarlane, it remained undecided whether British nations should pull out of the 1982 Football World Cup, England's first cup in 12 years. The England team in June 1982 that nearly didn't play but went on to beat France during the 1982 World Cup finals in Bilbao, Spain . Files released to the National Archives in Kew show that cabinet ministers debated withdrawing from the World Cup, due to start on June 13 in Spain that year, but feared the decision would be used as Argentinian propaganda. In April 1982 Mr Macfarlane wrote to the Sports Council, saying: 'I urge no sporting contact with Argentina at representative, club or individual level on British soil. This policy applies equally to all sporting fixtures in Argentina.' According to the file, concerns spread to the impending World Cup tournament in Spain. Although neither England, Scotland or Northern Ireland were due to play in the same qualifying group as cup holders Argentina, there were worries that Scotland could meet them in the second round and England could come up against them in the final. Some leading players were said to have implied they would find it 'difficult to meet Argentina on a sports field' if fighting was continuing, but the British Ambassador in Madrid advised that any withdrawal would be ""interpreted as a slight on Spain, not a statement about Argentina'. On May 11 Mr Macfarlane wrote to Thatcher, saying: 'Up until a week or 10 days ago I have taken the line that it was up to the Football Authorities to decide whether they should participate. 'However, the loss of British life on HMS Sheffield and Sea Harriers has had a marked effect on some international footballers and some administrators. Margaret Thatcher leaving Downing Street in 1982. Released archives reveal the Sports Minister contacted Thatcher saying the loss of British life had had a marked effect on some footballers . 'They feel revulsion at the prospect of playing in the same tournament as Argentina at this time. 'Much has appeared in the sporting pages and much more will appear the longer these hostilities continue.' The Brazilian president of international football governing body Fifa made it clear that Argentina would not be pressured to withdraw from the World Cup, he said. On May 17 1982 Cabinet Secretary Robert Armstrong wrote to the prime minister before a paper was presented by the sports minister, to be followed by cabinet discussions. 'Ministers will be able to assess the strength of public and Parliamentary feeling on this issue, which will be seen as quite different from that of the Moscow Olympic Games following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan,' he said. 'In this case no other country would follow us in withdrawing from the World Cup. 'Argentina would see British withdrawal not as putting any pressure on them but as an opportunity to make propaganda: the United Kingdom, not Argentina, would be the country set apart.' None of the home nations pulled out of the tournament which was eventually won by Italy. The England team was knocked out in the second round, Scotland in the first round, Northern Ireland in the second round. In August that year, after the end of the conflict, restrictions were lifted on sporting engagements with Argentina.","Sports governing bodies were urged to pull out of competitions .

Spare a thought then for Rhys Barker who was quoted £1.2million for his £1,400 Vauxhall Corsa. The 27-year-old contacted Zenith to make sure the figure was correct and they helpfully offered him the opportunity of paying it in instalments of £104,000 a month. Overpriced: Rhys Barker, 27, was offered a quote of £1.2million to insure his £1,400 Vauxhall Corsa . A screengrab shows the massive quote Mr Barker was given by Zenith when he tried to insure his car online . Mr Barker, who lives in the Salford Quays area of Manchester, said: 'I went through all the questions and then the quote came up for £1,165,977.75. I was convinced it must be a mistake, so I called them up on their helpline. 'They didn’t even seem to be shocked by it. They checked it for me and then said it was right.' He was even more shocked that they suggested he could pay in instalments if he could not afford the total upfront - with a first payment of £233,000 followed by 10 months at £104,000 per month. He said: 'I’m convinced they were just trying to price me out of buying insurance with them but it’s a ridiculous way of doing it. I’d love to know how they would have reacted if I’d just agreed to it - although with a car worth less than £1,500 it was never going to be likely.' Mr Barker, a project analyst for Manchester United, passed his test two years ago and had been paying £2,000 to insure a Ford Fiesta before he bought the second-hand Corsa. He has a clean record with no accidents and no convictions. He claimed his quote was just one example of how young and new drivers are treated poorly by insurance firms. He added: 'I’ve got one of the cheapest cars you can get but the criteria for insurance is crazy. If I change a search from living alone to co-habiting, it goes down by £200.' He says postcode-based quotes are also unfair. 'I’m classed as Salford because of the first three figures - why don’t they look at the whole postcode? The way they assess risk makes no sense at all.' Unfair: Despite Mr Barker's car being one of the cheapest on the market, he was quoted extortionate insurance prices . Mr Barker is now insured with Bell, which is owned by Admiral, and pays around £,2000. He has a Telematics box - a black box which records how he drives to lower insurance rates. He added: 'That’s not fair either really because when you go over a speed bump it counts against you, and if you have to stop suddenly because someone steps into the road it does too.' Gary Humphreys, group underwriting director at Markerstudy Group, which runs Zenith, said: 'The price Mr Barker was quoted reflects that we have ‘declined’ to provide cover, as we would not expect a customer to pay such a high premium. 'This is not a case of pricing customers out of the market but quoting on the risks that are within our rating parameters and declining if they are outside. 'Without the detail we are unable to tell why Zenith was unable to provide cover at the time. We are aware this website has changed the way it quotes since Mr Barker used it, so that if a quote is over £10,000 it ‘declines’ rather than quotes a high premium.' A spokesman from Admiral Group plc said its premium is based on statistics. He said quotes change because of factors like marital status or postcode because they reflect the risk taken on by an insurance company.","Rhys Barker said insurance companies treat young drivers 'unfairly'

He will also say that 49 senior NHS bosses have been replaced – most because they ‘weren’t up to the job’. Announcement: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today highlight a big increase in NHS staff airing concerns about patient safety, death rates and poor care, with almost 8,000 cases raised in the past ten months . The Health Secretary is expected to point to a scheme ensuring nursing students ‘get their hands dirty’ by working for a year as healthcare assistants as evidence of progress. An increase in hospitals putting the name of one ‘responsible doctor’ above each patient’s bed will also be underlined. Mr Hunt argues that creating a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ across the NHS is vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which as many as 1,200 patients died. The Government has barred so-called ‘compromise agreements’ – which mean NHS staff cannot raise anything embarrassing to their employers when they leave their jobs – throughout the health service with immediate effect. Staff have also been given a specific legal right to blow the whistle on issues such as patient care and safety, or anything that could be in the public interest. In a speech on the eve of the first anniversary of the Francis Inquiry into Mid Staffs, Mr Hunt will say there have been 7,626 calls to a new hotline for whistleblowers working in the NHS since last April. He will claim that the ‘Francis effect’ has meant more failing hospitals being identified and put on the road to recovery. ‘Most weeks I join staff in different parts of the country on a shift, and I have seen first-hand how hospitals are using the Francis report as a catalyst to improve care,’ Mr Hunt will say. The speech come on the eve of the first anniversary of the Francis Inquiry into Mid Staffordshire scandal . ‘Twelve months on, we cannot expect to have solved everything or to have completely transformed the culture of the country’s largest and finest institution. ‘But we have seen a real shift in priorities – new inspections, more nurses and a stronger voice for patients, with compassionate care starting to replace tick-box targets as the major focus on boards and wards. He will add: ‘Our goal is safe and compassionate care as the hallmark of every hospital and experience of every single patient and family. 'As the NHS starts to cross this Rubicon, we must pay tribute to the hard work of NHS staff as well as the whistle-blowers and patients’ champions who refused to be silenced.’ Mr Hunt is expected to highlight the example of Helene Donnelly, an A&E nurse who faced ‘bullying and harassment when she spoke out about poor care at Mid Staffordshire’. He will highlight further changes since the Francis Inquiry, including an extra 2,400 hospital nurses hired in the last year, with 3,575 nurses working on NHS wards and 6,000 more clinical staff overall since the 2010 election. Nearly 40 per cent of hospitals now have the names of a senior responsible doctor above patients’ beds, and the first 165 nursing students are piloting the new training approach. Jamie Reed, Labour’s shadow health minister, said the Coalition had presided over ‘the loss of thousands of NHS nurses’ and that the Government was ‘making care failures more likely’. He added: ‘It is yet more proof that you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.’","Comes on eve of first anniversary of Francis Inquiry into Mid Staffs scandal in which as many as 1,200 patients died .

Two hero bin men today told how they rescued a terrified woman and her dog from a sinking car - after she drove off a 20ft harbour wall and plunged into the sea. Derek Main, 35, and Gary Roberts, 43, were eating their lunch at Burghead harbour in Moray when they heard a loud revving noise followed by a massive splash. The duo fled to the water's edge to find the shocked woman and her dog trapped in a brand new Vauxhall Corsa. Sunk: The vehicle flew into the water after a woman drove off a 20ft wall and plunged into the sea . Mystery: It is not yet clear what happened to lead to the red Vauxhall flying into the sea, but thankfully there were no injuries . While Derek ran for some ropes, Gary swam into the harbour with a mystery Irish cyclist who said he was a lifeguard and freed the panicking woman, thought to be in her 50s, from the stricken vehicle. Derek, of Lossiemouth, recalled the bizarre incident which happened 12.20pm on Thursday afternoon. He said: 'We were at the harbour having our lunch. We saw a person sitting in the car and we thought she was taking in the view, which is not unusual. 'But suddenly there was an almighty revving sound and the car shot into the water.' Gary ran down the slipway and began swimming out to the car, while the Irish man, who would only give his name as Paddy, stripped off and dived 20ft off the pier into the water. With the car being washed out to sea and already submerged in water as deep as 12ft, the men had to act quickly. Brave lads: Derek Main, left, and Gary Roberts, right, beside Burghead harbour where they saved a woman driver and her dog . Gary, 43, of nearby Lhanbryde, said: 'Derek took his boots off, but I went straight in with all my gear on. 'I noticed there was a woman in the front seat holding a dog. 'I'd just reached the car when this Irish guy got the woman out of the driver's seat. 'As he was pulling her to safety he shouted out that there was still a dog in the back of the car. 'At this stage the car was sinking and I didn't think I'd be able to open the door because of the water pressure, but I just about managed it. 'A collie dog clambered out, but then it started swimming the wrong way out into the harbour. 'It was panicking and snarling at me, so after pushing it round the right way I decided to just let it make its own way back.' Dragged out: The emergency services inspect the sunk car as it is pulled from Burghead Harbour . Derek added: 'The woman was probably aged in her 50s. 'After she was brought out of the water, she started going on about how she had valuables in the car, so the Irish guy went back into the water. 'The car was completely submerged by then, but he dived down and managed to bring a couple of items back, including the dog's pillow. 'The woman was quite shaken and shivering. She seemed to be suffering from shock. 'The whole incident was a scary thing to be involved in. 'We didn't think about it at the time, but afterwards you realise just what a close thing it had been.' Gary said: 'It was a close shave, if it hadn't been for that other guy jumping in and helping, who knows what would have happened? 'The lady was very lucky.' Local resident Sarah Doonan said she thinks the woman accidentally drove off the edge of the pier. She said: 'It's all a bit bizarre, but thankfully she's OK. 'She seems to have just been sitting there looking out to sea and then somehow managed to press the accelerator by mistake and drove into the sea. 'She definitely didn't mean to do it as she said she had a lot of valuables and money in the car.' The woman was taken to Dy Gray's Hospital in Elgin for a check-up but is not thought to have suffered any serious injuries. Police and an ambulance went to the scene, as did the village's coastguard, who winched the woman's Corsa - which became completely submerged at one point - up the slipway and out of the water. It is thought that the woman's dog is recovering in a local boarding kennel.","Derek Main and Gary Roberts having lunch when they heard huge splash .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 18:29 EST, 12 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:12 EST, 13 January 2014 . Prime Minister David Cameron has been warned that he will foster division in the party if he ignores the views of eurosceptics . David Cameron was branded ‘absolutely out of touch’ with the Tory party last night after he dismissed calls to give Parliament a veto over EU law. The Prime Minister was told he risked causing disastrous divisions in the party, including a Cabinet split, after a letter from 95 backbenchers demanding the right to say No to European legislation was branded unrealistic. Eurosceptics reacted furiously last night, saying the Prime Minister would be ‘bonkers’ to ignore their views and warning that Tory high command was heading for an ‘almighty smash-up’ with the rest of the party. The row is expected to intensify on Wednesday when Chancellor George Osborne makes a speech arguing that Britain should remain within a reformed European Union. The number of rebels calling for a veto on new EU laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten Britain’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 MPs who voted against the Government on Europe in 2011. The letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by Mr Cameron. The rebels say at least six Cabinet members also back them, plus six ministerial aides and members of Mr Cameron’s policy board, making the true figure 107 MPs or more. One signatory said: ‘If Downing Street digs in over this they are absolutely bonkers. They will create a Cabinet split. This is a wake-up call. If the governing elite of our party are so absolutely out of touch it’s going to be absolutely disastrous.’ At the moment, Mr Cameron can only veto new laws on the most sensitive issues such as defence and the EU budget. But while Parliament can raise concerns with the European Commission, it has no powers to block or repeal existing laws. The rebels call on Mr Cameron to ‘make the idea of a national veto over current and future EU laws a reality’ and ‘enable Parliament to disapply EU legislation, where it is in our vital national interests to do so’. The MPs point out that this ‘would transform the UK’s negotiating position in the EU’ as Mr Cameron seeks to carve out a new relationship with Brussels ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017. William Hague says the unemployment will soar and the UK economy will be hit hard by a veto . But Foreign Secretary William Hague warned the veto would undermine the single market and damage business. He told Sky News: ‘If national parliaments were unilaterally just able to choose which bits of EU law they would apply and which bits they wouldn’t, the European single market wouldn’t work. We have to be realistic.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he understood the MPs’ concerns but a ‘red card’ system could work only if several  countries got together to oppose EU laws. Bernard Jenkin, who co-ordinated the letter, said europhiles overestimate the economic damage that could be caused if the Uk renegotiates its relationship with the EU . He added: ‘I don’t think it’s realistic to have a situation where one Parliament can veto laws across the European Union.’ But irate MPs accused senior Tories of peddling a policy that was ‘indistinguishable from that of the Liberal Democrats’. They warned Mr Osborne not to use the argument advanced by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg – that leaving the EU could cost three million jobs – when he speaks to the Open Europe think-tank and the Tory Fresh Start group on Wednesday. The Chancellor is expected to urge EU nations to change their economic approach to copy Britain’s growth, but signal that the UK wants to stay in if the EU reforms itself. Bernard Jenkin, who coordinated the letter, said: ‘We’re all being very polite to each other but I think it’s better if we have some honest disagreements on the future of Europe rather than pretending we agree. ‘It’s the facile tactics Europhiles always use. They start talking about three million jobs as if the sky is going to fall in if we ask for some powers back.’ Jacob Rees-Mogg, another signatory, said many rebels don’t even want the single market, adding: ‘If this makes the single market not work, that’s not the problem. We can still have free trade, which is more important. Laws should be made by our democratic representatives, not by the fiat of Brussels.’ Signatories include James Clappison, Conor Burns, John Baron, Anne Main and ex-defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. One said: ‘Downing Street’s argument is such rubbish. We are at crunch point. They are heading for the most almighty smash-up.’ They said Mr Cameron had nothing to lose by making the veto Tory policy because the pro-European wing of the Tory Party was so depleted. One added: ‘Would the party be split? I don’t think so.’ Europe's ‘travelling circus’, in which MEPs decamp to France once a month, costs taxpayers at least £93million a year. European Union figures show the astonishing price of packing up the parliament in Brussels and shipping it to Strasbourg for just four days each month. Conservative MEPs estimated the true cost to be £130million – and called for an end to the practice. Some £250,000 is spent just lugging paperwork between the two cities, a report on the ‘financial and environmental impact’ showed. Maintaining the parliament in Strasbourg costs £50million a year. Although MEPs voted to scrap the ‘circus’ by three to one last year, the French will veto any such attempt. Conservative MEP Ashley Fox said: ‘This craziness has to stop.’ Jacob Rees-Mogg says the UK doesn't need the single market, as free trade is more important . Mr Clegg warned the letter showed the Tories were drifting towards the exit in Europe, which would lead to ‘economic suicide’ for Britain. He said the Tory signatories were ‘cowering behind the cliffs of Dover’, adding: ‘Conservative MPs need to make up their mind. If they want full exit from the European Union, they should be free to argue it, but then they should come clean because what they’re saying is they want to be part of a European club but don’t want to play by the rules.’ A No10 spokesman said: ‘We will study this idea, but we need to look at what it would mean in practice. If national parliaments unilaterally overturned EU laws, the single market wouldn’t work.’","PM warned it would be 'bonkers' to ignore views of eurosceptics .

Seeds from a record-setting champion could go for as much as $40 for a pack of three to four seeds. 'There should be over 1,500 seeds in here,' he said. 'We all share seeds and trade them back and forth. They have auctions in the winter time to raise funds for the clubs and stuff. 'There's a lot of camaraderie among growers worldwide now, with the internet and stuff but there's also a competitiveness about it.'","Chris Kent is from Sevierville in Tennessee .

A Long Island man shot dead his fiancée Sunday morning in front of his children and had a shootout with police before eventually surrendering. Jose Rodriguez III, 32, shot dead fiancée Kimberly Sellitto, 36, before firing several shots at responding police while his three children watched in horror, authorities said. Mr Rodriguez eventually turned himself in and was charged with second-degree murder. Out of nowhere: Jose Rodriguez III, 32, shot dead fiancée Kimberly Sellitto, 36, at their Long Island home late Sunday morning . Officers responding just after 11.30 Sunday morning discovered a woman’s body in front of the Ridge, NY apartment complex where the couple lived. Locked and loaded, Mr Rodriguez pumped several shotgun rounds at responding officers. No police were injured, but a police vehicle sustained minor damage while cops were firing back at the violent man. Police were able to negotiate the release of Mr Rodriguez’s two children – Ms Sellitto was not their mother – before eventually convincing him to surrender at about 1:45, the Suffolk County Police Department said in an official statement. Neither Mr Rodriguez nor the children were hurt during the tense standoff, authorities said, adding they were put into their mother’s custody. The picture of happiness: Both had many pictures of each other kissing posted to social media . They were going to marry: The pair was engaged and had been together for seven years . The children, both younger than seven-years-old, were not taken as hostages, but unfortunately were inside the apartment as the traumatic events unfolded, a source told Newsday. The deranged gunman fired six shots at officers, Newsday reported. Ms Sellitto’s lifeless body remained on the ground until 7.40pm, the source added. No motive has yet been established, but a woman identified as Mr Rodriguez’s sister told Newsday their relationship was tumultuous from the start. ‘He wanted to be happy with her, but in the inside he was screaming, he felt like the only people he had were his kids,’ Stephanie Rodriguez told the paper. Suddenly gone: Ms Sellitto was shot dead in front of the apartment she shared with Mr Rodriguez . No longer a joke: Mr Rodriguez now has a real mug shot after being arrested Sunday . ‘I told him I would never leave his side,’ she added, saying that her tormented brother wanted to leave Ms Sellitto. The pair met seven years ago in a tattoo parlor where the accused killer worked, the sister noted.Pictures posted to social media show a seemingly happy couple. Stunned friends posted messages of disbelief online. 'Wishing this was all just a bad dream,' wrote Cassi Lopez, later adding ' I'm ok. Just some crazy s**t going on. Trying to wrap my head around it all.' 'Me too...I tried so hard so many times,' one of her friends replied. 'I can't believe it either,' wrote another. Days at the beach with Mr Rodriguez’s children are peppered in with pictures of the happy couple kissing and showing off tattoos. There was no outward indication the couple was in trouble, but Mr Rodriguez’s sister said otherwise. ‘You can only push a person so much before they break.’ Mr Rodriguez is scheduled to be arraigned Monday.","Officials say Jose Rodriguez shot dead fiancee Kimberly Sellitto before turning his gun on police .

Ed Balls and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander had to be ‘dragged apart’ when they almost came to blows during a blazing row, it was revealed last night. Former Cabinet Minister Tessa Jowell was forced to intervene, saying she feared the Labour rivals were about to get into a ‘fisticuffs’. The dust-up happened when the Shadow Chancellor and Mr Alexander clashed in a private room in the Commons over the party’s policy on Europe. Ed Balls (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) reportedly had to be dragged apart by Tessa Jowell after rowing over the Europe vote . Mr Balls told Labour’s Shadow Cabinet he had Mr Alexander’s full support in toughening Labour’s stance on the EU. But pro-Brussels Mr Alexander accused him of lying and the two men slugged it out in a furious confrontation. The row was disclosed by Labour insiders after Mr Balls’s bid to soften his ‘bruiser’ image by praising Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg as ‘friendly and warm’. Labour aides say animosity caused by the Balls-Alexander flare-up is disrupting the party’s preparations for next year’s General Election. Mr Alexander is Labour’s election chief and allies of Mr Balls say the Shadow Chancellor has been ‘shut out’ of the campaign. The row happened when Mr Balls led a Labour ambush on David Cameron by backing rebel Tory MPs in a Commons vote demanding a cut in the EU’s budget in October 2012. Mr Alexander accused Mr Balls of plotting the U-turn while he was on a trip to America. The former Cabinet Minister was forced to intervene reportedly fearing the pair would end up in a fight . By the time Mr Alexander returned to the UK on October 28, Mr Balls had talked Labour leader Ed Miliband into agreeing to the policy somersault. The following day, an article co-written by Mr Balls and a reluctant and jet-lagged Mr Alexander, spelling out the Labour switch, appeared in a national newspaper. Friends of Mr Alexander say he was ‘bounced’ into it. On October 31, 2012, Labour and Tory rebels duly defeated Mr Cameron in the Commons vote – but Mr Alexander was seething. The Labour duo squared up to each other in the Shadow Cabinet Room, and a   Dame Tessa – who regularly acted as peacemaker between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown during their time in Downing Street – had to intervene. She said later she feared the pair would come to blows. ‘She said it nearly ended in fisticuffs and she had to drag them apart,’ said a source. Another Labour insider added: ‘Ed and Douglas were screaming abuse and jabbing fingers at each other. ‘Ed said the decision to vote with the Tory rebels was agreed in full by Douglas’s team. Douglas was incandescent and called him a liar. Ed denied it.’ If they had come to blows, Mr Balls, who is more heavily built than Mr Alexander, may have had the upper hand. Although they are both aged 46, ‘Bruiser Balls’ is a keen footballer and is as aggressive on the pitch as he is when shouting and gesticulating at Mr Cameron in the Commons. ‘Deadly Doug’ is a wily behind-the-scenes operator, but mild-mannered by comparison. Both were leading members of Gordon Brown’s inner circle, but relations collapsed during Mr Brown’s on-off General Election fiasco in 2007, with claims that allies of Mr Balls tried to blame Mr Alexander. Mr Alexander was accused of ‘betrayal’ by friends of Mr Balls when he led Blairite David Miliband’s failed Labour leadership campaign in 2010. Dame Jowell allegedly had to act as peacemaker between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown during their time in office . In 2005, Mr Alexander was the Minister for Europe who approved a cut in the UK’s rebate from Brussels and an increase in the EU’s budget. Two years later, Mr Balls attacked the EU’s ‘outdated budget’ – seen as a side-swipe at Mr Alexander.More recently, Mr Balls manoeuvred to push Labour towards backing an ‘in-out’ referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, a move fiercely opposed by Mr Alexander. A Labour official said: ‘Balls presents a cosy image of himself playing the piano and chatting with his new best friend Nick Clegg. But it’s a sham. Everyone knows he is a political thug.’ However, a supporter of Mr Balls hit back: ‘Ed’s ploy to link up with Tory EU dissidents was a success. This is sour grapes by Douglas’s camp.’ The Balls-Alexander row comes less than two months after The Mail on Sunday revealed how a leaked email from Ed Miliband’s office described Mr Balls as ‘a nightmare.’ A spokesman for Mr Balls said: ‘There was no row about the EU budget vote. We successfully defeated the Government on it and Ed and Douglas welcomed the result.’ Mr Alexander and Dame Tessa both declined to comment last night.","Ed Balls and Douglas Alexander rowed over the party's policy on Europe .

Michael Meldish - who is believed to have co-led the Purple Gang - was discovered in the driving seat of his Lincoln LS sedan in the Bronx on Friday night. The 62-year-old had a single gunshot wound to the head and blood leaking from both ears. The gangster's body was discovered by neighbour Janet Forbes at about 10:30pm on Ellsworth Avenue, according to the New York Daily News. Mrs . Forbes, 52, had been driving home when she spotted the rusty car parked . at the side of the street - with its driver's side door hanging open . and a motionless man inside. Her husband John, 51, who was in the house at the time, also claimed to have heard a 'pop'. Former NYPD commanding officer Joseph Coffey . said Meldish's murder had all the markings of a contract killing - . describing it as 'poetic justice' for a 'stone-cold killer'. 'It should have happened a long . time ago,' he told the newspaper. 'Michael was a stone-cold killer. I . call it vermin killing vermin.' However, police have said they cannot confirm the exact circumstances surrounding the murder. Meldish, the older brother of infamous hitman Joseph Meldish, is believed to have carried out more than 10 hits in the 1970s and 1980s with the Purple Gang. However, he was never convicted of any hits - something Mr Coffey attributes to his ability to instil fear into witnesses. 'We couldn't get any witnesses,' he said. 'They had people so terrified, they just wouldn't cooperate. Discovery: Michael Meldish was found shot dead in his car on Ellsworth Avenue, pictured, in the Bronx . The gang, which controlled the supply of heroin in the Bronx and Harlem, was known for killing and dismembering its rivals. It . was originally affiliated with the Lucchese crime family, before . developing relationships with the Bonanno and Genovese families. However, the crew started to disintegrate in the late 1980s as its members were arrested during drug busts. During his lifetime, Meldish has been arrested for a number of crimes, including assault, weapon possession and forgery. However, his neighbours have described him as a 'friendly' man who is always willing to help. In 2011, his brother Joseph Meldish was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for a 1999 killing. The 56-year-old shot Joseph Brown, 35, nine times inside a crowded New York bar after mistaking the victim for his lookalike drug dealer brother. He is also believed to have been responsible for as many as 70 contract killings. Police have launched an investigation into Meldish's murder, but no arrests have yet been made.","Michael Meldish, 62, discovered in the driving seat of his car in the Bronx .

Two 26 year-old women living on separate continents - one of them an actress in Los Angeles, the other a fashion designer in London - have spoken of the moment they came to discover each other as identical twins. Anaïs Bordier and Samantha Futerman were separated at birth. Miss Bordier was taken to France by her adoptive parents, while Miss Futerman was raised in New Jersey. Over the course of the last year, the pair have visited each other in their respective countries and taken the time to get to know each other before deciding to answer the question that they and everyone around them wanted to know - are they sisters? Scroll down for video - and find out how you can donate to their film by clicking here . Twins! Two wonderful young women -  strangers living thousands of miles apart found that they shared a life-changing secret . Seeing double: They decided to make a documentary about their experience and say they've already heard from countless other adoptees thanking them . Documentary: Anaïs Bordier and Samantha Futerman, 26, are now making a documentary to chart the moment when they finally get the results of a DNA test that proves they are twins . Parent trap: Suspected twins Anais Bordier, left, and Samantha Futerman, right, during their very first conversation, via Skype; Bordier lives in London while Futerman lives in Los Angeles . My other half:  The two young women launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a documentary and meet each other in person. They've nearly reached their $80,000 goal . It all began last February. 'I got message on Facebook from a girl in London,' Miss Futerman, an actress, said in an interview on Good Morning America. 'It said she had seen me in a YouTube . video, then after looking my name up online, saw that we were both . adopted, and born on the same day, in the same city. When I saw her . profile, it was crazy. She looked just like me.' The message had been sent by Anais Bordier, a French fashion designer in London. 'When . I looked at the video, I - it was, like, shocking ...,' Bordier said. 'You can't imagine that you might have a twin sister somewhere that you don't know about.' Last . February Miss Bordier, who is studying at Central St Martins in London . but was raised as an only child in a Parisien suburb, had been watching a . YouTube film when she noticed that an actress in the clip looked very . similar to her. She also . shared similar mannerisms to the actress, who turned out to be Miss . Futerman, who grew up in Verona, New Jersey and was living in Los . Angeles. History: The sisters say they always felt as though something was missing in their lives. They never knew that they were each placed in separate foster care agencies and adopted separately . Hey, you look familiar!The original Facebook message that Anais send to her would-be sister . Coincidence: They would soon discover they both have been adopted after being born on the same day in the same Korean city. Could it be? Were they identical twins separated at birth? Growing up: Bordier grew up in France while Futerman spent her childhood in New Jersey . Twinterest: The two have now taken a DNA test that confirms that they are indeed related. Over the last year they have been filming to make a documentary together as they travel and learn about each . other's lives . Is it really you? The first time the twins met each other, they had to touch each other just to be doubly sure . Miss Bordier . contacted aspiring actress Miss Futerman on Twitter and the women say . they soon worked out that they were both born in the South Korean town of Busan on November 19, 1987. Bordier and Futerman, who appeared together for this morning's interview, decided to start chatting via Skype. Both women speak English, although French is Anais' first language. Futerman . described this morning looking into Bordier's face and seeing a mirror . of her own features. Nonetheless, they've had their DNA tested to erase . any doubt that they're sisters. 'It . was weird, but I feel like there was a strange calm and comfort as . well, and something that I can't really explain,' Futerman said. 'We . talked for three hours.' They met for the first time in London, then in Los Angeles, and now they've united again in Manhattan. The pair have now taken a DNA test to clear up any doubt and the results proved what they knew deep inside: they were sisters. My second heart: The twins feel as though everything is perfect now that they have found one another . Filmmakers:  They decided to make a documentary about their experience and say they've already heard from countless other adoptees thanking them . Emotions: The girls say they often felt as though something was missing in their lives but that they feel they have extra confidence knowing they found their second heart . Proof: The DNA result proved what their faces told them all along: they were sisters . The 'twinsters,' as they have since dubbed themselves, shared an immediate and undeniable bond. Two . women decided to share their emotional meeting with others and launched . a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a documentary tracking their . 'possible siblingship' — which would culminate in the release of their . DNA results, proving whether or not they are in fact related. Over . the last year, the twins have been able to capture tons of amazing . moments along their journey, including two weeks at Samantha's home in . California, and 10 days in their birthplace, Seoul, Korea, where they . visited their adoption agency together. All in all, the sisters have collected 42,000 video clips together. Bordier says she felt as though something was missing in her life. She . said that her father had cried upon meeting Miss Futerman, while her . mother believed that the pair were so alike that they had to be sisters. They . both share a love of Harry Potter, the arts, and many of the same . television programmes, while Miss Bordier confessed that the duo had . taken advantage of their physical similarities to play a trick on Miss . Futerman's mother and father. 'I . came out first and surprised them and they stopped for five seconds, . saying, 'What? What? No!' and they said we were identical too. It was . just like The Parent Trap.' After she and her sister were born, they were each placed in separate foster care agencies and adopted separately. So much to catch up on:  The time they first met online, they shared their entire life stories in that first conversation, chatting for three hours . Pure chance: The story is remarkable that they managed to find each other after 25 years, yet neither knew of the others' existence! 'I . did feel like I missed something,' she said. 'I had an imaginary friend . when I was a kid.  It happens to a lot of kids, but I had an imaginary . friend and she was called Anne ...  I needed that comfort, I guess,'she . added. Futerman has two adoptive brothers, while Bordier is the only child in her family. 'It . makes me really emotional, because as a kid you have dreams of wanting . to change the world.  It's something-- it's something that feels too far . away ... it's an overwhelming thing to know that two little,  tiny, . Asian hobbits can,you know, make a difference,' she said, laughing. The . pair have decided to make a documentary about their experience, and . they say they've already heard from many other adoptees who are thankful . to them for sharing their experience. They're still raising money to help with the post-production of the documentary and have almost reached their $80,000 goal. For Christmas, Futerman got necklaces that say 'Best Friends Forever' for her and her sister. Bordier appreciates it. 'It sounds really cheesy, but I think we need those little kid's moments and those cheesy moments together,' Bordier said. Futerman . described finding her sister like 'that feeling on Christmas when you . open up the presents, the one you were asking for, it's that - that pure . feeling of joy - that's how I always feel.'","Anais Bordier and Samantha Futerman believed they were separated at birth in South Korea .

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 17:47 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:48 EST, 6 August 2013 . British children are suffering thanks to an epidemic of online bullying - with the number of calls to ChildLine from victims almost doubling in just one year. In 2012/13, a total of 4,507 children - around 12 a day - rang the helpline to complain they were being abused by peers on social networking sites. That is up a startling 87 per cent from the 2,410 calls the year before, with the head of the NSPCC revealing many were ringing in ‘utter panic’ after suffering months of ‘torment’. Despair: Childline was contacted on more than 4,500 occasions by cyber bullying victims last year - around 12 a day (file picture) Girls are three times more likely to call than boys and, worryingly, one in six calls are received from children aged 11 or younger. The revelation follows the death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith, who hanged herself on Friday after months of abuse on the internet. Her father said he had found bullying posts on his daughter’s ask.fm page from people telling her to die. She had been urged to ‘drink bleach’ by her anonymous tormentors and taunted over her weight, the death of an uncle and an apparent propensity to self-harm. The notorious ask.fm website - described as a ‘stalker’s paradise’ - has been linked to at least four teenage deaths over the past year. Now an analysis of calls received by ChildLine show that these victims are far from alone - and that cyberbullying is now one of the fastest growing issues young people contract them about. Bullying: The head of the NSPCC revealing many were ringing in 'utter panic' after suffering months of 'torment' Misery: The controversial Ask.fm website which has been blamed for the deaths of four UK children following cyber bullying . The shocking increase has happened just as the number of calls about traditional playground bullying has started to fall - indicating that attackers are retreating to the virtual word as schools take a tougher approach. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ‘When I was young you could at least escape the bullying when you got home from school and closed the front door behind you. ‘But now it follows children into their homes, into their bedrooms via mobile phones and laptops.’ He added: ‘Many young people suffer in complete silence not knowing what to do or who to turn to. They internalise the pain blaming themselves going over and over it in their head.’ Victim: Hannah Smith, 14, has killed herself after being bullied by anonymous trolls online . ChildLine, the helpline founded by former That’s Life presenter Esther Rantzen, is now provided by the NSPCC. Their analysis of calls revealed that in 2012/13, more than 1,000 boys rang advisers because they are being intimidated online. And while cyberbulling mostly affects teenagers, the figures reveal that around 16 per cent of calls - more than 700 - are from children aged 11 or younger. One girl told an adviser: ‘I feel really depressed and like I want to fade away. I have no one to talk to and no one understands what I’m going through. ‘This girl has been sending me really horrible messages on the internet, telling me I should kill myself and that I am fat and ugly. 'Everyone tells me to ignore it, but it really upsets me that someone would say such awful things. I don’t know what to do?’ Another said: ‘I’m not feeling good. Someone has set up a fake social network account and is pretending to be me. I don’t know who it is, but I’m really upset because they have been sending horrible messages to people I know and now people are starting to hate me because they think it’s me doing it. ‘I’m really upset and don’t know what to do. I don’t want my parents to find out because I’m too embarrassed. I want to find out who is doing this to me.’ Mr Wanless said that the examples last week of older women suffering abuse from online trolls on twitter shows just how ‘horrible and draining’ bullying can be for the strongest of people. He said: ‘For children and young people, desperate to be liked and to “fit in”, the consequences can be particularly devastating. ‘Can you ever imagine a situation in the office where people came up to you on a daily basis and called you fat, ugly or stupid? Can you imagine receiving emails from your work colleagues telling you they wish you were dead? New trend: The shocking increase has happened just as the number of calls about traditional playground bullying has started to fall - indicating that attackers are retreating to the virtual word as schools take a tougher approach . 'No, and action would be rightly taken immediately. Others would step in just as others stepped in to defend the women facing abuse on twitter.’ He added: ‘Children and young people need to know that there is always somewhere they can turn. 'They can talk to their parents, their teachers and if they really feel they can’t speak face to face with a trusted adult, ChildLine is always here to listen and to support. ‘But these social networking sites will not go away; they must take more responsibility for what happens on their sites just as a school takes responsibility for what happens within its gates. 'We are writing to the regulators of these sites asking for an urgent meeting to discuss how we can tackle this problem. ‘But this is also about education. About being clear with bullies that their actions will not be tolerated and being clear to victims that they have done nothing wrong and it can and will be stopped if they speak out.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said that no-one ‘should have to suffer the fear and victimisation of bullying’. ‘The law is clear that what is illegal off-line is also illegal on-line,’ he said. ‘Perpetrators of grossly offensive, obscene or menacing behaviour face stiff punishment. ‘Through the UK Council of Child Internet Safety we are working with social networking sites and internet providers to make the internet a safer place for a young people.’ The spokesman added that under the new curriculum, children would be taught from the age of five ‘how to stay safe online, and how to communicate safely and respectfully’.","In 2012/13, a total of 4,507 children rang Childline complaining of cyber bullying .

A shocking video emerged today of a woman going on a rant to patients in a hospital waiting room. The two-minute clip, filmed on Saturday night at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk, saw the woman shout abuse at students Gina Thompson, 23, of Nigeria, and her 21-year-old Spanish friend. The woman asked them ‘where do you come from’ before saying: ‘You're coming over here and you're pleading poverty. We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis.’ Scroll down for video . Video: The woman shouted abuse at students Gina Thompson, 23, of Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and her 21-year-old Spanish friend at Ipswich Hospital in Seville, Suffolk, on Saturday night at around 7:30pm . The incident took place at 7:30pm in the hospital’s accident and emergency department waiting room, where Miss Thompson had gone with her friend who had sprained her ankle playing sport. Miss Thompson, of Port Harcourt, Nigeria, is a film and media student at University Campus Suffolk and has been in the UK for two years, while her friend from Seville, Spain, arrived last September. The woman shouted in front of about 20 shocked patients and friends or relatives: ‘What has happened to this f*****g country’, before directly abusing Miss Thompson who was sitting down. She asked her ‘Where do you come from?’, to which Miss Thompson replied: ‘What does it matter where I'm from?’ The woman said: ‘We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis’, before Miss Thompson replied: ‘Don't call me an a***hole’. Rant: The woman shouted in front of about 20 shocked patients and friends or relatives at the hospital . But the woman said: ‘I will, because you're coming over here and you're pleading poverty.

Calling me an . a***hole? Are you alright?’ 'What has happened to this f*****g country? We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis' Woman . The woman said back: ‘Don't accept it, you fat a***’, before a voice off camera said the police had been called. The woman was then apprehended by a group of nurses, paramedics and security guards, saying: ‘There's a revolution going on here.’ Miss Thompson told MailOnline after the incident: ‘I was so embarrassed and I couldn’t do anything because I was stuck in the situation, so we just had to laugh about it. All the attention was on us. ‘She said I've come here to claim . poverty. That's not true. I'm an international student and I pay £13,000 . a year in tuition fees. My friend is a student here from Spain.’ Location: The two-minute clip was filmed at the A&E waiting room of Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk . ‘It made me feel low of myself. I had to go back home and question why it was wrong I was here. My friend was surprised. She was scared, she was terrified. ‘She kind of felt unsafe afterwards.

Belgium is considering a significant change to its decade-old euthanasia law that would allow minors and Alzheimer’s sufferers to seek permission to die. The proposed changes to the law were submitted to parliament on Tuesday by the Socialist party and are likely to be approved by other parties, although no date has yet been put forward for a parliamentary debate. 'The idea is to update the law to take better account of dramatic situations and extremely harrowing cases we must find a response to,' party leader Thierry Giet said. Contentious: Belgium was the second country in the world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002 but it applies only to people over the age of 18 (picture posed by models) The draft legislation calls for 'the law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we cannot alleviate.' Belgium was the second country in the world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002 but it applies only to people over the age of 18. Socialist Senator Philippe Mahoux, who helped draft the proposed changes, said there had been cases of adolescents who 'had the capacity to decide' their future. Campaign: Tony Nicklinson, who suffered from locked-in syndrome, lost a legal battle for the right to be helped to end his life when he chooses earlier this year. He died at his Wiltshire home just days after the High Court judgement . He said parliamentarians would also consider extended mercy-killing to people suffering from Alzheiner’s-type illnesses. Euthanasia was allowed to an Alzheimer’s patient for the first time in the Netherlands last year. In Belgium, some 1,133 cases -- mostly for terminal cancer -- were recorded in 2011, about one percent of all deaths in the country, according to official figures. A seriously ill prisoner serving a long jail sentence this year became the first inmate to die under Belgium’s euthanasia laws.","Proposals submitted to parliament by Socialist Party .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:49 EST, 5 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:10 EST, 5 February 2014 . British military advice was given to the Indian authorities ahead of the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, William Hague admitted yesterday. A Special Air Service (SAS) officer flew to the country and advised India's military leaders ahead of the assault in Amritsar. But a Government investigation into British involvement in the incident concluded the advice had a 'limited impact' on the operation. It found the officer's advice was largely ignored and Indira Gandhi’s government instead launched a frontal assault – codenamed Operation Blue Star -  which killed 575 and resulted in up to 3,000 deaths from subsequent riots. British involvement: An SAS officer did visit the Golden Temple and advise Indian military leaders ahead of the 1984 attack in Amritsar which resulted in 3,000 deaths, a government investigation has found . Prime Minister David Cameron (left) has asked for Sikhs to forgive the Tories after it emerged Margaret Thatcher (right) approved the SAS officer's visit and advise to the Indian government ahead of the massacre . The investigation was ordered by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood after documents released under the 30-year rule suggested that an SAS officer advised the Indians about how to deal with the Sikh dissidents occupying the site. Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons that a British adviser travelled to India in February 1984, but his recommendation for a surprise assault using helicopters was not reflected in the raid which took place in June that year and resulted in extensive bloodshed. Mr Hague said: 'The Cabinet Secretary's report finds that the nature of the UK's assistance was purely advisory, limited and and provided to the Indian government at an early stage; that it had limited impact on the tragic events that unfolded at the temple three months later; that there was no link between the provision of this advice and defence sales and there is no record of the (British) government receiving advance notice of the operation.' Alliance: David Cameron visited the temple last year, and Sikhs in Britain form a key bloc vote for the Tories . He told MPs the SAS assessment ‘made . clear that a military operation should only be put into effect as a last . resort’ and recommended that any military operation use ‘an element of . surprise and the use of helicopter-borne forces in the interest of . reducing casualties and bringing about a swift resolution’. David Cameron last night pleaded with the Sikh community to forgive the Tories as it emerged Margaret Thatcher had agreed to send the special forces officer to help the Indians. Her principal private secretary at the time, Lord Butler of Brockwell, said it was clear the then-prime minister had considered sending the SAS officer 'very carefully' before agreeing to it. Anger: Lord Indarjit Singh said Mr Hague's statement was 'smug and condescending' Mr Cameron yesterday said he wanted the dialogue between the Government and the Sikh community over the issue to continue, adding: ‘British Sikhs have made – and continue to make – a vital contribution to our national life. 'Thirty years ago, a great tragedy unfolded...in Amritsar. Many lives were lost and the scars in the Sikh community still run deep. ‘I tasked the Cabinet Secretary with getting to the truth. He did so, and there are two main findings. ‘One: around four months before the events, at the request of the Indian Government, a single UK military officer provided some advice. But critically, this advice was not followed, and it was a one-off. ‘Two: there is absolutely no evidence of UK Government involvement in the operation itself.’ The Prime Minister travelled to Amritsar last year to visit the temple - a trip that appeared to have led to a rise in Conservative support among British Sikhs, who are a key voting bloc in marginal constituencies in London and the Midlands. His efforts are seen by many to have been dashed by the new revelations. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said 'serious questions' remained, adding: ‘The pain and suffering still felt by many about the tragic events of 1984 places a particular duty on the Government to provide what answers it can to address very genuine concerns.’ Dabinderjit Singh, of the Sikh Federation UK, said Britain’s involvement was clear, adding: ‘We are actually very disappointed with the announcement.’ The assault triggered the assassination . of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (pictured right with Thatcher on a visit to India), who ordered the attack, when two . Sikh bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later . Lord Singh, director of the Network of Sikh Organisations, called Mr Hague’s statement ‘smug and condescending’ and said the language in the documents was ‘insulting’ to Sikhs since it suggested they were all extremists. On the claim that UK advice had a ‘limited impact’ of the Golden Temple attack, Lord Singh said: ‘It is like saying that I had only a minimal involvement in a massacre or a holocaust.’ Jasvir Singh, director of the City Sikhs Network, which represents Sikh professionals in the UK, said the information disclosed in the review ‘harks back to colonial times’. He added: ‘I think there are lots of people in the Sikh community who are upset that the British could be involved in this, even to a limited extent.’","SAS officer .

Thirteen people have been killed at one of Pakistan's last pornographic cinemas after three grenades were thrown into the audience. About 80 people were in the cinema as it reportedly screened an X-rated film midway through the afternoon when one grenade hit the main door and two more landed inside the building. Twenty more people were wounded as blood ran down the aisles of the auditorium. One man was decapitated in his seat by the blast. Blood-soaked shoes, caps, condoms and . human flesh were found following the attack, which a witness said happened while a pornographic film was being . screened at around 4pm. Scroll Down for Video . Attack: Volunteers inside the Shama cinema in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is the town's last to show pornographic films, after three grenades were hurled into the audience yesterday . Double life: The cinema advertised family-friendly films but had a well-known pornographic back room . Violence: The attack happened yesterday in the middle of the afternoon in downtown Peshawar . Rescue: At least a dozen people died and 20 were wounded. One man was decapitated in his seat by the blast . Dead: A blood-stained shoe lies abandoned inside the movie theatre, which showed three X-rated films a day. Peace talks between Pakistan's authorities and the Taliban are due to begin within days . The Shama cinema was the last place to . watch pornographic films publicly in the northwestern city of Peshawar, . a battleground for Taliban extremists. The cinema is famous for being one of the last places in Pakistan to defy the strict moral codes demanded by the Taliban, upon pain of threats or death. Attack: The cinema's location . Though it has a main auditorium for mainstream films, the official public face of the cinema, it is notorious for its smaller, 30-year-old screen showing X-rated films three times a day. Men are known to cover their faces as they slip into the back of the theatre in a cloud of cannabis smoke, reportedly paying a special 'Class X' price of 200 rupees (£1.15) to sneak down a concrete passage past an armed guard. In the centre of a city of two and a half million people, the cinema had already been threatened and its owners had been told to put up metal detectors but did not follow the advice, CNN reported. Various reports put the death toll between 10 and 13. No one has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attack, which came days after Pakistan began a peace process with the . Taliban to end years of violence which has killed more than 40,000 people. One recent film at the Shama's . backroom, Dostana ('Friendship'), was a cheaply-made romantic drama . made in Pakistan about a hero who cannot decide to marry his sweetheart . or his arranged bride. So he 'tests' his brides-to-be to see which is the best, with much of the feature-length film occupied with graphic sex scenes. Horror: A body is removed from the Shama cinema, with a pair of bloodied sandals visible on top of the bag . Cinema: Blood-soaked shoes, caps, condoms and human flesh were reportedly found at the scene . Aftermath: Inside the cinema journalists and police inspect the damage as blood stains the auditorium floor . Deaths: The attack was the second on a cinema in Peshawar in less than two weeks . Rescuers carry one of the bodies out of the cinema after an attacker threw three grenades into the audience . Carnage: People were found dead and bloodied still in their seats in the cinema in northwest Pakistan . Abandoned: A shoe without an owner lies between dust-strewn seats. Most photos are too graphic to publish . Much of the pornography shown at the cinema is in Pashto, the regional language, as was the film reportedly being shown at the time of yesterday's attack. The attack came just nine days after another on the city's Picture House cinema, which killed four people and wounded 31 more, and less than two years after the Shama was burned down and reopened. Islamist extremists see cinemas as an example of sinful indulgence or bowing to Western ideas of entertainment. The fear of being seen in public at the cinema along with the rise of DVDs and downloads means there are almost no cinemas left in Peshawar, once a film capital known half-jokingly as Pollywood. Fewer than 10 remain, and even they are being destroyed by extremists or knocked down and turned into shopping centres. One conservative political party, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), has previously demanded the cinema should be shut down - but its owners, the Bilour family, are influential in the rival Pashtun nationalist ANP party. Some observers point to that as one explanation why the cinema may have defied strict government censorship for so long.

Given the amount of hours that are wasted playing games on phones and tablets, it was only a matter of time before someone put all this game play to good use. Cancer Research UK has teamed up with agency Guerilla Tea to develop a game that will help scientists research faulty genes. Called Play to Cure: Genes in Space, the game is similar to Space Invaders, and as players navigate through the on-screen asteroids they are helping to create new genetic patterns.

Called Play to Cure: Genes in Space, pictured, the game is similar to Space Invaders, and as players navigate through the on-screen asteroids they create new genetic patterns . A computer app for GPs that tells them their patient might have cancer could save hundreds of lives a year. The app, created by the University of Exeter Medical school, costs £50 per surgery and can help doctors diagnose some of the deadliest forms of the disease far more quickly. The app works by recording patients’ symptoms whenever they visit the surgery even if they see a different doctor or nurse and turn up out-of-hours. If a patient has a number of symptoms which could be cancer – but might otherwise be dismissed as harmless – a message flashes up on the doctor’s screen. Researchers believe it could enable up to 3,000 more cases of cancer to . be detected sooner leading to 300 lives saved annually due to earlier . treatment. To create the game, Cancer Research UK collected over two million pieces of data from 2,000 breast cancer patients in the UK and Canada. Travelling in a world set 800 years in the future, players guide a spaceship safely through an intergalactic assault course, gathering along the way a fictional cargo called Element Alpha. Each route that gamers choose to fly the spaceship, and each piece of Element Alpha collected, uses data taken from these cancer patients' genes to create a new genetic pattern. Every time the game is played, these patterns are fed back to scientists who can detect hot spots in faulty genes within these patterns that could be targeted with new treatments. This in turn should help them develop new drugs that target specific genetic faults, and new ways to figure out how to stop cancer developing in the first place. The researchers created the game because there was too much data for a scientists to sift through manually.

A 24-year-old Muslim convert who had been licensed to work as a security guard has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to join Al-Qaeda and lying on a U.S. passport application to aid international terrorism. Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen, who also went by the name Hasan Abu Omar Ghannoum after converting to Islam, was arrested on Friday in Santa Ana while waiting to board a bus to Mexico, the FBI said. Officials said he planned to become a foot soldier for the terrorist group and had spent time in Syria.

In January, Ghannoum wrote: 'I'm doing well in Syria â€¦ having a blast here, and I mean literally.'

The Orange County Register reported Nguyen went to Syria in December after hearing about the civil war. 'He said that he wanted to protect his brothers,' Nguyen's sister, Minh Ngoc Nguyen, said.

With its pretty riverside location and the annual Royal Regatta, Henley-on-Thames has never had much trouble attracting visitors. But the latest ones won’t be welcome – the upmarket town in South Oxfordshire has been invaded by a plague of mutant ‘super-rats’. Carrying a poison-resistant gene, they have been found by researchers on farms and other properties around Henley after previously being identified in parts of Berkshire and Hampshire. The brown rats look the same as  their non-mutant counterparts and, like them, can carry life-threatening diseases, but are resistant to typical pest controls thanks to genetic mutation. Dr Alan Buckle, a research fellow at the University of Reading who carried out the study that found the rats in Henley, said: ‘Rats carry a vast range of diseases, including Weil’s disease. ‘These diseases are very harmful and potentially fatal to both humans and animals.’ Weil’s disease is a water-borne bacterial infection linked to the urine of infected rats. It killed Olympic rowing champion Andy Holmes in 2010. Dr Buckle used new DNA techniques to determine the prevalence of rats with the poison-resistant gene. As well as areas around Henley, they were found in Berkshire near Caversham and Sonning. ‘For 30 years we have been using the same two poisons,’ Dr Buckle said. ‘This has meant that the susceptible rats died and the resistant ones lived and bred. ‘We are now in a situation where the rat poison which pest controllers are legally allowed to use is ineffective, meaning it is becoming harder to control rats.’ Henley-on-Thames, pictured, which hosts the world famous annual Royal Regatta, is the latest place to become host to the creatures after they were found in Berkshire and Hampshire . The Health and Safety Executive is . evaluating whether new poisons should be approved to control rats. However, many animal welfare groups believe that this is not the answer . as poisons, or rodenticides, can be detrimental to wildlife. Jeff Knott, of the RSPB, said: ‘The . risk to wildlife by the use of rodenticides is very real, particularly . to animals which eat rats such as birds of prey and barn owls. ‘Rat control is necessary but the RSPB does not believe that the answer is the licensing of more and more toxic poisons. ‘The more poisons we use, the more . resistant rats will become to them. The answer is firstly prevention and . then other control methods such as trapping and shooting.’ But Richard Moseley, a technical . manager with the British Pest Control Association, said: ‘Tons and tons . of poison are being used to little effect. ‘In terms of the threat to wildlife, . it would be a lot better if new poisons which actually work could be . used as a much smaller amount of them would be needed. ‘Rats are very intelligent and would soon become behaviourally resistant to traps.’ Dr Buckle, whose survey was funded by . nine organisations involved in pest control, said: ‘My view is that we . need to use the stronger poisons but we need to tell people how to use . them carefully. If we can do that we can solve the problem.’ There are thought to be 10.5million . rats in the country. In areas where resistance exists around  70 per . cent carry the rodenticide- resistant gene.","Rats carrying diseases have spread from Berkshire and Hampshire .

Michael Laudrup's future at Swansea City is once again uncertain with elements of the club’s board believed to be keen for him to leave before the end of the season. It has long been assumed within the club that the Dane would leave at the end of this season. But Sportsmail understands there are factions of the club’s hierarchy who would rather see Laudrup leave sooner, with Swansea struggling in the Barclays Premier League. Under the cosh: Sportsmail understands senior board members at Swansea want Michael Laudrup gone . Weak: The Swans were dismal in their defeat at West Ham and Laudrup could go before the end of the season . They were dire in falling 2-0 against West Ham on Saturday and go into the weekend’s south Wales derby against Cardiff City only two points clear of the bottom three. Huw Jenkins told the BBC on Sunday night that the club were not discussing a move to sack the manager – a measure they have not taken since Brian Flynn was dismissed 10 years ago. Furthermore, senior figures at the club believe it is unlikely that such a drastic step would occur. However, the board is extremely unhappy with the team’s performances on the pitch and there are elements who believe a quick change might be necessary to avoid a relegation fight. Not happy: The manager vented his anger at defender Chico Flores after he got Andy Carroll sent off . Trouble: There were serious disagreements at board level over the signing of £12m Wilfried Bony . It is sorry state of affairs for a manager who led Swansea to their first major trophy last season and has guided the team to historic wins at Valencia and Manchester United this season. But he came extremely close to leaving in the summer and the team has struggled enormously to gain any kind of consistency in results or performances in this hectic campaign, in which they have done well to reach the knockout stages of the Europa League. Part of the issues in the summer surrounded Laudrup’s frustration over transfers, in particular suggestions that they sign Marvin Emnes or Kenwyne Jones. He was ultimately backed to sign Wilfried Bony for a record transfer fee of £12million, but Emnes was signed on deadline day on loan from Middlesbrough. Laudrup is currently in Paris on holiday and due back on Tuesday.

The footage uploaded to YouTube shows the pair clutching the skids of a helicopter while downing a bottle of VB each as it hovers several dozen feet above a lake. Neither man is wearing a safety harness and only one is wearing a helmet, which is apparently so that he can mount a camera rather than out of any safety considerations.

Helicopter: The props involved in this particular necknomination stunt may make it a difficult one to beat . It is the wildest 'neknomination' video yet seen after the social media drinking game emerged. The fad encourages participants to film themselves 'necking’ liquor, then nominate a friend to do the same. They then try to outdo each other creating more extreme, disgusting and outlandish videos. Those who refuse to participate risk losing face among their peers. The new video begins with two young men driving in a Ferrari somewhere in the outback and explaining that they have been nominated. They arrive at a farm, where they leap from the sports car and run to a waiting helicopter that is already hovering several feet above the ground. Grabbing hold of its skids, they hang on for dear life as it lifts then into the air and carries them to a nearby lake where a person aboard the aircraft hands them each a bottle of Victoria Bitter. Each man then holds on with just one arm as they both down the bottles of Australian-brewed beer. Finally, they let go of the helicopter and plunge into the waters below.

A species of shark long thought to be extinct has been rediscovered – lying dead on a slab in a Kuwait fish market. The incredibly rare smoothtooth blacktip shark was believed to have died out, with only one new example identified in the last 110 years. But a new survey of fish markets in Kuwait City has turned up a staggering 47 examples of the mysterious shark, and although they were all dead and prepared for eating, scientists think they have collected enough information to prepare a conservation plan. Discovery: The smoothtooth blacktip shark was believed to have died out until scientists began searching Kuwait fish markets (pictured), where they found a staggering 47 examples . Before the Kuwait fish market finds, there were only ever two smoothtooth blacktip sharks positively identified. Although the first was registered as a new species in 1985, it was actually a specimen taken from a collection of dead animals assembled more than 80 years earlier by naturalist Wilhelm Hein during a trip to Yemen. Until 2008, the 1902 fish was the only known smoothtooth blacktip shark, despite scientists scouring Middle Eastern waters for new examples. During a Shark Conservation Society meeting in 2008, a whaler shark described as ‘very similar but different’ to a smoothtooth blacktip shark was unveiled. The rare smoothtooth blacktip shark was registered as a new species in 1985 - although that was actually a specimen from an 83-year-old collection. The 1902 fish was the only known example until the recent finds . Later analysis proved that the fish . actually was a smoothtooth blacktip, but had initially been dismissed . because it had been found in a Kuwait City fish market - 1,800 miles . from where Hein found his. The mysterious fish was actually discovered in a market named ‘Sharq’ – a complete coincidence as the word means east in Arabic. The find led researchers to begin studying fish catches elsewhere in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as in markets around Yemen. After unearthing 47 varieties in Kuwait fish markets alone, the scientists were able to study how they grow, how many pups they can bear and how they most likely use their habitat. Although the shark was relatively common in the markets, it is not considered cast-iron evidence of the smoothtooth blacktip being in rude health. As a result, the studies will now be used to create widespread conservation plans in an effort to increase the population.","Smoothtooth blacktip shark was thought to have died out decades ago .

The innovative trainers - or 'smart shoes' - warn runners if their feet are in the wrong position or if they are simply exhausted via a smartphone app. Scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute . for Photonic Microsystems (IPMS), Germany, said running novices and . those with bad habits, risk twisting or injuring their ankle joints, . pulling ligaments or even breaking bones when they are running on uneven . ground or when they are tired. German scientists worked with five partners to develop a hi-tech running shoe with 'Runsafer' sensors in the sole, which measure the biomechanical data of the athlete and evaluate the runner's form with the help of measurements in real time . If their muscles are not warmed up or a person overestimates their condition, training is often interrupted due to knee pain and pulled or torn muscles, the researchers warned. To combat these problems they worked with five partners to develop a hi-tech running shoe with ‘Runsafer’ sensors in the sole, which measure the biomechanical data of the athlete and evaluate the runner's form with the help of measurements in real time. ‘Pulse-rate watches and chest straps record only vital signs like breathing and heart rate. In contrast, our running shoe medically evaluates and monitors training while jogging,' said Dr Andreas Heinig, a scientist at IPMS. ‘It informs the runner, for example, of incorrect foot position, asymmetric loading, or warns of exhaustion or overload. There has never been a comparable device before,’ he added. Scientists said running novices and those with bad habits, risk twisting or injuring their ankle joints when they are running on uneven ground. To combat the problem they developed their trainers that transmit running performance and recommendations to a runner's smartphone . A recent study found that men who turn to exercise in middle age may be damaging thier health. Known as 'MAMILs' - Middle-Aged Men In Lycra - they exchange nights in front of the TV for frantic sessions on the treadmill in an attempt to get fit, lose weight and reduce the risk of a heart attack. However, an excessive, vigorous and unsupervised exercise routine might not be as healthy as it seems. Emerging science suggests there is a threshold of distance, intensity or duration for even the hardiest fitness fanatic, and overshooting this can have a serious impact, particularly on cardiovascular health. A study presented at the American Academy of Family Physicians found middle-aged men who run marathons are at significantly greater risk of cardiac arrest. The system includes an RF module and batteries as well as accelerometers and GPS systems that record biomechanical signals from the body and as the runner's speed. This information is transmitted via Bluetooth to the runner’s smartphone. The researchers said an app evaluates the data in a split second using unique algorithms to give the runner feedback on their performance in real-time. If they are not performing as well as they might, it also makes suggestions about how they are running or their training pattern. Dr Heinig said: ‘The app could recommend running more slowly, for example, or rolling off the foot differently, suggest seeking a different running surface or stopping if necessary.' The data collected from each run is transferred from the jogger’s smartphone to a website for further processing and display so that a constantly-updated training programme can be created based on personal performance and goals. The scientists said their measurement system can be installed and removed from the soles of shoes and can be charged by placing the trainers on a charger that is included. A prototype of the running shoe and the smartphone app has been made but the researchers are now working on reducing the size of their sensors, which have to be light, waterproof and durable. They believe the smart sports shoe will be available to purchase in 2015, although no price has yet been decided.","Scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems (IPMS) developed the smart shoe to combat risks of ankle damage when running .

The Red Cross still hasn't spent more than a third of the $303million it raised to assist victims of the storm even seven months after Hurricane Sandy ravaged much of the East Coast. The charity organizers say that it isn’t an accident that more than $100million of the funds have been left unspent, saying that their strategy will help address needs that weren't immediately apparent in the disaster's wake. The revelations about the slow spending comes the same day as President Obama is due to meet with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for his second tour of the damaged areas since the storm hit in late October. Now: The Star Jet roller coaster, seen here on May 14, is still in the water in Seaside Heights, New Jersey as it was revealed that the Red Cross has yet to distribute more than $100million in donations . Back together: President Obama arrived in New Jersey on Tuesday morning and was greeted by Governor Christie so that the two could tour the damage . Ready to roll: Even though he has been criticized by members of his party for appearing chummy with the Democratic President, he brushed those slights aside saying he is doing what is best for his constituents . Some disaster relief experts say that's smart planning but others question whether the Red Cross should have acted with more urgency in the weeks after the storm and left long-haul recovery tasks to someone else. Storm victims could have used more help this past winter, said Kathleen McCarthy, director of the Center for the Study of Philanthropy and Civil Society at the City University of New York. 'People were cold. Homes mildewed. There wasn't enough decent housing,' she said. 'Given the lingering despair, it's hard to understand the argument that “We are setting that money aside.”' As Americans open their wallets to assist tornado victims in Oklahoma, the Red Cross is again emerging as one of the most important relief organizations on the ground and also one of the most prodigious fundraisers for victims. As of Thursday, it had raised approximately $15million in donations and pledges for the tornado response, including a $1million gift from NBA star Kevin Durant and numerous $10 donations, pledged via text. The Red Cross was also the No. 1 recipient of donations after Sandy. The organization said it still had $110million remaining from its pool of storm donations as of mid-April, which were the most recent figures available. Red Cross officials pledged that all the money in its Sandy fund will eventually be spent on the storm recovery and not diverted to other disasters or used to support general Red Cross operations. Over the next few months, the Red Cross expects to spend as much as $27million of its remaining Sandy donations on a program providing 'move-in assistance' grants of up to $10,000 to families displaced by the storm. About 2,000 households have been assisted by the program so far, with an additional 4,000 waiting for an eligibility determination. Promoting the Shore: The New Jersey government has spent millions in an advertising campaign and media onslaught in order to promote the Jersey Shore and encourage tourists to visit . Welcoming one and all: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, seen here in Ashbury Park on Sunday, has been extremely vocal in his fight to get the federal government to allocate emergency funds to the area . Part of the delay in spending, officials said, is to wait to see how the hardest-hit states allocate a $60 billion pot of federal relief dollars and address gaps in the government aid package. 'We are waiting to see where the greatest need is going to be over time,' said Josh Lockwood, CEO of the Red Cross Greater New York Region. 'We are more concerned with spending our resources wisely rather than quickly.' Some disaster relief experts said holding funds in reserve was indeed a smart move. Much of the toughest and most expensive relief work after a natural disaster comes not during the initial months but during the long-term rebuilding phase after the public's attention has waned and new donations have stopped flowing, said Patrick Rooney, associate dean at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. 'It would be splashier, perhaps, to spend the money right away while the media is still there and the donors are still looking,' he said. 'But the important needs, from the cost perspective and the recipient perspective, take place after the headlines are gone and after the cameras are gone.' Red Cross officials noted that a year after a tornado killed 158 people in Joplin, Missouri, it found itself providing a new round of mental health services to survivors. Then: The damage to the entire boardwalk and town of Seaside Heights immediately after Superstorm Sandy (seen here on October 31) was widespread, but they have worked hard to make it ready for summer . Up and running: Now the boardwalk and arcades are open (seen here on May 26) in time for Memorial Day weekend as the region depends on tourism for much of its economy . Comforter-in-chief: Both Christie and Obama won praise across the aisles for their bipartisan work on the relief effort . The cholera epidemic that killed thousands of people following a massive earthquake in Haiti, where the Red Cross was also criticized for not spending donations faster, also didn't start until nearly a year after the disaster. The Red Cross says it is planning substantial grants to other nonprofit groups doing Sandy recovery work and is doing much of its current work in conjunction with charitable partners with local ties. Red Cross volunteers working in conjunction with the organizing group New York Cares are going out several days a week to muck and clean flooded homes and remove mold. Red Cross staff and caseworkers have been holding 'unmet needs roundtables' in hard-hit communities, trying to identify victims not covered by traditional aid programs. 'Our experience shows that as the recovery goes on, the needs of survivors will evolve,' said Roger Lowe, Red Cross senior vice president. 'It's important to make sure some money is available for those needs no one can predict right now.' Other organizations that raised large sums for the relief effort have also held back money while they evaluated the wisest way to spend it. The Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund, led by Mary Pat Christie, the wife of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, raised $32million after the storm but didn't begin awarding grants on a large scale until April. So far, it has given about $11million, with the biggest grants going to local organizations building or repairing housing. The United Way, which raised $9.7million in a Sandy recovery fund for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and some parts of Pennsylvania, said it has spent about $4million of that total to date, though another $2.5million is set to go out soon. High profile: Prince Harry's visit to Seaside Heights in mid-May helped bring attention back to the area . 'We always knew, from the very beginning, that our fund and our resources would be for longer-term strategies. We feel good about the timeframe,' said United Way of New York City President Sheena Wright. That strategy of holding some cash to spend later contrasts with the approach taken by the Robin Hood Foundation, which was in charge of distributing more than $70million raised by a December 12 benefit concert by Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones and other music royalty. That fund was depleted entirely by April, with grants given to 400 relief organizations ranging from food banks to legal services to volunteer rebuilding groups. Robin Hood spokeswoman Patty Smith said the foundation moved as fast as it could because it believed that delays in government aid were leaving big gaps in services. Red Cross officials say they have the ability to meet both long-term and short-term needs, noting the organization has served 17 million meals and snacks, distributed 7 million relief items, mobilized 17,000 workers and volunteers, and provided 81,000 overnight stays. Its efforts won over early critics like Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro, who assailed the Red Cross response in the days immediately after the storm but now praises it as having provided vital help. 'They've come a long way since Day One,' Molinaro said.","Charity has kept about a third of all donations, saying that they are earmarking them for longer-term problems that still may not have arisen .

A man whose hand swelled and turned black and yellow after a spider bit him discovered he had been the victim of the UK's most venomous spider - but only when he posted a picture of it on Facebook five weeks later. Alex Michael said his had was still 'swollen like a balloon' after what turned out to be a false widow spider - the British cousin of the lethal black widow - bit him while he was asleep at his home in Blackfen, Kent. He had blood tests and x-rays at both Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong with his hand. Venomous: Alex Michael's hand swelled up after he was bitten by the false black widow spider . It was only when Mr Michael put a photo online of a spider online that friends recognised the dangerous animal. Mr Michael made the connection between the spider and his swollen hand and captured the culprit in a pot to take with him to Darent Valley Hospital in Kent. 'I said I’m going to let this spider go in your office and if it bites you I’m going to follow you to where you get it sorted,' he said. 'Eventually they took it pretty seriously.' Doctors gave him a course of the antibiotic flucloxacillin and within days, the swelling reduced and the pain disappeared. The 2in-long spider, known by experts as Steatoda noblis or 'noble false widow', unleashes a powerful venom when provoked which can kill those who are allergic to it. Wound: Mr Michael's finger remained swollen for weeks and he visited three hospitals for tests and x-rays . Mr Michael, a tattooist, explained he only realised he’d been attacked by a spider when he posted a picture online. He said: 'I I put a picture of the spider on Facebook saying, ""Have I found a new species?"" 'Within minutes people replied saying ""It is dangerous, don’t touch it."" 'I went back to the doctor and he didn’t believe me. He said, ""What website did you get that (picture) off?"" 'I said it was taken in my kitchen. He went online and I saw his face drop. 'He said, ""You could be right about this. It could be a spider bite.""' No deaths have ever been confirmed in the UK from a false widow spider bite. It is thought their numbers have increased in recent years due to milder winters and warmer summers that some put down to global warming. London Wildlife Trust conservation ecologist Tony Wileman said: 'Reports from false widow spider bites have included symptoms like chest pains and a swelling and tingling of the bite area, usually the fingers. 'If bitten then visit A&E, do not ring 999. 'Ideally and if possible the spider should be caught in a jar so it can be identified.' Natural History Museum spider expert Stuart Hine said there have been a lot of sightings of the spiders in recent weeks. He said: 'It's spider season. A lot of species mature in the autumn. When it’s hot and humid, we leave our doors and windows open, and that allows the spiders in.'","Alex Michael bitten by UK's most venomous spider .

At one point they even downed a champagne flute of the liquid live on air, as Holly shielded her eyes with her hands. But viewers took to Twitter to . complain that the segment - aired at 10.50am - was too much for morning TV. One wrote: 'Stomach is churning. Just watched people drink their own urine on This Morning. I physically feel sick. Just want to vomit.' Another said: 'Do you chill it or drink it straight from the tap??

When he met Miss Long two years ago, he introduced her to it - and after finding it relived symptoms of her depression, she has continued with it. The couple now firmly believe the practice is a key part of staying healthy. Mr Dixon told the programme that he'd . started drinking his own urine seven years ago after being 'a naughty . kid' - and noticed the difference straight away. He said: 'I found it balanced my head, things were calmer and I could think clearer.' Miss Long added that when she met him she'd suffered from depression for 10 years and was taking medication for it. Wanting to come off the tablets, Mr .

Happy: Mr Dixon explained he has been drinking a cup or two his own urine every day for seven years after a friend extolled the virtues of it . Doing it together: When Mr Dixon met Miss Long two years ago, he introduced her to 'urine therapy' - and after finding it relived symptoms of her depression, has continued with it . She . said: 'I spoke to people where John works and heard stories about how . they had got better [from doing it] and thought I would try it. 'For the first couple of months I felt happy and bouncy - it worked straight away,' she added. 'If I had forgotten to take a tablet then I would do that instead.' She added that the taste and smell of the urine 'depends on what you've been eating and drinking' - and that it 'definitely wasn't an acquired taste'. Mr Dixon added: 'It smells and tastes like wee - there's not getting around it. But it cleans you out. 'When you carry on doing it, you can taste what food you eat.' This was backed up further after the couple knocked back a shot of their urine live on air - with Mr Dixon declaring he could 'taste the coffee' he had just drunk. Caution: But Dr Ranj Singh (right) warned that 'urine is one of the body's ways of getting rid of stuff - and it could contain toxic byproducts' And when quizzed by an incredulous Holly Willoughby, the couple admitted they tended not to sip the first 'go' of the day, due to it being 'quite strong'. And Dr Ranj Singh cautioned against the practice. He warned: 'It's not necessarily recommended. If you are on medication and you are going to come off it, then it's important to talk to a doctor first. 'Urine is one of the body's ways of getting rid of stuff - and it could contain toxic byproducts. 'Yes, it is sterile in the bladder, but once it leaves the bladder it can come into contact with bacteria. if you drink it, you are re-introducing that bacteria back into the body. Urine therapy is said to date back to the Bible. Historical documents suggest that the Aztecs disinfected wounds with it, while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature. Urine is highly sterile, consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. During the digestive process, the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted. The blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine. But GP Dr Rob Hicks said: 'Over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine, but as far as I'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back-up these claims. 'The kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body doesn't need, so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive. 'Personally, I believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and keeping stress under control.'","Bex Long and John Dixon have been together for two years .

Among those looking to the past was Miss Sweden, who chose a Viking-inspired get-up, which came complete with a sequinned armour-plated bodice and a silver sword. Bizarre though Alexandra Friburg's look was, she at least managed to make an effort which is more than could be said for Miss Denmark who appeared in an insipid blue crop top and skirt combination, that appeared to be inspired by Copenhagen's Little Mermaid Statue.

Warning: David Cameron said that the failure of the eurozone to prop of the single currency threatened the stability of the world economy . The world is ‘staring down the barrel’ of a new economic catastrophe, David Cameron said last night. As panic-selling rocked global stock markets, leading UK companies lost £64billion of their value in the FTSE 100’s worst day since the height of the crisis in spring 2009. The Prime Minister blamed the eurozone and America for the turmoil, saying they must get a grip on their vast debts. In a day of dire economic news: . In London, the FTSE 100 tumbled nearly 5 per cent, closing 246.8 points down at 5041.61. The index has lost 17 per cent of its value since July, wiping nearly £265billion off the value of Britain’s leading firms. Yesterday’s sell-off was the biggest since March 2009 and the 24th worst in history. Mr Cameron, in New York for a meeting of the United Nations, issued a stern rebuke to eurozone leaders, saying their failure to act to prop up the single currency threatened the stability of the world economy. Later, in a speech to the Canadian parliament, the Prime Minister accused his fellow world leaders of lacking the political will to emulate his coalition government’s deficit reduction strategy. Tumbling: The FTSE 100 closed down 246.8 points down at 5041.61 yesterday, with the index losing 17 per cent of its value since July . ‘It’s important that we are clear about . the facts. We are not quite staring down the barrel but the pattern is . clear. Growth in Europe is stalled. Growth in America is stalled,’ he . said. ‘In a global economy, we need every country in the world to show the leadership to address its problems. The problems in the eurozone are now so big that they have begun to threaten the stability of the world economy. ‘While these problems aren’t being solved, while they grow, businesses don’t invest, confidence is sapped in the euro area itself and, increasingly, worldwide also.’ In a TV interview, the Prime Minister added: ‘We’ve got to stop kicking the can down the road. We need decisive action.’ David Cameron and Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper at the Canadian parliament in Ottawa . Mr Cameron addresses a joint session of Parliament as House of Commons Speaker Andrew Scheer looks on . Britain wants German leader Angela Merkel to press the eurozone to stop delaying the bailout of Greece and show the markets she is serious about underwriting the single currency. ‘Eurozone countries must act swiftly to resolve the crisis,’ he said. ‘They must implement what they have agreed and they must demonstrate they have the political will to do what is necessary to ensure the stability of the system. ‘Endlessly putting off what has to be . done doesn’t help, in fact it makes the problem worse, lengthening the . shadow of uncertainty that looms over the world economy. In an unprecedented move he joined . forces with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, and . South Korea to read the riot act to President Barack Obama, the Germans . and the French. Talks: Prior to yesterday's speech to the UN, Mr Cameron held discussions with the General Secretary Ban Ki-moon . The letter, . addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, says: ‘Eurozone . governments and institutions must act swiftly to resolve the euro crisis . and all European economies must confront the debt overhang to prevent . contagion to the wider global economy. ‘The United States, as the world’s largest economy, also has an important role to play in restoring confidence. ‘The U.S., along with other high deficit advanced economies, needs to overcome the remaining hurdles toward restoring medium-term fiscal sustainability.’ Downing Street officials rejected the charge that Mr Cameron was lecturing. ‘This affects us.

Actor Martin Clunes playing Mr Chips in the the classic novel - a surname which is one of 200,000 now extinct . For the schoolmaster of the classic novel, ‘Mr Chips’ was an affectionate nickname. And sadly it seems that’s the only way it will survive. ‘Chips’, once popular in Middlesex and Essex, is one of 200,000 surnames which have disappeared from England and Wales over the past 100 years. Others said to be extinct –  with fewer than five left on the census – include Woodbead, Rummage and Jarsdel. Some very familiar names are also on their way out, according to the research by family history website ancestry.co.uk. The surnames of Helen Mirren, Hugh Bonneville and Bill Nighy are all at risk of vanishing within a couple of generations. In 2001, 50 people or fewer were called Mirren, Nighy or Bonneville. The study compared the prevalence of surnames in that year with the 1901 census. The researchers also compiled a list of the traditional surnames which are dying out the fastest. That was topped by William, which was the 374th most common surname in 1901 but has fallen to 12,500th today. Others include Clegg, Sutcliffe and Kershaw. In some cases the decline is because other names have become more common, particularly Scottish, Irish and foreign surnames. The researchers said many of the names which had vanished since 1901 had been anglicised by their owners. Immigrants coming to Britain would often do this to ‘fit in’ or avoid complications with spelling. A spokesman for ancestry.co.uk said: ‘This trend persists but to a far lesser degree today, accounting for just 6 per cent of current British residents who have changed their names. ‘One famous example of this trend is Helen Mirren, who was born Helen Mironoff before her Russian father changed the family name to Mirren in the 1950s.’ Under threat: The surnames of Helen Mirren, left, and Bill Nighy, right, could be lost in a few generations . The First World War also played a part in ‘wiping out’ some names. The . spokesman added: ‘Unfortunately, when specific battalions suffered mass . casualties during the conflict, whole towns or villages would lose a . generation of young men. In the early 20th century many names were . common, or exclusive, to an area, so such catastrophes could easily wipe . specific surnames off the map.’ The . study also found that people with rarer surnames were typically more . attached to them. This is shown in a recent spike in double-barrelled . names, which were once the preserve of the upper classes. One in 50 Britons now has a hyphenated name, compared with one in 50,000 in 1901. Nearly half of these are preserving a family name. As for Chips, the study found there were 33 of them listed in the 1901 census, and fewer than five in 2001. The real name of fictional Latin master Mr Chips, who appeared in a 1934 novel by James Hilton and a film of the book five years later, was Mr Chipping. But according to the study, that is on the way out too. - Chicken-Fish and Pickywickywoowoo are among the most ‘creative’ names owners give their pets, according to a poll by Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. Dog names in the top 20 include Chicken-Fish, Toe-Jam and Mr Terry Foxer, while cat names include Pickywickywoowoo, Princess Maisie Dolores and Strawberry Surprise.","Many familiar surnames have died out since 1901 .

An army medic who developed a potentially fatal illness after being exposed to uranium in Iraq has just weeks left to raise the £100,000 she needs to pay for life-saving treatment. Katrina Brown, 31, was exposed to depleted uranium while treating injured comrades at a field hospital in 2003. After years of failing health she was diagnosed with a debilitating immune disorder which is so rare that neither the NHS nor the MoD offer life-saving treat sufferers. Doctors in America told the army wife . she could have pioneering treatment in Chicago to reboot her immune . system, but the life-saving procedure would cost a whopping £100,000. Katrina Brown developed an autoimmune disease after being exposed to uranium in Iraq in 2003. Life-saving treatment is not available in the UK so she is having to raise £100,000 to pay for treatment in the U.S. Mrs Brown has been forced to book the stem cell procedure for next month despite still needing to raise the final £25,000 because doctors have told her time is running out. Mrs Brown, from South Cerney, Gloucestershire, said: ‘It is not as if I’m asking for something like a swim with the dolphins to make me happy. ‘I am going to die without this treatment. ‘I’ve got to the point where I am about £25,000 short of the target but have gone for it. ‘It’s sort of now or never anyway, because I’ve been told it will be too late for treatment if it’s left any longer. ‘I’ve booked the treatment, although I have not paid for it.’ She . added: ‘It involves taking my stem cells and giving them a massive . blast of chemotherapy, and then replacing them and sort of tricking the . immune system into thinking there is nothing wrong, like a reboot of the . whole thing. She has already raised £75,000 but is running out of time to raise the remaining £25,000 because her health is deteriorating . ‘It can potentially kill me - I’ll be left with literally no immune system. I know that, but I don’t have much choice. ‘But I’ve seen the other people who’ve had what I have and they’ve had the treatment, and they are a real inspiration. It’s a recognised treatment over there, which the medical insurers in America are prepared to pay for.’ Mrs Brown thinks she was exposed to the highly poisonous material - used to increase the penetrative power of bombs and bullets - when she was sent to a derelict airstrip called Shaibah, seven miles from Basra. It contained dumped tanks blown up by uranium-enhanced weapons in the 1991 war. Before flying home she was handed a white plastic card by Army officials saying she could have been exposed to dust containing depleted uranium during her deployment and should inform her GP. But the young medic feared it would be put on her medical records and could possibly stop her getting life insurance or a mortgage. Four years later, she visited her doctors because she was feeling constantly cold and numb, with aches and pains all over her body. She was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis - the rare autoimmune disorder causes abnormal growth of the connective tissue. This causes vascular damage and hardening of the internal organs, preventing them working properly. Symptoms include dry skin, swelling of the fingers and toes, tiredness, weight loss, muscle pain, joint pain, heartburn, bloating, coughing, dizziness and breathlessness. Mrs Brown said: 'Since I was . diagnosed, everything's been a battle - as well as battling the illness . I've been fighting to try and access the right treatment. 'Now we've been offered this ray of light but obviously we need help to raise the money. 'I've . lost about 90 per cent of my mobility and the longer I live with the . illness, the more I'm deteriorating physically, but I know I can't give . up.' Mrs Brown . travelled to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago - the world’s . leading treatment centre which is filled with U.S. Army veterans - in . October 2012. Mrs Brown needs treatment which would see her stem cells blasted with chemotherapy to reboot her immune system by tricking her body into thinking she is well. Without it she will not survive . Doctors told her the condition would eventually kill - probably in around a year - unless she has the £100,000 treatment which would see her stem cells blasted with chemotherapy to reboot her immune system by tricking her body into thinking she is well. Her family, friends and husband, Martin, have raised around £75,000 - but desperately need the final cash before time runs out. She said: ‘It took a year before that to raise the £20,000 to get me to Chicago and have the tests in the first place, so I didn’t think it was possible to raise £100,000. ‘When I came back from America I was thinking it was such a short space of time to raise a huge amount of money and I didn’t know how we were going to do it. ‘I wasn’t expecting this kind of response at all, it’s overwhelming and amazing.’ She is planning to open a pop-up shop to sell some her belongings to trying and reach her final goal. ‘I am literally going to sell everything I own,’ she said.

The man who founded Poundland in 1990 has revealed plans for an online store where everything costs £1. Steve Smith, who sold his share of Poundland for £50million in 2002, believes he can make the idea work on the web. The businessman, who sold his share of Poundland for nearly £50m in 2002, however could face competition from his former business, which is also reportedly preparing to open a website. Poundland founder Steve Smith is planning to open the UK's first online single-price retailer - Poundshop.com . Business: Mr Smith, pictured, sold his share of Poundland in 2002 for nearly £50m after opening his first store in 1990 . The 51-year-old told Retail Week customers would have to pay a delivery cost of about £3, which he compared to transport and parking costs for high street shoppers. He said: 'People are used to delivery costs. My challenge is to make sure it works out cheaply for the customer.' According to reports, Mr Smith had thought about a £42 minimum order value for customers, but this is likely to reduced to about £23 following market research. He is also considering a 'click-and-collect' system which would allow customers to pick up their goods at other stores and shopping centres. Mr Smith told The Times the business may not immediately make a profit. He said: 'The first few years we didn't . make any money at Poundland. It's a bit like this. I suppose I'm the one . person who can make it work.' Smith opened his first Poundland store in 1990 with the help of a £50,000 loan from his father and sold his share for nearly £50m in 2002 . Mr Smith came up with the idea for Poundland after selling items which had lost their packaging for 10p in his first discount shop which he opened in West Bromwich at the age of 16. He managed to convince a shopping centre in Burton upon Trent to open a store in December 1990 and £13,000 of stock was sold on the first day. By the time he sold the business it had a million customers a week and 6,000 people were employed by the company. Mr Smith now finds himself living in a luxury mansion with his family while also owning homes in Florida and Majorca. Despite having enough money in the bank to retire, Mr Smith didn't want to stop working just yet and has launched a number of other businesses including one which offers investment loans to other entrepreneurs waiting for a lucky break. Poundland now has 460 stores in the UK and is the biggest bargain basement chain in Europe. A typical shop contains more than 3,000 different products with a wealth of brand names including Heinz, Pepsi, Nivea, Thorntons and Simple. Earlier this month the Daily Mail reported how of its 4.5 million savvy shoppers, one in five is a middle-class professional.","Businessman Steve Smith has bought the internet domain Poundshop.com .

As fans of political thriller 'House of Cards' settled in to watch season two's premiere tonight, real-life politicians were rehearsing their lines. Now This News recruited members of Congress to deliver lines originally spoken by power-hungry character Francis J. Underwood, played by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, in the hit Netflix series. But if you thought chilling comments uttered by a malicious - but fictional - character were unsettling, just wait until you hear them repeated by people with real power. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Kevin Spacey plays the cut-throat politician Frank Underwood in hit Netflix series 'House of Cards' The popular program charts the Democratic congressman and House Majority Whip's highly intricate plan to disgrace his enemies and obtain a cabinet position after the President goes back on his promise to appoint him Secretary of State. Underwood's vengeful plotting and deep-rooted corruption has attracted the ire of some politicians - and the adoration of others. This News producer Ashley Codianni targeted six political representatives - three Democrat and three Republican - who are fans of the show to deliver some of Underwood's most memorable quotes. But, she told USA Today, it wasn't easy: 'It was particularly difficult to get members to participate.' Majority Whip, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), opens the clip with the poignant: 'I never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn.' Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (D-SC) means business when he says, 'I have no patience for useless things,' while Trey Gowdy (D-SC) gets into character with a sharp, 'I have zero tolerance for betrayal.' Cold-hearted: Rep Jeff Duncan (R-SC) nails Underwood's comment to his chief of staff, Doug Stamper, 'That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time' Quiet achiever: Underwood's chief of staff Doug Stamper (pictured), played by Michael Kelly, is a vital cog in his boss's malicious machine . Majority Whip: Just like Underwood, who speaks directly to the camera, Rep Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) puts his call on hold to say, 'I never make such big decisions so long after sunset and so far from dawn' The lines get increasingly chilling, including Donna Edwards' (D-Md.) deadpan, 'Power is a lot like real estate. Location, location, location.' Repeating a line Underwood originally directed to his chief of staff, Doug Stamper, politician Jeff Duncan (R-SC) quotes: 'That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time.' And to end, Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) repeats this doozy, initially directed to White House chief of staff Linda Vasquez: 'The nature of promises, Linda, is that they are immune, IMMUNE, to changing circumstances.' The plot: 'House of Cards' documents Frank Underwood's fury at being betrayed by President Garrett Walker and how, with his equally malicious wife, Claire, seek to exact revenge and ultimately gain power . Tough: Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) (left) repeats one of Underwood's most scathing lines to White House Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (right), 'The nature of promises, Linda, is that they are immune, IMMUNE, to changing circumstances' Direct: Adopting the typical Underwood stance, Rep Trey Gowdy (D-SC) declares, 'I have zero tolerance for betrayal' Participating: Channeling Democrat representative Frank Underwood, real-life Democrats Jim Clyburn (left) and Donna Edwards (right) repeated some of his killer lines with aplomb . Meanwhile, Spacey said he's heard from politicians that his portrayal of Underwood is relatively accurate. 'I've had politicians say it's very accurate, probably closer to the truth. I've had others say it's cynical and unrealistic. It depends on your perspective,' he told USA Today. 'I was surprised that Kevin McCarthy said publicly something he said to me privately: 'If I could just kill one member of Congress, I'd never have to worry about another vote'.'

It sounds like the plot of a science fiction film, but US researchers have revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching Earth with nuclear weapons. The Iowa team outlined their vision at a Nasa conference, and say they would need just a weeks notice to launch if the system were developed. It sends a small projectile to create a crater on the asteroid surface, then milliseconds later a nuclear warhead which detonates inside it. How it would work: The HAIV system sends a small projectile to create a crater on the asteroid surface, then milliseconds later a nuclear warhead which detonates inside it. Called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, or HAIV, the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space.It consists of a fore body (a leader spacecraft), which would hit the comet and create blast crater. Around a millisecond later, an aft body (a follower spacecraft) carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times. 'We have the solution, using our baseline concept, to be able to mitigate the asteroid-impact threat, with any range of warning,' Bong Wie, of Iowa State University at the 2014 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) meeting at Stanford University, according to space.com. He said the previously undetected 65-foot-wide (20 meters) space rock that detonated in the skies above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, injuring 1,500 people a year ago has helped the cause to create asteroid busting technologies. 'A couple of years ago, I had to use the dinosaur example to justify our research,' he said, referring to the asteroid impact that wiped out the giant reptiles 65 million years ago. 'Now, that's no more — we had this major event.' Nasa has previously backed the project. 'Despite the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear disruption approach, disruption can become an effective strategy if most fragments disperse at speeds in excess of the escape velocity of an asteroid so that a very small number of fragments impacts the Earth,' Nasa said. Bruce Willis in Armageddon, where a nuclear bomb was detonated on an asteroid to save Earth. Now researchers believe the scheme might actually work . Experts say the project could be ready within a week - and would launch 24 hours before detonation occured . 'It offers a potential breakthrough or great leap in mission capabilities for mitigating the impact threat of near-Earth objects.' Called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, or HAIV, the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space. 'The proposed HAIV system consists of a fore body (a leader spacecraft) to provide proper kinetic-energy impact crater conditions for an aft body (a follower spacecraft) carrying nuclear explosives,' explained Nasa.

Detonating the bomb inside a crater increases its effectiveness by 20 times, the team believes. The nuclear bomb would follow one millisecond behind, hopefully shattered the asteroid. Each mission would cost around $500m, it is believed.","Experts say system could blast an asteroid with just a weeks notice .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:37 EST, 14 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:52 EST, 14 February 2014 . The lawyer tapped to investigate allegations of workplace misconduct within the Miami Dolphins organization that led to former offensive tackle Jonathan Martin's quitting the team has released his independent report on the allegations and found that at least three players - including shamed guard Richie Incognito - harassed not only Martin, but several other players on the team. The investigation was conducted by attorney Ted Wells, who is the co-chair of the litigation department at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, and was retained by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in November to look into the allegations of harassment - that in many cases was racially charged - against Incognito that Martin claims caused him to leave the team mid-season. Bullied: An investigation found that Richie Incognito (left) engaged in a 'pattern of harassment' against teammate Jonathan Martin (right) 'Bully': Offensive lineman John Jerry also is accused of harassing Martin and others in the Miami Dolphins organization . Harassment: Mike Pouncey (pictured), Richie Incognito and John Jerry engaged in a 'pattern of harassment' against Martin and others . Wells' report indicates that he agrees with Martin's claim that the endless harassment is what caused him to leave the team, and that it wasn't just Incognito who was responsible for the abuse, but several members of the team. 'The report concludes that three starters on the Dolphins offensive line, . Richie Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, engaged in a pattern of . harassment directed at not only Jonathan Martin, but also another young . Dolphins offensive lineman and an assistant trainer,' Wells writes in his report. The harassment of the trainer and others was often derogatory towards homosexuals and in many cases racist. He goes on to write that 'the Report finds . that the assistant trainer repeatedly was the object of racial slurs and . other racially derogatory language; that the other offensive lineman . was subjected to homophobic name-calling and improper physical touching; . and that Martin was taunted on a persistent basis with sexually . explicit remarks about his sister and his mother and at times ridiculed . with racial insults and other offensive comments.' The harassment of the trainer and others was often derogatory towards homosexuals and in many cases racist. Investigation: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ordered an investigation of the Dolphins after Martin quit the team in October . Investigation: Attorney Ted Wells was hired by the NFL to conduct an independent investigation into the Miami Dolphins . -April 23, 2013Martin writes his mother: 'I'm a push over, a people pleaser. I avoid confrontation whenever I can, I always want everyone to like me. I let people talk about me, say anything to my face, and I just take it, laugh it off, even when I know they are intentionally trying to disrespect me. I mostly blame the soft schools I went to, which fostered within me a feeling that I'm a huge p****, as I never got into fights. I used to get verbally bullied every day in middle school and high school, by kids that are half my size. I would never fight back, just get sad & feel like no one wanted to be my friend, when in fact I was just being socially awkward. Most people in that situation are witty & quick with sarcastic replies, I never have been. I'm awkward around people a lot of the time because I simply don't know how to act around them.' -April 29, 2013, Martin writes his father: 'People call me a Nigger to my face. Happened 2 days ago. And I laughed it off. Because I am too nice of a person. They say terrible things about my sister. I don't do anything. I suppose it's white private school conditioning, turning the other cheek.' -May 5, 2013, Martin writes his mother: 'I'm never gonna change. I got punked again today. Like a little b****. And I never do anything about it. I was sobbing in a rented yacht bathroom earlier. -January, 2013, Martin writes his mother: 'I have really severe depression. There are many instances where I can't get out of bed. . . . I'm really embarrassed to talk about it with anyone in person, I tried to with you when I was home but I couldn't do it. I've managed to keep it under control for the most part on my own. Anyways, I really do wanna take care of it, because it is debilitating & keeps me from reaching my potential in all facets of life.' -May 28, 2013: Martin writes his mother: 'I just don't really see the point in things. It's a major accomplishment for me if I brush my teeth or eat more than 1 meal in a day on off days. It's not that I'm sad, just unmotivated.' Martin, a Stanford standout in his second season with the Dolphins, left the team in October citing 'emotional' reasons. It was later revealed that Incognito and other players created a 'culture' of harassment in the Dolphins' locker room, and that Martin often was the target. Incognito - considered one of the NFL's 'dirtiest' players - claimed his alleged harassment of Martin was all in good fun, and that Martin was exaggerating the claims of verbal abuse. Wells' report, however, finds that Martin's claims are genuine - and that they were the primary reason he left the team. 'The Report rejects any suggestion that Martin manufactured claims of . abuse after the fact to cover up an impetuous decision to leave the . team. Contemporaneous text messages that Martin sent to his parents and . others months before he left the Dolphins — which have never before been . made public — corroborate his account that the persistent harassment by . his teammates caused him significant emotional distress,' Wells writes in his report. In many of the messages Martin wrote to his family he describes being depressed because people think he's 'soft,' or a 'pushover' who lets people walk all over him. 'I care about my legacy as a professional athlete. But I'm miserable currently. A therapist & medication won't help me gain the respect of my teammates. I really don't know what to do Mom,' Martin wrote to his mother in an email on April 2013. However, Wells found that it was not the other players' intention to make Martin quit. 'Martin’s teammates did not intend to drive Martin from the team or cause him lasting emotional injury,' Wells writes. Wells concludes that, 'in short, the . treatment of Martin and others in the Miami Dolphins organization at . times was offensive and unacceptable in any environment, including the . world professional football players inhabit. A young football player who . has the skills to play at the highest level, and who also happens to be . quiet and reserved, should have the opportunity to pursue a career in . the NFL without being subjected to harassment from his teammates.' Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross issued a statement addressing Wells' report. 'We . have just received the report from Ted Wells and will review it in . detail before responding relative to the findings. When we asked the NFL . to conduct this independent review, we felt it was important to take a . step back and thoroughly research these serious allegations. As an . organization, we are committed to a culture of team-first accountability . and respect for one another,' Ross said in the statement. Incognito also has responded to the report through his attorney, Marc Schamel. 'Mr. Wells' NFL report is replete with errors. The facts do not support a conclusion that Jonathan Martin's mental health, drug use, or on field performance issues were related to the treatment by his teammates,' Schamel says in a statement. 'It is disappointing that Mr. Wells would have gotten it so wrong, but not surprising.  The truth, as reported by the Dolphins players and as shown by the evidence, is that Jonathan Martin was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins Offensive line,' he continues. We are analyzing the entire report and will release a thorough analysis as soon as it is ready.' 'Goon': Incognito is widely considered one of the 'dirtiest' players in the National Football League . Bullied: Martin wrote in several messages to his parents that he's 'too nice' and a pushover, which made him a target for harassment .","The report found that John Jerry and Mike Pouncey also bullied Martin .

The relationship soon became sexual, including encounters in the school bathroom. But when the girl's parents' learned of the relationship in May 2013, they contacted authorities, who arrested Hunt. She was released on bail after 24 hours in the local jail on the condition she did not have any more contact with the younger girl. She was charged with two counts of lewd or lascivious battery of a child - although her parents argued the courts and the younger girl's family were only pressing charges because of anti-gay bias.

Speaking to News Channel 5, she expressed regret that she had never had the chance to speak to her ex-girlfriend's parents about their relationship before the arrest. 'I would have respected their wishes and I would have sat down with them and had a conversation with them and it would have been different,' she said. However she said she did not think the girl's parents deserved an apology from her.","Kaitlyn Hunt was 18 when she was arrested last year for her sexual relationship with a fellow high school student, who was 14 .

The search for a missing Hawaiian woman who is five months pregnant continues after her pet dog was found 20 miles from where her friends found her burned out, abandoned car Wednesday evening on the island of Maui. Carly Scott, 26, was last seen Sunday night when she drove to mile marker 20 on the Hana Highway to pick up Steve Capobianco, her ex-boyfriend and father of her unborn child, who was stuck in Hana, near the eastern shore of the island. Capobianco told authorities that his truck had broken down and he called his on-again off-again girlfriend to help him. Missing: Carly Scott, 26, hasn't been seen since Sunday when she helped her ex-boyfriend fix his car . 'She picked me up from my house at 8:30, drove out to my truck that I got stuck in Keanae and she dropped me off at my truck -- it took me about 10 minutes to fix my truck, 'cause I had extra light tools with me at that time,' Capobianco said in an exclusive interview with Hawaii News Now. 'And then we came back to Haiku. And I'm pretty sure I saw her lights in my rearview the entire time.' Capobianco says he went home and went to bed and didn't check to see whether Scott until the following morning. She never got back to him. The following day, Tuesday, Capobianco says he was awoken about 5:30 a.m. by police knocking on his door. They told him Scott's family had reported her missing and had given them his name. Capobianco admits he didn't have the greatest relationship with the family of his unborn baby's mother. Capobianco says he went to the police station and was interrogated by detectives investigating Scott's disappearance. He also says he was given a lie detector test. 'The Police told me I failed,' Capobianco says. 'They didn't make me take it again. I'm honestly not convinced I failed, I think they might have just said that as a tactic, but I really don't know - I'm walking around right now without handcuffs on.' Burned: Scotts car was found burned out and on its side several days after her disappearance . Capobianco says he knows he is 'undeniably probably the prime suspect,' but maintains that he did nothing to harm Scott, nor does he know where she is. On Tuesday, Scott's pit bull, Nala, was found  at the Nahiku Marketplace along the Hana Highway. 'She . was uninjured, unmarked,' Carly's mother, Kimberly Scott, told the station, '(Nala) was remarkably clean.' The following day, friends of the missing woman - 'searching on a hunch' - found Scotts car 'on its side and part of it was burned,' at the top of Jaws surf break, a popular surf spot near Capobianco's home that is made up of mostly dirt roads and is littered with abandoned cars. 'Peahi is a pretty bad notorious area for people who steal cars to go and ditch them,' he says. However, there was no sign of Scott. 'There is absolutely no reason that Charli would have taken her car out . there alone,' her mother said 'It's a party place. Charli is five . and a half months pregnant, as a girl you just don't go out there alone . and Nala wasn't with her.' Mystery: Scott's burned out car was found in a remote area near the home of her ex-boyfriend . After finding the abandoned car, Kimberly Scott says she has 'every worst nightmare running through my head' but vows to continue the search for her missing daughter. 'Don't give up looking for her.

From the period drama settings of Downton Abbey and Pride and Prejudice to the reality TV location of Made In Chelsea or the sedate and serene backdrop of Bake Off, couples looking to say ‘I do’ can now follow in the footsteps of small and silver screen stars for their big day. From the elegant Orangery at Goldney Hall in Bristol, which was recently the set of Dr Watson’s eventful wedding in Sherlock, to Clandon Park in Surrey which was home to Keira Knightley in The Duchess, these are just some of the locations available to hire to provide the ‘wow factor’. According to a recent survey, church weddings are on the decline with only 35 percent taking place in this traditional venue. Scroll down for video . Sherlock: Bristol's Goldney Hall was the backdrop for Watson's wedding, and can be hired for £2,000 . Goldney Hall in Clifton, Bristol, boast traditional English architecture as well as the chance to recreate Watson's wedding . The Old Royal Naval College, in Greenwhich, London, is available to rent for £92 per person . Skyfall: The College was also used to host the funerals of spies killed in the latest Bond movie . In comparison zoos, lighthouses, boats or eco-houses are all alternative locations that have gained popularity in recent years. Now, You & Your Wedding Venue Finder which currently has details of 1,000 wedding venues, has compiled a top ten list of TV and film locations which can be hired for a wedding. Yesterday romance expert Tiffany Wright, 33, who co-runs the UK’s only proposal planning agency, said she was not surprised they have become popular choices for weddings. The cast of Made In Chelsea often head to the Bluebird on Kings Road to chat about their complex love lives . To add a touch of Chelsea class to your big day, why not rent the Bluebird for £55 per person? Downton: You could have the run of Mrs Crawley's residence, Hall Place in Berkshire, for £6,000 . Miss Wright said: ‘We have a lot of clients who want to propose at popular TV and film locations and it does not surprise me that they are also popular for weddings. ‘I think it’s to do with the glamour behind it. Everyone wants to feel like a celebrity these days. Weddings are becoming bigger and more extravagant and many take place abroad now. 'Choosing a film or TV location can give it the ‘wow factor’ and it’s not just important for the bride and groom but also for the wedding guests. Notting Hill: The Ritz, which featured in the 1999 Hugh Grant film, offers a dinner package starting at £250 each . The Great British Bake Off takes place in tents in the grounds of Valentine's Mansion in Essex . Bake Off: The ground of Valentine's Mansion in Essex provide the backdrop to The Great British Bake Off and can be yours for just £2,000 . 'If they are stepping into a world that they have seen on TV or film it adds an element of excitement. And so it’s not just an average wedding that they’ve been to a million times before.’ In recent years the Church of England has considered allowing couples to have ‘Posh and Becks’ weddings as part of a drive to raise the popularity of its marriage services. Brides and grooms may be allowed to introduce pop music into church weddings or to stage extravagant ceremonies, for example brides passing through the church doors on horseback. Pride and Prejudice: The BBC chose Brocket Hall as the location to film the Netherfield ball, and you can chose it too, for the price of £15,000 . Brocket Hall features in the iconic Pride and Prejudice which turned Colin Firth into a sex symbol . The Duchess: Clandon Park, Surrey, was home to Georgiana Cavendish, played by Kiera Knightley in the 2008 film. It can also be rented for £3,000 . Churches may also allow photographers and cameramen to film during the service, a practice traditionally frowned upon. The initiative, dubbed the Posh and Becks scheme after the celebrity couple were married on golden thrones more than a decade ago - has been produced by a Church committee in the past anxious to build on an improvement in numbers of CofE marriages in recent years. Examples of customised wedding ceremonies suggested to vicars include biker weddings, where leatherclad couples may be brought to the church on vintage motorcycles. Elizabeth: Royal Leeds Castle, Kent, which featured in the 1998 film, will cost around £200 per head . Harry Potter: As muggles can't get to platform nine and three-quarters, why not celebrate at Searcy's Champagne Bar in the station, which costs £60 per head . Church weddings had been declining in popularity since before 2010, when CofE marriage numbers increased by 4 per cent to nearly 55,000. The increase followed legal reforms which have allowed couples a much greater choice over the church in which they can have their wedding, and an easing of restrictions of the marriage of divorcees in church.","Whether you're a fan of Notting Hill, The Duchess, or even The Great British Bake Off, there is a wedding venue out there to suit your needs .

Sir Cliff Richard has been chosen as an unlikely co-star for singer Morrissey in a major U.S. show – but admitted he initially thought it was a wind-up. The 73-year-old confessed to searching for the ex-Smiths frontman on Google because he could not name any of his hits. The unusual combination is one of two shows Morrissey has lined up with veteran pop knights, the other being with Sir Tom Jones in Los Angeles. English singer Steven Patrick Morrissey has had many hits, but Sir Cliff admitted he would struggle to name them . Sir Cliff told BBC Radio 5Live yesterday: ‘I said, “My initial answer is yes but can you check it’s not a joke? Is there an ulterior motive?” [My manager] got hold of Morrissey’s management and he said, “No, Morrissey’s a fan and he’d like you to be there.” So I said yes please. ‘The chances of me singing for 15,000 people in New York are pretty well nil … So I thought it would be great.’ Sir Cliff admitted he would struggle to name Morrissey’s hits. “I couldn’t tell you the titles. I’ve just googled him to see what kinds of crowds he plays to and what sort of show he did. I’m thinking, okay, it looks like a pop-rock show,” he said. Morrissey is renowned for his hatred of meat and has at times insisted on it being banned in the vicinity of some performances, even walking off stage at the smell of burgers. The combination is one of two shows Morrissey has lined up with veteran pop knights, the other being with Sir Tom Jones in Los Angeles . But Sir Cliff, 73, appeared to underestimate Morrissey’s conviction. He said: 'I like to think he might eat some meat when I arrive, but I wouldn’t expect him to. So I don’t think he’d expect me to be vegetarian. 'If I found he was offended by people eating meat then I won’t eat it in front of him. But I’ll have a chicken curry afterwards.' Asked about his set list for the night, he said: 'I’m going to cut my show down to the best one-hour segment I can make it. 'I’ve had hits in the States. I did have two songs in the top 10 - Devil Woman and We Don’t Talk Any More. They will have heard of Wired For Sound. They know Suddenly, which I sang with Olivia [Newton John]. I’m just going to make it really difficult for Morrissey to follow me. He went on: 'People don’t know me in America. That’s why I had no problem saying yes. If Morrissey asked me to support him in England, I’d question it greatly. I’d say, ""You can have the first half and I’ll have the second half."" 'But this is a different world. I’ve had nine top 30 hit singles [in the US] but I have no identification out there. All I can say is ""Thank you Patrick, or Morrissey"" - I’m not quite sure how to refer to him - and I’m so grateful that he’s thought of having me on the show. I’d love to play to 15,000 people in the States and now I will.' Morrissey - whose Christian name is actually Steven, although his middle name is Patrick - is playing a series of dates in the U.S. This is not the first time Morrissey has teamed up with a 1960s chart star. In 1984 The Smiths duetted with Sandie Shaw on a new version of their debut single Hand In Glove which made the top 30.","It is one of two .

As always with Marchesa, the garments were couture-like in their construction. A crystal-and-ribbon-embroidered cocktail dress of cream wool - so fine it was almost transparent - seemed to float rather than hang on the model. Heavily-embellished dresses were draped with the world's most lavish argyle-knit 'cardigans', amped-up with fox fur, ostrich feathers - and of course plenty more of that intricate beading. The cocktail numbers were largely inspired by the kilt and flashed sexy glimpses of leg. There was even a pair of lace-up trousers - a rarity for Marchesa, which specializes in statement dresses.

Brett Jones was used to making tough dives and dropping into dangerous territories as a Navy SEAL but his most harrowing mission came when he left a message for his boyfriend . A former Navy SEAL has revealed how by accidentally ending a voicemail to his boyfriend by saying 'I love you' led to the end of his military career. Brett Jones was a part of the elite military unit nearly a decade before the 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy was lifted, allowing military servicemen and women to serve while being open about their sexuality. In 2002, Jones had just returned from his second deployment and on the morning after his welcome home party, Jones called the fellow Navy serviceman who threw him the party. Jones left a voicemail thanking the . man- who he had secretly been dating- and accidentally said 'I love you' at the end of the message. When the man got home and listened to the message, a female colleague was in the room with him. That woman reported what she heard to her superior and it worked its way up the chain-of-command. 'That was all it took for the Navy to launch a full-scale investigation that lasted for months,' Jones told ABC News. At . the end of the investigation, the Navy evidentally didn't like what . they found because they pulled his security clearance and 'treated me . like I was a criminal,' Jones said. 'It was one of the most difficult times of my life...It was so damn humiliating,' he told ABC. On the outs: After a colleague of his boyfriend's overheard a private message, she told her superiors and he became the subject of a months-long investigation . The Navy honorably discharged Jones in 2003 and a spokesman would not comment on his allegations about the investigation. Jones recently penned an essay about his time in the Navy SEALs for SOFREP, a site dedicated to military news and stories that takes its name from the code for Special Operations Forces Sitations. He wrote how he reluctantly spun a web of lies to keep his brothers-in-arms from finding out about his social life. He recalled an instance when he got a call from a man named Mike who he had met the night before at a gay bar, and how he desperately wanted to see the man again but would have to come up with multiple excuses to keep it from his peers. 'I absolutely hated it when I did that,' he said of lying to the other SEALs in his company. 'Second, I was going to lie to Mike, because there is no way in hell I was going to tell him truthfully what I did and who I worked for. I’m not proud of the lies, but living under the rule of DADT left me few options in such a small close-knit community.' Support: Jones was honorably discharged in June 2003 but said that the majority of his fellow SEALs were supportive of him during that difficult time . Mr Jones' is not the first to go through such hurdles in order to keep two parts of his life- his sexuality and his service- separate from one another. The 2011 repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell made it legally safer for military servicemen and women to serve openly, but he said that the majority of the Navy SEALs from his company were supportive of him. 'Eventually, I was forced out of the closet to my SEAL team, and I discovered that it was not as bad as I had made it in my mind. Sure, there were guys who would whisper and talk behind my back, but overall my SEAL brothers supported me. For that, I will always be thankful,' Jones wrote. 'It was because of that support, from my brothers, that I could proudly say, “My name is Brett Jones, I am a Navy SEAL, and I am gay.”'","Brett Jones was a Navy SEAL nearly a decade before the 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy was revoked in 2011 .

American Idol host Ryan Seacrest plans to launch a men’s clothing line at Macy’s just in time for fall shopping. Mr Seacrest, 39, has named his line Ryan Seacrest Distinction. It aims to offer men affordable suits with a built-in color coordination system for those that find it difficult to dress themselves. Items will range from $45 for belts to $550 for a suit, reports The Wall Street Journal. Man and his suit: Ryan Seacrest's signature suit style has led him to create a range of men's clothing called Ryan Seacrest Distinction . Mr Seacrest says that when helping design the label, he considered how many men only buy suits for a special occasion, and how their price point is often detrimental to looking good. ‘I had in mind the first time I walked into the Fox offices to audition to host. I didn’t have the means to buy an expensive suit but I wanted to look the part,’ Mr Seacrest told the paper. The television host admits, though, that he does not consider himself a fashion designer. ‘I’m not a designer, nor do I think I am. I see an opportunity to help curate these different pieces for guys at an accessible level,’ he said. In creating the label, Mr Seacrest was determined to only produce color ways and designs that he would wear himself. This dedication was welcomed by the brand’s producer Randa Accessories, which long researched celebrities’ effect on menswear culture before even approaching Mr Seacrest. According to the paper, Randa executives spent one year researching how frequently people searched the web for Mr Seacrest’s fashion in relation to other celebrities. Unexpected influence: When researching which celebrity to work with, Randa Accessories discovered that Mr Seacrest is a well-respected fashion icon among men . Keeping ties: While Mr Seacrest (here pictured with John Legend at last month's Grammy Awards) has a strong red carpet relationship with Burberry, he says that he will start mixing his own label into his public appearance wardrobe . They considered personalities including Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon before deciding that Mr Seacrest’s influence was greater, and longer-lasting. Macy’s will launch Ryan Seacrest Distinction in 150 of its stores by fall, and will be the line’s exclusive retailer for at least one year. The label is accompanied by a system named ‘Style made Smart’ which manifests itself in a collection of numbered tags that adorn each garment. The numbers, which run from one to four, help men easily discover which designs live within the same color category. Therefore, all of the clothes in 'group one' will coordinate. Advice will be provided on which numbers can be mixed with each other as well. Mr Seacrest, who is known for consistently wearing Burberry on-air, says that he will start to wear items from his own label while also maintaining his relationship with the English brand. ‘I’m a big fan and will continue to be. I plan to wear my line. I plan to wear [their] line,’ he said.","The American Idol host will unveil Ryan Seacrest Distinction in 150 Macy's stores .

Campaign finance chairman Matthew Barzun is set to move into the sumptuous residence in London's Court of St James which boasts a sprawling garden second only in size to that of Buckingham Palace. Obama raised a record-breaking $1.1 billion to defeat Mitt Romney last year, of which his big money donors, or 'bundlers' as they are known in Washington, brought in an estimated $286 million. Posting: Obama's chief fundraiser Matthew Barzun, who helped raise around £700 million to the election campaign, has been rewarded with the post of ambassador to the United Kingdom . Mr Barzun, a technology and internet magnate, is said to have personally contributed some $2.3 million to the campaign while helping to raise a total of $700 million. He has just completed another glamorous posting as ambassador to Sweden which he was awarded after fundraising for Obama's 2008 campaign.

Obama raised a record-breaking $1.1 billion to defeat Mitt Romney last year, of which his big money donors, or 'bundlers' as they are known in Washington, brought in around $286 million . The average amount raised by those being appointed to top embassies around the world is now almost $1.8 million (£1.2 million). Other recent appointments include San Fransisco banker Azita Raji, who donated a generous $3.2 million and is now rumoured to be packing his bags to enjoy the crisp alpine air of Switzerland.

'It has the effect of diminishing perhaps the sense that the US is treating these countries with the respect that they deserve.' Last month Obama tapped Patrick Gaspard, a former White House aide and top Democratic Party official, to be the U.S. ambassador to South Africa. Earlier in June he nominated Rufus Gifford, who raised upward of $700 million as the head of Obama's 2012 finance operation, to be U.S ambassador to Denmark.

However, Roker is standing by other comments he made about the mayor's decision to not close schools. In contrast, de Blasio canceled a scheduled press conference Friday morning, at which he likely would have had to face reporters and discuss bungling the second snow storm of his young administration, as well as questions about his intervening in the arrest of a campaign donor who was arrested earlier in the week after it was discovered he had outstanding warrants - de Blasio reportedly called an NYPD official following the arrest of Bishop Orlando Findlayter, sparing the Democratic campaign contributor a night in jail.

Roker led the angry criticism of de Blasio after he kept city schools open while the rest of the state declared a state of emergency amid heavy snowfall. In addition to the 'one term' comment, Roker, whose daughter goes to school in the city, fired off a series of angry tweets. He said: ‘Chancellor says Macy's is open, schools should be open. They're also open on Thanksgiving, nights and Sundays. Are you kidding?’ ‘And how about all the parents and caregivers who have to scramble to get their kids home? Is there no one there with any common sense?' Roker, who has twice been voted best weatherman, added: ‘Why are schools all around NYC . closed? It's going to take some kid or kids getting hurt before this . goofball policy gets changed.' ‘@NYCMayorsOffice . @NYCSchools snow policy is ridiculous. Tell people to stay off the . roads. Stay home. But send your kids/teachers/staff in?' The mayor responded to Roker's tweets, saying: 'It’s a different thing to run a city than to give the weather on TV.' The response prompted Roker to tweet: 'Mr Mayor, I could never run NYC, but I know when it's time to keep kids home from school.' Parents of city school children . joined in on the criticism of de Blasio, noting that this is the second . time in as many winter storms that the mayor has failed the city and that his decision to not close schools was 'idiotic.' 'For a man that I voted for,' Manhattan parent Kourosh Mahboubian . said of De Blasio to the New York Post, 'It’s not the way to get . re-elected. He doesn’t understand snow.

Although he is only 5ft 3in and his younger, blonde second wife towers over him, Brendan O’Carroll is an imposing man with a slightly menacing energy. At the National Television Awards this week, the 58-year-old creator and star of Mrs Brown’s Boys, was in full - faintly terrifying - flow. Holding court backstage after winning the title of best comedy, he was happy to discuss the success of his show about a foul-mouthed Irish matriarch which the critics hated when first broadcast — but couldn’t kill off. Scroll down for video . Influence: Brendan O'Carroll's mother Maureen (right) is the obvious inspiration for Mrs Brown (left). She was an extraordinary woman who started out as a nun and ended up as a politician . ‘I really do respect critics,’ he said. ‘I know they’ve got a job to do. But there’ll always be a donkey telling the racehorse how he’s doing in the race.’ Then, in typical Mrs Brown language, he added: ‘You can criticise me all you like, but as long as you’re writing little columns in Mickey Mouse giveaway newspapers, f*** off.’ With withering sarcasm he said he was just grateful that the critics at least always spelled the name of the show correctly. The reason for his ire? One snooty broadsheet called the show, which features a cursing O’Carroll in a wig and baggy cardigan as the eponymous character, ‘the worst comedy ever made’. O’Carroll, who has made £16 million — and counting — from it, isn’t about to take such an insult lying down. This week, wearing a black bow tie and with his spectacles perched on his balding head, he became increasingly pugnacious as he attempted to explain the secrets of  his success. His wife Jenny — who plays his daughter on screen — grimaced expressively at his side in her grey sequined dress. Beating Miranda, American sitcom The Big Bang Theory and Derek, featuring Ricky Gervais, to the best comedy prize was another honour for the show which has been decried as hopelessly vulgar and dated. But the Christmas Day special pulled in the biggest audience on BBC1 — nine million viewers — and it’s no surprise that it scooped its accolade this week as the awards are based on the public vote. At the National Television Awards this week the 58-year-old creator and star of Mrs Brown¿s Boys, Brendan O'Carroll (pictured holding award), was in full - faintly terrifying - flow . The Christmas Day special of Mrs Brown's Boys pulled in the biggest audience on BBC1 - nine million viewers . The success of the show is phenomenal. It has also won a Bafta, versions have been made in Iceland, Romania and the Czech Republic and it’s the most popular comedy show in Australia. O’Carroll is about to take the show on a three-month tour Down Under, and revenues have been estimated at £8.5 million in that country alone. There are discussions about making a Mrs Brown in America, too, although the bad language is apparently an issue. (The show’s producer admits to 34 uses of a barely sanitised variant of the F-word in a 30-minute show.) O’Carroll wants to write a fourth series this year, and a movie spin-off is due for release in the summer. Enormous amounts of DVDs of the show have also been sold — figures for 2012 suggest 2.1 million. And there are the incredibly lucrative tours. The team are in the middle of the second one. As O’Carroll exclaimed in wonder on Wednesday night: ‘325,000 of them bought tickets. I’m getting a yacht!’ So just who is Brendan O’Carroll? Born in Dublin, he was the youngest of 11 children. His father Gerald was a carpenter, who built ‘beds on the walls, like in submarines’ for his huge brood.His mother, the obvious inspiration for Mrs Brown, was an extraordinary woman who started out as a nun and ended up as a politician. X-rated: Mrs Brown's Boys is well-known for its slightly salty brand of comedy . Unlike Mrs Brown, she was highly educated. Maureen McHugh attended University College, Galway, and became a novice nun before she renounced her vows, married and became a language teacher. Upon her marriage in 1936 she was expected to give up her job because married women in Ireland were not allowed to be civil servants. So she embarked on protests that got the law changed. She was the first female Irish Labour Party MP, and went on to be the party’s chief whip. O’Carroll said: ‘Ireland at the time was in the Middle Ages and it was actually legal for a husband to beat his wife with a stick, so long as the stick wasn’t longer than his forearm. My mother helped change all that.’ She had nine children and also adopted a boy from reform school. Aged 42, she became ill with ‘a growth’, which turned out to be a 9lbs 3oz boy she called Brendan. Maureen was an outspoken woman who had no time for convention. Neither did her son. Despite an IQ reputed to be a dizzy 156, he left school aged 12 in 1968 while his mother was away on union business in Canada. Happy couple: Brendan O'Carroll with his wife and Mrs Brown's Boys co-star Jennifer Gibney . Brendan worked as a waiter on and off for the next decade. He met and fell in love with the Dubliner Doreen Dowdall when they were both 13. They were married in 1977. Their first son, Brendan, died a few days after being born. They went on to have three more children — Fiona, Danny and Eric. And the family needed welfare to survive as Brendan drifted from one job to another — milkman, painter and decorator and then, publican. Disaster struck when his partner in a Dublin pub disappeared with the money. Returning from a holiday in 1989, O’Carroll found that Kevin Moore had cleared out the pub. In the book The Real Mrs Brown, by author Brian Beacom, O’Carroll says that he was even arrested on suspicion of killing Moore, when he was found hanged. But Kevin, who was gay, had contracted Aids and had gone to Australia for a holiday before returning to his mother’s house to hang himself. Left with debts of £96,000, O’Carroll was declared bankrupt. He said later: ‘I was finished. At that stage, if you’d put my name into the computer, you’d have sworn that I’d murdered the bank manager’s wife, the credit rating was so bad.’ Desperate for money, O’Carroll started to work in pubs and clubs as a stand-up comedian. In 1992 he wrote a radio sitcom called Mrs Brown’s Boys which was broadcast daily on the Irish station 2FM. Then, an appearance on the Dublin chat-show The Late Late Show the following year raised his profile. The host of that show, Gay Byrne, says: ‘He had the audience crying with laughter. He’s also a very sharp businessman. The fact he has got the BBC to allow him to retain complete ownership over Mrs Brown’s Boys shows what a smart operator he is.’ O’Carroll followed up his success as a stand-up by writing a novel, The Mammy, about working class matriarch Mrs Brown, and followed it with three sequels. But in 1998, when he wrote a film, Sparrow’s Trap, and directed it, funding was withdrawn, and he was left with a debt of £2 million. He was bankrupt again. A Hollywood film of The Mammy, starring Angelica Huston, helped to nudge him towards solvency in 1999 but it was only when he wrote a play about Mrs Brown that he managed to get back into the black. By this time he had split from Doreen and fallen for Jenny Gibney,  who was in a play with him. They married in 2005. Brendan told his biographer his first wife was suspicious of showbusiness and preferred to take her mother to bingo than go to his first nights. One unusual feature is that Mrs Brown's Boys leaves in footage of the cast making mistakes and then laughing . Around this time he started to play Mrs Brown, when an actress hired to play the part called in sick.O’Carroll sat down at a dressing-room mirror, put on a wig, pencilled in a mole on his chin — then declared, ‘F*** me, it’s me mammy!’ The show remains a family affair, with his son, daughters-in-law and former agent all taking parts in it. One of its unusual features is that Mrs Brown’s Boys leaves in footage of the cast making mistakes and then laughing. In the first broadcast episode, O’Carroll turns to the studio audience and announces: ‘It’s just a man in a f****** dress.’ Vulgar and old fashioned? Certainly. Obvious? Probably. But so successful that O’Carroll lives in some style in Florida, where he writes Mrs Brown’s Boys. His most recently filed accounts show touring profits for 2011-2012 at £880,000 — and that’s after O’Carroll took a dividend of £345,000. (They also show considerable charitable donations — he supports a Christian charity that tackles poverty and an autism charity.) His ventures are expected to eventually net him £50 million. Though he often sports a moustache offscreen, he is stopped in the street and asked for photographs. O’Carroll sighs: ‘I don’t even think my mother if she was alive would want a f****** photograph of me.’ And the secret of his success? Sometimes he credits the long years of working with Mrs Brown on radio and stage with allowing him to know which jokes work. But at other times he just shrugs. He told his biographer: ‘Brian, do me a favour. Analyse this and tell me what the secret is, ‘cos I don’t have a f****** clue.’","Maureen O'Carroll is the inspiration for Agnes in BBC hit Mrs Brown's Boys .

First it was Apple's fingerprint sensor that got tech fans all flustered and then there was the more recent rumour that Samsung's next phone could come complete with iris-scanning technology. But now, thanks to an app, you don't need to but a new phone to get a futuristic unlocking feature. New Android software now allows you to unlock your phone using your ear. The Android app claims that a person's earprint is as unique as their fingerprint and that it is more convenient to use. Biometrics is an increasingly popular area of development in mobile technology . U.S. based company Descartes Biometrics claims their 'biometric authentication application' is a 'robust and reliable mobile device security solution'. Use passwords of eight characters or more with mixed types of characters . Use passphrases -- short words with spaces or other characters separating them . It's best to use random words rather than common phrases. For example, ""cakes years birthday"" or ""smiles_light_skip?"" Avoid using the same username/password combination for multiple websites. The company also claims that a person's ear print is as unique as their fingerprint. As with a fingerprint sensor, the patent-pending app verifies an phone owner's identity against a profile stored on the device before granting access it. An owner's identity is then checked against ear measurements as well as the manner - such as the angle - in which the phone is placed against the face. Biometric technology is gaining popularity in the mobile phone industry, with various companies experimenting with innovative ways to make technology more responsive and tailored its user. Earlier this month Samsung’s executive vice president Lee Young Hee announced that the firm was looking to release its next flagship phone between March and April. The app, costing £2.50 ($3.99), also monitors the way a phone owner moves the phone to their face - checking the angle at which it rests on the users face, for example . Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its Galaxy range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured . Lee also discussed the possibility of a future model that could feature iris-recognition technology, but he did not confirm if it would be added to S5 or not. Biometric experts at New York-based firm EyeLock have already created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner that, they claim, could replace all passwords for you electrical devices. The Myris device can register up to five different users. Each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises. These unique images are then translated into an encrypted code. The scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately. Different body parts are more reliable than others when it comes to identification. Voice recognition, for example, is far less secure than facial recognition, while iris scanning technology is even more surperior . Once registered, each user can add various online passwords to their Myris profile. Next time the user visits one of these accounts, instead of entering a password, they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access. According to EyeLock, the False Acceptance Rate of the average fingerprint sensor, in which the system is hacked by an unknown print, is one in every 10,000 scans.  For iris scans, this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans. Myris is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around £150 ($250) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced.","$3.99 Ergo software uses a person's earprint to identify its owner .

Romania's population has fallen by more than 12 per cent since 2002 as hundreds of thousands leave the poverty-stricken nation for richer countries such as Britain. Figures from the latest Romanian census reveal that migration and a low birth rate have pushed the population down to 19million, a fall of almost 3million in ten years. The country’s National Statistics Board said nearly 1million Romanians were working abroad. Romanian Firuta Vasile, left, and Lina Petrea, right, are two Romanians who have migrated from their homeland to Britain where they can sell the Big Issue and claim generous benefits . However, other estimates suggest the number of expatriate workers could be 3million. There is no official figure for the . number of Romanians in the UK, but British bosses advertised 2,400 . vacancies last month alone on a Romanian website for nurses, engineers . and other jobs. Unemployment in Britain is at 8.4 per . cent, but many firms seek staff from impoverished nations such as . Romania – the second-poorest in the EU after Bulgaria – to work for low . wages. Although Romania joined the EU in 2007, its citizens still need permission from the UK Border Agency to work here. Romania is being bailed out by the . International Monetary Fund and has imposed austerity measures. Its . falling population will further hit tax revenues. The figures raised concerns about the size of the country's work force and tax income. It is also being hit by a low birth rate. The scene outside the British Embassy in Bucharest, Romania . The data comes after a Romanian Big Issue seller in Britain was revealed to be claiming generous state handouts. Firuta . Vasile, a mother of four who sold the magazine in Bristol, was given . the legal right to claim  housing benefit on top of the other aid she . already receives. An . investigation revealed that large numbers of Romanians are working in . the UK as Big Issue vendors whilst also claiming benefits. Almost . one in three Big Issue sellers – 700 out of a nationwide force of 2,250 . registered vendors according to the magazine – were found to have come . from Romania. Immigration officers swoop on an illegal Roma camp in Ireland. There are as many as 2.5 million of the minority group in Romania, although the exact figure is unknown . The benefits loophole is just one example of the more prosperous life that Romanian immigrants are able to lead in Britain. The exit of workers has raised . particular concerns in a country where only about 5 million employees . pay taxes and most of the rest are pensioners, children, subsistence . farmers or people working illegally. Romania's over-sized and inefficient state sector accounts for nearly a quarter of employees. 'The . foreign migration balance is the main reason for the decline in . Romania's population, coupled with a negative natural growth,' said Ilie . Dumitrescu, spokeman for the National Statistics Board. A Romany gypsies from the camp in Ireland carries her baby while collecting some food. Right, an older Romany women among tents and rubbish . Romania's government has pushed through tough austerity measures, cutting salaries and raising sales tax to bring its budget cap under control and maintain an International Monetary Fund bailout. The fall in population will make it harder to increase revenue collection. Hungarians make up 6.5 per cent of the population and 3.2 per cent, or 619,000, described themselves as Roma. Rights group say many Roma do not declare their background, some of them fearing discrimination, and the true number could be as high as 2.5 million. That would be the largest Roma community in Europe. The statistics office estimates about a million people were not included in the data because they did not complete the forms or are living abroad and were not declared by relatives. Dumitrescu said the agency would release more detailed data in late May and there could still be some significant changes to the figures.","Population has fallen to 19million as workers leave .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 20:11 EST, 29 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:11 EST, 29 July 2012 . David Cameron has come under pressure to follow Spain's example tighten border controls . Britons living in Spain face tough income tests as the debt-ridden country launches a crackdown on migrants. The move has led to demands from Tory MPs for David Cameron to take a tougher approach to EU nationals living in this country. Earlier this month, Spain passed proposals for ‘proof of income’ and other tests. Ministers hope to save 1billion euros (£780million) a year by forcing EU citizens to meet strict criteria if they wish to stay for three months or more. Migrants must prove they have either a job or enough money to support themselves, and if they are jobless, they must produce health insurance. If they cannot supply the evidence, their application for residency in Spain may be rejected. It is unclear what effect the rules will have on those currently living in Spain. Currently, EU directives say that those living in member states for more than three months should not become an ‘unreasonable burden on social services’. Yesterday, former Labour immigration minister Phil Woolas told the Mail on Sunday: ‘We do have the power to deport EU citizens – but they are ignored by the British authorities. We should heed the Spanish example and change our approach.’ The Home Office said yesterday it did not have figures for how many EU nationals were removed because they could not support themselves. Tory MP James Clappison, a member of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘This move drives a coach and horses through the freedom of movement principle and we should take inspiration from it.’ A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said: ‘We carry out enforcement operations up and down the country every day and wherever we encounter someone breaking the rules, we will take steps to remove them.’ A new ministerial order, slipped out by the Spanish government on July 9, states that any EU citizen living in Spain for more than three months must prove they will not become a financial burden on the State by producing a job contract or documents confirming they have enough money to support themselves. If they are jobless, they must also show they are covered by health insurance. The decree, which potentially affects thousands of Britons seeking a new life in the country, declares that Spain will now adopt  a stricter interpretation of the ‘free movement’ principle. The Spanish government has justified the measures by pointing to Article 7 of the 2004 EU directive on free movement, which gives EU member states the power to define it ‘without prejudice to national border controls’ – in other words, entry conditions can be imposed on other EU citizens by member governments. Tough times: Spanish demonstrators take to the streets to protest against the country's austerity measures . The UK has also enacted the provision – . and the Home Office insists that it does demand that EU citizens should . not be ‘an unreasonable  burden on public funds’ before allowing them . to stay in the UK. Spain is in the grip of its worst . economic crisis since the Forties and is almost certain to require a . bailout in the coming weeks. Official figures released on Friday . show that unemployment has soared to a record 5.7 million – a staggering . 24.6 per cent of the workforce. The centre-right government of prime . minister Mariano Rajoy has introduced the new controls in an attempt to . cut expenditure on health and social services. Health minister Ana Mato . said recently that 700,000 foreigners had moved to Spain just to obtain . free health care. The country has become a favourite destination for ‘health tourists’ from other EU countries, attracted by short waiting lists, cheap treatment and excellent hospitals. Under EU law, citizens of member states are entitled to receive health care in any member country. But Spanish authorities say their finances are being drained by the arrangement, with local media claiming Britons are the worst offenders. In contrast to the Spanish regulations, EU citizens coming to live in Britain do not need to register or take out health insurance. And the only requirement on those not in work is that they should not become an ‘unreasonable burden’ on public funds. A spokesman for the Spanish Embassy in London said: ‘You either must hold a job or have the means to support yourself to ensure that you do not become a burden on the Spanish state. ‘Those people who do not hold a job would have to show that they have contracted a medical insurance service to cover them during their stay in Spain, and also that they have the appropriate means to support themselves and any other member of their families. Pensioners do not need medical insurance.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘This change simply brings Spain in line with many other EU countries. The British Embassy has issued guidance in English for British expatriates in Spain via its website. We understand the new rules will affect a relatively small number of expatriates.’ British holidaymakers would have borrowing limits on their credit cards lifted by the Government if they were caught up in the collapse of the euro, under new plans. The move is one of a series of measures being considered by crisis- management teams in No 10, the Foreign Office and the Treasury following advice that Greece’s exit from the single currency is ‘near inevitable’ – and could come before the end of the summer-holiday season. The deepening economic malaise on the Continent has led to the conclusion at the top of the Government that there will soon be an ‘orderly ejection’ of Greece from the euro – probably with only a few days’ notice. If this ‘Grexit’ occurred in the height of the summer season, hundreds of thousands of British tourists could be stranded with euros that are no longer legal tender. Cash machines could freeze and credit-card companies are unlikely to process transactions. The UK Government’s primary aim would be to avoid panic by allowing British tourists to remain in Greece until the end of their holiday.

The director of the National Security Agency admitted today that the agency collects data from social networks and other private databases to hunt terror suspects but is not using the information to build dossiers, or personal files, on Americans. NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander testified during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday that not all social network searches are authorized by a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court, but the agency's actions are proper and audited internally. Alexander called a recent New York Times report on the searches 'inaccurate and wrong.' Denial: National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander gestures during a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act on Capitol Hill on Wednesday . The Times report did not specifically cite dossiers, but said the NSA was exploiting huge collections of personal data to create sophisticated graphs of some Americans' social connections. The Times said the private data includes bank, flight, GPS location and voting records. General Alexander told the Judiciary Committee that social networks are only investigated when they suspect 'someone who is part of a terrorist investigation'. 'The fact that people assume that we're out there mapping the social networks of US persons is absolutely wrong,' said Alexander. 'What we do go after is those that are the subject of a terrorist investigation or something like that.' Defending the work of the NSA's surveillance efforts which have been under fire since the revelations of whistle-blower Edward Snowden in June, General Alexander said that the agency uses social networks to 'enrich' information on suspects. Considered: National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander pauses while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2013, before the Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing . 'We don't have the Facebook and other stuff on those people here in the US. It would have to come from the foreign side,' he said. Asked whether they would continue to investigate social networks if the suspect turned out to be an American, Alexander said that the investigation would be handed over to the FBI. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is seen during an interview by The Guardian in his hotel room in Hong Kong in this June 6, 2013 file still image taken from video . However, General Alexander did admit during the hearing that the National Security Agency once tested whether it could track Americans' cellphone locations, but he says the NSA does not use that capability. Alexander said the agency conducted tests in 2010 and 2011 to see if it could handle the data, and then reported the tests to both House and Senate intelligence committees. He claims the data gathered was never used for intelligence analysis. These apparent clarifications follow on from revelations in the New York Times over the weekend which claim that for almost three years the National Security Agency has been tapping the data it collects to map out some Americans' social connections, allowing the government to identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information. Citing documents provided by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden, the Times reported that the NSA began allowing the analysis of phone call and e-mail logs in November 2010 to examine some Americans' networks of associations for foreign intelligence purposes after NSA officials lifted restrictions on the practice. The newspaper posted the report on its website Saturday. National Intelligence Director James Clapper , left, accompanied by National Security Agency Director Gen.

A January 2011 memorandum from the spy agency indicated that the policy shift was intended to help the agency 'discover and track' connections between intelligence targets overseas and people in the United States, the Times reported. The documents Snowden provided indicated that the NSA can augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as property records and unspecified tax data, the paper reported. NSA officials declined to say how many Americans have been caught up in the effort, including people involved in no wrongdoing, the Times reported. The documents do not describe what has resulted from the scrutiny, which links phone numbers and e-mails in a 'contact chain' tied directly or indirectly to a person or organization overseas that is of foreign intelligence interest, the paper reported.

However, NSA officials said the large database of Americans' domestic phone call records revealed in June was not used, the paper reported. Disclosures from documents leaked by Snowden earlier this year have sparked debate over the government's surveillance activities and concerns that Americans' civil liberties have been violated by the data collection.

The era of cheap food is coming to an end, the boss of Tesco warned yesterday. Philip Clarke, chief executive of Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, said rising global demand meant the low prices could not continue for much longer. He spoke as a new poll indicated that consumers would be prepared to pay more for their groceries if they thought it would benefit British farmers. Tesco’s reputation was badly damaged by the horsemeat scandal at the start of the year and Mr Clarke has promised to rebuild customers’ trust. But it faced accusations of profiteering yesterday after raising the price of its basic bottled water by 40 per cent as the country sweltered in the heat. Food price inflation was 2.7 per cent last month, up from 2.4 per cent in May. Mr Clarke is the second supermarket boss, after Waitrose’s Mark Price, to back experts’ warnings that rock-bottom prices would eventually lead to quality being sacrificed. Last month a UN report predicted world food prices could rise by as much as 40 per cent over the next decade, driven by the demands of a growing middle class in China and India. ‘There was a time when we could go to South Africa to buy fruit and be the only retailer there,’ Mr Clarke said, adding: ‘Not any more.’ And he pledged to fulfil a promise to the National Farmers’ Union, made after January’s scandal, to give British producers a better deal.

Oh no, Tesco: The chief executive of Britain¿s biggest supermarket chain, said rising global demand meant the low prices could not continue for much longer . His comments came as a poll to mark National Countryside Week, which starts today, suggested a majority of British consumers would pay more for food if farmers benefited rather than supermarket shareholders. The poll, by YouGov for The Prince’s Countryside Fund, also indicated that more than 80 per cent of consumers think it is important to buy British. Donald Curry, a trustee of the fund, said: ‘The public are prepared support British farmers, even if that means paying more for food – provided extra money goes directly to the producer.’","No more bargain buys during your weekly show, supermarket boss warns .

Plans have been submitted to develop the world's first tidal lagoon energy project in the UK. And the ground-breaking project could provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in Swansea, Wales for 120 years. Developers behind the £750million to £850million Swansea Bay project believe it could be the first step in developing lagoon technology that could meet 10 per cent of the UK's electricity needs from the tides. An artist's impression of the proposed Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, which if developed would be the world's first tidal lagoon energy project and provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in Swansea for 120 years . The developers say the £750million project, along with four others could meet 10 per cent of the UK's electricity needs from the tides by 2023. The six-mile wall around Swansea Bay complete with turbines could generate electricity 14 hours a day. Tidal Lagoon Power believes the project will boost a UK supply chain and create a new export market if it gets the go-ahead. The project includes creating a 10km sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities. It would save 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year. 1,850 construction jobs would be created plus 150 long-term jobs in its operation. The scheme would involve a six-mile (9.5km) wall built around Swansea Bay, which would create a lagoon in the Severn Estuary with turbines that could harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day. If it gets the go-ahead, the lagoon could be the first of a series of five developments around the UK, coast which could generate as much as 10 per cent of the UK's electricity by 2023. Tidal Lagoon Power, the company behind the project, said it hopes that 65 per cent of expenditure will be in the UK, boosting a home grown supply chain and creating a possible future export market. The project includes creating a 10km sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities. According to the developers, research as part of the project's initial stages found that 86 per cent of local residents were in favour of the scheme. The Swansea Bay project would save 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year and create 1,850 construction jobs. Around 150 long-term jobs in operation and the leisure facilities would also be created in the area while the development would also boost jobs in the wider supply chain, the company said. If the ambitious scheme (illustrated) gets the go-ahead, the lagoon could be the first of a series of five developments around the UK, coast which could generate as much as 10 per cent of the UK's electricity by 2023 . ‘Until now, tidal energy has been heavily promoted by governments and environmentalists as an intuitive source of clean and reliable energy for our island nation, but the business response has focused on relatively small-scale tidal stream devices, Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Lagoon Power said. ‘The UK has the second highest tidal range in the world and today we are submitting an application for a development that will prove that this resource can be harnessed in a way that makes economic, environmental and social sense. ‘Tidal lagoons offer renewable energy at nuclear scale and thus the investment of hundreds of millions of pounds in UK industries and coastal communities.’ He added: ‘Our intention is to supply 10 per cent of the UK's domestic electricity by building at least five full-scale tidal lagoons in UK waters by 2023, before the UK sees any generation from new nuclear.’ It is believed that building more, larger lagoons would bring economies of scale. The project would expect to benefit from subsidies levied on energy bills for clean power, but Mr Shorrock said a second lagoon would require a lower level of support than offshore wind. The project is the latest plan to harness the huge tidal power of the Severn Estuary, after a separate scheme for a barrage across the estuary failed to win political support amid concerns that the economic and environment case for it did not stack up. The New Severn Bridge is pictured . A third lagoon, he suggested, would be competitive with the support received by new nuclear plants but without the decommissioning costs and safety concerns. And other sites where lagoons are being considered, such as the Somerset coast, could have added benefits such as flood defences. The developers have submitted an application that will now be considered by the Planning Inspectorate. If the application is accepted it will then be assessed with a final decision expected from the Energy Secretary and Natural Resources Wales in early 2015. If the go-ahead is given, construction could start next year, with the first power generated by 2018, the company said.

Science fiction has long speculated what it would be like to peek inside a person's mind and find out what they are thinking. Now scientists are one step closer to such technology after forging a new brain monitoring technique that could lead to the development of 'mind-reading' applications. The breakthrough comes from a Stanford University School of Medicine study that was able to 'eavesdrop' on a person's brain activity as they performed normal functions by utilizing a series of electrodes attached to certain portions of the brain. The process, called 'intracranial recording', was tested on three epilepsy seizure patients who had been admitted to the hospital for pre-surgery observation, according to FoxNews.com. A new study from the Stanford University School of Medicine has developed a new way to monitor the brain . During visits, the patients had a portion of their skull temporarily removed so that intracranial electrodes can be attached to the exposed brain surface. They are then monitored for up to a week as the electrodes pick up electrical activity in the brain, allowing neurologists to observe the patients’ seizures and pinpoint the exact portion of the brain from which the seizures are originating. The patients were confined to their rooms and were comfortable, pain-free and alert, making them perfect for understanding how the brain operates in normal scenarios. The patients were asked to solve mathematical equations and various true/false questions that appeared on a computer screen. Some of the true/false questions required the use of simple mathematical calculation, such as verifying whether or not 2 + 2 = 5. After analyzing the patients' electrode records from these experiments, the researchers saw a spike in the electrical activity of the brain’s intraperietal sulcus when the patients performed calculations. Results from the study identified brain cells that spiked in electricity when faced with mathematical equations. Researchers discovered that 'when the subject is reminiscing, laughing or talking' these cells are not activated . They also found that activity in this brain region spiked several other times throughout the day. By watching back video recordings of the experiments, the research team discovered that whenever a number was mentioned - even just through words like 'many' or 'more than' - the same spikes were seen in the intraperietal sulcus, which was a very unexpected finding. The findings, which will be detailed in Nature Communications, provide a new framework for studying for the brain works in normal day-to-day circumstances. 'We’re now able to eavesdrop on the brain in real life,' lead author Dr. Josef Parvizi, associate . professor of neurology and neurological sciences and director of . Stanford’s Human Intracranial Cognitive Electrophysiology Program . (SHICEP), told The Amalgest. 'The beauty of this paper is not just to report another experimental finding, but it is a breakthrough in terms of methodological advancement in terms of being able to record from brain activity in real life, natural conditions. 'These nerve cells were not firing chaotically. The ways in which doctors and scientists are able to study the brain are limited because of the organ's sensitivity. The new method, called intracranial recording, is being seen as a breakthrough in the area . 'They’re very specialized, active only when the subject starts thinking about numbers. 'When the subject is reminiscing, laughing or talking, they’re not activated.' Thus, it was possible to know, simply by consulting the electronic record of participants’ brain activity, whether they were engaged in quantitative thought during nonexperimental conditions. Parvizi said the success of the study meant that intracranial recordings could change the way researchers observe the brain. Current brain monitoring techniques, such as magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), do not provide a very accurate picture of the human brain in normal settings. 'The MRI scanner is several tons, and you can’t actually take an MRI scanner home, but this (apparatus) is something you can walk with – as a patient of course,' Parvizi said. 'So subjects that are implanted with these spying electrodes, they were walking and talking… We have a new method by which we can study the brain activity in natural environments, so it’s totally different than other experiments.' Parvizi said this technique has the potential to lead to very beneficial medical applications, especially for patients whose brains or nervous systems have been severely damaged. The future: It is hoped the findings of the new study will one day allow for people who cannot speak to be implanted with brain chips that could allow machines to talk for them . 'If we’re able to decipher the code of brain activity, let’s say beyond mathematics, then patients who are unable to speak, for example (due to) stroke, or are unable to move, we could use this deciphering method to communicate with machines so that machines can do (the talking),' Parvizi said. 'Or we can somehow try to understand what’s going on in the brain activity without even patients talking.' While some experts have speculated that Parvizi’s new technique could one day be used in a sinister way to read a patient’s private thoughts, Parvizi said that is still a very fictional concept. 'This is too far-fetched.  We are not there yet.  We are light years away from mind-reading,' Parvizi said. 'I don’t want people to get scared that doctors are mind-reading their patients.'","Stanford University School of Medicine develop new way to monitor brain technique .

Family goldfish Juliet has spent the last month ensconced in a tank at their London neighbour's home after Victoria dropped her off on Boxing Day and forgot (or so we assume) to pick her up. 'You can forgive the Beckhams for being a little distracted following their move to a new £30 million mansion in London’s Kensington,' wrote Shakespeare. 'But could they not spare a thought for their lonely goldfish?' Beckham goldfish . He continued: 'Victoria dropped off the pet fish with a neighbour to look after for the holiday season on Boxing Day last year — and is yet to reclaim it.' 'The goldfish just came with some fish food,’ says neighbour, military historian Adrian Weale, who lives on the street in Kensington where the Beckhams rented prior to their move. ‘We believe it belongs to their son Romeo, so we’ve called it Juliet.’ Mr Weale, who with his wife is caring for the fish, added: ‘It seems quite chirpy, but I can’t help thinking it’s pining for its celebrity lifestyle.’ And it seems Mr Weale could be correct. Speaking to Shakespeare, animal psychologist Dr Roger Mugford revealed the fish may indeed be pining for its ritzy owners.

They notice smell, lighting, pollution,' he explained. ‘So this fish could pick up the different body perfumes in its new home, as odours can dissolve in the water in their tank.’ Mugford also believes Juliet needs a piscatorial pal, reports Shakespeare. ‘I think it’s a bad idea to keep just one goldfish — they are fundamentally sociable animals. And it is horrible to think about a fish swimming round and round in circles with nothing to do. They need structured tanks with places to hide, and architecture to explore.’ Adds Mr Weale: ‘The fish came in a plain bowl, but we’ve bought it a tank with a filter as the water was getting murky. We’re happy to keep it, but it would be nice too, if they came to collect it.’","The fish, named Juliet, has been at a neigbour's home since Boxing Day .

The Atacama Desert, spanning from Chile to Peru, is considered the driest place on Earth. It is so arid that even mountains reaching as high as 22,589 ft are completely free of glaciers . Although there is no water on the ground, moisture in the air from a heavy coastal fog passes through the net and condenses before travelling through pipes into tanks where it is stored.

Farmers at a fog collection co-operative in Chanaral, northern Chile inspect aloe vera plants which they grow using the water from large fog collecting nets . The fog collectors are huge nets hung between two poles and are made of a polypropylene mesh that captures the droplets. When the droplets gather together they then run into the storage tanks. The water is pure for drinking and can be used for agriculture, with a collective in the village of Chanaral use the water for small-scale aloe vera farming. However, if the process was used on a larger scale the possibility to change the hostile desert environment is great. The water is pure enough to drink and can also be used for agriculture, helping to boost the local economy . The fog water condenses on the nets and is collected in large containers. With more investment the water could help revitalise the area . Nicolas Prado of the Universidad Catolica, Santiago checks the water level of a tank that stores water collected from fog catching nets at the Alto Patache fog Oasis . The plants grown from water spilled during the process shows that there are a wide variety of seeds in the ground. Fog water has been used to transform once arid patches of desert into gardens. Currently water is piped to towns from hundreds of miles away in the Andes or driven by water trucks, so fog collection could prove to be a sustainable way to revitalise the area. Non-profit organisation FogQuest, who make collection nets, say that each cubic meter of fog contains 0.05 to 0.5 grams of water. FogQuest projects have been established in Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Cape Verde Islands, Eritrea, South Africa, Yemen, Oman, Ethiopia, Israel, and Nepal.

Lord Laird has resigned the Ulster Unionist whip after referring himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs over his contact with a fake lobbying company . Two labour peers have been suspended by the party and Ulster Unionist Lord Laird has resigned his party whip after being accused of agreeing to carry out parliamentary work for payment. Former police chief Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate and ex-cabinet minister Lord Cunningham were caught up in  two separate stings by undercover journalists posing as lobbyists. In a statement, the party said the pair 'have been suspended from the Labour Party pending further investigation. 'The Labour Party expects the highest standards of its representatives and believes that they have a duty to be transparent and accountable at all times.' Lord Laird earlier resigned after being targeted by the same investigation. All three deny breaching the rules and have referred themselves to the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards. Lord laird confirmed . that he had been approached by two BBC journalists posing as . consultants for fictitious consultancy firm Alistair Andrews . Communications. It comes on the back of Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigning the party whip over the 'cash-for-access' row. In a statement, party leader Mike Nesbitt said: 'Having reviewed the video footage on the Daily Telegraph website, and other media reporting of Lord Laird's engagement with alleged lobbyists, I telephoned his home this morning and as a result he has relinquished the Party Whip, pending the outcome of the review of his behaviour that he has already requested of the relevant authorities at Westminster.' Mr Nesbitt was quoted by the BBC: 'Any sensible, right-minded person watching that video clip would form an opinion and that is not the opinion I would want for the Ulster Unionist Party. 'Nobody gets privilege from the Ulster Unionist Party, we expect high standards, we really do.' Lord Laird, Lord Mackenzie and Lord Cunningham, the former minister Jack Cunningham, were all said to have been . secretly filmed offering to become paid advocates for a firm pushing for . new laws to benefit its business. According to The Sunday Times, Mackenzie and Laird told how some peers . were colluding to hide their conflicts of interest from public scrutiny. They claimed some of their colleagues struck job swapping deals, . pulling strings in parliament for each others clients. Three peers were identified last night as having been caught up in the cash-for-questions row that has forced Tory MP Patrick Mercer to resign the party whip.  The trio include Lord Cunningham, right, and Lord Mackenzie, left . According . to the newspaper, Cunningham asked for £144,000 a year for a personal . lobbying service to reporters posing as representatives of a South . Korean solar energy company. He reportedly asked an undercover reporter: 'Are you . suggesting £10,000 a month? make that ... £12,000 a month. I think we . could do a deal on that.' He also claimed he could introduce them to senior figures in all three main political parties. The Mail on Sunday understands Lord Laird will feature with Mr Mercer in a Panorama exposé due to be broadcast this week. The . former PR executive insisted he had not broken any rules because he had . never agreed to act on the fake consultancy’s behalf, nor accepted any . money. LORD LAIRD . Lords Cunningham and Mackenzie both also stressed they had not broken any rules. Lord Laird claimed he believed the 'sting' was a scam from the start but has since referred himself to House of Lords standards watchdogs and to Black Rod, the House’s senior official. 'In recent days I have been the subject of a scam operated by journalists masquerading as communications consultants,"" he said in a statement. 'This has led to allegations that I have broken the rules of the House of Lords. 'I wish to make it clear that I did not agree to act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the House nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services.' He said that because he suspected a scam, he took a journalist to the meeting as a witness. 'Shortly after the meeting, because it was so obviously a scam, we reported it to the appropriate authorities in the Lords. 'I have not broken any rules. However, I have referred the situation to the appropriate authorities and I will be making no further statement until I have received their ruling.' Mr Mercer, a former Tory frontbencher, resigned the party whip last week after he was accused of taking £4,000 to lobby and ask parliamentary questions on behalf of Fiji. Patrick Mercer MP has quit the Tory party whip over allegations he took £4,000 from a fake lobbying company and did not declare his interest . The MP for Newark is also accused of . agreeing to provide a parliamentary pass for a representative of a . fictional Fijian client. Mr Mercer said he was taking legal advice on the allegations but had resigned the whip ‘to save my party embarrassment’. Nick Clegg: Pressing ahead with a register of lobbyists . He announced that he would stand down at the next Election but is facing pressure from Tory colleagues to quit now. The . row has led to fresh calls on David Cameron to introduce a ‘right of . recall’ allowing voters to sack misbehaving MPs and to set up an . official register of lobbyists. Last . night the Mercer affair deepened after several MPs from both major . parties admitted that they had joined the all-party parliamentary group . (APPG) on Fiji after being invited by the disgraced MP. Mr . Mercer was reported to have dismissively described them as ‘several . freeloaders that would like to go to Fiji’ – including one who asked to . take his wife. The MPs he . persuaded to join included Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home . Affairs select committee, and Conservative MPs Julian Brazier and Mark . Field. A Labour spokesman said: 'The . Labour Party expects all peers to comply with the Lords Code of Conduct, . which is there to bring clarity to their dealings with outside . commercial interests and consultancies. 'We demand high standards of behaviour from our parliamentarians. 'Where there is genuine evidence of . wrongdoing, including non-compliance with the code of conduct, the . Labour Party will consider appropriate disciplinary action as and when . necessary.' The MPs' code of conduct prohibits 'paid advocacy' and requires the declaration of financial interests. Tory Monmouth MP David Davies has . revealed that he was among those targeted by the Panorama sting, but . insisted he refused the offer of lobbying work. Mr Mercer tabled questions to . ministers in May about Fiji and also tabled a motion saying there was . 'no justification for Fiji's continued suspension from the . Commonwealth'. Mr Mercer reportedly boasted to the . undercover reporters that among 18 MPs he signed up were 'several . freeloaders that would like to go to Fiji'. Labour MP keith Vaz was invited to join a group representing Fiji but was not offered a trip to the island . A spokesman for Mr Vaz said he was a member of several such groups but had not been offered a visit to Fiji. 'He fully supports Fiji's suspension . from the Commonwealth which should remain until there are free and fair . elections. This reflects the views of his Fijian origin constituents,' he said. His sister Valerie told the newspaper . that she had an interest in human rights and democracy and was keen to . see discussion about Fiji among British MPs. Mr Field said it was a 'routine . thing' to sign up as a qualifying member of a new group and it had not . struck him as improper and Mr Hamilton said that despite knowing nothing . about Fiji it was 'not uncommon for MPs to canvass other MPs...to get . the APPG off the ground'. Mr Brazier told the newspaper: 'I . from time to time enjoy, very occasionally, doing a nice visit somewhere . and if you join an APPG there's always the possibility you may visit . that country.' A review into APPGs was announced by . the Commons standards committee in January following a working group set . up by Speaker John Bercow whose recommendations included the need for 'greater transparency.' The Fiji group was never formally registered. The controversy has reignited calls . for the Government to press ahead with promised legislation both for a . statutory register of lobbyists and the power for constituents to 'recall' MPs who breach the rules. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has . made clear his determination to secure the register - blaming the Tories . for the lack of action. Calling for cross-party talks on a . register, shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett MP said: 'We have . seen no action from this Tory-led Government, despite David Cameron . himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to . happen.' David Prince, interim chairman of the . Committee on Standards in Public Life, said it warned in January that . lobbying remained a 'significant and continuing risk to ethical . standards' but that a register would not solve all the problems.","Lord Laird referred himself to watchdogs over his contact with fake lobbying company set up by undercover journalist .

"By . Hayley Peterson . PUBLISHED: . 17:40 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:16 EST, 23 April 2013 . Charged: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been formally charged in the Boston Marathon bombings and he will be tried in the U.S. criminal justice system . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was read his Miranda rights as he was charged in the Boston Marathon bombings during an arraignment from his hospital bed on Monday. During the proceedings at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Tsarnaev only uttered the word 'no' when asked if he could afford a defense attorney. He was officially read his rights by U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowlerand he nodded affirmatively several times to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him. The hearing began with Bowler asking a doctor to rouse Tsarnaev, who is in serious condition with apparent gunshot wounds to his neck, leg, arms and hand. 'You can rouse him,' Bowler said, according to a transcript of the hearing. 'How are you feeling?' a doctor asked Tsarnaev. 'Are you able to answer some questions?' Tsarnaev nodded his head affirmatively. At the end of the hearing, Bowler said: 'At this time, at the conclusion of the initial appearance, I find that the defendant is alert, mentally competent and lucid. He is aware of the nature of the proceedings.' A probable cause hearing in the case was then set for May 30. Tsarnaev is specifically charged with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction - namely, an improvised explosive device or IED - against persons and property within the United States resulting in death, and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death, according to the criminal complaint. Out of the courtroom: Tsarnaev was arraigned in his hospital bed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, pictured, which is under tight security by Boston authorities . If he is convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of death or life imprisonment, as well as a fine of up to $250,000. Regardless of Tsarvaev's sentence if found guilty, rocker Ted Nugent has weighed in on the case, arguing that his punishment should be much more severe - and as America's 'Founding Fathers' intended. In a column for World Net Daily entitled, 'Time to Stretch Neck of Jihadist Punk', Nugent wrote: 'Imagine if this Jihadist punk had basically committed the same crimes 150 years ago. He would have been swinging from an oak tree in Boston Common no longer than 60 days from the date of his arrest. That would be justice.' The charging documents reveal dramatic new details of the investigation and events following the bombings, including a list of items obtained from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's college dorm room and claims that during a carjacking at least one suspect was advertising his role in the marathon bombings. 'Although our investigation is ongoing, today’s charges bring a successful end to a tragic week for the city of Boston, and for our country,' U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. He will not be tried as an enemy . combatant because he is a naturalized U.S. citizen and under federal . law, citizens cannot be tried in military commissions, the White House . said Monday. Instead, he will be tried in the U.S. justice system. Wounded: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here moments after he was pulled from the boat where he was hiding, suffered a throat wound and a leg wound . Tsaernaev, . who was born in Russia, remains under heavy guard while he receives treatment for his injuries. His older brother and suspected accomplice in the bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a firefight with police early Friday morning. The twin bombings last Monday killed three people and injured more than 180. The younger Tsarnaev was captured alive following a massive manhunt involving hundreds of law enforcement officials. He was eventually discovered hiding in a boat parked outside a home in Watertown, Mass. CARJACKING . The charging papers allege that the Tsarnaev brothers carjacked a man around midnight on Thursday and that the eldest of the two told the car's owner that he had carried out the marathon bombings. 'The victim stated that while he was sitting in his car on a road in Cambridge, a man approached and tapped on his passenger-side window,' according to the charges. 'When the victim rolled down the window, the man reached in, opened the door, and entered the victim's vehicle. The man pointed a firearm at the victim and stated, ""Did you hear about the Boston explosion?"" and ""I did that.""' The gunman, identified by the FBI as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, removed the magazine from his firearm to show the victim that it was loaded, then re-inserted it and said, 'I am serious.' Dzhokhar, right, and his older brother Tamerlan, left, are suspected accomplices in the marathon bombings . Tamerlan Tsarnaev then allegedly forced the victim to drive to a location where they picked up Dzhokhar. One of the suspects then got behind the wheel of the car and demanded money and an ATM card from the victim. The suspects drove to a gas station and got out of the car to withdraw money, at which point the victim managed to escape. FIREFIGHT . The stolen vehicle with the two suspects inside was located by authorities a short time later in Watertown, Mass. As police cruisers descended on the scene, the men threw at least two small IEDs from the car windows, sparking a firefight. During the exchange of fire, the older Tsarnaev brother, Tamerlan, got out of the car and was shot several times. Meanwhile, the younger brother managed to escape in the car - but not without first mowing over his brother's body. Tamerlan was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead, and authorities launched a manhunt for Dzhokhar, who apparently abandoned the carjacked vehicle shortly after making his getaway. Site: A blood stain can be seen on the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding after a massive manhunt that left the Boston area paralyzed in fear . CACHE OF EXPLOSIVES . From the scene of the shootout, the FBI recovered two unexploded IEDs, as well as the remnants of numerous exploded devices. Another in-tact device was found inside the abandoned vehicle. A preliminary examination of the explosive devices that were used at the Boston Marathon revealed that they were low-grade explosives housed inside pressure cookers with metallic BBs and nails. Many of the BBs were contained within an adhesive material, authorities said. Found: Authorities discovered a white hat and black jacket in Dzhokar Tsarnaev's (left) dormroom like the ones worn by the suspect in photos from the day of the bombings . Investigators discovered the exact same type of explosives at the scene of the firefight and inside the abandoned getaway car. MANHUNT . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was on the run for nearly a full day when authorities located him hiding in a boat parked outside a home in Watertown. He engaged in a firefight with police from inside the boat before he was eventually coaxed out of the vessel, authorities said. He had visible injuries, including apparent gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand. He was searched and authorities found several means of identification in his pockets, including credit cards and a Dartmouth student ID. 'At the end they were just making . demands of him: Show your hands, lift your shirt. And eventually that's . what he did,' Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told ABC News. 'He . was very slow and lethargic in every move that he made and they could . see that there was no device on his chest. They kept creeping closer to . him and then they felt it safe enough to pull him away from the boat.' Authorities initially said they couldn't question the terror suspect because of his severe throat wound. 'We . are hoping, for a host of reasons, that the suspect survives, because . we have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered,' Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said. Authorities conducted a search at Tsarnaev's Dartmouth dorm, where they found a pyrotechnic as well as a white hat and black jacket like the ones he is pictured wearing in surveillance footage from the scene of the marathon bombings. MARATHON BOMBINGS . The charging documents also contain new details about the marathon bombings and allege that at least one of the suspects was using a cell phone shortly before the explosions. The documents state that at approximately 2:41 p.m. - about eight minutes before the explosions -  both bombing suspects were standing together about a half-block from the Forum Restaurant on Boylston Street near the finish line, according to footage from surveillance cameras. About one minute later, one suspect - believed to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev - appears to break away from the crowd and begin walking east on Boylston street toward the finish line. At 2:45 p.m., Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - referred to in the charging documents as 'Bomber Two' - walks in the same direction but stops short of the finish line, directly in front of Forum Restaurant. 'He appears to have the thumb of his right hand hooked under the strap of his knapsack and a cell phone in his left hand,' FBI special agent Daniel R. Genck wrote in the documents. About 15 seconds later, 'Bomber Two' appears to drop his knapsack to the ground. The suspect  stays in that position for about four minutes, occasionally looking at his cell phone and once appearing to snap a picture with it. 'At some point he appears to look at his phone, which is held at approximately waist level, and may be manipulating the phone,' the charging papers state. 'Approximately 30 seconds before the first explosion, he lifts his phone to his ear as if he is speaking on his cell phone, and keeps it there for approximately 18 seconds. 'A few seconds after he finishes the call, the large crowd of people around him can be seen reacting to the first explosion.' As others are reacting to the explosion, 'Bomber Two' 'calmly but rapidly' begins moving away from the finish line  - without his knapsack, which he had left on the ground. About 10 seconds later, an explosion occurs in the location of the discarded knapsack. 'I can discern nothing in that location in the period before the explosion that might have caused that explosion, other than Bomber Two's knapsack,' Genck wrote.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was arraigned in his hospital bed, where he remains in serious condition .

The first 1,200 litres will soon be shipped to Norwich, where scientists from the John Innes Centre will work on getting authorisation for commercial sale. The purple tomatoes have anti-inflammatory effects and were shown to slow down cancer in mice. They also have double the shelf life. The colour of the tomatoes is derived from high levels of anthocyanins, compounds normally found in blueberries, blackberries and other deeply coloured berries. Professor Cathie Martin, from the John Innes Centre, said: ‘We want to explore a way for consumers to benefit from our discoveries, as we are finding there is a demand for the added health benefits.’ Research so far has been funded by the EU and through the John Innes Centre’s strategic funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

Professor Martin has worked with Professor Jonathan Jones, from The Sainsbury Laboratory, to form the UK’s first GM crop spin-out company, Norfolk Plant Sciences, to explore the commercial potential of plants with increased levels of health-giving compounds. The tomatoes and juice are set to be used to study the effects of a high anthocyanin diet on cancer, cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases. Other varieties, high in compounds such as resveratrol normally found in red wine, are already being used to develop skin care products in collaboration with Essex company Biodeb. Bringing the juice to the food market will require regulatory approval and may be possible in as little as two years in North America.

City trader Robin Clark has said he thought he was going to die after he was shot as he got out of a car at Shenfield railway station, in Essex . The City trader dubbed the 'Wolf of Shenfield' has described how he said a prayer as he thought he was going to die after being shot in the leg while on his way to work. Robin Clark is currently under armed guard in hospital while he is treated for a serious leg injury. The 44-year-old was shot by a man in a balaclava as he got out of his friend's car at Shenfield railway station, in Essex, at about 5.45am on Friday. Speaking to The Sun from his hospital bed, Mr Clark has described the moment he was shot. He said: 'I put my hand over the wound and felt a reasonable amount of blood come out. 'I said a quick prayer because I thought this was going to be the end. 'I thought I was going to bleed to death before any help would come.' Mr Clark said he could not think of why anybody would have attacked him, ruling out links to money or relationships. British Transport Police, who have made no arrests in the case, interviewed Mr Clark yesterday after letting him recover from his injuries. Detective Superintendent Gary Richardson today said: 'We are continuing our investigation into the incident at Shenfield rail station on Friday, 24 January and are currently pursuing several lines of enquiry. 'I can confirm we have now interviewed the victim at some length. This has provided us with a number of investigative leads. He currently remains in hospital. 'Officers have undertaken a range of enquiries in relation to this investigation, including liaising with local police, interviewing witnesses, and conducting visits to the railway station. Mr Clark is currently under armed guard in hospital as he is treated for a serious leg injury . 'We will be carrying out another . return visit to the railway station on Friday morning, one week after . the attack, during which we will be distributing information to . commuters in an attempt to identify anyone who might be able to assist . the enquiry.' Just days . before the shooting, Mr Clark hinted that he was in financial trouble as . he shared a message on Twitter stating: ‘At what point on a first date . do you mention you are emotionally unstable and in financial ruin?' The . comment – originally made by another Twitter user before being . retweeted, or forwarded, by Mr Clark – was his penultimate message . before he was wounded. Officers have said they have been unable to establish a motive for the shooting so far. Mr Clark, a twice-divorced father-of-four, last year rented out his £2.2million five-bedroom house in nearby Ingatestone after running into debt. Also last year, a county court judgment was filed against him for debts of £14,653 and he was director of a number of companies that were shut down while owing money. Armed officers from Essex Police were scrambled to the scene on Friday while a large section of the car park was taped off . Mr Clark had just got out of a car at Shenfield railway station, in Essex, when the attack took place on Friday . The day before the shooting Mr Clark had tried to sell his Range Rover for £10,000. He . is thought to have already sold two Porsches. Luxury car dealer Steve . Hurn, from Stowmarket in Suffolk, said Mr Clark had been a ‘prolific car . buyer’ until he went through a ‘messy divorce’ around 18 months ago. Over the past few years he had bought a number of expensive cars including Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Maseratis. Mr Hurn said: ‘His great love is classic cars and particularly Porsches. But from what I understand Robin is having a few money difficulties. I think he used to have two Porsches but he had to sell them because he hasn’t got any money. Former home: Mr Clark had lived in this £2.2million house in the village of Stock, Essex . ‘I spoke to him for about ten minutes on . Thursday about his Range Rover which he wanted me to sell. He wanted to . get rid of it and said it was sitting on his drive.’ Mr Clark works as a euro derivatives trader at RP Martin, a  brokerage firm in the City of London. He is reportedly known as the Wolf of Shenfield – after the recent Leonardo DiCaprio film The Wolf of Wall Street – because of his playboy lifestyle. Affluent Shenfield is 24 minutes by train from central London and is a popular place for City workers to live.","Robin Clark was shot by a man in a balaclava at Shenfield railway station .

And celebrities including Lorraine Kelly, Chesney Hawkes, Lewis Moody, swimmer Sharron Davies, and Paralympian Jonnie Peacock are just some of her more famous fans. Pretty Zoey Peace, 26, from Cambridgeshire, was struggling to cope with the heartache of being apart from boyfriend Cpl Sam Garwood, 24, from Norfolk, while he serves on the front line in Afghanistan. Zoey Peace - left, with soldier boyfriend Cpl Sam Garwood - has kept him abreast of her life while he's on tour in Afghanistan by writing a daily blog, right, until he comes home in February . So she kept herself busy by launching a morale-boosting blog, Until February, charting her bid to become the perfect girlfriend by the time Sam gets home next year. In the funny, touchingly and honest . diary, Zoey outlines her plans to become a 'domestic goddess', to lose . 'a stone in weight' and to 'master DIY'. As . well as regular updates on her progress, she also posts hilarious photos . and links to keep Sam in touch with the day-to-day life he is missing . out on. So far Zoey has . captured playing with sparklers on bonfire night, wearing Remembrance . Day poppies, beautiful sunrises near her home, and even . eating toasted soldiers for breakfast. The blogger admits to regularly getting emotional and bursting into tears when she misses . Sam, and recounts heartwarming tales of being helped and comforted by kind strangers. And at the end of each entry the smitten girlfriend lists what she has missed most about her soldier that day. Zoey's creative blog has now . attracted thousands of daily followers and become a huge hit among all . the soldiers in Camp Bastion. To . keep Sam and his pals spirits up over Christmas, Zoey has used her blog . to launch #smilecampbastion, where friends and family are pictured with a . written sign, which simply reads 'Smile Camp Bastion'. So far Zoey has captured playing with sparklers on bonfire night, hanging out with the Seven Dwarves, wearing Remembrance Day poppies, beautiful sunrises near her home, and even eating toasted soldiers for breakfast . The idea has even been backed by a host of celebrities including World Cup winning rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, Inbetweeners star James Buckley, Lorraine Kelly, England rugby legend Lewis Moody, Sharron Davies, Bath rugby team and 90s singer Chesney Hawkes, all of whom have tweeted their support for her. Delighted Zoey, from Cambridge, said she started the blog because she refused to sit around listening to soppy music and crying while Sam is away. She said: 'It's funny because Sam will say that the other soldiers will update him on the blog too when he hasn't even had chance to read it. 'I really like that it gives everyone a little boost from home, shows how we are all getting on with it and just doing ordinary things. 'My biggest achievement since he left in September has to be learning how to put a shelf up and I am currently re-tiling my kitchen too. 'Some may walk along the Great Wall of China to do something amazing - but I really needed to put that shelf up and so that was quite amazing for me.I write on it every day and try and find myself little tests and challenges.' 'I want to show a different side to the military girlfriend and that's important to Sam, because sometimes there's negativity around the army but people must know there is a brave and positive side too' Zoey, whose boyfriend Sam is from Norfolk, started her blog, called Until February - when Sam is due home - at the start of November. The events executive at the Royal Society of Chemistry, said she wanted to support him doing what he loved most - serving with the Royal Logistics Corps on his fifth tour overseas. Soldiers are limited to time on the phone and internet, which left Zoey worried Sam would miss out on all the fun they usually have together.

'So with the help of my loyal girlfriends, armed with some Nigella cook books (could she make cooking any more sexual, who knew you could make whisking an egg a turn on - go you, Nigella!) alcohol and bad dancing this is my diary of an unconventional army girlfriend.'

The blog has dozens of photos of attractive Zoey larking around in a bid to keep her soldier boyfriend's morale up. It also includes flashes of humour, in place of the jokes the couple would usually share together. One funny entry reads: 'Whilst on the train a man aged roughly 45 sat next to me in a squirrel outfit, he smelt of wee and was very grumpy! I personally liked Mamma G's reply when I text her my squirrel update: ""He must have had big nuts to go out dressed like that."" Zoey also talks readers through the life of a soldier's girlfriend, including requesting her first ever 'bluey' envelope at the post office. She summarises her life as 'not being able to go for dinner at friends' houses if you don't get phone signal there,' and 'realising I have awful handwriting now I write 'real' letters.' Zoey tries to add a touch of humour to daily life on the front line for her boyfriend Sam and his comrades at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . Zoey also writes about struggling . with the 'low' moments which hit all soldiers' loved-ones. She wrote: . 'Had a slight moment though when waiting for a connecting train. 'Went to . Costa ordered a soya chai tea latte (standard) burst into tears, nice . lady sat me down asked me what's wrong and pathetically I said that the . last time I had this coffee you were waiting for me with it at the train . station. 'I hadn't . actually appreciated how romantic that was especially for you and so I'm . thanking you now for A) getting me a lovely hot beverage B) remembering . my favourite drink C) Waiting for me on the platform.' The daily messages to Sam have become a surprise must-read after the blog was spotted by the Help for Heroes charity, which tweeted a link to it. Zoey Peace's blog is called Until February, because that is when her boyfriend Cpl Sam Garwood is coming home from the front line . For her latest challenge Zoey has enlisted the support of celebrities to capture photographs of themselves holding signs saying '#smileCampBastion'. She has received twitter support from rugby star Lewis Moody, swimmer Sharron Davies, Lorraine Kelly, singer Chesney Hawkes and Paralympian Jonnie Peacock. She added: 'I do lots of things with my friends and I'm lucky that I have been inundated with people trying to help me pass the time. 'I will never be short of dinner dates, but I always make sure I have signal when I'm out and about because you'll never know when he may call. 'It is the quiet moments, at night especially, its very difficult to get use to watching the TV with him in a picture frame not sat next to you. 'But I want to show a different side to the military girlfriend and that's important to Sam, because sometimes there's negativity around the army but people must know there is a brave and positive side too.'

'Crush': Wendi Deng wrote that she missed Tony Blair and his charm, his body and his 'butt' Rupert Murdoch’s feud with Tony Blair over Wendi Deng flared up again last night after claims  that the tycoon had bullied the ‘embarrassed’ Prime Minister into becoming godfather to his and Ms Deng’s daughter. In an investigation into reports that Mr Blair’s overnight stays with Ms Deng contributed to the Murdochs’ divorce, the Labour-supporting Guardian newspaper claimed: . Friends of Mr Murdoch last night hit back at the newspaper’s suggestion that he pressured a reluctant Mr Blair into becoming godfather  to his daughter Grace, then aged eight, in 2010. ‘It doesn’t ring true,’ said one London-based confidant of the media mogul. ‘The christening  was all Wendi’s doing, Rupert had virtually nothing to do with it.’ The source criticised the Guardian, saying: ‘It has made a lot of false statements about Rupert without bothering to check.’ Another Murdoch ally suggested Mr Blair may have had an ulterior motive for agreeing to become godfather: ‘He was raising money from Rupert for his causes at that time.’ Explaining the bitter rift between Mr Blair and News Corp boss Mr Murdoch, the Guardian said: ‘Hell hath few furies like a mogul who feels cuckolded by a man he had come to see as a true friend.’ It claimed Mr Blair was about to tell Mr Murdoch about one of his two overnight stays with Ms Deng at Mr Murdoch’s home in Carmel, California, in 2012, but held his tongue when Murdoch and Ms Deng’s daughters, Grace, now 12, and Chloe, now ten, entered the room. Feuding: Mr Blair and Mr Murdoch pictured together in 2008 . ‘He should have left, say friends, but didn’t and we’re no longer there to tell him not to be an idiot,’ said the Guardian. ‘He should have told Murdoch when next they met, but didn’t. In the loyalist version, the Murdoch girls burst in just as he was about to.’ The newspaper said Mr Murdoch believes the allegations are true. ‘And so do loyal News Corp colleagues and the four children from his first two marriages.’ The Guardian continues: ‘Though friends insist Blair and his wife Cherie are a contented couple (despite long separations she works as a barrister, does charity work and has other interests) or that she would not tolerate affairs, rumours have inevitably become attached to him.’ In an investigation into reports that Mr Blair's overnight stays with Ms Deng contributed to the Murdochs' divorce, the Labour-supporting Guardian newspaper claimed . The Guardian says a woman friend of Blair said: ‘He likes women around him, he’s rather flirty.’ The newspaper says his ‘friends seem to accept [his] assurances’ the allegations about Ms Deng are untrue, but adds money is the Blairs’ Achilles heel. ‘Blair stresses the need to fund and staff his philanthropic foundations, but his fondness for yachts, executive jets and Barbados holidays (“How much would I need to have a place like this?” he supposedly asked when staying at Cliff Richard’s home), is more apparent.’ The report follows the publication of a note in which Ms Deng wrote of her ‘crush’: ‘I’m so so missing Tony. He is so charming and his clothes are so good. He has such good body and he has really really good legs.’ It referred to his ‘butt’ and continued: ‘.  .  . and what else and what else and what else...’ The Guardian suggests Mr Murdoch, 82, could not keep up with Ms Deng, 45. ‘Rupert would be going to the gym at 6am just as Wendi was coming in from a party.’ It says Mr Blair’s enemies have a new joke: ‘Why did Blair betray a friend? Because he could.’","Rupert Murdoch's feud with Tony Blair over Wendi Deng flared up again after claims the tycoon bullied the PM into becoming godfather to daughter .

Dunn . claimed he acted in self-defense, testifying he thought he saw a . firearm pointed at him from the SUV as Davis yelled insults at him and . the argument escalated. No weapon was found in the SUV. Dunn . told jurors he feared for his life, perceiving 'this was a clear and . present danger.'  Dunn, who has a concealed weapons permit, fired 10 . shots, hitting the vehicle nine times. Prosecutors . contended that Dunn opened fire because he felt disrespected by Davis.

Family: Roberts with Nancy Motes and their mother Betty Lou when the star was filming 1997's My Best Friend's Wedding. The star's mother was reportedly hospitalized this week . Upset: Julia Roberts' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon . However according to the NY Daily News, a lawyer for the family said her mother Betty Lou Motes was being treated in hospital but would give no further details as to her condition. A coroner's official revealed no further details as to whom Ms Motes' body had been released. MailOnline had reached out to Ms Roberts' representative for comment. On Tuesday, Julia . Roberts' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she . visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her . younger daughter, Nancy Motes. Dressed in a tartan hat and black . jacket, Ms Motes was driven by a friend from her . home in Pacific Palisades to Julia's mansion in Malibu. On Thursday, John . Fraschetti, a friend of Nancy' Motess grieving fiancé, John Dilbeck, claims the . family of the Oscar winner are now only interested in manipulating . public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, 'drove her to . death.' Making the . incendiary comments today outside Nancy and Dilbeck's home, Fraschetti . said that Nancy spiraled into depression after her and Roberts' mother, . Betty Lou Motes, 'rejected' her six months ago - and that she 'just . couldn't handle it anymore'. 'And . then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she . didn’t want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.' Cut-off: Nancy Motes is pictured in this photo with Julia Roberts when the Oscar winning actress was around 22 years old . Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her in an apparent suicide. She left behind a five-page letter which Fraschetti claims to have seen. Friend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide . Fraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction. ‘They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,' said Fraschetti. Labeling them 'a family that drove her to death', Fraschetti said that Nancy, 'couldn't stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.' 'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn't handle it anymore.' Fraschetti admitted that Nancy's well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable. ‘They didn’t care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there’s a way to deal with your relatives,' said an angry Fraschetti. Nancy's suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family's rejection had sent her to. 'It . read about how much she loved and cared for her fiancé and how happy he . made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made . her and how she couldn’t cope anymore,' said Fraschetti, who said that . fiancé, Dilbeck, is grief-stricken by Nancy's death and can't face the . media. Ms Motes and Mr Dilbeck were due to marry on May 17. Indicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets. But, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar-winning sister, including 'Just so you all know ""America's Sweetheart"" is a B****!!' on January 20. That and others were indeed deleted on Tuesday morning. See more of the interview on Inside Edition on Monday . Support: Dressed in a tartan hat and black . jacket, Betty Lou Motes, left, was driven by a friend, right, from her . home in Pacific Palisades to Julia's mansion in Malibu . ‘We’ve got a person who is grieving . so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, . so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,' said . Fraschetti. 'It’s the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he’s the one who’s in agony, he’s the one that’s genuine.' And in an apparent confirmation that . she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was . planned, but that she didn't use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman. 'She wasn’t into heroin, as far as I was aware. It’s not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it’s ridiculous. ‘I . wouldn’t read too much into where she did it, it wasn’t in some drug . den. She was dog-sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn’t have . to do it at home and let John find her.' Gone too soon: Nancy Motes, pictured in August . (left), died on Sunday from an apparent drug overdose; she is the . half-sister of Julia Roberts (right) On . Twitter, Ms Motes sounded decidedly unstable, lashing out at Julia, whom she . claims bullied her about her weight when they were growing up. 'So . my ""sister"" said that with all her friends & fans she doesn't need . any more love. Just so you all know ""America's Sweetheart"" is a B****!!' she tweeted on January 20, referring to Roberts. 'Do . you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She's not even that good of . an actress. Happy you totally F***ed with me?' she added in a subsequent . tweet before claiming she'd never been more angry. 'I must admit I maybe going to far… But I never been so angry in my life. I'm actually a pretty easygoing, peaceful person.' '(M)y own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted January 22. Three weeks later, she was dead. The emotional comments, seen on the Twitter handle @Dabbs76, had been deleted by Tuesday morning. Rage: Nancy Motes, tweeted under her husband-to-be's last name online. This vitriolic attack is believed to be against her half-sister, Julia Roberts and happened a little more than a month before she died . Pain: Nancy Motes is also believed to have launched these attacks on the star of Pretty Woman and Mystic Pizza - calling her cruel and blaming her for causing her rage despite her best efforts to remain calm . Sad: Nancy Motes posted these bittersweet tweets in October - in which she laments that she is having to leave her family to find the love she craves from another . The most recent Twitter outburst followed similar rants late last year. For example, Nancy had written previously of her family abandoning her. 'Feeling blessed, even though I'm sick as a dog! I'm very grateful that I have my loves family, since my own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted, referring to her new partner. Her next tweets also appeared to be angrily directed at the Notting Hill star. She tweeted: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You’re going to LOVE what’s coming! FYI-You’re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human. 'I must be grateful & not hateful. I must forgive. But Damn that is a REALLY hard thing to do sometimes, right?!?!' Back on December 19, Nancy also . sounded depressed. She wrote: 'I must remember how blessed I am even in . this very low point in my life. I want ALL of my family to have an . awesome magical Christmas!' Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner's Office, reported this week: ‘The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks. ‘A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We’re not releasing what illegal drugs they were. ‘It could be a possible suicide, but we don’t know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It’s more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we’re not sure what happened at the moment. 'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don’t know at this stage.' Julia Roberts cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday. Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee. Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts.

A baby Prince Charles was 'fascinated' by his newborn sister Princess Anne, according to a rare letter written by the Queen just days after the birth. Less than two years old at the time, Charles treated Anne with 'great care', the Queen wrote to her friend Mrs Tanner. She also wrote that 'it will be fun when they are able to play together'.

Now, the two page letter giving a glimpse into the rarely seen family life of the royals will go on sale for £600, 64 years after it was written. In the letter, which offers an insight into the Queen's life as a young mother, she thanks her correspondent for the good wishes upon the 'arrival of our daughter'. Continuing, she writes: 'The baby is quite unlike her brother, so it will . be interesting to see whom she will take after when she is older.' Written in fountain pen, it is dated 3 September, 1950 - just 19 days after Anne's arrival on August 15. The letter came from Clarence House where the Queen lived with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, before she became queen two years later. The Queen wrote in her letter that it would be 'fun' when Prince Charles and Princess Anne could play together . The letter is accompanied by two unsigned vintage Press photographs of the young Prince Charles and Princess Anne in different poses in the gardens of the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions which is selling the item, said it was rare to find a letter of this nature written by Her Majesty. Davie said: 'Charles is clearly quite fond of his sibling and he appears to be a really sweet child.' He further revealed that it is unusual for a letter like to come up for auction as most people hang on to their letters from the Queen. Queen said in the letter that two-year-old Charles treated Anne with 'great care' Prince Charles and Princess Anne with the Queen Mother at the Trooping the Colour in 1974 . 'The Queen has been a prolific letter writer over the years but most recipients have kept their letter. 'Most letters are not going to be of this nature and it highlights really well the Queen's maternal instincts, which makes it an interesting read. Davie said that although he was unsure of what the receipent, Mrs. Tanner's, relation to the Queen was, he could make a few assumptions. 'I don't know who Mrs Tanner is but she lived in Windsor judging by the envelope which came with the letter. 'She may have been part of the Royal household because she appears on close terms with the Queen. Charles and Anne have remained close throughout adulthood too, and are members of the Order of the Garter .

A woman too heavy to leave her parents’ basement for over two years has received a new lease of life after radical weight loss surgery. Olivia, 46, from Cicero, Illinois, weighed around 43st, and had not left the house since a suicide attempt in 2012, due to a lack of mobility and weight-related depression. In a last-ditch effort to turn her life around, Olivia moved to Houston to seek pioneering surgery from a specialist in the super morbidly obese. Olivia's near 600lb frame meant she had been reliant on oxygen for 11 years and was confined to her parents basement . Olivia moved across the country to live with her brother (pictured here with her brother's wife) in Houston in the hope of getting the surgery she needed . As well as causing extreme medical problems, Olivia's weight had made her depressed, causing her to attempt to take her own life in 2012 . There, Olivia was finally able to get the risky . bariatric surgery she needed to shed the weight that had effectively . been keeping her prisoner. Previously totally dependent on her family for even her most basic needs, Olivia had dreamed of living on her own and re-joining society. However her mobility was severely restricted by lymphodema: one of Olivia's legs had ballooned, due to blockage in her lymph system, which made it very painful to move around at all. Pre-surgery, Olivia confessed: ‘My body is my prison. I have been hiding from the world just waiting to die. It scares me to think that one day I might not wake up because of my weight. ‘Sometime it feels like I'm dead, that I'm not alive. My weight is killing me. ‘Just moving around is hard with this weight hanging over my knees. That’s why I don’t go out, I don’t leave the house. ‘I want to get up and just leave but I can’t. I haven’t been out in society in two years. ‘If I am feeling alone, sad, depressed, food is what makes me happy because that is what comforts me. Olivia being checked into hospital where she underwent life-saving bariatric surgery from Dr Nowzaradan who specialises in weight loss surgery on the super morbidly obese . ‘I'm eating and eating and I know that I’m full and I can feel that I'm full, but I’m still eating. ‘If I wasn’t this size I would probably be someone right now. I want my house, my car, my life; I want all of that back. Olivia suffered numerous health problems brought on by her weight and was dependent on breathing equipment to get enough oxygen. ‘For the last seven years I have been in and out of the hospital constantly for my illnesses and depression. ‘I have been on oxygen now for 11 years; I sleep with it, I wake up with it, I survive with it. Olivia depended on her twin sister Olga and mother Minerva for food, to take her to the doctor and help her with her oxygen supplies. After her surgery, Olivia spent three months in hospital recovering and having her food intake closely monitored . ‘I was afraid for her to be by herself,’ Minerva says, ‘she wants to be independent but she is not in a good place right now. ‘ . Olivia’s reliance on her loved ones in itself took a toll on her emotionally. ‘I fear being a burden on my family. They do everything for me.’ Bullied for her size growing up, Olivia dropped out of high school in her senior year because she couldn’t face the constant ridicule. However, this signalled the start of her descent into morbid obesity. ‘I started putting on weight in elementary school. It was due to bullying and molestation. 'I was molested when I was eight and I kept it secret until I was 40. 'As time went on I started putting on a lot of weight. By high school I would say I probably weigh about 250lbs. I just didn’t care anymore. Putting on the weight is how I avoided people.’ Olivia had gastric band surgery seven years ago but failed to lose weight. ‘I know they say you have to put in effort but I just gave up on myself. Though still with a way to go on her weight loss journey, Olivia is looking forward to her future and being more independent . ‘On a typical day I really don’t do anything. It feels like these walls are closing in on me. ‘Two years ago I gave up; being here, being sick. I tried to commit suicide. I have never felt so low. In 2013, Olivia decided to move to Houston, leaving her twin sister behind for the first time ever, to live with her brother in the hope of receiving bariatric surgery from Dr Nowzaradan, who specialises in weight loss surgery on the super morbidly obese. After removing the existing band in Olivia's stomach, Dr Nowzaradan performed a sleeve gastrectomy. Olivia was left with a small, banana-shaped cavity that only allows her to eat tiny amounts at a time. Following the operation Olivia spent three months in hospital, dropping to 360lb (25st 7lb). Once home, Olivia's loss slowed as she struggled to adjust to managing her diet on her own. However, seven months after the surgery, her weight finally dropped below 300lb, allowing her to undergo further surgery to remove the excess skin and lymphodema. Requiring a four foot incision and over 500 blood vessels to be cut, a mass of excess tissue and skin  weighing 40lb was removed. Although Olivia's journey from 43st 8lbs to 18st has been at times traumatic, she is now looking forward to the future for the first time in years. 'I think another 100lb and I will probably be where i want to be,' she says. 'I'm excited. the last time I felt this free was probably in grammar school.' Olivia is now able to walk with the aid of a stick and is no longer dependent on oxygen cannisters. ‘I do things I couldn’t do before: I couldn’t pull up my socks, I couldn’t touch my toes. I just want to get on with things. Live my life. 'This journey was not easy, with every pain every stitch, every tear that I cried. But I didn’t give up . 'I have been reborn and brought back to life.’ Olivia appears on My 600lb Life, Tuesday at 11pm on TLC .","Olivia had not left her parents basement in over two years .

Little wonder, then, that the Prince of Wales has brought out his own handcrafted hive. The sting in the tail? Its £1,250 price tag. The ‘Top Bar Bee Hive’ is currently for sale on his Highgrove website. All profits from the range go to the Prince’s charities. Honey pot: Prince Charles is selling his handcrafted Top Bar Bee Hive for £1,250 on the Highgrove website . Charles has spoken passionately about the plight of the bee. In the UK, wild honey bees are nearly extinct and some species of bumblebee have been lost altogether. Poor weather and pesticides have resulted in the death of a third of all honeybee colonies in England. The prince supports beekeepers’ associations through The Prince’s Countryside Fund, as well as keeping bees on his Highgrove Estate in Gloucestershire. The website boasts that the  ‘Top Bar’ Bee Hive allows the insects to live in an environment which is sustainable and low-impact, more akin to their natural environment. Made from FSC cedar and larch in Gloucestershire, the design allows bees to form a natural comb. Prince Charles, a keen environmentalist, has spoke out about the plight of the British honey bee . The hive has a base trough filled with ‘natural woodland material’ creating an enclosed natural ecosystem allowing beneficial insects to live in harmony with the bees. The hinged roof also allows easy access and maintenance and observation windows allow monitoring of the activity and progress of the creatures inside. Each bee hive is completely bespoke and takes between 8-12 weeks to be produced. It is painted in the Highgrove duck-egg blue colours. The hive isn’t the only luxury animal home the prince has created, however. He also sold a hen house – also for charity - costing an eye-watering £3,750. There was even was a £95 house for hibernating hedgehogs, inspired by the garden furniture at his country home.","Top Bar Bee Hive for sale on Highgrove website for £1,250 .

After her scene stealing appearance in the Queen's diamonds on Tuesday night, the Duchess of Cambridge was back to earth with a bump in grittier surroundings today . Its programme helps youngsters to grow in self-confidence and self-esteem and, hopefully, engage in their education. Kensington Palace said the Duchess chose to link herself to the charity as it ‘reflects her interest in the arts and her particular interest in using the creativity of art to enrich the lives of young people’.With studios in Oxford and London, Northolt High School has been chosen as the charity’s seventh venture as it is a school serving a diverse population.

The Art Room offers art therapy to children aged five to 16 years old who are facing challenges in their lives, and has six other studios at schools in Oxfordshire and London.

The firm donates all of its revenue and commissions made on the day to charity. Up to 60 children each week will use the Art Room, some of them coming from neighbouring schools, working with art therapists in group sessions designed to build up their self-confidence and self-esteem. It has been proven to reduce children’s emotional and behavioural problems. The Duchess was greeted by raucous applause by the school’s 1,000 pupils when she arrived in the school hall .

Perched just nine yards from the cliff edge and facing the certain prospect of falling into the North Sea, this house was unlikely to top any new buyers' wish list. But the semi-detached home in Easton Bavents near Southwold in Suffolk has sold, a month before it was due to go up for auction. The property was snapped up by mystery buyers, lured, it is thought, by a council policy aimed at helping the new owner build a brand new property in a safer spot once their new home has been demolished. Now: The house, which is about 26ft from the edge of the cliff following December's surge tides at Easton Bavents near Southwold, has sold for an undisclosed sum . In 1998: The house, near the centre of this picture, was on firmer ground before neighbouring buildings disappeared . The house was a mile inland in the 17th century but is now just 26ft from the crumbling cliff edge. There has been continuous erosion over the centuries, with the house 'moving' 2ft closer to the sea during storms which lashed the cliffs last month. The home was bought for an undisclosed sum after being listed with a guide price of between £25,000 and £50,000. It was due to be offered for auction on March 13 by Aldreds of Great Yarmouth. But the sale completed on February 5 after the mystery buyer came forward. And complete with their keys, the new owners have the promise from Waveney District Council that they will be given financial help - believed to be to the tune of £10,000 - and planning permission to demolish their stricken home and build a new property on a safer plot in the area. The authority has established a special scheme to help those homeowners at risk of losing their homes to the force of nature. Andrew McTear, whose insolvency firm is selling the house, said: ‘We have been very clear about the property~s future and have informed interested parties of the problems. 'The only reason anyone would want to purchase it is for the opportunity it affords for the development of another site in the locality.' Speaking when the house went on the market, Mr McTear said: 'It may sound crazy to try selling a house that close to the edge of an eroding cliff. November 2010: Waveney District Council said assistance would be available under its scheme for new owners of blighted houses . October 2009: Waveney council's Pathfinder scheme has offered nine Easton Bavents landowners up to £25,000 towards building and moving costs . December 2008: The council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available . ‘But by owning this property you could potentially get planning permission for another plot of land that you wouldn't otherwise be able to. Coastal erosion is the wearing away of rock by destructive waves hitting the coastline. There are four major forms: . ‘Plots of land near Southwold with planning permission are clearly highly sought-after, so we hope to be able to sell the clifftop home, even in the knowledge that it will have to be demolished.’ Waveney council's Pathfinder scheme has offered nine Easton Bavents landowners up to £25,000 towards building and moving costs. Coun David Ritchie, chairman of the Pathfinder board, said: ‘If you are in danger of losing your property to erosion and you sell it, the new owner would still have planning rights to build elsewhere. ‘The whole policy is an attempt to deal with coastal blight, so it could work to buy a house on a clifftop and move inland and take their planning permission with them.’ The council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available for this. Laura Martin, who lives next door to the home which has been sold, admitted she could not afford to buy or build another house elsewhere. She added that her long-term plan was to live in a caravan in her back garden, which is further inland than her house. The 57-year-old said: ‘I've got no plans to try and demolish my house because it's not in immediate danger but you can't make predictions about the future rate of erosion - nobody can.’ Other examples of major coastal erosion have happened across Britain over the past few years. Last April a house bought for £154,000 in a telephone auction by retired police officer Ann Diamond in February 2010 fell 300ft into the sea off Torquay, Devon. In parts of East Anglia, the fast receding coastline has been severely damaged - with 6,000 truckloads of sands washed away in just three years at Hopton-on-Sea beach in Norfolk. Worried owners of a holiday park overlooking the beach said the damage threatens the future of the seafront.","House in Easton Bavents near Southwold, Suffolk, was a mile inland in 17th century but is now just 26ft from edge .

Wye Valley NHS Trust, in Hertfordshire, paid £3,717 for one doctor to work a 30-hour shift, the highest single payment of any NHS body. Some doctors were paid not just for the hours they spent in the hospital, but also time they spent on call, including time they spent asleep. In total £242million was spent by A&E departments in 2013 on agency doctors, enough to pay for 3,00 full time consultants . An investigation by The Sunday Telegraph revealed that a total bill for all agency workers in 2013 was £242million, enough to pay for 3,000 consultants or 7,000 junior doctors. Data showed that NHS hospitals are regularly employing shift workers to cover staff shortages, despite senior managers insisting that rates of £1,000 or more were only paid in crisis situations. Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust paid above that rate on 719 occasions last year, Kettering General Hospital Foundation Trust paid out 595 times. Barking, Redbridge, and Havering University HospitalsTrust in Essex, which was placed into special measures over a severe shortage of senior casualty doctors, had the highest total bill at £7.9million. Dr Cliff Mann, the most senior A&E doctor in the UK, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'The use of agency doctors has become endemic in the NHS. 'There are units which would implode if they weren't relying on them day in, day out. 'The worst of it is that with the money we are wasting on temporary staff we could double the number of A&E consultants, if only a more long-term approach was taken.' A freedom of information request found that hospitals were also paying up to £1,600 per shift for nurses. Staff shortages have forced hospitals to fill gaps in their rota with expensive shift doctors, who can collect cash while on call and asleep . In January it was revealed that GPs are also being paid nearly £1,500 a shift to work nights and weekends in crisis-hit A&E units. Four in ten casualty departments are hiring family doctors – already paid an average £104,000 a year – to help deal with the soaring numbers of patients. Hourly rates vary from £50 at Wirral hospital in Merseyside to £98 at Wrightington, Wigan, and £100 at Portsmouth Hospitals. Later the same month, understaffed A&E departments were found to be spending more than £80million a year hiring locum doctors. The average casualty unit is paying £750,000 annually for temporary medics to plug rota gaps, with some shelling out more than £4million. A&E is in the grip of a recruitment crisis with most junior doctors put off by the intense work, antisocial hours and low pay. At the same time rising numbers of trained casualty doctors are quitting the NHS to work abroad where salaries are higher and standards of care better. Hospitals are having to rely increasingly on expensive locums who tend to be less competent, more inexperienced and prone to mistakes as they are unfamiliar with equipment.","A&E departments paying up to £3,000 per shift to fill gaps in rota .

"By . Dominic Prince . and Jo Knowsley . PUBLISHED: . 17:08 EST, 15 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:08 EST, 15 February 2014 . Parents struggling with the spiralling cost of private education are signing deals which give Britain’s leading public schools a share of the family home in return for deferring fee payments. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that parents are so desperate to keep their children in top schools, they allow them to take a ‘charge’ on the house as a guarantee against unpaid fees. It means the school allows the child to remain in education but claims the fees when the family’s house is eventually sold. Millfield School in Somerset, which charges up to £30,385 a year, is one school taking a 'charge' out of parents' properties in order to cover fee payments . In extreme circumstances, the school could force the sale of the house to recover the debt. The headmaster of a leading South London day-school, who did not want to be named, told The Mail on Sunday that taking charges on homes had become common practice. Schools including Millfield in Somerset, whose former pupils include Lily Allen and model Sophie Dahl, King’s School Canterbury, where Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe and children’s author Michael Morpurgo were educated, and Saint Felix in Southwold, Suffolk, have all agreed deals to take charges over parents’ properties. Millfield charges up to £30,385 a year, King’s up to £32,235 and Saint Felix up to £24,420. Millfield has at least one charge over a West Country property which is currently for sale at £1.3 million. Bursar Mark Suddaby said: ‘We understand that school fees are a major financial commitment for parents and that financial situations can change. Taking a charge on homes is the last resort.’ He added that there were no recorded cases in the past five years of the school forcing the sale of a house to recover an unpaid debt. John Jackson, a governor at the school, said: ‘Public schools do take out legal charges on occasions but this is only done when parents are  in real difficulty. ‘It allows the parents to pay the fees later while the school can be content that the parents can’t disappear without paying.’ Mark Taylor, bursar at King’s School Canterbury, confirmed that the school held charges over several properties. At Saint Felix, a floating charge against parents’ property has been enshrined as part of its ‘affordability packages’ offered to help parents pay the fees. The King's School, Canterbury, which charges up to £32,235 a year, is also accepting charges. They allow the school to take part of the value of a house when it is sold . School governor John Whyte said: ‘We have had this  system in place for four or five years and I would say it has been successful. We only have a handful of legal charges against property – probably about four or five. ‘It all started when a couple of  parents got into hardship when the recession hit and we felt it was important to be as fair and flexible as possible. ‘We only take out legal charges if the loan is more of a long-term agreement that requires more security, as we give some parents the option to take eight years to pay back the fees. ‘It is usually the whole fees amount that parents borrow. ‘The middle class have been squeezed over the past five years and I would say that all independent schools are having to look at ways  to make it easier for parents to pay the fees. ‘I think we have to use all the weapons in our armoury to make paying the fees as flexible as possible for parents who have come to  us with problems.’ Mike Lower, general secretary of the Independent Schools Bursars Association, said that it was not known how widespread the practice had become. ‘At a time of recession parents will struggle more to pay their fees, so it is only logical to estimate this is happening more often,’ he said. Since 2000, private school fees have more than doubled, with pupil numbers dropping from 514,531 in 2009 to 508,472 in 2012.","Private schools are placing 'charges' on parents homes .

Oshie brainstormed while he skated to center ice, desperately trying to come up with one last move to end an epic shootout. He had already taken five shots at Sergei Bobrovsky, and the Russians were still even. Yet Oshie was chosen for the U.S. men's hockey team with just such a situation in mind, and the shootout specialist concocted one last clever goal to silence an arena filled with screaming Russian fans. Oshie scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between Bobrovsky's legs in the eighth round, leading the United States past Russia 3-2 Saturday in the thrilling revival of a classic Olympic hockey rivalry.

'I was just thinking of something else I could do, trying to keep him guessing,' said Oshie, the St. Louis Blues forward. 'Had to go back to the same move a couple times, but I was glad it ended when it did. I was running out of moves there.' International rules allow the same player to take multiple shots after the first three rounds of a shootout, and U.S. coach Dan Bylsma leaned on Oshie's array of slick shots and change-of-pace approaches to the net.

'I aged a couple of years in that shootout,' Bylsma said. 'We had other guys that are capable, but T.J. was the guy who was going well. It seemed like he was going to score every time he went.' Oshie's final shot was a beauty: He threaded a forehand right through Bobrovsky's pads, the puck punching the back of the Russian net emphatically enough to pop the water bottle on top into the air. 'At some point, you think, 'Does he have any more moves left?'"" U.S. captain Zach Parise said. ""But he did a good job. ... That's hard to do, to get in a goalie's head and throw him off a little bit.' Oshie was among the final selections for the U.S. roster, and though the 27-year-old from Warroad, Minn., has never had a 20-goal NHL season, he leads American-born players with seven shootout goals this season. The U.S. men are only interested in the one that all but wrapped up an automatic berth in the quarterfinals next week. 'I think you're going to see T.J. Oshie become a household name after that display he put on,' said David Backes, Oshie's teammate in St. Louis.

Cam Fowler and Joe Pavelski scored in regulation for the Americans in the marquee game of the preliminary round. Jonathan Quick made 29 saves and stopped five attempts in the shootout as the U.S. improved to 2-0. Captain Pavel Datsyuk scored two goals in regulation and another in the shootout for the Russians, who rallied from a third-period deficit in a fast-paced game. Russia also had an apparent goal waved off with 4:40 left because Quick's net came off its moorings. 'The U.S. team is a good team and a good test for us,' Datsyuk said. 'We played good, but the result is not good.' The shootout finish was entertaining, but the entire game was international hockey at its most compelling â€” and the third period was a thriller. Pavelski scored the tiebreaking goal for the Americans on a power play with 10:33 to play, but Datsyuk tied it with 7:16 left during a Russian power play, spurring Putin out of his seat to cheer. After review, the officials waved off Fedor Tyutin's apparent go-ahead goal because the net was loose, incensing the crowd.

Both teams had quality chances in overtime, but Bobrovsky denied Patrick Kane on a breakaway in the most hair-raising moment. Oshie started off the shootout with a low shot between Bobrovsky's legs, and the next four shooters missed before Ilya Kovalchuk scored in the third round.

A father accused of hacking his disabled seven year-old son's head off with a meat cleaver and leaving it by the road for the boy's mother to see has been ruled not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. Defense experts have successfully proven that Jeremiah Wright, 32, from Louisiana, was suffering a delusion at the time of the brutal murder of Jori Lirette, who suffered from cerebral palsy. Wright was charged with the first degree murder of the little boy on August 14, 2011, and faced life in prison or death by lethal injection if convicted. Expert witnesses Dr. Sarah DeLand, a director at the mental facility that treated Wright, and psychiatrist George Seiden of Shreveport, said Wright suffered from a psychotic disorder at the time of the incident, couldn't tell right from wrong and believed his son was 'a CPR dummy'. Jeremiah Wright, left, was on trial for the first-degree murder of his son Jori Lirette, right, by chopping off his head, hands and feet with a meat cleaver. He was found not guilty Friday by reason of insanity . They testified that Wright thought his son was really a government social experiment and told them: 'I don't believe they can do anything to me because it wasn't a real person. His skull was made of plastic. He had foam in him.' Wright was accused of killing and dismembering the boy after his mother Jesslyn Lirette threatened to kick him out of their Louisiana home. A passing motorist found Jori after Wright allegedly left his head in the front yard for his mother to see. His hands and feet were also hacked off and found in a garbage bag. The crime scene was so gruesome that some of the police who responded to the emergency call have had to have counseling, according to AZCentral. Investigators . said the grisly killing was carried out over a kitchen sink. The boy required around-the-clock care and was fed through a tube. Appearance: Jeremiah Wright seen here during a court appearance in 2013. He has now been confined to a state mental hospital . Mother: Jesslyn Lirette held the hands of two guards as she attended a court hearing in 2013. Her her long term boyfriend was accused of killing their son . Judge John LeBlanc of Thibodaux told a court on Friday that Wright will be sent to a state mental hospital in Jackson that is often used to house criminals who have either been charged with a violent crime or have been ruled not guilty by reason of insanity, according to Houma Today. The judge said he based his ruling off doctors' consistent evaluations that indicate Wright has long been mentally ill and, as a result, believed the world around him was not real. 'Nothing has really changed in regard to the interviews that said Mr. Wright suffered from a mental disorder during the time of the incident and that this psychotic disorder existed prior to the incident,' LeBlanc said during the hearing. 'He couldn't understand the difference between right and wrong and he still suffers the same delusions and disorders today.' From the bench, LeBlanc spoke directly to Jori Lirette's family members. 'This was absolutely the only decision that could be made based on the medical history and testimony in the court,' the judge said. 'It is not a good day for you, it is not a good day for anyone involved, but it is a day we must all face because it is the only decision that could be rendered in this case.' Devastated: A distraught Jesslyn Lirette speaks a the candlit vigil for her murdered disabled seven-year-old son Jori following his death in 2011 . After Jori's body was discovered it was revealed that his mother had previously warned police that Wright wanted her son dead. The week before Jori was born, Jesslyn obtained a restraining order against Wright after he 'broke the baby's . piggy bank' and 'shoved her onto a pile of CDs on the bed'. Then, . when Jori was just six-months-old, she obtained another similar order . after he called her and said he 'was tired of seeing the baby suffer' and wanted him dead. Details . of the orders, which Jesslyn apparently allowed to lapse, were revealed . in sworn statements she made in 2004 and made part of the official . court record. Thibodaux Police Lt. Kim Favalora said in a statement to a court in early 2013 that: 'Wright was very matter-of-fact as he calmly explained that he thought for years that Jori was not his son. Wright's doctors said for years he lived under the delusion his son was a 'dummy' as part of a psychotic disorder . 'Wright said that he recently saw the way the dummy looked at him and there were signs and little things the dummy did to him that let him know that Jori was not his son, but a dummy.' Favalora said Wright told police that 'he was tired of taking care of the dummy. Wright said that as soon as he realized that Jori was a dummy, and not his son, he 'started contemplating on killing him.' The document said Wright admitted to arguing with Jesslyn the previous night and that he expected to be kicked out of the house. Wright has a previous criminal history that includes arrests for drugs, burglary and contempt.","Jori Lirette, 7, suffered from cerebral palsy .

Under fire: Maria Miller's political career could be harmed by a ruling over her expenses . Maria Miller’s political future was in doubt last night after expenses watchdogs found fault with the Culture Secretary’s £90,000 claims on a second home. This newspaper has learnt Mrs Miller is to be criticised by parliamentary standards officials over claiming the taxpayer-funded allowances on a home where her parents also lived. The move has sparked a row at Westminster, with some Tory MPs outraged at the report. It comes amid speculation that David Cameron is seeking to promote more women to his frontbench team as well as hold on to the female Ministers he already has. But last night, one Tory MP privately admitted that criticism over her expenses could make Mrs Miller’s position in the Cabinet ‘untenable’. The former marketing executive, 49, has been under investigation for the past year over second-home allowances claims between 2005 and 2009. Mrs Miller claimed for a ‘second home’ mortgage and costs on the London home where her parents and family lived – not on two properties she rented in her Basingstoke constituency over the same period. The case has drawn comparisons with the case of ex-Labour MP Tony McNulty, who had to repay almost £14,000 in second-home expenses after it emerged he was claiming for a constituency property where his parents lived rent-free. However, Mrs Miller has repeatedly maintained her claims were ‘entirely above board’, insisting they had been ‘audited twice independently’. But The Mail on Sunday understands the Commons’ Standards Committee, which rules on MPs’ conduct, has been advised that for at least part of the four years, Mrs Miller should not have claimed second-home costs for her London home. Sources said a report to MPs by Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson concluded Mrs Miller should have nominated her rented  Basingstoke home as her second home. But when the report  was delivered to the Standards Committee two weeks ago, it sparked a furious row. Claims: The dispute centres around expenses payments for Mrs Miller's London home while she was also renting properties in her Basingstoke constituency, including this barn . A source said ‘many Tories don’t agree with Hudson’s view’ and hinted they want to avoid Miller suffering a damning verdict in the committee’s final report. Another source said: ‘The commissioner is arguing that as Mrs Miller owned the London property, that really was her main home and she’s sticking to her guns.’ However, the source suggested that Ms Hudson, who became standards commissioner over a year ago, may have got the expenses rules wrong. The source predicted that Miller would get ‘a rap on the knuckles’ but could escape the humiliation of being asked to repay any money. Last night, Mrs Miller declined to comment. But sources close to the Culture Secretary said she had sent in a full rebuttal of the commissioner’s conclusion. Friends of Mrs Miller said: ‘We’ve always been clear that Maria’s expenses are entirely above board. She is co-operating with the Standards Committee inquiry and she will wait for its conclusion.’ Ms Hudson’s office said her report had now been sent to the committee but refused to comment on its contents.","MoS has learned Mrs Miller will be criticised over second home expenses .

The storm that hit Britain on Friday and blew away across the North Sea yesterday will be the last on the ‘conveyor belt’ of severe depressions that have ravaged the country since December, the Meteorological Office said last night. The cause of the storms is the jet stream – the high altitude band of wind girdling the planet. For the past eight weeks, a Met Office spokesman said, this has been the cause of a ‘continuous string’ of storms across the UK. Firing line: A storm passes over Britain on the 'conveyor belt' last week . Because the jet stream’s course has been unusually straight, this has increased the storms’ ferocity. It has been fixed in one position – with Britain directly in the firing line. But from today, the spokesman said, this is set to change: ‘The jet stream is going to be much more like it usually is, with a buckled, more convoluted shape. 'It will also move more, both to south and the north of the country. 'It is going to stay unsettled for another week. 'There will be rain at times on Monday and again on Thursday. But it will be normal winter weather, not the extreme conditions experienced lately.’ This photograph shows waves crashing into Southsea in Hampshire on Friday night . Because the ground is so saturated, even that may cause problems. But slowly, the spokesman added, the weather is set to become drier, although he pointed out that the further ahead forecasts are made, the less reliable they become. That said, the week after next is looking more settled. ‘It is a slowly improving picture,’ the spokesman said. ‘We have seen the last of this sequence of intense storms.’ The Met Office does not offer detailed forecasts more than five days ahead, but the American website AccuWeather predicts mild sunny days by mid-March.

The civil rights leader's family described the artwork as tasteless and said they had not endorsed the use of the picture. 'Tasteless': The family of Malcolm X complained about the use of his photo on a Nicki Minaj single . In an exclusive statement with AP on Friday, Malcolm X's daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz, said . Minaj's use of the picture 'in no way is endorsed by our family'. 'Ms Minaj's artwork for her single does not depict the truth of Malcolm X's legacy,' Ms Shabazz said. Minaj apologized on Thursday and the artwork for her single Lookin A** N**** was pulled after being heavily criticized on social media networks. She said the single cover was 'never the official artwork'. Mark Roesler, chief executive of CMG Worldwide, which is the business representative for the Malcolm X estate, called Minaj's use of the photo 'dehumanizing'. 'This is a family photo that was taken out of context in a totally inaccurate and tasteless way,' he said in a statement made on behalf of the family. L.

If you can remember dinner-party meals along the lines of curried lentil soup followed by bacon and onion hotpot, or if your early attempts at home decorating involved stenciling, rag-rolling and distressing every conceivable surface, then you will see The Brewer’s House, just off Brick Lane in London’s East End, as a monument to your impecunious youth. For this is the home of Jocasta Innes, author of  77 bestselling instructional tomes – including The Pauper’s Cook Book and The Thrifty Decorator –  who died, aged 78, last April. Her son, the novelist Jason Goodwin, leads me through shady passages  to the kitchen, where much of her  work was done. ‘This was her lair,’ says Jason, 49, pointing towards the Aga and the giant farmhouse table. ‘You’d find her here  at her typewriter – she never came to terms with a computer – struggling  to meet some deadline, cooking a  meal and welcoming all-comers at the same time. Bold stroke: The Georgian townhouse located in London's East End has been painted brick red . ‘She was a truly creative person. When she did something – be it cooking, decorating or talking – she went at it with a fury.’ Jocasta’s life story reads like the plot line for a novel. Born in Nanking, China, where her father was an executive for Shell Oil, in the 1960s, she  was the archetypal party girl. Stunningly beautiful and a graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, she was pursued by men including Mark Boxer, the cartoonist. She soon married film director Richard Goodwin, with whom she had a daughter, the writer Daisy Goodwin. Then the plot gets murky. Firstly, she had Jason as the result of an affair with the New Age writer John Mitchell, who numbered The Rolling Stones among  his friends. Then, as the swinging Sixties rolled into the peace-and-love Seventies, she went to live with struggling Newcastle novelist Joe Potts in a bedsit in Dorset, leaving Richard holding the children. Unsurprisingly, the relationship with Joe didn’t last and, in 1979, Jocasta moved to London. Around this time trendy young things were discovering rough-and-ready parts of the capital where sizeable properties – often warehouses or abandoned commercial buildings – could be bought for very little. Illusions: Many of the £2.3million home¿s features, from the stone walls to black and white floor tiles, were painted on by the late Jocasta Innes . Cosy and central: The house is located in the trendy Spitalfields area and has four bedrooms on three floors . With her finger on the zeitgeist as usual, Jocasta found The Brewer’s House, near Spitalfields Market, part of a brewing complex and the last word in derelict dumps. It was boarded up with corrugated iron, and she had to climb on to the roof to gain entry through an upstairs window. Inside, she found rooms waist-deep in old TVs, mattresses, fridges and cookers. She bought it from the Spitalfields Trust for a song. By this time Jocasta had money coming through from her books and she was also working as the home editor of Cosmopolitan magazine. So she set up camp on the top storey of the building and worked on the rest of it, room by room, as and when funds allowed. Famous words: Writer and interior designer Jocasta Innes . It was just after moving into The Brewer’s House that she also started a new relationship, with her next-door neighbour, the modernist architect Sir Richard MacCormac. Today the wreck that was The Brewer’s House has been quite exquisitely restored. The sitting room and study have a heavy Dickensian glow about them, and throughout the four-bedroom, three-storey house nothing is what it seems. Touch the surfaces and the tiled walls of the hall are, in fact, hand-painted trompe l’oeil; the marbled walls are similar pieces of fakery; the black-and-white granite stone floors have been created with glossy chequer-board painting. There is a remarkable rounded landing where one wall panel opens, magically, into a secret passage leading to Sir Richard MacCormac’s house next door. ‘My mother believed that you don’t have to spend a fortune on fancy decorators to make a beautiful home,’ says Jason. The Brewer’s House is a showpiece  of Jocasta’s artistry. Quite accidentally, for she was never motivated by money, it has also been an extremely profitable project – it’s on the market for £2.3 million. The Brick Lane area, with its bars, restaurants and markets, is now seriously ‘hip’. Easy access to the Square Mile also adds to its value. ‘Perhaps a wealthy banker will buy it: hopefully one with an interest in architecture,’ says Jason. ‘Whoever it is, I just hope they do something funky with it. My mother would have liked that.’ www.hamptons.co.uk, 020 7236 8398 .","Home of late interior designer and writer Jocasta Inness on sale .

Olympic skicross racer Maria Komissarova of Russia has undergone a 6½-hour operation on her broken and dislocated spine following a serious training accident at Sochi on Saturday. Russian freestyle ski federation spokesman Mikhail Verzeba said Komissarova fractured the 12th dorsal vertebrae in her lower-middle back and was taken to a hospital near the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park for emergency surgery. So serious was her condition, Komissarova could not be transported to Moscow. 'The operation is over ... it's been successful,' Verzeba said. 'When our doctor discusses everything with the hospital medics, we are going to issue a statement and post it on our site.' Maria Komissarova broke and dislocated her spine during an Olympic training accident at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia on Saturday, Feb. 15, 2014, and was taken into emergency surgery . Maria Komissarova races during the official training session for the Audi FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup Skier Cross race on December 22, 2012 in San Candido, Italy . The International Olympic Committee was monitoring the situation. President Thomas Bach said: 'Our thoughts are with the athlete and we wish her a full and speedy recovery.' The 23-year-old Komissarova was practicing for next Friday's contest on a sunny morning on the 1,200-meter course, which has nine banked turns and 25 jumps. In the main competition, six skiers race against each other, with the top three advancing through heats until the final. Normally during practice runs, skiers are on the course themselves, or traveling down the mountain in loosely packed bunches. Jenny Wiedeke, spokeswoman for the International Ski Federation, said the accident occurred on a series of jumps near the top of the course and that Komissarova fell while exiting the third jump. She was taken by sled to the medical services tent, and from there to the hospital. Maria Komissarova (left) pictured with some of her Sochi teammates. The 23-year-old has been forced to bow out of the Olympics after a serious spinal injury . Team doctors decided to do the surgery immediately instead of transporting Komissarova down the mountain. Komissarova is ranked 33rd in the current World Cup standings and recovered from a leg injury last year to qualify for the Olympics. Her best World Cup finish was a second-place at a race in Switzerland in 2012. At the same event, Canadian skicross racer Nik Zoricic suffered fatal head injuries in a crash near the final jump of a heat in the men's race. 'Nik's death wasn't anything that happened with contact,' American racer John Teller said. 'But we all understand how dangerous it is.' Maria Komissarova, 23, as seen in a photo from her official Facebook page . Teller said the biggest concern for any skicross racer comes during the racing part, not training or qualifications, which are individual runs down the mountain. He said most of the competitors had been complimentary of the course setup for the Sochi Games but labeled it a 'bigger course'. 'It's like a North American style course,' he said. 'We race skicross all year long in Europe. They tend to be smaller courses. I feel like this course is more of an X Games style of course.'","Maria Komissarova, 23, sustained serious injuries during a pre-game training accident in Sochi on Saturday .

Claims by sacked Tory MP Tim Yeo that he was the victim of a witch-hunt by anti-gay marriage Tory fanatics in his rural Suffolk constituency have been dismissed as ‘tosh’ by his leading local critic. Mr Yeo, who was deselected after a ballot of local party activists earlier this month, blamed Conservative ‘extremists’ angry with him for supporting same-sex marriage. But the claim backfired last night when the man who led opposition to Mr Yeo revealed that his son is gay and will be among the first in Suffolk to have a same-sex wedding. Sacked: Tim Yeo, (left) alleges he was the victim of a 'witch-hunt' by anti-gay marriage fanatics. But his claims backfired when the man who is said to have led the opposition, Simon Barrett revealed his gay . Simon Barrett, deputy chairman of the Suffolk Tory association, said his son Oliver, a doctor, is to marry his partner, a male nurse, in December. Businessman Mr Barrett, 55, said last night: ‘Tim Yeo is talking a  load of tosh. Just because we live in  Suffolk does not mean we all chew turnips and are homophobic. ‘No father could be more proud of his son than I am of Oliver. It will be one of the proudest days in my life when I attend his wedding to his boyfriend Jonathan in December. ‘Mr Yeo is making excuses. The reason he was deselected is that he has been absent. We hardly ever see him and people got sick of it. To claim it is because we are anti same-sex marriage is laughable – and wrong.’ Mr Barrett’s wife Alison died in 2001, leaving him to bring up two sons and two daughters aged between nine and 16 as a single father. Oldest child Oliver, now 29, qualified as a doctor and works as a registrar in an accident and emergency department in Sydney, Australia. His partner Jonathan Roberts is a New Zealander. On December 22, three days before Oliver turns 30 on Christmas Day, they will marry in Sudbury register office, a stone’s throw from Mr Yeo’s local party HQ. Same-sex marriage becomes legal next month. ‘It will be a wonderful day,’ said Mr Barrett, who is now married again, to Melanie. Couple: Oliver Barrett (right) a doctor, is to marry his partner, Jonathon, a male nurse, in December . ‘All my family and friends are delighted. I have not heard a single anti-gay comment from any of them.’ Mr Yeo, 68, was deselected amid ongoing controversy after it emerged he earned vast sums thanks to the green energy policies he was promoting in Parliament. After a sting by journalists, the Commons sleaze watchdog last year cleared him of breaking parliamentary rules. Controversy: Mr Yeo, 68, was deselected amid after it emerged he earned vast sums thanks to the green energy policies he was promoting in Parliament . Local Conservatives complained that keen golfer Mr Yeo was rarely present in his Suffolk constituency – preferring to spend time at his home next door to the famous Royal St George’s Golf Club in Sandwich, Kent, more than 100 miles from his constituency, or at a £2.2 million  riverside apartment in London. The Mail on Sunday revealed how, at a showdown with local Tories,  Mr Yeo pretended to be rebuffing phone calls from Downing Street. He told his audience he was too busy to speak to the Prime Minister, though it later emerged he had apparently merely set the alarm on his phone. Asked why he was thrown out after 30 years as an MP, he said: ‘Clearly there were some issues on which I may have had disagreements with them. ‘I voted in favour of gay marriage – that wasn’t a universally held view among my members. ‘We have a shrinking membership, which means you tend to get predominantly among those remaining activists people with probably more extreme views than the average Conservative voter on issues like the EU and gay marriage.’ But Mr Yeo’s own equality credentials have come under fire in gay rights publication Pink News, which has claimed he missed 13 votes on gay equality and opposed an equal age of consent.","Tim Yeo said he was victim of a witch-hunt by 'anti-gay marriage' fanatics .

After an ‘horrendous’ divorce, Sarah Hall decided to boost her confidence with a cosmetic treatment – and picked one that promised permanent fat reduction in just one session of ‘freezing’. But instead of returning home with a sleeker silhouette and a spring  in her step, she was left burned, in agony, and possibly scarred. Only afterwards did Sarah, 33, discover the practitioner who carried out the botched ‘fat freezing’ procedure last month at the Starbright skin clinic, in Liverpool, was actually trained as a hairdresser. The case emerged last week as  the . Government faced heavy criticism for failing to regulate the cosmetic . treatment industry despite  a major review and a campaign by The Mail on . Sunday.

The inflammation was so . painful she felt sick. ‘It was worse than sunburn,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t stand, sit or lie because movement or anything touching the . affected area felt like being poked by a hot iron.

Later, he tried to retract his statement, saying it was incorrect because he was ‘caught on the hop’. He also claimed that  the ‘therapist’ was fully trained in using the machine. The Department of Health last week pledged to set up a committee of doctors to help the General Medical Council make cosmetic surgery a speciality in its own right. This was in response to last year’s Keogh Review of the Regulation of Cosmetic Interventions, which called for a major overhaul in regulation. But the government fell short of saying there should be a requirement for those offering these operations to become specialists, meaning doctors still would not need to be qualified in cosmetic surgery in order to perform it. And there was widespread dismay that those offering non-surgical treatments, such as Botox, fillers, lasers and fat reduction, would not be brought into line. Instead, non-medical professionals – including hairdressers – will continue to be able to offer and carry out these life-changing procedures. Cryolipolysis targets specific problem areas using a machine-based probe that freezes fat cells through the skin until they apparently die and are metabolised by the body . Nigel Mercer, former president  of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons, believes Sarah’s case again highlights how British patients are being left wide open to the horrifying consequences of cowboy cosmetic practitioners. He said: ‘This new guidance from the Department of Health is yet another missed opportunity to protect patients. It beggars belief that  an untrained operator can be put in charge of aesthetic medical equipment, with the result that a woman may now be permanently scarred. ‘And the involvement of voucher sites is outrageous. You wouldn’t go to a voucher site for a hip replacement, so why would you use it for an aesthetic medical treatment?’ Sarah added: ‘I wasn’t expecting miracles, just a kickstart to a new fitness regime and I did my research on this treatment without finding a bad review. The clinic’s address, in Rodney Street in Liverpool, is known as the Harley Street of the North, and that reassured me, too.’ The clinic referred to the treatment as Cryolipolysis which, according to Starbright’s website, is ‘a celebrity favourite’ and has ‘numerous clinical trials citing its effectiveness’. But Cryolipolysis is a trademark of US company Zeltiq, for the fat-freezing process it pioneered as its own treatment, CoolSculpting. CoolSculpting does have clinical trials to support its claims, as well as approval from US regulators the Food & Drug Administration. Yet Zeltiq said it never sold any of its equipment to Starbright. The firm added: ‘We would be concerned to discover that a hairdresser would be involved in a treatment using Cryolipolysis technology. Our providers are all fully qualified, leading plastic surgeons, dermatologists and medical aesthetic specialists.’ The company is particularly worried about copycat or counterfeit devices that do not have a ‘kill switch’ to detect and stop treatment when skin has reached a temperature beyond which damage can occur. Starbright has told Sarah it hasn’t had any other clients report similar injury. But she argues this is little consolation if she ends up scarred. She added: ‘After years of having my confidence knocked, I’d just started dating again but I can’t take my clothes off in front of anyone now. I just hope other women think twice about purchasing treatments through voucher sites.’","Mail on Sunday's 'Stop The Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys'-campaign .

Angry: Freddie Starr has blasted police and the CPS for 'tarring me with the same brush' as Jimmy Savile . Freddie Starr has pledged to bring Operation Yewtree 'down on its knees' after his fourth arrest over historical sex abuse allegations. The TV comic, 71, blasted Scotland Yard for using him as a scapegoat after failing to convict Jimmy Savile during his lifetime. The investigation, which was set up in October 2012, has so far led to 16 arrests, with four people charged and five suspects remaining on bail. Mr Starr, who denies the claims, was first arrested in November 2012 in connection with the late DJ, and three more times over unrelated allegations. Last year he suffered a health scare due to stress. Mr Starr told The Daily Mirror: 'I've been tarred with the same brush as Savile and Gary Glitter. What's happened to me is unlawful. The cops and the Crown Prosecution Service are playing dirty. 'I will expose them and bring Operation Yewtree down on its knees.' He added: 'It's a celebrity witch-hunt after the Met failed to get the one person who was guilty, Savile. If they had enough evidence they would have charged me.' He was arrested on Wednesday after returning to the police station to answer bail. He has been re-bailed until April. His lawyer says he will now file for a judicial review into the conduct of the police and CPS. Dean Dunham said: . 'In January 2014 we wrote to the police and Crown Prosecution Service . to express concern for the amount of time that the investigation was . taking and to put them on notice that we believed that the decision to . keep Mr Starr on bail was unlawful. Accusation: Mr Starr claims police are trying to make arrests to atone for the Jimmy Savile scandal in 2012 . Senior officers and prosecutors faced allegations of a 'celebrity witch hunt' to 'make us feel better about Savile' after former BBC DJ Dave Lee Travis was this week acquitted on 12 of 14 sex assault charges . Coronation Street actor William Roache was also cleared of sex charges, not in connection with Operation Yewtree. The acquittals have sparked questions into police conduct . 'Both the police and CPS responded by saying that a decision whether to charge or release would be forthcoming by 12 February 2014, at the latest. 'We are therefore disappointed that this has not transpired and as such Mr Starr will now be filing an application in the High Court for judicial review in relation to the conduct of the police and CPS.' Senior officers and prosecutors also faced allegations of a ‘celebrity witch hunt’ to ‘make us feel better about Savile’ after the former BBC superstar DJ Dave Lee Travis was acquitted on 12 of 14 sex assault charges. The acquittal of the former Radio 1 star – dubbed  the ‘Hairy Cornflake’ – came the week after Coronation Street actor William Roache was cleared of sex charges dating back to the 1960s and follows last year’s failed prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Michael Le Vell and Andrew Lancel. However, MailOnline understands that there is no review planned into the Scotland Yard investigation at this stage. Scotland Yard did not name the performer, but released a statement that said: 'Today 'Yewtree 2' was further arrested after returning to a police station to answer bail. 'The arrest relates to further allegations made to Operation Yewtree, which falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'others'. We are not prepared to discuss further.'

Against the odds: Colin Young's cerebral palsy, has not stopped him from pursuing an acting career . As the stars of tonight’s controversial and much talked-about episode of  Call The Midwife – watched by about nine million viewers each week – actors Colin Young and Sarah Gordy are unarguably hot property. They play a young couple, Sally Harper and Jacob Milligan, who are both ‘patients’ in a home for the disabled – forced apart, and mocked when she becomes pregnant. Sally’s parents are disgusted to discover she is expecting Jacob’s child, branding it unnatural and preventing him from seeing her again. The desperately sad scenario was a routine way of handling the situation in the 1950s. Campaigners have welcomed the storyline, saying it showed how far we have come as a society in accepting diversity. Yet the actors – who have the same disabilities as their on-screen personas, Sarah with Down’s syndrome and Colin with cerebral palsy – believe there’s still a long way to go. Colin, 27, was once told a career in showbusiness would be little more than a pipedream. ‘They said no one would want to watch a disabled person on TV,’ he reveals – declining to name the culprit. ‘So Call The Midwife is a big “I can do it even if you think I can’t”.’ Sarah, 25, adds: ‘Although I thank God I wasn’t born at that time, and I got very angry when reading the script about people being put in institutions, some of those attitudes are still around.’ Both welcome anything that gets people talking about equality, and accepting that disabled people have romantic relationships. ‘We’re all different and all part of society. We have a right to fall in love,’ adds Sarah. Colin says: ‘It was very courageous of Call The Midwife to bring to the forefront such an unspoken about topic as people with disabilities having relationships. 'Jacob is a young guy wanting a family and being in love rather than just a person with a disability who has to be cared for.’ On-screen love: Jacob Milligan, played by Colin, and Sally Harper, played by Sarah Gordy, are forced apart when Sally falls pregnant . But even 60 years after the drama is set, portrayals of sex and love among people with disabilities are so rare it provokes strong feelings – something that baffles Colin. ‘My brother and his partner are both disabled and I went to a school for disabled people so I grew up seeing disabled people fall in love,’ he says. ‘But relationships among disabled people are still taboo, although with shows like The Undateables [Channel 4’s programme about people with disabilities dating] able-bodied people are becoming intrigued.’ Colin was diagnosed with cerebral palsy aged two after a traumatic birth in which he was strangled by the umbilical cord. Starved of oxygen, he suffered brain damage that led to his condition – which affects the way the brain communicates with the muscles, causing stiffness and problems with movement. He wasn’t expected to survive, but surpassed doctors’ expectations and learnt to walk and talk. Today, as we sit in a pub in North London, he speaks more slowly and quietly than most – and also with more effort, as cerebral palsy can affect the vocal cords – but this doesn’t dampen his vociferousness. Colin is working on a PhD as well as appearing in the hit BBC show. And like his character, he’s looking for love and wanting a family. ‘Apart from one or two able-bodied people, I’ve mostly dated disabled people,’ he says, pointing out this is partly because of his environment. His first girlfriend, for example, went to the same sixth-form boarding college for disabled pupils as he did. But there are advantages to being with another disabled person. ‘You have a mutual understanding of what it’s like having an impairment so you don’t need to explain,’ he says. ‘But that can also make you think you have more in common than you do. So there are pros and cos. I just try to see the person as an individual, not according to what their disability is. It’s about a similar outlook and whether we can connect on an emotional level.’ But a 2008 poll by ICM Research found 70 per cent of able-bodied people wouldn’t date someone with a physical disability. Love story: Colin as Jacob and Miranda Hart as Chummy in Sunday's controversial episode of Call The Midwife . ‘They’re writing off a tenth of the population,’ says Colin. His longest relationship has been 18 months, and the dating game for someone who has a personal assistant to help him dress, cook and eat has practical challenges. ‘It’s been hard,’ he says. ‘I’m not going to lie.’ Even making the first move has its obstacles. ‘Having a disability, you’re not sure how they’re going to react and you mostly meet people in bars and clubs where it’s harder because the music drowns out my speech. ‘Also, buying someone a drink is tricky as I can’t carry a glass,’ he says, sipping tea through a straw. Online dating has proved fruitful, though, and he prefers to use generic sites rather than those for the disabled. ‘Inclusion is the main principle disabled people – and society – should strive for. I always tell women before we meet [about having cerebral palsy] and normally the reaction is positive. They say, “Thanks for telling me,” or they’re intrigued.’ When dates don’t progress beyond a first meeting, he is left wondering whether it’s because of his cerebral palsy. ‘But you can’t exactly ask people – they would get defensive as everyone likes to portray themselves as open-minded.’ Some women become maternal towards him. ‘I can sense condescension. And I also try to resist those who think I’m somehow inspiring. Yes, there have been barriers and I’ve worked hard to break them down, but I wouldn’t call that anything other than fighting for what is rightfully achievable.’ Mostly he is an old-fashioned romantic – although there can be pitfalls. ‘There have been barriers to having romantic nights alone as neither of us can pour a glass of wine or eat alone, but laughing it off helps.’ Colin would like to have children and is optimistic about finding love. He already has a role model: his big brother.‘Nathan, who’s 29, has arthritis and is in a civil partnership with a man who has cerebral palsy.

Chinese engineers have unveiled plans to build the world’s longest tunnel. At 77 miles, the Dalian-Yantai tunnel on the country’s eastern coast will save travellers an eight-hour ferry ride or 900-mile road trip. The £22billion project could start within a couple of years, with completion scheduled for 2026. These are the plans for China 77-mile tunnel that, at a cost of £22billion, will be the longest in the world . The first proposal for the undersea link was made in 1994 but it has been stuck in the planning stages ever since. The world’s longest undersea tunnel, the Seikan in Japan, opened in 1988 after more than two decades of construction. The Channel tunnel is 31 miles long. Engineers will submit a blueprint to the government by April for the tunnel and work could start as early as 2015 or 2016, the China Daily newspaper reported yesterday. The tunnel will run from the port city of Dalian in northeastern Liaoning province to Yantai city in eastern Shandong, slashing travel time to 40 minutes. At present, the journey between the cities is a 1,400-km (870 miles) drive or an eight-hour ferry ride, the China Daily said. At 77 miles long, the tunnel will be more than double the length of the Channel Tunnel, which is 31 miles long . China announced plans in 1994 to build the tunnel, at a cost of $10 billion, with completion set before 2010. But 20 years on, the project remains stuck in the planning stage. The project has been proposed at the annual session of China’s parliament every year since 2009, the newspaper said. Wang Mengshu, a tunnel and rail expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the estimated cost of the tunnel would be 220 billion yuan, the China Daily reported. Work on a feasibility report could take two or three years, Wang said. In July, a state-run newspaper, quoting Wang, estimated the costs at 260 billion yuan.","Tunnel will run from Dalian to Yantai, saving travellers eight-hour ferry ride .

A heroic paratrooper who lost both legs and an arm in Afghanistan has spoken for the first time about the campaign of abuse he suffered from officers after returning  to Britain. Corporal Tom Neathway, 30, overcame the loss of three limbs after a bomb blast in Helmand and was able to return to work with new recruits. But he told The Mail on Sunday he left the Army with a broken heart after being ‘singled out’ and bullied by his Regimental Sergeant Major. Corporal Tom Neathway claims he was driven out of the Army by his Regimental Sergeant Major, Alistair Hutcheson, who bullied him . An Army inquiry found Regimental Sergeant Major Alistair ', left, singled out' and bullied Corporal Neathway, right, over several months in 2011 and that the harassment was 'cumulative in effect over time' Corporal Neathway lost both legs and his left arm in a bomb blast while he was serving with the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 Para) in Afghanistan's Helmand province . Cpl Neathway of the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 Para), broke his silence yesterday after a Government report revealed a  25 per cent rise in reported cases  of Armed Forces bullying in the past year . After suffering his devastating injuries, Cpl Neathway was targeted by RSM Alistair Hutcheson, 54, while they were working at the Parachute Training Support Unit (PTSU) at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire. ‘It was not the Taliban that cost me my life as a soldier, it was Hutcheson and those officers in the Army’s chain of command who ignored my mistreatment,’ said  Cpl Neathway. ‘I loved my job at the PTSU helping junior Paras making their first jumps, but Hutcheson would get other members of staff to call me at all hours, demanding to know where I was and questioning me over what I was doing. ‘He also criticised me for wearing gym kit of shorts and a regimental  T-shirt, which was practical given the problems I had with my artificial legs, which were continually falling off. He wanted me to wear uniform as if I was able-bodied. I looked ridiculous and would collapse in a heap. It was embarrassing. Cpl Neathway said on returning to work after overcoming his injuries, the bullying he was subjected to was 'harder to cope with than being a triple amputee' Senior officers also upheld Cpl Neathway's claims he was subjected to excessive phone calls at the RSM's behest and that he suffered unreasonable demands that he should wear uniform . ‘Hutcheson kept on at me over several months and I couldn’t take any more. The psychological impact of what he was saying was harder to cope with than being a triple amputee. So I lodged an  official complaint.’ An Army inquiry found he was ‘singled out’ and ‘isolated’ by RSM Hutcheson over several months in 2011 and that the harassment was ‘cumulative in effect over time’. Senior officers also upheld Cpl Neathway’s claims he was subjected to excessive phone calls at the RSM’s behest and that he suffered unreasonable demands that he should wear uniform. In his treatment of the disabled soldier, RSM Hutcheson, also of the Parachute Regiment, was found to have failed to maintain the standards expected of his rank. Cpl Neathway’s claim that RSM Hutcheson had whispered in his  ear ‘you’re not much of a  paratrooper any more, are you?’ was dismissed after the Army found no supporting evidence. The RSM denied making the comment. After lodging his complaint, Cpl Neathway was forced to leave the PTSU, even though the offices had been adapted for severely wounded personnel. He returned to 2 Para’s base in Colchester, Essex, but the facilities were unsuited to a triple amputee. Cpl Neathway left the Army last year, five years after he was blown up by the Taliban . Cpl Neathway, of Crowle, Worcestershire, left the Army in 2013, five years after he was blown up by the Taliban. He says that the psychological scars of being abused also led to the breakdown of his relationship with model Rachael Patterson, who he had met at a charity event. Hutcheson has since been transferred to the Princess Royal Barracks at Deepcut, Surrey. The Mail on Sunday can also reveal that following a separate enquiry, Hutcheson was accused of displaying ‘poor judgment’ after allegedly making disparaging remarks about the mental state of a Parachute Regiment officer who had recently returned from Afghanistan. And in 1991 Hutcheson was fined £500 by the Army for physically abusing a recruit at a training depot. An MoD spokesman said: ‘The Army takes all incidents of bullying and harassment extremely seriously and all allegations are thoroughly investigated. ‘We have robust processes in place to ensure all Commanding Officers are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect others harassment and discrimination, and any suspicion of bullying is dealt with immediately.’","Corporal Tom Neathway lost both his legs and left arm in a bomb blast .

Fascinated: Liam McAtear, 16,wrote a 'chilling' letter to Moors murderer Ian Brady before sneaking into another boy's bedroom and beating him with a claw hammer . A teenager wrote a 'chilling' letter to Moors murderer Ian Brady detailing his fascination with the infamous killer before sneaking into another boy's bedroom and beating him with a claw hammer. Liam McAtear, 16, was given a life sentence for the protection of the public after he crept into the other boy's bedroom and hit him repeatedly with the metal hammer. A court heard how McAtear had written to child killer Brady, expressing his 'fascination' with the infamous murderer who killed five children alongside Myra Hindley in the 1960s. He also wrote notes, found in his bedroom, in which he expressed his desire to murder the teenager, who was also 16. One read: 'I am planning a murder and it is very interesting and makes me feel good. 'The person I am going to kill is a low life, a good for nothing, so what do people care what becomes of him? 'I certainly do not and I will go to any lengths to end his life.' A . second note detailed how McAtear, from Clayton-le-Moors, would wait . until the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was in bed . before he launched his attack. At . a hearing at Preston Crown Court on Friday, Judge Anthony Russell QC . sentenced McAtear to life imprisonment for the 'protection of the . public' after he had admitted attempted murder. He . will not be eligible for parole for at least six years and 134 days. Even if it is considered that he can be released, he will be on license . for the rest of his life. The . court was told that an allegation had been made by a mutual friend of . the defendant and the victim, who can not be named for legal reasons, . that McAtear had touched her inappropriately. McAtear was worried about how people would see him in light of the accusations, the judge heard. Chilling: McAtear wrote to child killer Brady (left), detailing his 'fascination' with the infamous murderer who killed five children alongside Myra Hindley (right) in the 1960s . Appearance: A court sketch of Brady appearing via video link before a mental health tribunal last June . During . the early hours of September 16 last year, the defendant went to the . victim's bedroom and began hitting him over the head with the weapon. The blows continued and the teenager put his arm up to protect himself. Jeremy . Gront-Smith, prosecuting, said the victim shouted out 'right that is . enough' and began crying before suffering one further blow. He . was taken to hospital for treatment for a depressed fracture to his . skull. In total, he suffered 12 individual injuries to his head. Mr Gront-Smith said the youngster still suffered from numbness around his skull. In . a victim impact statement read to the court by Mr Gront-Smith, the . victim said: 'I was a lot more active prior to the attack, a lot more . sociable. 'This has changed since. I have changed from a bubbly, outgoing person and I lack the get up and go I had previously.' Defending, Mark Stuart said his client, who had passed eight GCSEs, was very intelligent and had planned to take four science A Levels with the hope of studying medicine. Sentence: Sitting at Preston crown Court Judge Anthony Russell QC sentenced McAtear to life imprisonment for the 'protection of the public' after he admitted attempted murder . He said: 'This was undoubtedly a wicked attack. To say anything otherwise would be to belittle what happened. 'The only feature of mitigation is that the defendant was prepared to plead guilty. 'A culmination of features probably led to the defendant behaving in the way that he did.' Judge Russell said McAtear's intelligence made him 'more dangerous', but that the boy had severe personality problems. He said: 'You are a high risk of developing mental illness. 'What is of particular concern is that you express no remorse for what you have done. 'You are very much more articulate than many who appear in these courts. In the circumstance of this case, that makes you more dangerous. 'In my judgement, a chilling feature of your case is you composed a letter to Ian Brady expressing your fascination in him.' Speaking after the hearing, Det Insp Mark Vaughton, of Blackburn CID, said: 'The sentence reflects the severity of the ordeal that the victim had to endure. 'This attack was vicious, unprovoked and sustained, leaving the victim seriously injured. 'Whilst he has made a good recovery from his physical injuries he still suffers from mental scars. 'I hope the sentence can bring the victim some closure so that he can start to move on with his life.'","Liam McAtear wrote to Brady detailing his 'fascination' with the killer .

Two 17-year-olds have been arrested on suspicion of stabbing to death a man with a mental age of nine. The male youths are in custody in north and west London police stations. Police say Dean Mayley, 24, would have had no chance of defending himself against the three or four attackers who set upon him in Greenford, west London, at 5.20pm last Friday. Mr Mayley, who was on his way to visit relatives, was killed by a single stab wound to the chest in Ruislip Road around 50 minutes after he was seen getting off an E9 bus on The Broadway nearby. Last sighting: Dean Mayley was last seen getting off an E9 bus on The Broadway in Greenford. He would usually get off a stop earlier but is believed to have accidentally missed his stop on the day he was murdered . He suffered from learning difficulties related to microcephaly which his family say left him very easily led. His family say he was very vulnerable, which meant he rarely left home alone, except to visit relatives. The last sighting of Mr Mayley before the attack was CCTV footage, released by Scotland Yard, of him waving goodbye to the bus driver after missing his usual stop and getting off on The Broadway instead. What happened to Mr Mayley in the 50 minutes between the sighting and the attack in Ruislip Road remains a mystery. After the attack he was taken to St Maryâ€™s Hospital in Paddington where he died later the same evening. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a single stab wound to the chest.

Chief Inspector Matt Bonner said: 'This was a vulnerable man who would . have shown an unusual degree of trust in those who he came across and it . is utterly sickening that he should have been set upon in this way.' Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner, of the Metropolitan Policeâ€™s Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'Dean was a vulnerable young man who had . travelled alone to the Greenford Broadway area to visit a relative. 'He had made this journey many times before without incident and there was no reason this should have been any different. 'Sadly that was not the case and Dean was later to die following what appears to have been an unprovoked attack,' Detective Chief Inspector Bonner went on to say. Police say their inquiries are continuing. Mr Mayley's mother Donna, 51, said her son was aware of his learning difficulties which meant he struggled with reading and writing. But it also meant he saw the best in everyone and trusted people easily. She said: 'Dean was very vulnerable and easily led he just wanted to please people all the time. He wanted to be an adult - to be like all the other lads... It took me a long time to be able give him that independence he wanted, bit by bit. 'He was a creature of habit - he knew how to get the bus and took exactly the same route every time. But something went wrong that day and he didn't get off at the usual stop,' she added. Mrs Mayley said: 'He was very friendly and I'm sure all the shop keepers in Greenford knew who he was. I just hope someone can help us because we will never get closure without knowing what happened.' 'He was vulnerable and didn't know how nasty the world is. Obviously now we know. What has happened to him is evil - but we need to know what happened,' she went on to say. Mr Mayley was captured on CCTV waving goodbye to the bus driver after getting off the bus at the wrong stop. He was murdered 50 minutes later .

Jailed: Majid Bashir was jailed for four years and nine months after hitting father-of-four Stephen Chappell while driving his wife's car without a licence or insurance . A hit-and-run killer who callously drove off after fatally injuring a father-of-four was caught after trying to claim for the damage on his wife's car insurance. Majid Bashir did not have a licence when, driving his wife's Nissan Micra, he hit Stephen Chappell crossing a busy road last January. He carried on driving for one-and-a-half miles with a shattered windscreen, before abandoning the vehicle near Great Barr, West Midlands. Mr Chappell, an HGV driver, suffered severe head injuries and died days later. But soon after, Bashir, 39, contacted his wife's insurance company to make a claim for the damage. Yesterday, Bashir was found guilty of causing death while uninsured, aggravated vehicle-taking and dangerous driving. He was jailed for four years and nine months at Birmingham Crown Court, and banned from the roads for four-and-half-years. Judge Patrick Thomas QC said it was a 'deeply sad case' as Mr Chappell was a 'hugely decent man in the middle of his life with a loving family.' His grieving family later slammed the sentence and claimed they had faced threats and intimidation during the court case. The court heard the victim had parked his lorry on Bordesley Green Road on January 30, 2013 and had later been trying to return to his vehicle. He waited for another lorry and car to pass before getting half way across the road when he was struck by a Nissan Micra driven by Bashir, who had no driving licence or insurance. The judge said Bashir had been travelling . at just above the speed limit and that his view had been partly . obscured both by the passing lorry and Mr Chappellâ€™s own HGV. The judge told Birmingham Crown Court said it was a 'deeply sad case' as Mr Chappell was a 'hugely decent man in the middle of his life with a loving family' As a result he should have taken extra care while making the over-taking manoeuvre, as he only had a couple of seconds in which to avoid the collision. Judge Thomas said: 'You drove off leaving him to his fate in a vehicle which had sustained very significant damage to its front, in particular the windscreen.' Sanjeev Sharma, defending, said Bashir, a father-of-four, was remorseful and continued: 'He wishes that he could have made a different choice on that day.' But after the hearing Donna Humphries, one of Mr Chappellâ€™s daughters said: 'We are pleased with the sentence although it is nowhere near what it should be. 'Every court hearing we have had to come to we have had some kind of intimidation or threats from his family and friends.

The corporation was accused of trying to hide the enormous cost of the work until it was revealed in a secret tender document yesterday. The Queen Vic: The set, which was built in 1984, will be demolished and rebuilt . A project codenamed E20 – after the postcode of the fictional borough of Walford in EastEnders – will see the current set, built in 1984, demolished and rebuilt from scratch at the BBC’s studios in Elstree, Hertfordshire. The tender document said the BBC was prepared to spend ‘in excess of £15million’ on the new lot, which will include a temporary set in which the soap will be filmed until a permanent home is built. The corporation is currently seeking specialist designers and architects to make sure the current set is exactly replicated, including its ‘weathered and damaged building/structure facades’. It had previously refused to reveal the cost of the new site, which will be 20 per cent larger than the existing set, claiming the information was ‘commercially sensitive’. Secret: The project is codenamed E20 ¿ after the postcode of the fictional borough of Walford in EastEnders . The cost was criticised by Tory MP Rob Wilson, who has repeatedly questioned the amount the BBC spends on its huge property portfolio. He said: ‘Why is the existing set so unsuitable that they need to fork out £15million on a replacement?’ Last month, EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins – who took charge of the show last year – revealed he wants the new Albert Square to ‘reflect the modern world’. The new set will have a new high street and police station. Show bosses said it would allow ‘greater editorial ambition and improve working conditions for staff’.

Tim Hall has been refused benefits after he travelled abroad for a four-month internship to improve has career prospects . A budding filmmaker who has lived in Britain almost all his life has been refused benefits because he travelled abroad for a four-month internship. Tim Hall, 26, travelled to Brussels last autumn for a course to build on his skills and improve his career prospects. But he has been stung by new rules aimed at preventing EU migrants from taking advantage of the benefits system. When Mr Hall, of Acomb, North Yorkshire, returned from the internship he applied for Jobseekers' Allowance but was told he was not entitled to it. An official said in a letter: 'This is because we have decided that for benefit purposes only you’re not considered to be habitually resident in the UK.' The letter went on to say that as an ‘EEA national’, his right to reside as a job seeker would be limited to six months unless he could provide evidence he was continuing to seek work and had a genuine chance of work. Mr Hall said he was shocked by the letter and had appealed, but had heard nothing yet. He said: 'I couldn’t believe it. I went to Brussels thinking it would eventually help me find work back in the UK but now I seem to have been penalised for doing this. 'Fortunately, I live at home with my mother and she will ensure I can eat and get by, but what would I be meant to do if I was living on my own?' The Leeds Metropolitan University film-making graduate worked in the Belgian capital for the Leonardo Mobility Programme, which is funded by the EU Commission. Mr Hall has been stung by new rules aimed at preventing EU migrants from taking advantage of the benefits system . It aims to give participants an understanding of sustainability-related projects while also developing their employability skills and helping them gain experience abroad. Mr Hall said he wondered whether he had been caught up in a new Government drive to prevent EU migrants coming to the UK and immediately claiming benefits. This was confirmed by the Department for Work and Pensions. A spokesman said it was 'absolutely right' that strict rules were in place to protect the British benefits system and make sure that it was not abused. In the letter, an official told Mr Hall: 'This is because we have decided that for benefit purposes only you're not considered to be habitually resident in the UK' 'As has always been the case, anyone who chooses to live in another country for a long period of time and so isn’t contributing in Britain must, if they return to the UK and want to claim benefits, prove that they have strong ties to this country in order to pass the Habitual Residence Test,' he said. 'The new rules, which came into force on January 1, mean that someone has to be living in this country for three months before they can take the Habitual Residence Test. 'The rules apply to migrants from all EEA countries coming here to look for work, including British nationals returning to the UK after a period of living abroad.' York Central MP Hugh Bayley said Mr Hall’s case was the second of that nature he had been made aware of. He said: 'I have spoken to Steve Webb (minister for the DWP) to warn him that these new regulations will hit as many British people as foreigners. He has said he will look at it, but I have not heard back from him. 'The Government seems more interested in stopping people’s entitlement to benefits, because that makes unemployment figures look lower, than in trying to operate a fair system that supports people who have paid National Insurance for years, if and when they become unemployed.' The new rules, brought into force on January 1, mean EU migrants now have to wait for at least three months before they can claim any out-of-work benefits. Previously, EU migrants had been able to start claiming Jobseekers' Allowance and other benefits within weeks of arriving – prompting concern that some people are arriving, signing on and only then looking for work. Announcing the measures in December, Prime Minister David Cameron said he understood the concerns of voters worried that incomers should not be allowed to take advantage of Britain’s benefits system and public services. Other measures announced included cutting off benefits after six months for EU jobseekers with no employment prospect and stopping them from making housing benefit claims. The Government has also toughened the so-called ‘habitual residence test’ to include a minimum earnings threshold, to check whether migrants are in proper employment.","Tim Hall travelled to Brussels last year for a four-month internship .

A woman who kept an moving daily diary of her battle against leukaemia has told her thousands of loyal readers she is in remission. Katherine Sinfield from Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, was diagnosed in April last year and in June she started a day-by-day account of her gruelling rounds of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, blood transfusions, drugs and a bone marrow transplant. With the help of her husband Stephen, 34, the editor of local newspaper the Ashbourne News Telegraph, the 33-year-old's journal appeared in print and gave her a huge following. Within two months blood and bone marrow donors in her town had risen 15 per cent as readers were inspired by her messages of goodwill. Scroll down for extracts from Katherine's diary . Start chilling the champagne: Katherine Sinfield, pictured with her husband Stephen, has gone into remission from chronic myeloid leukaemia after keeping a daily diary about her battle with the illness . Achievement: She prompted a boost in blood and bone marrow donations and donated old stamps to charity . Columnist: Mrs Sinfield's diary was published in the local newspaper where her husband (right) works . Today Mrs Sinfield, a teacher, revealed she has gone into remission - and her first act was to apologise for not saying so earlier. 'I need to say a little ""sorry"" to my loyal followers,' she wrote online. 'Many of you will have been checking my diary on a regular basis to discover news of my clinic visit on Wednesday.

Symptoms include a sore mouth, stinging legs and patches of dry skin and will need regular hospital treatment. She said: 'It's going to be a very long and complicated road back to full health, but at least I am currently free of leukaemia.' Katherine, 33, said: 'It's too early to pop the Champagne corks as further tests are still needed on the bone marrow biopsy, but it's safe to say that the Champagne can go in the fridge to start chilling' Illness: Mrs Sinfield had chronic myeloid leukaemia, which affects around 600 people a year in Britain . Around 600 people a year in Britain are diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Unlike other forms of the illness, it is not common in children and develops very slowly so sufferers can take a long time to realise they are ill, or what their condition is. It occurs when patients have too many abnormal white blood cells called granulocytes, which build up in the spleen and bone marrow and prevent usual levels of blood cells from being produced. The condition can be treated in some people with a bone marrow transplant, but donor matches are much harder to find than with blood. Health authorities have to campaign hard for people to sign the register, which is run by the Anthony Nolan charity. Inspiration: Katherine Sinfield (pictured) kept the diary since June last year . Monday, June 24, 2013 (first entry): Admitted to hospitalFollowing my appointment with Professor Craddock last Wednesday, I was told to arrive today with my overnight bag packed. At my appointment today, Professor Craddock told me that the results from the bone marrow test showed I was in blast crisis phase and so I was admitted to ward 625. I was assigned to a private room and was given a tour of the ward and visited by the doctor. Tests were taken for MRSA and HIV. Saturday, July 6The weather looks hot outside and as I am expecting more visitors than usual today, I enquire about venturing out of the ward. As I am still neutropenic the risk is too great to venture out of the ward and so the only sun I see today is that shining through my sixth floor window. Sunday, July 14It's taken a while, but I am now fairly confident that my hair is starting to fall out.It's not falling out by the hand full, but loose strands of my long locks are starting to depart at fairly frequent intervals. I may be lucky and it may just gradually start to thin, or it may fall out altogether - either way, I have wigs, a bandanna and hats at the ready. Wednesday, August 14This was has been my first full day at home since June 24. But despite being home, my medical treatment continues. The district nurse arrived to check and change my dressings first thing and then my day revolved around a timetable of tablets, creams and medicines. I managed to venture outdoors to the convenience store but this was quite a challenge - I'm not used to walking more than 50 metres at any one time. It's going to take a while before my energy levels return to normal. Saturday, September 14Today was a very rare change for me - we went off to London for a wedding. The Houses of Parliament to be precise. Of course I had to be armed with a bag full of medicines and my emergency medical card just in case I was taken ill, but we made it. Choosing what to wear is now made increasingly tricky because of my Hickman Line - anything too low-cut and you can see the dressing over where the tubes protrude. A new technique of hair nets and hair clips also meant that I managed to wear my wig and a hat all day - and until I told them, nobody even knew it was a wig. There comes a time when people ask you where you had your hair done, that you have to break it to them that it came out of a box. Tuesday, October 29 – Day ZeroThe day has come – the day when I am going to receive my stem cell transplant. It’s funny in life how certain dates attract a lot of activity and October 29 is one of those dates for us. Not only is October 29 the day I am due to receive my cells, it would also be my late mother’s birthday, my late brother-in-law’s birthday, and was also the day when one of my aunts died. Unfortunately, storm St Jude had made its way over to Germany and was playing havoc with the flights. My cells did arrive in the ward on October 29 – at around 11pm - but it was just after midnight when they were finally up on the drip stand. Sunday, December 1Today is the day when we would normally decorate the house in preparation for Christmas. We have a few decorations in place, but nothing to the scale as it usually is because I do not have the energy and there is only so much one person can do on their own. Instead of 'decking the halls' in a single day, I think it will be done over several days or even weeks. Tuesday, December 31As today marks the end of another year, it fills me with optimism for the year to come. This past year hasn’t been particularly joyous – with the bombshell of discovering I had leukaemia being dropped in April. 2014 will certainly be the year when we do all we can to help the charities which have supported me in one way or another through a troublesome 2013. Saturday, February 15, 2014I need to say a little 'sorry' to my loyal followers. Many of you will have been checking my diary on a regular basis to discover news of my clinic visit on Wednesday.

Nepal has announced a cut in the price of climbing Mount Everest, despite concerns that attracting more mountaineers will add the to huge deposits of rubbish blighting its natural beauty. The current fee for climbing the mountain is £15,000 per person - though discounts are available for groups. This regime will be replaced with a flat fee of £6,600 for every climber. Madhusudan Burlakoti, the head of Nepal's Department of Mountains, said the previous system was dangerous because it encouraged climbers to team up even if they had never climbed before and had different levels of experience.

He said: 'We hope to attract more climbers and also at the same time better manage the climbing teams. This will allow the smaller teams and individuals more freedom when they climb Everest.' But the increase in footfall on the mountain this may bring could result in even more refuse accumulating on the slopes of Everest. The vast quantities of food wrappers, climbing gear and oxygen cylinders - leading some to dub Everest the 'world's highest garbage dump' - is so bad it has led to calls to close down the mountain while a clean-up takes place.

Tens of thousands of Nepalese hoteliers, trekking guides and porters also depend on climbers and the money they bring.

Ang Tshering, who chaired a government committee which reviewed mountain tourism, said new plans are in place to make sure climbers bring their rubbish down with them.

A grandmother died after being thrown from the horse that she adored on her first ride out on the animal for six months. Christine Francis, 55, lost control of her horse Nelson after farm machinery spooked the animals ridden by her and her husband John as they travelled along Cortworth Lane, Wentworth, South Yorks, yards from their family home. At Rotherham Coroners Court on Wednesday, Mr Francis revealed how tragedy struck as they returned from his wife's first ride since a knee replacement operation six months earlier. He said: 'We got almost to the bottom of the lane that leads to Cortworth House when what I thought was a combine harvester but I now know to be a grass forager and another tractor approached. 'As we drew nearer they slowed and they were stationary as we passed, but the horses were upset and they wound each other up. 'My wife came past me and it was immediately apparent that shed lost her balance completely. 'Her horse was on the pavement near to an opening to a field. It was uneven and she was bucked out of the saddle. 'Her right leg got caught in the stirrup. Her foot didnt release and she was dragged down the road a little way. 'It was immediately apparent that she'd been seriously injured.' Motorist Stephen Hill said that the drivers of the grass forager and the tractor that followed drove off after the horses passed, probably unaware of the tragedy that had unfolded behind them on May 26 last year. Both tractor drivers contacted police after hearing about the tragic incident later that same day, the hearing heard. Mr Hill, who went to Mrs Franciss aid, added: 'The tractor drivers were in no way to blame.' He said that he found the stricken rider in a pool of blood and dialled 999 on the mobile phone of fellow motorist Kathryn Wroe, who had also witnessed the collision. Two passing cyclists gave assistance but told paramedics arriving at the scene that they could not feel her pulse and she was not breathing. The Yorkshire Air Ambulance was dispatched to Cortworth Lane but Mrs Francis died at the scene. Pathologist Dr Arun Manoharan reported that, despite wearing a helmet, she had died due to fractures to her skull and neck. At Rotherham Coroners Court on Wednesday, Mr Francis revealed how tragedy struck as they returned from his wife's first ride since a knee replacement operation six months earlier .

He's seen walking into a shop and asks for a steak pasty and a can of Fanta - before hurriedly leaving when the proprietor tries to sell him a gun. But violence isn't far away, with him battering to the ground one adversary for daring to insult the good name of South West-based retailer Trago and another for preferring another pasty maker over Falmouth's Tickle Yer Tastebuds.

A High Court judge has blocked a plan to build a huge wind turbine amid an unspoilt historic landscape, in a ruling that will give hope to campaigners nationwide. The 284ft turbine, which would have been visible from more than three miles, was due to stand in an area of Norfolk countryside dotted with historic churches, a Grade I-listed Jacobean mansion, and a moated 15th century castle. Although the scheme had been rejected by North Norfolk district council, a planning inspector overturned the decision and gave it the go-ahead – even making the extraordinary suggestion that the giant rotor blades could actually draw tourists to the area. Unspoilt landscape: The turbine would have overlooked historic gems such as Baconsthorpe Castle . A High Court judge has blocked a plan to build a huge wind turbine at Pond Farm in Norfolk . Although the scheme had been rejected by North Norfolk district council, a planning inspector overturned the decision, giving it the green light - even making the extraordinary suggestion that the giant rotor blades could draw tourists to the area . But High Court judge Robin Purchas yesterday granted a court order to the council quashing the scheme’s approval, saying the inspector failed to give adequate weight to the impact on the landscape and historic buildings. Threat: The landscape was in danger of having a huge turbine, like the one pictured, installed . Landowner David Mack had applied for permission to erect the turbine on his farm at Cromer Ridge, one of the highest points in Norfolk. Mr Mack, who operates Pond Farm under the name Genatec, argued it would generate energy for 665 homes and be ‘a good asset to the community’. Listed buildings in the magnificent surrounding countryside include the Grade I-listed Barningham Hall, which is of Jacobean origin, the 15th century Baconsthorpe Castle, also Grade I, and four churches listed at Grade II*. The council, which originally unanimously refused planning permission in August 2012, was outraged when planning inspector Alan Novitzky ruled last April that the huge turbine could be built. Remarkably, he declared in his decision that the impact of the giant rotor blades in the midst of such beauty ‘would be less than substantial’. And in response to objections that it would deter tourists, he said: ‘For some, a wind turbine provokes interest rather than distaste.’ The local authority immediately launched a High Court appeal and argued that approving the scheme ‘flies in the face of the will of the local community’. The application had generated 1,800 letters and emails, 1,450 of which had been against the turbine plan. Council members argued that allowing the turbine could open the door to similar future applications, damaging the district’s vital tourism industry. Landowner David Mack had applied for permission to erect the turbine on his farm at Cromer Ridge, one of the highest points in Norfolk. He argued it would generate energy for 665 homes and be 'a good asset to the community' Yesterday Judge Purchas ruled that the planning inspector did not comply with the planning regulations requiring him to have special regard to the ‘desirability of preserving the settings of listed buildings’. But he added that, had the inspector complied with theses, he could still have come to the same overall decision. Last night North Norfolk district council leader Tom FitzPatrick welcomed the ruling, saying: ‘While a firm supporter of the economic benefits of off-shore wind energy, the council firmly believes on-shore wind turbines detract from the unique landscape of this beautiful area.’ Member of the No To That Turbine protest group councillor David Ramsbotham said: ‘The decision by the last inspector was disgusting because it did not take into account the views of local people. ‘A turbine would ruin the view for miles around. The tourism industry is vital for north Norfolk as it employs 8,500 people and brings in £400million a year.’ Mr Mack, who is building a 20-acre solar farm next to the proposed turbine site, said: ‘We will carry on fighting to get the turbine. The benefits would far outweigh any impacts.’","Landowner David Mack applied for permission to erect the turbine at his farm at Cromer Ridge, one of the highest points in Norfolk .

Anwar Rosser has been told he will never be released from prison after he admitted the 'savage' and 'sadistic' murder of a 'happy and bubbly' four-year-old boy . The mother of a four-year-old boy savagely murdered by a friend who was allowed to sleep on her sofa has said she feels 'so much guilt' over letting the 'monster' stay with them. Sharon Smith and her partner Guy Earwaker had thought psychopath Anwar Daniel Rosser was a harmless neighbour and allowed him to stay at their house when he asked after turning up after a night out. In the early hours, the 33-year-old sneaked upstairs armed with four knives and stabbed Riley Turner to death. He then crept into another bedroom where the boy’s mother and her partner were sleeping and curled up to sleep on the floor. In a victim impact statement read in court Miss Smith said: ‘I wish I had told the monster no that night when he asked if he could sleep. He said people were outside his house and were going to beat him up and I believed him. I didn’t want him to get beaten up, but all along he had a knife in his pocket, plotting to hurt one of us, or all of us. ‘I feel so much guilt that my poor son had to go through such horrific things because my kind heart didn’t want to let that monster get beaten up. Now my kind heart cost me my son’s life. ‘I don’t feel like ever being nice to people at all except my family. The guilt eats me away every day. What he’s done is unforgivable, he’s ruined our lives.' In the morning, following the attack, the mother-of-three, 26, was shocked to find Rosser curled up in a ball on the floor next to her, and ordered him to leave. Moments later her partner, Guy Earwaker, noticed Riley’s light on and went to check his room – only to find it covered in blood and the boy semi-naked and dead on the bed with his throat cut. Riley had been strangled, repeatedly stabbed and attacked in a sexual manner. Chillingly, Rosser had waited downstairs to hear the anguished screams. He escaped, but was arrested later by police. Riley Turner was stabbed 30 times as he slept in his own bed after the boy's mother and her boyfriend allowed Rosser to stay at their house . Riley's mother Sharon Smith, pictured third from left. Also pictured are Riley's grandfather 'Tommy' (left), grandmother Sharon Smith (second left) and Detective Sergeant Jan Sullivan (right) at court for the sentencing of Anwar Rosser . Yesterday Rosser, a former soldier with a history of being violent when drunk, admitted murder at Bradford Crown Court. Experts agreed he was not mad but was a psychopath who could commit more ‘acts of sadistic homicide’. Mr Justice Coulson branded him an ‘exceptionally dangerous man’ who had shown ‘appalling savagery’. He jailed Rosser for life and there were emotional scenes in the public gallery as the judged ordered he remain behind bars ‘for the rest of his natural life’. Victim impact statements read in court showed how the family’s life has been devastated.Miss Smith described Rosser as a ‘sick monster’ and said she had been frightened to go outside since the murder. ‘I get in a panic when a man walks past. I don’t trust men at all.’ Riley was described as an 'extremely happy, active and popular little boy who was particularly close to his twin brother' She said Riley was a ‘happy, bubbly, caring and loving’ child and she was enduring a ‘bad nightmare’ without him. ‘This monster has hurt us so much, we will never ever recover from this.’ Riley’s identical twin brother Mackenzie regularly asks why he can’t ‘go to the sky’ to play with his brother. The court heard Rosser had gone to the family’s house after spending the evening in a local pub. He asked to stay overnight – telling the couple he feared people he owed money to were waiting for him to return home and would beat him up. Miss Smith and other relatives left the court when prosecutor Paul Greaney, QC, detailed the horrific nature of the ‘sadistic’ murder, which had a ‘strong sexual component’. The court heard that Miss Smith and Mr Earwaker, 23, had been friends with Rosser for a few months, and had shown ‘considerable kindness’ by helping the part-time chef to furnish his nearby flat. There had never been an argument between them. Rosser had turned up at Riley’s family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on January 19 last year after spending the evening drinking. He was described as ‘intoxicated’ but in control, the court heard. Riley, Mackenzie and 18-month-old brother Tyler were asleep in separate rooms upstairs when the couple went to bed, leaving Rosser to sleep on the sofa. On the day before Riley's death, Rosser - who lived opposite the family - had been drinking at a nearby pub, where he 'drank a good deal', the court heard . Riley's mother woke up at around 4.30am to find Rosser curled in a ball next to her bed . Rosser was holding a brown-handled knife when he was find - a weapon he stole from a pub he had been drinking at . Speaking after the sentencing, . Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, Senior Investigating Officer, . said: 'This has been an incredibly horrifying and tragic case which has . had a profound effect on all those involved in the investigation. 'Riley was a very much loved son, grandson and brother who will be deeply missed by his family and friends. 'Rosser . abused the kindness and compassion shown to him by Riley’s family, when . they allowed him to stay in the safety of their own home. 'He . has shown no remorse or compassion for the pain suffered by Riley’s . family by offering an explanation for his savage and gratuitous actions. 'The . death of Riley in such circumstances provides a clear indication that . Rosser presents a significant danger to all those who may come into . contact with him, which is reflected in the (whole life) sentence . imposed upon him today. 'Today brings to an end what has been a very sad and disturbing case.' At 4am, Miss Smith woke up ‘scared’ to see Rosser next to her. He apologised for upsetting her, asked for tobacco and left the room. Moments later Mr Earwaker walked into an unimaginable scene of horror in Riley’s bedroom. ‘He entered the room and then returned to his own bedroom in a panic,’ said Mr Greaney. He was ‘unable to speak’ out of trauma and the mother then saw for herself what had happened. After being taken to a police station later that morning, Rosser said: ‘I know I’ve done summat, but I don’t know what.’ The court heard that Rosser had been adopted at five by a professional couple and given a loving upbringing. But despite a stable home life, he was in trouble from an early age, starting fires and bullying other children. At 16, he carried out a similarly chilling and motiveless attack on an ‘innocent, sleeping victim’ when he smashed a trophy on to the head of another 16-year-old who was ‘crashed out in a bedroom’ during a house party. Rosser joined the Army but was discharged without seeing active service because of aggressive drunken behaviour. He became an alcoholic and was in regular trouble for ‘drink-induced anger’. Rosser was even arrested on a hospital ward, where his mental health was being assessed, because he was threatening staff. Outside court, Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley said Rosser ‘abused the kindness and compassion shown to him by Riley’s family’ and he has ‘offered no explanation for his savage and gratuitous actions’.","Anwar Rosser given whole-life tariff for murder of Riley Turner, four .

Bodybuilder: Davey Fallon died after losing his grip and plunging two floors from the bedroom window of his flat . A bodybuilder high on drugs and intoxicated from alcohol died after plunging from his second floor flat, as he tried to climb through the bedroom window after an argument. Davey Fallon suffered serious head injuries when he lost his grip on the windowsill and fell. The 20-year-old used a wheelie bin to climb on to the porch roof. From there he he was trying to clamber through the bedroom window. An inquest heard the bodybuilder, who worked at a gym in Warrington, had argued with his girlfriend Leanne Chadwick, hours before he fell at the home in Warrington, Cheshire, in the early hours of July last year. Miss Chadwick, 31, said she was woken in the early hours by banging at her bedroom window. She told the inquest: 'As I looked towards the window I saw a white vest and I asked him what he was doing? 'Then he just disappeared. One minute he was there and the next minute he wasn't.' A row erupted between the couple as they headed home after enjoying a day with friends at the Glastonferry festival. Miss Chadwick, who had lived with Mr Fallon for about a year, left without him at around 10.30pm on July 6, the inquest heard. She locked him out, telling him to go back to his family home on Newton-le-Willows. His friends told the inquest he was 'very drunk'.

Fusilier David Lee Collins, 18, from Manchester, who was stabbed outside the club in Ayia Napa in November 2012 . The mother of a teenage soldier stabbed to death in Cyprus broke down in tears at an inquest as two of his killer’s friends refused to answer key questions over her son’s death. Fusilier David Collins, 18, was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife as he tried to settle a nightclub dispute in the party resort of Ayia Napa, Cyprus. He died without knowing his young girlfriend Aimee Williams was pregnant with his second child. The 17-year-old delivered a healthy girl five months after his death. David’s killer Mohamed Abdulkadir Osman, 20, originally from Somalia, . but living in London, was jailed for eight years in Cyprus for manslaughter . after claiming he was 'provoked' and ‘lost self-control’. Two of Osman’s friends Umar Anwar and Tukki Abbas Shah, both 18 were initially arrested in connection with the killing . but were later freed - even though 11 flick knives and two knuckle . dusters were found in the hotel room they were all were sharing. During an inquest in Stockport, Greater Manchester, on Thursday Lisa Minot, 38, was reduced to tears as the two men refused to answer questions and maintained her son had started an argument by asking the three men 'are you bad men?’ They claimed the statement was British slang for wanting a fight - but they refused to answer a number of questions after advice from a coroner that they did not have to say anything which could be incriminating. Afterward Mrs Minott said: 'We are disappointed that Anwar and Shah who were involved in the incident which led to David’s killing decided to rely on their right not to answer some of the questions which were potentially self-incriminatory rather than give the inquest a full and true account of what happened.

At the time of his death in November 2012 David was based at a British Army base at Dhekelia and had traveled to Ayia Napa to go clubbing with army colleagues as a final celebration before flying to Afghanistan the following day. While in Club Black 'N White, friends from the 2nd Batallion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers saw David, of Chorlton, Manchester, mopping blood from his face after he said he was punched. David approached Osman and his two friends and a scuffle broke out. Fusilier James Sullivan and another soldier - Fusilier Jordan Ramsbottom - attempted to diffuse the situation but David was ejected from the club by security. While outside, Mr Ramsbottom noticed that David’s t-shirt was covered in blood and he had a one inch stab wound close to his heart. He collapsed at the scene and was pronounced dead by paramedics who attended. Mr Ramsbottom told the hearing: 'I saw David and he was dancing but he was holding his face because it was bleeding. I went to the bar to ask for tissues. Someone had punched him and I asked who and he said he didn’t know but was going to find the guy and ask.

Fusilier David Lee Collins was based at a British Army base at Dhekelia traveled to Ayia Napa to go clubbing with army colleagues as a final celebration before flying to Afghanistan the following day . 'He said it happened on the dance floor. He walked across and I saw him speaking to a dark-skinned man and we followed towards where he was. While they were talking two other guys approached and started shouting at David and attacked him. 'Three of them surrounded him and jumped on him at once. We tried to break it up and the security took David outside. I followed him outside and he asked me whose blood was on his clothes. He had a lot of blood on his t-shirt and it was sticking to his chest. 'Something was not right. I checked under his t-shirt and could see a hole in his chest one inch wide. I could see his muscle through the hole. 'I picked his t-shirt up to have a better look and could see muscle and tissue. I started to shout at people to get an ambulance. David tried to walk and talk but he couldn’t. He was dizzy. 'We just wanted to enjoy our night because it could be our last for a long time.' Speaking in a quiet mumble, Anwar said: 'I was on the dancefloor having a chat and a cigarette - I had no problems with anyone. David was based at a British Army base at Dhekelia and had traveled to Ayia Napa to go clubbing with army colleagues as a final celebration before flying to Afghanistan . 'A white stocky male approached me and tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I ‘was bad’ and repeated it and I could see him clenching his fists so I pushed him away then he punched me in my face and I fell to the floor.' Anway rejected allegations he knew Shah had picked something up - believed to be the knife - from the back of a quad bike they had used to travel. He also refused to answer questions on whether he knew the knuckle dusters and knives were in the hotel room. Shah said David approached him and a quick discussion followed before Anwar was punched in the face and a fight broke out. But he could not recall anything after the event until he went outside the club and saw revellers stood around David. In a statement to the inquest, Osman said: 'A huge guy and two more men approached me and said they were from Manchester and started fighting with us. 'They began punching us on the dancefloor. I tried to defend myself and hit him back. 'Because of that I pulled a knife from my pocket and put it to his face. He wasn’t scared and jumped towards me to attack me.

'That was when I realised what happened and the security came and pulled him out. I saw him on the floor injured.' Osman later retracted the statement and claimed he was in fact stabbed in the hand. However he pleaded guilty to manslaughter before trial and a murder charge was dropped. Reaching a conclusion of unlawful killing, South Manchester coroner John Pollard said; 'There was an altercation that led to what I feel can only be described as an unprovoked punch to David Collins' face. 'I think it’s fair to say that David wanted to sort it out and find out why he had been hit. 'He went over to the three men and I suspect started talking to them and it is my view his colleagues were ready to assist him. 'There is a further scuffle and there is no doubt in my mind that Osman stabbed him with this knife he had in his possession.' At Osman’s sentencing hearing in Lanarca it was claimed Osman had bought two brass knuckles and 11 switchblades as 'souvenirs' to take back home and give to friends.","Fusilier David Collins, 18, was fatally stabbed on a night out in Cyprus .

Spindly: We are used to seeing arachnids scuttling under the couch as little more than a dark blur, but Jimmy Kong's photos reveal a side to them which we rarely see . Bristles: Although spiders have multiple pairs of eyes, much of their 'vision' comes from sensitive hairs which pick up even the slightest vibration in their environment . Surreal: Many of the species are highly unusual, with translucent skin and pointy protrusions on top of their eyes . Otherworldy: The spiders call to mind the giant evil beasts of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings - but most of them are completely harmless, despite their looks . Hey beautiful: Some of the spiders, captured on a Nikon D90 camera by Jimmy Kong, look a little like giant robots or alien fighting machines . Fluttering: This spider is sitting pretty on a leaf with what, bizarrely, look like false eyelashes. Spiders' hairs are highly sensitive and act as their second sight . Just sitting in my hole: The spiders shot in their natural environment look very much like they've been caught in the headlights - with Mr Kong reflected in their glassy eyes . Camouflage: This species blends in with the spines on a leaf almost perfectly. Even its eyes are practically the same shade of green . Gorgeous: Eight-legged creatures are not always regarded as the most beautiful in the animal kingdom, but they serve a vital function in the natural order . Put your hands in the air: The photographer's skill is evident as his images almost look like they have been posed for by his eight-legged models .

Buckingham Palace was investigating today after giant images of the Queen were used on the front of a new kebab shop. Large pictures of HM appeared on the front windows of a takeaway selling burgers, pizzas and doners in Chingford, London. It recently underwent a complete refurbishment and has been renamed ‘The Queen’ complete with a purple facade and two giant images of Elizabeth II. The Petra Restaurant kebab shop has been transformed into The Queen, complete with giant pictures . Buckingham Palace is now investigating the shop, in Chingford, over the use of the images . The Queen, formerly the Petra Restaurant, offers ‘charcoal grill, peri peri and sisha’ and sells a range of takeway foods. But the restaurant has caught the attention of The Royal Family and Buckingham Palace say they are looking into the matter. Pictures of the Queen cannot be used for marketing purposes and can only be used legally by businesses issued with a Royal warrant of appointment. A Royal Communications Spokesperson said: 'Images of members of the Royal Family should not be used for commercial endorsement.' But takeaway owner Hussein Ibrahim, 42, thinks his purple kebab shop is the perfect way to show his love for the Queen. He said: 'I love the Queen and what she’s done for every single person in this country. This is her land and she deserves to have everybody to come here to salute her. Businesses cannot use pictures of Her Majesty for promotional purposes, and can only legally use her image if they apply for a Royal warrant of appointment . Owner Hussein Ibrahim, 42, has defended his shop, saying that he simply wanted to express his love for the Royal Family . 'The Queen makes everybody happy. I believe in this community they are missing this kind of thing, something that brings the community together.' Britain’s biggest Royal Family fan also slammed the Mr Ibrahim’s decision to ‘cash in on our heritage.’ Margaret Tyler, 70, is thought to have the world’s largest collection of Royal memorabilia, after spending more than 50 years filling her home in Wembley, north London, with more than 10,000 collectables. She said: 'It’s disgraceful. How dare someone cash in on our heritage. It’s not an homage, it’s an abomination.

Just minutes after the footage was captured, he drove a truck full of explosives into a prison killing himself, along with many others. Pictures yesterday emerged of him relaxing with local children. The images were sent by the suspected bomber from Syria to his family in the Langley Green area of Crawley, West Sussex. In one picture, he is seen wearing pink Minnie Mouse-style ears while he cuddles a child. In another, he is pictured kneeling surrounded by children as they give the peace sign. The pictures were taken at a refugee camp on the Turkey/Syria border, according to Arif Syed, 59, a community leader in Crawley, where Majeed was born. Happy: Photos released yesterday showed him wearing a light-up bow on his head while playing with children . Posing: He was also pictured with three young boys in a refugee camp on the Syria-Turkey border . Married father of three Majeed is suspected of driving a lorry into a jail in Aleppo and detonating a bomb last week. Officials have not confirmed the identity of the bomber amid reports that a UK jihadi, who used the name Abu Suleiman al-Britani, carried out the bombing. Counter-terrorism officers have searched Majeedâ€™s home in Crawley which is also the ex-home of schoolgirl Sarah Payneâ€™s killer Roy Whiting, according to neighbours. Majeed, known as Waheed, left Britain six months ago, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. Mr Syed said Majeed would phone or Skype his family every three days, but communication was lost with him about nine days ago. When news emerged about the suicide bombing in Syria, the family of Majeed - who is of Pakistani descent - started to panic, he added. Majeedâ€™s uncle, Mohammad Jamil, 65, said Majeed - who is a father of two boys and a girl aged 18, 16 and 12 - had never shown any sign of extremism. But this week extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed told the London Evening Standard that Majeed was 'a very dear brother'. Investigation: Police were still searching the Crawley home of Abdul Waheed Majeed today . He claimed Majeed had been an active and valued member of the banned extremist Al-Muhajiroun organisation between 1996 and 2004 and had wanted to further the 'Muslim cause'. Bakri said Majeed would organise his sermons in Crawley and record the lectures and distribute them. He said: 'He was a good brother. He was someone who was always at hand to help people. 'He wanted to study Islam and wanted to know what it was to be a good Muslim. He was also very interested in the issue of how we could establish an Islamic state.'

When mother-of-three Charlotte Pittuck crossed the finish line of the 2012 London Marathon her real challenge was only just beginning. Little more than a year later after completing the 26.2mile course, the 31-year-old would undergo a preventative double mastectomy - spending eight hours in surgery in order to drastically cut her chances of getting breast cancer. Mrs Pittuck was just 26, and a new mother to her eldest son Harry, when she discovered she carried the Breast Cancer 2 (BRCA2) gene - a genetic mutation that meant she had an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and a 40 per cent chance of getting ovarian cancer. Mother: Charlotte Pittuck, pictured with her daughter Edith, three, underwent a preventative double mastectomy after discovering she carried the BRCA2 gene . Runner: Mrs Pittuck at the start of the 2012 London Marathon (left), and crossing the finish line. She took up running to get fit for her operation and now plans to run the course again . Now, just nine-months after the potentially life-saving operation, Mrs Pittuck is preparing to take on the marathon for a second time - despite fearing that she would never run again after the drastic surgery, having struggled to walk or even sit in a chair. Mrs Pittuck, from Essex, was 10 weeks pregnant with Harry when she learned that the BRCA2 gene was present in her family. As an expectant mother, she was forced to wait to be tested until after the birth of her first child while one by one her loved ones underwent the test, each one coming back positive. 'It was heartbreaking,' she said. 'Next up was me and I just wanted to know one way or the other I already knew that if I had the gene I would opt for a double mastectomy, luckily I had time on my hands.' Her aunt, uncle, father, sister and brother all carried the gene, and Harry, now four, and her twins Samuel and Edith, three, each have a 50 per cent chance of being BRCA2 positive. Family: Mrs Pittuck with her husband Paul, and her children (left to right) twins Edith and Samuel, both three, and four-year-old Harry . Having given birth to her twins in January 2011, Mrs Pittuck began her marathon training as a means to get fit before the operation. In July last year surgeons carried out the operation, while tissue and fat were taken from the top of both her legs and used to 'build' her new breasts. Her journey to recovery did not go smoothly. Mrs Pittuck suffered some serious complications and within just six weeks had gone under the knife three times. Complication: Mrs Pittuck was rushed  back into surgery six weeks after her operation after one of her legs swelled to twice its normal size . She was rushed back into surgery six weeks after her operation after one of her legs swelled to twice its normal size and needed the fluid flushed out, leaving her a further eight weeks from being able to do any exercise. She now has a 12inch scar on each leg, while her original bruising from the surgery ran from her shoulders to her knees. But following the surgery her chances of developing breast cancer were slashed to just six per cent, and she is now embarking on her second marathon. She is determined to show other women that even following such major surgery anything is possible. 'Following my double mastectomy I felt like I would never run again,' she said. 'I . struggled to sit in a chair and even to walk. Running a marathon seemed . impossible then but, as I embark on my training again I want to show . the world anything is possible.' She added: 'Running doesn't come naturally to me, . far from it. 'The thought of a long run makes me want to cry and the . thought of doing the marathon again and the training it entails fills me . with fear but I feel like it would be the ultimate comeback and will . hopefully show other women with breast cancer or having preventative . surgery that pain is temporary and your body will get stronger.' Mrs Pittuck is running the gruelling 26.2 miles to raise funds for breast cancer research charity Breast Cancer Campaign, for whom she has written a blog documenting her BRCA2 journey - from finding out she carried the gene, to the recovery from her operation as well as her marathon training. 'This is my second London Marathon, but that doesn’t make it any easier,' she said. Support: Mrs Pittuck with her husband Paul, and with her mother Sonia Clark . 'For me, it’s all about raising money, raising awareness and just generally ""campaigning"" against breast cancer. 'I have met so many amazing women (and men) since I found I had a mutation of the BRCA2 gene and they inspire me to be better and to be grateful. 'The marathon is my way of giving back to them and giving back to the charity and to show to myself how strong I can be. 'It feels tougher than before and it feels harder than I expected it to but that makes me all the more determined. Worry: Mrs Pittuck's children each have a 50 per cent chance of carrying the BRCA2 gene. Mrs Pittuck found out she had the gene after she gave birth to Harry, now four . 'All I ask for is no snow or rain between now and April.' Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK and accounts for nearly one in three of all cancers in women. In the UK, around 50,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year - around 138 a day. There has been an increasing awareness of faulty BRCA genes in the last few years, particularly since actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy after discovering that she carried the BRCA1 gene. This spring EastEnders viewers will watch as popular character Carol Jackson, played by Lindsey Coulson, discovers that she has the BRCA2 gene, which will have implication for daughters Bianca and Sonia.

Carol's upcoming storyline, which started earlier this month as the Jackson matriarch decided to be tested for the gene, is the first time a UK soap opera has focused on BRCA. Through running the Marathon, Mrs Pittuck hopes to raise £2,000 for Breast Cancer Campaign - which will help fund research into the disease, and the BRCA genes. 'Without research into the BRCA2 gene, I wouldn’t have been able to make the decisions I have been able to make,' she said. 'That is why I have chosen to run the Virgin Money London Marathon once again for Breast Cancer Campaign, so I can raise more money to help the charity continue to fund vital research into breast cancer.'

Rihanna's video to her number one single 'S&M', which has been watched by nearly 49 million people on YouTube, could be banned after a German photographer claims she copied his work. New-York based Philipp Paulus, 22, from Germany, claims some scenes in the pop star's bondage-themed video were based on his fashion photography series ""Paperworld"".

A scene from Philipp Paulus' Paperworld series which the photographer accuses Rihanna and Universal of copying . Rihanna's video, produced by her record label Universal Music, features . the U.S popstar in a similar setup with plastic wrapping and crosses. 'It . is shocking that a company like Universal music, which generates its . turnover with intellectual property, copies the intellectual property . completely unauthorised and without respect,' said Paulus, who is . fighting his case in a court in Stuttgart, Germany. Paulus' lawyer, copyright specialist Philip Jakober, said Universal Music Group . had admitted the similarities some time ago but had not made a . reasonable offer to settle the matter, prompting the legal case. New-York based Philipp Paulus, 22, from Germany, claims a scene in the pop star's bondage-themed video was based on his fashion photography series ""Paperworld"" One of the scenes from Rihanna's 'S&M' music video which a German artist says is copied from his work . A scene from Rihanna's video, produced by her record label Universal Music, features the U.S popstar in a red dress by a wall in plastic wrapping with black tape X-marks. The scene appears to be similar to photographs taken by Paulus . He said: 'Certain video scenes of the music video 'S&M' are essentially the basics of the copyright protected achievements and creations of my client.' In 2011 Paulus began legal action over the issue, shortly after another photographer accused Universal and Rihanna of stealing his ideas for the S&M video. Well-kown American photographer David LaChapelle argued in documents filed in Manhattan Federal Court in New York City that certain scenes in the 'S&M' video were 'directly derived from and substantially similar' to eight of his photographs. After failing to come to an out of court settlement with the music giants, Paulus has now filed claims for an injunction as well as a claim for damages. If Paulus wins his case, Universal Music could face, among other things, a ban on broadcasting the video not only on YouTube but also on television worldwide. 'The ludicrous thing about this situation is that Universal Music has for some time been bringing about a wave of lawsuits against end users for copyright infringements, yet as far as our case is concerned the usage from the photo series 'Paperworld' by Philipp Paulus in the music video 'S&M' is a serious and worldwide infringement of copyright, which is the responsibility of Universal Music,' added lawyer Jakober. Paulus' legal costs for the trial in Stuttgart are being funded by Foris Legal Financing from Bonn, which enables him to fight the music giant. Paulus' Lawyer, copyright specialist Philip Jakober, said Universal Music Group had admitted the similarities some time ago but had not made a reasonable offer to settle the matter . Paulus said: 'Of course as a young artist I am not prepared to use my whole start-up capital to fight against the cold shoulder of a big player like Universal Music. I am really happy that after the out-of-court settlement fell through almost two years ago I am now being given the opportunity to work with Foris and my lawyers to fight for my rights.' Lawyer Jakober added: 'Universal music exploited the economic inferiority of my client in the out of court settlement talks. After Foris joined the case as the financer, those strategies will no longer work.' In an earlier interview Paulus said he was amazed that Rihanna did not express more originality in her work. 'Why a worldwide celebrity is not able to afford a creative director, who creates individual concepts and staging, is incomprehensible to me,' he said. Paulus added: 'While I really respect Rihanna's talents as a musician, nevertheless it is important to respect the creations of others, even young talent - and not to copy their work without legitimacy for earning money with it in order to make money.' The case continues.","Philipp Paulus claims scenes in the video are lifted from his photography .

Thousands of people are being duped into paying fees to copycat websites which appear to belong to government departments (stock picture) Thousands of people feel they are being duped into paying fees to copycat websites which appear to belong to government departments such as the Passport Office, the DVLA and the taxman. Private companies are using web names that link to sites which appear to be an official government service. They are paying internet search engines, such as Google, to ensure they appear on the first page when consumers carry out searches. It is the domain names of the websites - TaxReturnGateway.com, for example, as opposed to the official Gateway.gov.uk - that suggest they might be official. However, these firms then charge people huge fees to fill out forms which they could download and fill in themselves for free. Just . last week, an elderly couple from Lincoln complained after three £69 . charges - £207 – were taken out of their bank account by what they . thought was the HM Passport Office. In fact, it was a private firm that simply filled in a passport application form with information they supplied online. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has upheld complaints against a number of websites which have misled consumers. However, it has no power to block, fine or take legal action against the culprits. The sites themselves are not acting illegally. The . issue came to a head recently following concerns about the . TaxReturnGateway.com website, which many people have been fooled into . believing is part of HMRC. People filling in tax return forms on the site have been told they must pay charges, often running to more than £500, to allow the tax return to be formally accepted. In reality, these sums relate to a fee being charged by the company involved , which is called Who4 Ltd, rather than any tax payment. A Who4 spokesman has said: 'It is made absolutely clear on our client's website, specifically the home page, that it is not associated with HMRC, DWP or another government body and further, that it will levy a charge for the service it provides.' These problems represent just the tip of the iceberg. Other websites relating to passport renewal, driving licence renewal, the supply of the European health card (Ehic), US visas and London’s Congestion charge are also under suspicion. Chief executive of the Citizens Advice Bureau, Gillian Guy, said: ‘These businesses are nothing more than opportunistic rip-offs and serve little or no purpose for consumers.  They are cashing-in on everything from tax returns to passport applications, and land registry to congestion charges. ‘People who use these websites feel utterly duped after they realise they have paid for something they can do for free elsewhere or have forked out extra costs on top of standard charges.  As households across the country continue to feel a squeeze on their finances they can’t afford to be paying over the odds for services. ‘These firms need to be upfront with people about the service they offer, including the costs they charge and be clear they are not the official website.’ She said Government departments should do more to help consumers find their official websites, while search engines such as Google also have a responsibility to ensure people are not misled. ‘The internet offers endless opportunities to make day to day tasks much easier but consumers can come across difficulties.  Search engines should be striving to ensure customers can make informed choices about the websites they use,’ she said. The home page of Tax Return Gateway, the alleged copycat site that could charge you thousands of pounds to fill in government forms that are available for free . The ASA said it is doing all it can to tackle the problem, but it admitted its powers are limited. A spokesman said: ‘We have been taking action against ads for, and claims appearing on, ‘copycat’ websites. ‘We have been working to secure amendments to the individual sites and ads we’ve received complaints about.  Where needed that can involve working directly with the search engine providers to remove or amend problematic search engine ads.’ However, the organisation admitted: ‘There is no direct action which the ASA can take to prevent these websites from operating all together. ‘The legitimacy of this kind of business practice, while questionable to many, is a matter for Government and Trading Standards to tackle.’ He said the ASA has commissioned some consumer research to understand the extent of the problem, before deciding on future enforcement action. A Government Cabinet Office spokesman said the Government does takes the issue ‘very seriously’ and has set up a task force to tackle the problem. He said: ‘We have commissioned a cross-government group to evaluate the problem posed by misleading websites to our customers and the best way to address the issue. As part of this, we are engaging with internet search engine providers to mitigate the risks posed. ‘We’ve streamlined the myriad of government websites into a single domain, GOV.UK, which is built around the needs of users and provides one secure place where most government services can be accessed.’ An elderly couple were charged hundreds of pounds by a private company to fill in their passport forms . A couple in their seventies thought the website ‘passport-uk.co.uk’ was a simple and quick way to renew their passports. It . was only later that they realised that the firm was simply a private . business that filled in an application form – something they could have . done themselves - rather than part of HM Passport Office. The couple, . from Lincoln, are so embarrassed about being taken in that they do not . want to give their names. However, they are among a large and growing . group of educated people who have been misled. Mr K said: ‘I did an . internet search and this website came up on the first page. It looked . perfectly genuine and I thought I was dealing with the passport office. ‘I filled out all the details, once for myself and then again for my wife. I could see the fee was £69 for each of us. ‘It . was only later that I discovered I was not dealing with the passport . office at all and this fee was for just filling in the form.’ In fact . the correct basic fee for renewing a passport through the post is . £72.50, which would have had to be paid on top of the £69 service charge . applied by the website. People can renew their passport themselves . by simply filling in the form on the official website, which can be . found using the www.gov.uk portal. Mr K said he subsequently . discovered that the company had taken the £69 fee out of his bank . account three times, rather than twice. ‘I trusted the website and . believed it was official. In my opinion they are clearly trying to fool . people. I think it is very wrong,’ he said. The website is owned by . IQ Channels, which insists there is clear information to show users it . is not an official passport office portal.

It was an underwater arm wrestling match where an eight-armed creature had a significant advantage over the other. But one intrepid diver whose camera was seized by a curious octopus managed to hold onto his camera, despite its best efforts. And better still, his friend captured the moment the giant cephalopod lunged at him. Scroll down for video . Arm wrestling match: The octopus grabbed diver David Malvestuto's camera (pictured) who fought to keep hold of it. The two divers had a close encounter with the giant pacific octopus in Bluefish Cove off Carmel, California . The giant pacific octopus can be found in the coastal North Pacific. It is arguably the largest octopus species, based on a scientific record of a 156lb (71 kg) individual weighed live. Adults usually weigh around 33lbs (15kg) with an arm span of up to 14ft (4.3m). They only live for between three and five years but have many offspring. This species of octopus commonly preys upon shrimp, crabs, scallops, abalone, clams, lobsters, and fish. Food is picked up with its suckers and then crushed using its tough 'beak' of chitin, a bone-like substance. Octopuses are ranked as the most intelligent invertebrates. This species has demonstrated the ability to recognise humans. Two divers had a close encounter with a giant pacific octopus in Bluefish Cove off Carmel, California. David Malvestuto, of La Jolla, and his diving partner Warren Murray, who is also a professional underwater photographer, were initially shocked to see the large creature in shallow waters, 80ft beneath the waves. But were more surprised when it extended an arm and took a hold of Mr Malvestuto. ‘Before you know it, I saw an arm grab hold of him and then its whole body just lunged onto the camera,’ Mr Murray told CBS News. ‘I was worried that the octopus wasn’t actually going to come off his camera and I was just making sure I got it on video, otherwise the people on land wouldn’t believe us.’ An underwater tussle began as Mr Malvestuto struggled to keep hold of his camera. The octopus eventually let go when it was scared off by flashes from the device, but not before the encounter was captured on Mr Murray’s Go-Pro camera. ‘We didn’t bother it and we didn’t put it in a dangerous situation. I think it more or less it was just curious,’ Mr Murray said. Massive: The giant pacific octopus (pictured - stock photo) can be found in the coastal North Pacific.

He was forced to use a spear gun to prise the cameras away from the octopus.

A young boy has credited his pet Labrador with protecting him for a crippling condition that affects his nervous system. Brad Oliver has a rare disorder which means his heart races every time he stands up or becomes excited – this alters the blood supply to his brain, causing him to pass out. But, three-year-old Fudge, a golden Labrador, instinctively knows when Brad is about to fall ill and has kept him out of harm’s way on countless occasions. Brad Oliver, 11, has a rare condition which means his heart beats too fast when he moves meaning the blood supply to his brain is compromised and he is in danger of fainting. Fudge sits by him when his heart is beating too fast to warn him not to stand up . Brad, who turns 11 next week, has postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) which causes dizziness, fainting, tiredness, palpitations, shortness of breath and headaches. He suffers up to 200 blinding ‘ice pick’ head pains a day as well as nausea and blurred vision. Brad, from Chudleigh, in Devon, is so vulnerable, he has to be taught at home and to remain constantly in temperatures of 18 - 21C because a sudden change of temperature could cause him to fall ill. His heart can race dangerously if he eats any number of common foods including meat, dairy, fish and bread. Fresh strawberries are one of the few things he can enjoy and his mother, Katrina - widowed while pregnant when her husband was killed in a car crash - can travel up to 50 miles a day to find the four punnets a day he eats. ‘Brad was seven days old when his heart first went funny, he went stiff then limp in my arms and we ended up in hospital,’ said Mrs Oliver. ‘Now he has to wait two hours before . getting up each morning and we have to pace his whole day. If we don’t, . Brad can be knocked off his feet for over three weeks. ‘I think sometimes life throws things at us to make us stronger.’ If Brad blacks out, Fudge finds his mother, Katrina, to warn her. Fudge is not trained to help Brad - he is just a pet who happens to have an instinctive ability to help the child . But Brad’s life changed for the better three years ago when Fudge came along. He chose the runt of the litter because she had the ‘waggiest tail’. ‘She kept diving for him,’ said Mrs Oliver. ‘At four-days-old she started acting a bit strangely, sitting across his legs and not wanting to get off. ‘She wouldn’t let Brad get up so we moved her and shortly afterwards Brad collapsed. ‘We realised later this had developed into a pattern, Fudge knew when Brad was going to have an attack. ‘Even if he was upstairs being poorly in bed and I didn’t know, Fudge would be at the bottom of the stairs crying. PoTS is an abnormal response by the autonomic nervous system to becoming upright - the autonomic nervous system is in charge of all of the automatic bodily functions, such as sweating and digestion. The condition causes the heart rate to increase and alters the blood supply to the brain. There are many causes -  pregnancy, viral illnesses, surgery, rapid growth spurts and bed rest - but, in some cases, no cause can be found. Some patients are severely disabled by the condition while others have mild symptoms. Symptoms include: . Symptoms can be triggered by excess heat, eating, standing up, dehydration, alcohol and exercise. Source: www.potsuk.org . ‘A couple of times she came up to me to let me know I’m not moving fast enough. ‘It’s . also happened when Brad’s been in the downstairs bathroom and he’s . become unwell. Fudge will go running up to the door crying. ‘Brad used to end up in hospital a lot with concussion because he’d fall and hit his head, but now Fudge either cries or puts her paw on his arm warning him to sit down. ‘She just guards him the whole time and you know he’s not well. When she’s happy and running around we know Brad is in a good place too. ‘She doesn’t miss an occasion. When Brad had a loop recorder implanted to monitor his heart, it showed afterwards that every time he’d been extremely tachycardic [his heart has been beating much too fast] I’d entered ‘F’ into the manual log I kept and that meant “Fudge”, she had known he wasn’t well. ‘Sometimes I worry about her because it’s like she’s always working all the time although of course she’s never been trained to do this, it’s purely instinct. ‘Even if Brad goes out cold Fudge will let us know if it’s serious or he’ll come round by the way she’s laying by his feet, she just won’t leave if he’s bad. ‘When Brad’s going to collapse she tends to pin him down but if he’s about to have a head pain she’ll paw him more or go and sit beside him and give a little nudge, it’s really strange. ‘She helps him in so many ways. ‘The one disadvantage for Brad is that he can never lie about feeling unwell to get out of doing things because Fudge gives the game away.’ Howard Liebermann, a partner at the Kingsteignton Vets Practice where Fudge is looked after, said: ‘It’s not uncommon for dogs to be trained to predict when people might be at risk of an epileptic fit, but Fudge is the first dog I know of who has taken it on themselves to become a child’s protector like this.’ One of the reasons the Olivers decided to talk about their plight was to help raise the profile of Syncope Trust and Reflex Anoxic Seizures (Stars) – the charity which has helped them. Mrs Oliver said: 'It was only through the group that Brad was given a diagnosis and referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital. Ever since it has been on hand to provide advice and practical support. 'They are a fantastic charity, a lot of people get misdiagnosed with epilepsy when in fact it’s a type of syncope. 'Quite rightly the big cancer charities are well known but not Stars, nor Syncope or Pots – yet more people die of heart conditions than cancer. 'No one really knows how many people live with it and to raise awareness would be fantastic, it might help find a cure.' Shy Brad admitted that Fudge was his best friend and a ‘good dog’. He had one message: 'Make sure you love life.'

A major Liberal Democrat donor has been arrested as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery at Rolls-Royce. Sudhir Choudhrie was held by police with his son Bhanu this week. Since 2004 they have given £1.2million to the Lib Dems as personal donations and from their companies. The Serious Fraud Office is probing claims that Mr Choudrie - who, with his son, strongly denies wrong doing - acted as an intermediary by Rolls-Royce in deals in China and Indonesia. Sudhir Choudhrie (pictured) and his son Bhanu were quizzed at Snow Hill police station before being released on bail without conditions . More than 150 officers from the Serious Fraud Office, the City of London Police and the National Crime Agency swooped on a number of properties in central London. As a result of the dawn raids on Wednesday, the two men were arrested. Sudhir and Bhanu Choudhrie were quizzed at Snow Hill police station before being released on bail without conditions. The pair deny any wrongdoing and say they are co-operating fully with the authorities. Bhanu Choudhrie is the chief executive of family firm C&C Alpha Group, which runs care homes in the UK. The company has donated around £487,500 to the Lib Dems since 2010, according to official Electoral Commission records. Another firm, Alpha Healthcare Ltd, gave £540,000 to the party from 2004 to 2010. Bhanu Choudrie gave £30,000 as an individual from 2004 to 2008 while Sudhir Choudhrie has given £155,000 since 2006, including £60,000 in a cash donation to the local party of Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes in November last year. Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats have received around £500,000 from the Choudhries' family firm since 2010 . Sudhir Choudhrie was last year expected to be given a seat in the House of Lords, but it did not happen. Allegations of criminal activity in relation to alleged bribes emerged last year from a former employee. In December the SFO said it was launching a criminal investigation. A spokesman for the Choudhries said: ‘The allegations made against Bhanu and Sudhir Choudhrie are strongly denied. Full co-operation is being given to the authorities.’ A Serious Fraud Office spokesman said: ‘In connection with a Serious Fraud Office investigation, we can confirm a number of search warrants have been executed at various properties in London today, Wednesday, 12 February 2014.  Two men were also arrested. ‘Officers from the National Crime Agency and City of London Police assisted with the operation.'

Alert: Rachel Kendall (left) and Kristy Hume (right) uncovered the two-storey warehouse after noticing a strong smell of cannabis. They then spent a staggering seven hours trying to find the suspected 'grower' in the crop . However, it wasn't until Wednesday night that they stumbled across the 46-year-old male 'grower' - who had been hiding in a wall cavity. Ms Hume and Ms Kendell, who have had no formal drugs training, were forced to break into the factory, off Bath Road, during the raid. They were shortly joined by the police, who started to dismantle the factory, before discovering the suspect - believed to be from Vietnam - hiding in the small space. Today, Inspector Andy Berriman, from Leeds City Neighbourhood Policing Team, said the man is believed to be one of four people responsible for running the cannabis farm. Farm: The PCSOs, who have had no formal drugs training, were forced to break into the factory during the raid . Dismantled: The 46-year-old 'grower' - believed to be from Vietnam - was found by police hiding in a wall cavity . 'Officers were clearing out and taking sheeting off the wall and he was there in a tiny cavity,' he said. 'We are thinking that there may be three others and it’s possible they’re all victims who have been trafficked into the country and forced to work there.' The five-bedroom warehouse - which included basic living quarters, such as a bed and cooking facilities - contained sophisticated lighting, ventilation and heating system. It also included a rota of tasks, written in a foreign language - while the plants were found to be at various stages of growth. Police Constable Pat Kenning, who has worked as part of a drugs team for more than a decade, said the factory was 'one of the most professional operations' he had ever seen. 'Someone has taken care here which makes you think they intended to stay for a while,' he said. 'They aren’t amateurs, they will probably have a number of grows ongoing at the same time.' He added that the suspected 'grower' and his accomplices are likely to have been forced into running the farm after being . trafficked into the UK by organised crime gangs. 'It is likely that we’ve got someone in here - probably imported into the country - who is practically kept as a slave to look after this place,' he said. 'There is an organised crime gang behind it. The people who tend to these sorts of farms are, in effect, victims themselves.' A job well done: Following the PCSOs' discovery, hundreds of people have taken to social-networking sites to congratulate them. James Clennett wrote: 'Well done to those two! Keep that rubbish off the streets!' Meanwhile,West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson said the scale of the problem was difficult to assess. But he added: 'There’s no doubt in my view that it’s an underestimated crime and something that needs putting at the top of the agenda.' Forensic investigators are now studying the factory and its produce in a bid to track down the people responsible. Following the PCSOs' discovery, hundreds of people have taken to social-networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, to congratulate the pair.

The report said: 'Examination of all internal pipework . and transfer passages has not revealed any pre- or post-impact failure . and all paths still permit (correct) uninterrupted fuel flow. 'It has . been established that unrestricted flow was also available from each . supply tank to the corresponding engine fuel control unit, through the . relevant fuel shut-off valves which were found set to the 'open' position.' More than 100 people were in the popular Clutha bar, near the River Clyde, when the helicopter plunged into the venue's roof. Among the fatalities were the doomed aircraft's crew members - David Traill, 51, and police officers Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43. Six pub-goers were also killed when the helicopter struck, including Robert Jenkins, 61, Mark O'Prey, 44, Colin Gibson, 33, John McGarrigle, 57, Gary Arthur, 48, and Samuel McGhee, 56.

David Cameron has blocked plans to give voters the power to expel MPs found guilty of serious wrongdoing. The power to ‘recall’ an MP if they are found guilty of a crime, or judged to have committed ‘serious wrongdoing’ by their colleagues, was backed by all three parties after the expenses scandal, as part of restoring public trust in politics. The Tories and Lib Dems agreed to make it law when the coalition was formed but the idea has now been jettisoned by the Prime Minister and will not feature in the upcoming Queen's Speech. Ditched: David Cameron refused to include the power of recall policy . in this year’s Queen’s Speech, which means it will not happen before . the next election, despite Nick Clegg's promises . If 10 per cent of constituents signed a petition it would have triggered a by-election forcing an errant MP to stand for election again . A petition signed by ten per cent of an MP's constituents who are unhappy with their behaviour would have triggered an automatic by-election under plans included in the coalition agreement. Nick Clegg went further and suggested any MP given a jail sentence would be automatically kicked out. But it emerged last night that Mr Cameron and George Osborne have refused to include it in this year’s Queen’s Speech, which means it will not happen before the next election. The move ignited a fresh coalition row, with the Lib Dems accusing the Tories of being motivated by 'self-preservation' when there was 'no obvious excuse or good reason' to block it. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who has been campaigning for the recall plan to be introduced said it showed politicians had failed to grasp why the public 'hated' them. 'Parties can stuff their manifestos full of clever promises, but if voters don't believe them, they may as well present blank sheets,' he wrote on Twitter. 'How is it possible that our leaders still don't understand that the single biggest cause of people's hatred of them is deceit?' It is understood Lib Dems, who have been pushing for the policy, were informed it had been killed off this week.  Mr Clegg told his MPs about the decision on Tuesday night. Supporters of the plan say it could have removed Eric Joyce, the former Labour MP who was found guilty of assaulting a Tory MP and several researchers in a drunken episode in a Commons bar. The MP for Falkirk resigned the Labour whip but is still an independent MP. Patrick Mercer, who was filmed allegedly soliciting payment for raising issues in parliament last July, could also have fallen victim to it. He was forced to resign the Conservative whip but will continue to represent Newark until May 2015. Supporters of the plan say it could have removed former Tory MP Patrick Mercer (left) and . Eric Joyce, the former Labour MP who was found guilty of assaulting a . Tory MP and several researchers in a drunken episode in a Commons bar . The idea of giving voters a chance to kick out their MP between elections emerged at the height of the expenses scandal in 2009. Several MPs continued to sit in the Commons and claim expenses even while they were being investigated by the police. Eric Illsley, the Labour MP for Barnsley Central, stood down voluntarily in February 2011 after pleading guilty to defrauding the taxpayer of £14,500 he claimed in parliamentary expenses. He was later sentenced to 12 months in prison. Former Labour MPs David Chaytor and Jim Devine were able to remain in Parliament for three months after being charged with false accounting over their expenses. They departed only after being deselected by Labour, making them ineligible to stand for the party at the general election in May. Former Labour MP Jim Devine was able to remain in Parliament for three months after being charged with false accounting over their expenses while Eric Illsley stood down voluntarily as a Labour MP after he was convicted of defrauding taxpayers out of £14,500 . The Tories' refusal to support recalling MPs provoked a furious response from the Lib Dems. Tim Farron, the party’s president, said the Conservatives were motivated by 'self-preservation'. He  told The Independent: ‘This was an important step which we fought for in the Coalition agreement to try and restore some level of trust in politics. 'It sends a message to the electorate that “we don’t trust you. We think you might do things which we don’t like”.' He later told the BBC: 'It seems very wrong to me that an MP can be in position for the five years of a Parliament, get up to things which all of us would agree are inappropriate and be in a position where they would not be able to be held to account during that time. 'That's the basic, modest proposal that was agreed in the coalition agreement and there's no obvious excuse or good reason for David Cameron to block that vote now, but that is what he has done.' Graham Allen, chairman of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, which scrutinised the proposal, said he was not surprised it had been dropped, because the moment to introduce it was soon after the expenses scandal and the issue had now lost momentum. Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, responding to reports that the Government is set to drop plans to recall MPs, said: 'This is another broken promise from David Cameron. He's now backtracking from his own manifesto commitment to introduce recall of MPs. 'And Nick Clegg's claims back in 2010 that he'd be the 'great reformer' on the constitution are frankly laughable as he's got nothing whatsoever to show for it.'","Power to 'recall' MPs was backed by all three parties after expenses scandal .

More than £2.5million . has been spent getting rid of over 100 government officials only for . them to be rehired, MailOnline can reveal. It confirms that Whitehall’s lucrative revolving door has continued to turn despite the age of austerity. The . revelation will raise fresh questions about the ability of the civil . service to manage staffing numbers when they are supposed to be making . major savings. Return: Dozens of people laid off by government departments since 2010 have been rehired . Since May 2010 at least 106 people . have retired or been made redundant from government departments with pay-offs worth . at least £2.563million before being re-employed. The . Ministry of Defence alone spent £1.6million paying-off 44 staff who . have been rehired, while the Foreign Office the bill was a total of . £647,840 rehiring 14 people and the Department for Transport shelled out . £315,000 on 10 which went back to work there. The true scale of the bill could be much higher because several government departments refused to give details of the pay-outs. Labour . shadow transport minister Lilian Greenwood, who obtained the figures, . said: ‘This is just the latest example of how the Government’s . incompetence is wasting money. Labour frontbencher Lilian Greendwood condemned the 'shambles' of departments rehiring people they had laid off . ‘Taxpayers . will be outraged that at least £2.5 million has spent on paying off . civil servants, only for them to be rehired at great expense. ‘Ministers . seem to be stumbling from crisis to crisis while failing to deliver the . major projects that the country needs. The taxpayer shouldn’t be . footing the bill for this latest shambles.’ William . Hague's Foreign Office has rehired 14 people who had already retired. Eight of them received a total of £647,840.06 before being asked back. Foreign . Office minister Hugh Robertson said: ‘Individual payments are . calculated in accordance with the civil service pension scheme rules in . place at the time of retirement and are based on salary, years of . service and age.’ The . Ministry of Defence said that of some 10,000 civilian staff to have left . under a Voluntary Early Release Scheme, of 44 have been re-employed. Between . them they received lump sums totalling £1.6million to leave before . going back. Only one had to repay their redundancy money. Defence . minister Andrew Murrison said: ‘We have saved taxpayers some £2.2 . billion from a 15 per cent reduction in the civil service which is now . at its smallest since the second world war.’ Under . the Civil Service Compensation Scheme, only staff who are re-employed . within 28 days have to return all of their redundancy package. If an employee has been out of the civil service for more than six months before returning they pay back nothing. Philip Hammond's Ministry of Defence has rehire . 44 people it spent £1.6million making redundant while William Hague's . Foreign Office rehired 14 people who received a total of £647,840 when . retiring . The . Department of Health has already faced criticism for the huge number of . NHS staff paid off as a result of its controversial reorganisation only . to turn up in other health service roles. More than 3,200 NHS bureaucrats were handed redundancy pay-offs before walking into new jobs in the Health Service. Husband . and wife Chris Reed and Karen Straughair received six-figure pay-offs . from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got . jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust . At the DoH itself one member . of staff who was made redundant was rehired 16 months later, although . health minister Daniel Poulter insisted they were paid less than before. The .

Wilson doctored business statements to hide his fraudulent activity, using Google Images to copy the signature of author Terry Pratchett (pictured) to sign off audit reports . The manager of an investment fund used Terry Pratchett's signature to help dupe investors out of £22million. Benjamin Wilson, 35, used the money of 'several hundred' investors - including close friends and colleagues - to fund his 'lavish lifestyle', Southwark Crown Court heard. Wilson, who was today jailed for seven years, used the cash to pay for a multimillion-pound home as well as buying racehorses, a luxury sports car and gambling in Las Vegas. He doctored business statements to hide his fraudulent activity, using Google Images to copy the signature of author Terry Pratchett to sign off audit reports, the court heard. He pleaded guilty in December 2013 to two counts of forgery and one of fraud, having previously admitted a charge of operating a collective investment scheme without authorisation. Sentencing Wilson to seven years, Judge Michael Grieve said Wilson had carried out an ‘utterly shameless confidence fraud’ targeting victims who invested money ‘they could ill afford to lose’. He had used the cash to fund a lifestyle of ‘untold lavishness and luxury’, the judge said. ‘You were the sole architect of the fraud from start to finish,’ he said. ‘There may well be some element of living in a world of make believe. ‘At the same time it was a cruel and very sophisticated fraud with only one beneficiary - that was yourself.’ Opening the case earlier, prosecutor Michael Brompton QC said Wilson was a ‘cunning and sophisticated man’ who targeted a large number of victims, many of whom were vulnerable. ‘Between 2003 and 2010 he obtained funds totalling approximately £21.8million from several hundred private investors which he purported to invest in a collective scheme managed by him,’ the barrister said. ‘He offered investors huge returns on their money and pretended that he had succeeded in obtaining them. ‘In fact, most of the money was uninvested and that which was invested produced paltry returns or, more frequently, losses.’ The rest of the money was used to pay for Wilson's ‘extravagant lifestyle’ and to ‘defray the overheads of his business facade’, Mr Brompton said. Most of the investors were recruited by word of mouth including friends and members of his local golf club and later by a firm of financial advisors, the court heard. Some of the investors appeared to be ‘wealthy people’ but most suffered ‘grievous losses’, Mr Brompton said. Wilson, from Verwood, in Dorset, told investors the fund was based in the British Virgin Islands and therefore not under regulation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the court heard. ‘In fact there was no such fund in the British Virgin Islands,’ Mr Brompton said. The money was instead held in the UK bank accounts in Wilson's name, the prosecutor said. In 2008, Wilson used investors' cash to take on new offices in Bournemouth which he refurbished to include a bar, massage room and a games room, the court heard. He recruited new ‘mostly youthful’ employees, including two trainee traders, with no experience of trading on financial markets, the hearing was told. ‘They spent most of their time on computer simulations and rarely traded live,’ Mr Brompton said. The employees were not accomplices and had also invested into the fund which Wilson claimed was now worth more than $100million, the prosecutor said. Wilson, 35, was sentenced today at Southwark Crown Court to seven years in prison . The court heard £20million of investors' cash was paid into Wilson's fund between 2009 and 2010. Less than £4million was invested with brokers, while some £6million was spent on Wilson's personal expenditure, Mr Brompton said. He used the cash to buy a house for £4million with refurbishments costing £500,000 as well as spending £200,000 on cars including a Ferrari California costing £160,000 and £200,000 on racing and racehorses. Other spending included £100,000 on shopping, £75,000 on golf and more than £85,000 on a gambling trip to Las Vegas, the court heard. Some £4million was also spent on business expenses including almost £1million on new offices in Poole, Dorset. Investors included professional rugby player Charles Amesbury, a school friend of one of Wilson's traders, and Keith Satchell, a life assurance company director whose son was Wilson's best friend from childhood, the court heard. Wilson, a Swansea University graduate, who previously worked for computer company Intel, was arrested in June 2011, the hearing was told. The court heard Wilson paid out £4 million to a handful of investors and a further £5.3million had been recovered - leaving £12million still outstanding. The defendant, who has since been declared bankrupt, was jailed for five months in April 2012 for breaching a freezing order imposed by the High Court. Some of Wilson's victims sat in the packed public gallery for today's hearing. One woman sniggered while another man shook his head as Michael Bromley-Martin QC, defending Wilson, told the court that his client's remorse for his actions was ‘unequivocal’. ‘This is a classic example of an apparently intelligent man self deceived by his own capabilities,’ the barrister said. ‘Not unlike an addicted gambler, always believing that he would win in the end.’ Wilson, wearing a shirt and grey jumper in the dock, showed no reaction as he was told he must serve half of his seven-year sentence in prison before being released on licence. He was also banned from working as a company manager or director for 15 years. A confiscation order was made for just £1 due to Wilson's bankruptcy. It is estimated a further £444,500 will be recovered for investors, the court heard.","Several hundred people were duped into investing in SureInvestment .

A jury on Friday rejected a defamation case against Courtney Love over a Twitter post that suggested one of her attorneys had been 'bought off' for not pursuing a lawsuit over her late husband's estate. The verdict came after roughly three hours of deliberation in a case that spanned eight days and focused on the Hole frontwoman's postings on the social networking site. The case centered on one 2010 post that suggested that San Diego attorney Rhonda Holmes had been 'bought off' and that was why she wasn't representing the singer anymore. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Courtney Love, pictured at a benefit last year, is smiling after a jury sided with the former Hole frontwoman after a Twitter defamation lawsuit was brought against her . Love had hired Holmes to file a fraud case against the estate of her late husband, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. The lawyer contended during the trial that she was fired by Love and that the tweet and other statements the singer made against her have caused her substantial damage. Love's tweet stated, 'I was (expletive) devastated when Rhonda J Holmes Esq of san diego was bought off' in response to a question from user of the popular social media site. The message was never meant to be public, Love told jurors. She said she meant for it to be sent as a direct message, which only the recipient would see, but it instead went public and was quickly deleted. The swift verdict wasn't witnessed by Love, who had left court after closing arguments ended Friday morning. She arrived just as the courthouse was closing down and met her attorneys, John Lawrence and Matthew Bures, in the hallway where she hugged them both. Love praised her attorneys and the jury after the verdict. Asked about her social media presence, Love said she refrained from posting on Twitter during the trial. 'I didn't tweet out of respect for the case,' she said. While the case was billed as the first 'Twibel' trial in which Twitter and libel law intersected, Lawrence said it was tried by the same rules as traditional defamation cases. Jurors determined that Love's tweet included false information, but the musician didn't know it wasn't true. First-ever: The 'Twibel' lawsuit was the first of it's kind . Holmes attorney Mitchell Langberg said the jury's verdict meant the panel determined Love's statement was defamatory, but the singer couldn't be held liable for it. Holmes' side asked the panel to award $8 million in damages and send a message that false statements online had consequences. Langberg said that while his client was disappointed with the verdict, her reputation was upheld and the world now knows that Love's statements were false. 'At the end of the day, her biggest asset in life is her reputation,' Langberg said. 'That she got back today.' Love's social media postings have gotten her into trouble several times. In 2011, she agreed to pay $430,000 to fashion designer Dawn Simorangkir over statements she posted on Twitter and Myspace. Simorangkir sued Love again last year, alleging the musician libeled her when Love accused Simorangkir of theft on the Howard Stern's radio show and taunted her on the social media site Pinterest. The case is pending, but Love said she's trying to be more careful about her online musings than she was when she tweeted about Holmes. 'I don't tweet like I did back then,' Love said Friday.","A jury decided a 2010 tweet criticizing an attorney was not libel .

Whinging mass murderer Anders Breivik has threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a PlayStation 3. The right-wing extremist - who killed 77 people in a bomb and gun attack on July 22, 2011 - insisted he needed a better console and video games to alleviate his 'torture'-like living conditions. It emerged today that he issued a typed list of 12 demands to authorities at the high-security unit in Skien in southeast Norway where he serving out a 21-year sentence. Discomfort: Anders Behring Breivik, pictured clutching the assault rifle used during a rampage which killed 77 people in 2011, has complained that prison authorities are treating him 'worse than an animal' The demands - outlined in a letter sent to the the French national newsagency AFP today - included better conditions for his daily walk and the right to communicate more freely with the outside world, which he argues are in line with European rights legislation. He also demanded that his PlayStation 2 games console be upgraded to a Playstation 3 'with access to more adult games that I get to choose myself'. Held apart from other prisoners since 2011 for security reasons, Breivik argued in the letter sent in November, last year, that he has the right to a wider 'selection of activities' than other inmates to compensate for his strict isolation. List of demands: Breivik, pictured walking among the bodies of the youngsters he killed in cold blood on Utoeya island on July 22, 2011, is demanding better conditions in the prison where he is serving a 21-year jail term . Breivik also wants his standard weekly allowance of 300 kroner ($49, 36 euros) to be doubled, particularly to cover his postal charges from written correspondence. Other demands include an end to daily physical searches, and access to a PC rather than to a 'worthless typewriter with technology dating back to 1873'. In the letter dated January 29 he said that since there has not been any real improvement in his prison conditions, a hunger strike would be 'one of the only' options at his disposal. Slaughter: A wounded woman is brought ashore opposite Utaoya island after being rescued during Breivik's killing rampage in July 2011 . Mourning: Thousands of floral tributes were laid at the Oslo Cathedral, Norway, following Breivik's killing spree . 'The hunger strike won't end until the Minister of Justice (Anders) Anundsen and the head of the KDI (the Norwegian Correctional Services) stop treating me worse than an animal,' he said, adding that he would 'soon' make public the starting date of his protest action. On July 22, 2011, Breivik killed eight people in a bomb attack outside a government building in Oslo and later killed a further 69, most of them teenagers, when he opened fire at a Labour Youth camp on the island of Utoeya.","Breivik is serving 21 years in prison for murdering 77 people in 2011 .

To many it might seem counter-intuitive, but researchers have found that playing video games – including violent shooter titles – may boost children’s learning, health and social skills. This conclusion comes from a review of studies into the influence of video games that will be published in the American Psychological Association’s flagship journal, American Psychologist. Debate has raged for years among psychologists and other health professionals regarding the effects of violent media, with many warning that gaming can lead to addiction, depression and aggression. Brain boost: The study found that playing violent shoot-em-ups, such as Call of Duty 2 (pictured), can enhance creativity . The authors of the article point out that these should be noted, but insisted that gaming has many positive side-effects. Lead author Isabela Granic, Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at Radboud University Nijmegen in The Netherlands, said: ‘Important research has already been conducted for decades on the negative effects of gaming, including addiction, depression and aggression, and we are certainly not suggesting that this should be ignored. ‘However, to understand the impact of video games on children's and adolescents' development, a more balanced perspective is needed.’ Benefits: Playing shooter video games improved a player's capacity to think about objects in three dimensions, just as well as academic courses to enhance these same skills, the study revealed . According to an article in the prestigious American Psychologist journal, playing games may have the following benefits . While one widely held view maintains playing video games is intellectually lazy, such play actually may strengthen a range of cognitive skills such as spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception, according to several studies reviewed in the article. The authors said this is particularly true for shooter video games that are often violent, such as Call of Duty 2, which was one of the titles used to study cognitive benefits. A 2013 study found that playing shooter video games improved a player's capacity to think about objects in three dimensions, just as well as academic courses to enhance these same skills, according to the study. 'This has critical implications for education and career development, as previous research has established the power of spatial skills for achievement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics,’ Granic said. This enhanced thinking was not found with playing other types of video games, such as puzzles or role-playing games. Playing video games may also help children develop problem-solving skills, the authors said. The more adolescents reported playing strategic video games, such as role-playing games, the more they improved in problem solving and school grades the following year, according to a long-term study published in 2013. What’s more, children's creativity was also enhanced by playing any kind of video game, including violent games. Simple games that are easy to access and can be played quickly, such as Angry Birds, can improve players' moods, promote relaxation and ward off anxiety, the study said. ‘If playing video games simply makes people happier, this seems to be a fundamental emotional benefit to consider,’ said Granic. Reap what you sow: Gaming isn't necessarily socially isolating, as fans of Farmville will attest . The authors also highlighted the possibility that video games are effective tools to learn resilience in the face of failure. By learning to cope with on-going failures in games, the authors suggest that children build emotional resilience they can rely upon in their everyday lives. Another stereotype the research challenges is the socially isolated gamer. More than 70 per cent of gamers play with a friend and millions of people worldwide participate in massive virtual worlds through video games such as Farmville and World of Warcraft, the article noted. Multiplayer games become virtual social communities, where decisions need to be made quickly about whom to trust or reject and how to lead a group, the authors said. Playing violent video games not only increases aggression, it also leads to less self-control and more cheating, a study finds. Negative consequences: Playing violent games such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas leads to an increased aggression, a study found . Researchers found that teens . who played violent video games ate more chocolate and were more likely . to steal raffle tickets in a lab experiment than were teens who played . nonviolent games. The . effects were strongest in teens who scored high on a measure of moral . disengagement – the ability to convince yourself that ethical standards . don't apply to you in a particular situation. Overall, . the results suggest that the risks posed by violent video games goes . beyond the well-studied impacts on aggression, said Brad Bushman, . co-author of the study and professor of communication and psychology at . The Ohio State University. ‘When people play violent video games, they show less self-restraint. They eat more, they cheat more,’ Bushman said. ‘It isn't just about aggression, although that also increases when people play games like Grand Theft Auto.’ Bushman . conducted the study with colleagues from Italy. The findings appear . online in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. Participants were 172 Italian high school students, aged 13 to 19. They . played either a violent video game (Grand Theft Auto III or Grand Theft . Auto: San Andreas) or a nonviolent game (Pinball 3D or MiniGolf 3D) for . 35 minutes, after practicing for 10 minutes.During . the experiment, a bowl containing 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of chocolate . M&M candy was placed next to the computer. The teens were told they . could freely eat them, but were warned that high consumption of candy in . a short time was unhealthy. Those who played the violent games ate more than three times as much candy as did the other teens, the result showed. ‘They simply showed less restraint in their eating,’ Bushman said. After . playing the game, the teens were asked to solve a 10-item logic test in . which they could win one raffle ticket for each question they got . right. The raffle tickets could be used to win prizes. The . teens were told how many answers they got correct and had the . opportunity to take the appropriate number of raffle tickets out of an . envelope containing many tickets while not being watched. However, the . researchers knew how many tickets were in the envelope so they could . later determine if a player took more than he or she had earned. Results . showed that teens who played a violent game cheated more than did those . who played a nonviolent game — more than eight times more. People who play video games, even if they are violent, that encourage cooperation are more likely to be helpful to others while gaming than those who play the same games competitively, a 2011 study found. The article emphasised that educators are currently redesigning classroom experiences, integrating video games that can shift the way the next generation of teachers and students approach learning. Likewise, physicians have begun to use video games to motivate patients to improve their health, the authors said. In the video game Re-Mission, child cancer patients can control a tiny robot that shoots cancer cells, overcomes bacterial infections and manages nausea and other barriers to adhering to treatments. A 2008 international study in 34 medical centres found significantly greater adherence to treatment and cancer-related knowledge among children who played Re-Mission compared to children who played a different computer game. ‘It is this same kind of transformation, based on the foundational principle of play, that we suggest has the potential to transform the field of mental health,’ Granic said. ‘This is especially true because engaging children and youth is one of the most challenging tasks clinicians face.’ The authors recommended that teams of psychologists, clinicians and game designers work together to develop approaches to mental health care that integrate video game playing with traditional therapy.","Findings published in the prestigious journal American Psychologist .

James Anderson felt this winter’s Ashes pain more keenly than his England team-mates — because he played the majority of the 5-0 whitewash with a broken rib. Although the injury was kept quiet, it has prevented him bowling a ball in the six weeks since returning from Australia. The Lancashire fast bowler, second on England’s Test all-time wickettakers’ list behind Sir Ian Botham, was struck while attempting to pull a Peter Siddle short ball in the second Test at Adelaide. Ouch: James Anderson is hit by a short delivery from Australia's Peter Siddle in the second Ashes Test, which broke his rib . Painful memory: Anderson looks dejected after having 28 runs hit off his over by Australia's George Bailey in the third Ashes Test . ‘It was suspected that it was broken straight away but it wasn’t confirmed until ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne when it was decided to get an X-ray done,’ said an England source. ‘There’s nothing you can do to treat broken ribs anyway, so it was a case of just getting on with things.’ The medical staff got the damaged area scanned after Anderson reported increased discomfort ahead of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The 31-year-old played through the discomfort on a concoction of painkillers and adrenalin but failed to reach the heights of the 2010-11 series, when he finished as the most prolific bowler on either side, claiming 23 victims in England’s 3-1 win. Familiar sight: Anderson walks back to his mark during the troubled Ashes series in Australia . Rare moment: Anderson celebrates taking the scalp of Shane Watson but wickets were hard to come by during the Ashes series . That tour also featured Anderson nursing a sore rib after Chris Tremlett inflicted a hairline crack while boxing at the German boot camp, although he had fully recovered by the first Test in Brisbane. The injury revelation helps to explain why a man widely regarded as the most skilful new-ball operator in world cricket claimed a modest 14 wickets at 43.94 runs apiece. While Anderson decided to play on through the pain barrier, other members of the shamed England squad did not see out the tour. Early return from Down Under: Anderson, right, could only watch on as fellow bowler Graeme Swann retired from cricket after the third Ashes Test . Jonathan Trott flew home with a stress-related illness after a torrid working over by the Australian pace attack in the first Test in Brisbane, . Graeme Swann announced his retirement after the third Test and paceman Steven Finn was then sent home to ‘work on technical aspects of his game’. When England were looking for someone to step forward during the final test in Sydney, Boyd Rankin twice left the pitch suffering from back spasms and cramp and sent down only 20 overs in the humiliating 281-run loss. Although Anderson has been reporting for pre-season county duty at Old Trafford, his participation has been restricted to working on a batting technique remodelled by former international colleague Kevin Pietersen over the winter. Clean bowled: Anderson endured a horrific time with the ball and bat during the Ashes tour in Australia . However, it is anticipated he will begin bowling in the indoor nets within a fortnight and will be fit for newly promoted Lancashire’s opening County Championship fixture against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on April 6. National selector James Whitaker has urged players to show their worth post-Ashes with strong domestic performances ahead of May’s one-day series against Sri Lanka. All England hopefuls will be free to play at the start of the domestic season following a blanket snub from the Indian Premier League. Stake a claim: England selector James Whitaker, right, has urged the team to show domestic form ahead upcoming one-day international matches . Meanwhile, England’s abject effort Down Under was put into a slightly kinder perspective yesterday as South Africa, the world’s No 1 Test playing nation, were also humbled by the rampant Australians. Mitchell Johnson, the scourge of Anderson and the England team, followed up his 37-wicket Ashes haul by returning match figures of 12-127 as the Aussies crushed South Africa by 281 runs in the first Test at Centurion. ‘You never play a perfect game but it felt really good out there,’ said Johnson. Match-winner: Mitchell Johnson claimed match figures 12-127 as Australia beat South Africa in the first Test at Centurion . The South Africans were skittled for 200 on the fourth day as Australia made it six Test wins in a row. Skipper Michael Clarke said: ‘We worked exceptionally hard and, wh e n I look i n my teammates’ eyes at the moment, they are so hungry to continue their success.’ South Africa will be determined to make amends in the second Test, which starts in Port Elizabeth on Thursday. Captain Graeme Smith said: ‘We did not meet expectations and we deserve every bit of abuse that comes our way. It is one of the most disappointing four days we’ve had as a team.’","Fast bowler broke rib in second Ashes Test at Adelaide .

But Pentecostal Pastor Jamie Coots died from his dangerous denomination at the weekend, having been bitten by a rattlesnake at his small Kentucky church and refusing to seek medical attention. The father-of-two was known for practicing an extreme and rare Christian tradition of snake handling, based on an interpretation of the King James Bible, Mark 16: 17-18, which reads: 'And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.'

The Pentecostal pastor had been handling a venomous animal at his Middlesboro church when the bite occurred . Fundamentalist: Jamie Coots has been handling snakes as part of his Christian faith for over 21 years. He died on Saturday after being bitten by one and refusing to go to hospital . Flashback: Jamie Coots first picked up a snake at the age of 20 and had been bitten at least eight times before the bite that killed him . Scene: Coots was bitten at his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, in Middlesboro, Kentucky, on Saturday night. He died later at his home . The rare Christian tradition of snake handling is based on an interpretation of the King James Bible in Mark 16: 17-18 . Coots starred on the National Geographic show Snake Salvation, which profiled the few serpent-handling preachers in Appalachia, . and had appeared on numerous documentaries and shows about the snake . practices at his church in the rural town of Middlesboro, which are . illegal. Coots comes from four generations of religious snake handlers and believed they couldn't hurt him as long as he had the power of God. According to WYKT, emergency crews responded to reports of a snakebite victim at Coots church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, about 8.30pm Saturday. A rattlesnake had bitten Coots on his right hand but he had gone home before emergency workers arrived. Officials then went to his house and urged Coots to accept medical care, but he refused. They left at 9.10pm. Police then received a call indicating that Coots had died. He was found dead in his home about 10pm. In 1995, a woman died at Coots' church from a snake bite. Melinda Brown, 28, of Parrotsville, Tennessee, was bitten on the arm by a large rattlesnake, Kentucky.com reported. Jamie Coots dances and sings while holding two venomous snakes at a service at his church in Middlesboro, Kentucky . Jamie Coots, seen here as a young man, was from four generations of religious snake handlers . Following her death, police considered charging Coots with violating Kentucky's law against handling snakes in church, however a judge said Coots should not be prosecuted for practicing his faith. Brown's husband, John Wayne Brown, 34, later died after being bitten by a rattlesnake in church in Alabama. One year ago Coots pleaded guilty to violating Tennessee's exotic animals laws after he was found with several rattlesnakes and copperheads in his car. It is understood he would drive to Tennessee to 'hunt' for the animals himself. During an interview with Australian current affairs program Sunday Night in July 2013, Coots said he first handled a snake at the age of 20. Followers have to wait until God instructs them to pick up a snake. 'A peace and a calm came over me and yet an overwhelming joy that God had counted me worthy to let me do that,' he recalled.

However Coots had strong beliefs over how he would deal with getting bitten. At the time he told Sunday Night he had been attacked eight times before. 'I made a vow to god when I first started taking up serpents that if ever I was bitten I wouldn't go to hospital,' he said. 'I believe that when its my time to go there aint a doctor in this world that can keep me here.' In 1998 a rattlesnake he was handling struck the middle finger of his right hand. In one of his final interviews, with Australian current affairs program Sunday Night, Jamie Coots explained why he refuses to be treated for snakebites . Coots refused medical attention. The end of his finger eventually died and fell off. Snake handling does not take place at every service in the fundamental churches.

Morgan Miller comforts her husband Bode Miller of the United States during the Alpine Skiing Men's Super-G on day 9 of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics . The last year has been a difficult one for Miller: the death of his younger brother, Chelone, in April 2013; the court fight over custody of his infant son; the work it took to come back from left knee surgery and return to the Alpine apex. ‘To be on the podium, it’s a really big day for me,’ said Miller, who placed eighth in downhill and sixth in super-combined. ‘Emotionally, I had a lot riding on it. I'm super, super happy.’ Wife Morgan has been with him every step of the way and was the first to congratulate him after his latest medal success. She was also quick to praise her husband's achievements and his resilience. 'After the year we've had, and the fact we just keep pushing through it,' she said, 'it just shows how resilient Bode is.'

'Everything felt pretty raw and pretty connected,' Miller said, 'so it was a lot for me.' Later he took to Twitter to honor his brother: 'Thanks for all the support, today was one of the most emotional days of my life. I miss my brother.' Gold in the event was taken by Norweigan Kjetil Jansrud, 28.  It was his country’s fourth straight super-G gold, and fifth in the past seven Winter Games.

Gold medalist Kjetil Jansrud, center, of Norway is flanked by silver medalist Andrew Weibrecht, left, of USA and joint bronze winners Jan Hudec, second left, of Canada and Bode Miller . ‘It’s big, insane,’ Jansrud said of Norway’s dominance in super-G, a discipline that challenges racers to be fast and technically correct through a gate-setting they have never practiced. They are allowed a one-hour, early-morning course inspection. ‘Somehow when you come to the Olympic Games, Norwegians are on the top of the podium and that is impossible to describe,’ he said. ‘It feels perfect so far.’ Jansrud singled out Miller as one of his own idols. ‘He was already winning races when I was a little kid. He has been one of my heroes,’ Jansrud told The Associated Press. ‘He has had such an amazing career.’ Miller, who started No. 13, took the lead with an exhilarating run, though he lost time going off line down the steep final slope after making the final jump. Wife Morgan was on hand to capture the historic moment and was the first to congratulate him after his latest medal success . Weibrecht peaked at the Olympics for the second time in an injury-ravaged career. Nicknamed ‘War Horse,’ the Lake Placid, N.Y., native has blown out each ankle and gone through surgeries on both shoulders since the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, where he got super-G bronze.

A mom and her four children have been tragically killed after their SUV was engulfed in flames on Saturday evening after another vehicle ran a stop sign and hit their car in Fresno County, California. The crash occurred after 7 p.m. when a 2004 Nissan Quest minivan hit the 29-year-old woman and her four children - boys ages 1 and 3 and girls ages 6 and 11 - riding in a 2003 Ford Expedition SUV at an intersection. The woman's husband, who was driving a quarter mile behind the SUV, saw his wife's vehicle burst into flames and tried unsuccessfully to free his family, including breaking the windows, said California Highway Patrol Officer Axel Reyes. A mom and her four children have been tragically killed after their white SUV was engulfed in flames on Saturday evening after another vehicle ran a stop sign and hit them . He received minor burns to his hands, while his wife and four children all died at the scene. The minivan's driver, 41-year-old Juana Martinez Bejarano, has been hospitalized for major injuries. CHP officers and fire officials are investigating the crash and the fire. Coroner's investigators haven't yet confirmed the identities of the burned bodies. A witness said the minivan was traveling about 60 mph or near the 55 mph limit of county roads in the area, Reyes said. Speed is not considered a factor in the crash; neither are drugs and alcohol, he said. â€˜You almost could not have timed it any better, the two front cornersâ€™ of the two vehicles struck at the worst angle - right near the engine blocks - likely leading to the fire, Reyes said. The crash occurred after 7 p.m. when a 2004 Nissan Quest minivan hit the 29-year-old woman and her four children - boys ages 1 and 3 and girls ages 6 and 11 . Investigators are also looking at whether Bejarano was on medication at the time of the accident, Reyes said. Her medical history indicates that may be a possibility, he said. Fresno County Coroner Dr. David Hadden said investigators were conducting autopsies on Sunday morning. The couple had been headed to pick up another child, which is why they were in two cars, Hadden said. It's unclear whether the child was their own or a relative. The crash was a tragedy for the Fresno County community, where it's impossible to not routinely bump into people one knows, Hadden said. Everyone involved in the accident was from the small town of Riverdale in Fresno County, which is just north of where the crash occurred. The town is about 80 miles south of Merced. Distraught family members gathered along with the father at the crash site on Saturday evening, Reyes said.

Heather Sederbaum was arrested Friday and has been charged with carrying a weapon on school property and unlawful conduct towards a child after the child alerted her teacher that she found her mother's gun in her backpack. Police were called to the Newington Elementary School on February 6, after the little girl discovered the gun in her bag at the end of the school day. Busted: Heather Sederbaum was arrested after her daughter found her gun in her backpack . Armed: Heather Sederbaum showed the gun to other parents at the school the day before it was found in her daughter's backpack . Authorities say that after finding the gun the girl immediately told her teacher, who took the black and pink Ruger .380, told the principal and then called police. The previous day, another parent volunteer at the school said Sederbaum bragged about having the gun on school property. 'She opened up her purse and showed us a gun that was black and pink. And the other volunteer said you cannot have that on school premise,' the volunteer, who asked to remain anonymous, told live5news.com. 'She said she had a concealed weapons permit. I was . shocked.' Ruger: The gun, similar to this one, appears to have been placed in the little girl's bag by her mother after other parents disapproved of her having it at school . The anonymous volunteer says she told another volunteer about Sederbaum's gun and she then told the school's principal. Additionally, the anonymous woman says that prior to the discovery of the gun in the little girl's backpack., Sederbaum confronted another mother who asked her if carrying a gun on school property was a good idea. According to Live 5, Sederbaum became flustered and left. Authorities say the little girl's teacher told police that Sederbaum had gone to her daughter's classroom the day the gun was found in the girl's backpack and asked if she could put a book in the girl's bag.

Mitt Romney has said that former President Bill Clinton 'embarrassed the nation' with the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but doesn't think it will affect Hillary Clinton's likely run for president. 'I think Hillary Clinton, if she becomes a nominee, will have plenty to discuss about her own record,' Romney said on NBC's Meet The Press' on Sunday. 'I don’t imagine that Bill Clinton is going to be a big part of it.' According to Yahoo News, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican nominee was asked to comment on the 42nd president in light of the GOP's recent 'resurrection' of the Clinton White House. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has described Bill Clinton as embarassing America on the world stage following the Monica Lewinsky affair . President Clinton bites his lip as he is asked about his involvement in the Monica Lewinsky affair . The famous shot: Bill Clinton embraces Monica Lewinsky in a crowd outside the White House on November 6, 1996 . Hillary Clinton is capable of standing on her away, away from her husband's sex scandal, if and when she runs for President, Mitt Romney said Sunday . 'He embarrassed the nation,' Romney said of Clinton. 'He breached his responsibility, I think, as an adult and as a leader in his relationship. And I think that’s very unfortunate. 'But I don't think that's Hillary Clinton's to explain. She has her own record, her own vision for where she would take the country. 'And I think that's something which will be debated extensively during the 2016 campaign.' Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky, who at the time was a 22-year-old White House intern, led to his impeachment in 1998 and subsequent trial. Clinton was eventually acquitted of the impeachment charges. Last month, Republican Sen. Rand Paul first raised the issue of the Bill Clinton White House, lashing out at Democrats over pushing the idea of the GOP's 'war on women' while forgiving Clinton for his 'predatory' affair. 'The Democrats, one of their big issues is they have concocted and said Republicans are committing a war on women,' Paul said. 'One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that bosses shouldn't prey on young interns in their office. 'And I think really the media seems to have given President Clinton a pass on this,' the Kentucky senator continued. Hillary Clinton is expected to enter the 2016 Presidential campaign . 'He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office. 'There is no excuse for that, and that is predatory behavior, and it should be something we shouldn't want to associate with people who would take advantage of a young girl in his office. 'This isn't having an affair. I mean, this isn't me saying, 'Oh, he's had an affair, we shouldn't talk to him.' 'Someone who takes advantage of a young girl in their office? I mean, really. And then [Democrats] have the gall to stand up and say, 'Republicans are having a war on women'? 'So, yes, I think it's a factor. Now, it's not Hillary's fault. But it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history.' Paul is considered one of several possible candidates for the 2016 GOP nomination. Former Bush administration adviser has warned the Republican party against a 2016 presidential election strategy that focuses too much on the political history of potential Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton . Romney is not among them. Romney's comments come as former Bush adminstration adviser Karl Rove cautioned Republicans against focusing their campagn too much on Hilary Clinton. Rove told Fox News Sunday he was uncertain whether revisiting Clinton and husband Bill Clinton’s years in the White House would help Republicans win the presidency. 'It may,' he said. 'But the trouble for Republicans is it’s easier to say what you’re against than what you are for.' Republicans have tried to knock down a Clinton candidacy essentially since she resigned from her post in February 2013 as secretary of state.","Mitt Romney appeared on Meet The Press on Sunday .

In the top finishers after Roosevelt were Abigail Adams, Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolley Madison. First among first ladies: Eleanor Roosevelt in 1933 . President Harry S. Truman later called Eleanor Roosevelt the 'First Lady of the World' in tribute to her human rights achievements, which include civil rights activism and playing a role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She was the first presidential spouse to hold press conferences, write a syndicated newspaper column, and speak at a national convention.

Least impressive, according to the survey, was Jane Pierce, the wife of 14th U.S. president, Franklin Pierce. Although historians disagree over exactly when the title of first lady came into common usage, it has traditionally been given to a president's wife and is an unofficial, but potentially powerful, role.

Oshie . has said he tries to be unpredictable with his shot selections in . high-pressure situations, and he leads the NHL with seven shootout goals . in 10 tries this season. While Oshie might not be a household name, hockey fans respect him as one of the best, his former coach said. 'Today he introduced himself to the world,' Hakstol said.

After Saturday's win, Oshie addressed the expectations of his fans back home. 'I'm definitely going to try to represent the town and obviously the country as best I can,' Oshie said.

Montana is suing a Canadian outfitter and a world-renowned hunting . guide in Tajikistan he accuses of turning his once-in-a-lifetime . adventure of bagging a rare, wild argali sheep known as the 'Marco Polo' into a nightmare. Rick Vukasin said in a . lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Reno last week that he spent . more than $50,000 pursuing the animal in the Pamir mountains of . northeast Tajikistan near China's border in December 2012. The . 65-year-old electrician said he felt like he was literally on top of . the world after he tracked, shot and killed a 400-pound, big-horned ram . with the coveted, spiraling horns at an elevation of 14,000 feet. But he . was mortified two months later when he opened up the box shipped to his . home in Great Falls to find the horns were not the 58-inch-long ones . from his trophy animal. 'Marco Polo': Rick Vukasin claims the horns he was sent are not the horns that were on the animal he shot . 'I could tell right away,' Vukasin said. 'I was sick.' The . native Montanan who grew up hunting deer on the eastern front of the . Northern Rockies had stalked moose in Saskatchewan and red stag elk in . New Zealand. 'But the thing I really wanted to . do was a Marco Polo sheep hunt,' he said. He poured over books, guides . and websites before settling on the excursion halfway around the world. 'The . biggest of the species is in Tajikistan. So I figured if I was only . going to be able to do this once, I'm going top shelf,' he said. Vukasin . and his guide, Yuri Matison, saw animals the first day but had . difficulty tracking them partly because it's hard to breathe at that . altitude, he said. But the next day he said he 'felt lucky' to land a . prize with a rack in 'pretty good shape ... not all busted up from . fighting.' The horns he ended up with are . missing a few noticeable chips and weathered to the point he suspects . they are at least two years old. Vukasin said . Matison and the booking outfitter - Ameri-Cana Expeditions Inc. of . Edmonton, Alberta - first insisted the horns were the originals, then . offered to send a replacement. Rare: The wild argali sheep can be found in the Pamir Mountains and is one of the rarest sheep in the world . He's demanding . reimbursement or his original horns, but he said a possible exchange is . complicated by international treaties governing hunting of argali, a . threatened species in Tajikistan. Only 60 permits are issued there . annually for the sheep named after the 13th century explorer. The . Safari Club International considers the argali's horns the 'most . spectacular' of all the world's sheep, according to its record book. Vukasin shot his in the same region where Matison had served as guide . about a month before for Soudy Golbachi of Augusta, Ga., when he set a . club record for landing one with horns more than 71 inches long. Vukasin said Ameri-Cana co-owner Dan Frederick dismissed his concerns, telling him 'it's just hunting.' 'Granted,' Vukasin said, 'you can have bad weather or you might not see any animals or you might miss the shot. That's hunting. 'But to shoot the animal and take pictures of it and then not to get it, somebody has to be responsible.' Frederick didn't immediately return calls or email seeking comment. The Associated Press was unable to locate Matison. Tajikistan: Vukasin traveled all the way to the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan for a chance to hunt the rare sheep . Vukasin . said he contacted an FBI agent in Great Falls, who indicated he . probably was a fraud victim but there was little authorities could do . unless they found a number of other hunters who'd also been duped. FBI spokesman William Facer in Salt Lake City said on Friday the agency could not comment. Linda . Linton, a Reno lawyer, said she filed Vukasin's lawsuit there because . Matison and Ameri-Cana advertise and do business there regularly at . conventions of the Safari Club International and the Wild Sheep . Foundation, the latter of which named Matison to its Mountain Hunter . Hall of Fame in 2009. Vukasin is seeking $75,000 in damages for lost money, 'worry, anxiety, loss of sleep, physical and mental distress.' 'I've . been fighting them more than a year. I finally got fed up and decided . to do something about it,' he said, adding he's convinced others have . been victimized. 'I have this stuff sitting in my living room and every . time I look at the horns, I just get that much more mad.'","The argali sheep is known as the 'Marco Polo' of goats and is amongst the rarest in the world .

Short-track skater Christie, who prefers the 1000m event, looked more relaxed before putting in a final burst which saw her edge Italy's Arianna Fontana in a photo-finish before she was penalised and placed in last position. Within minutes of the finish of the heat it emerged that Christie had been penalised for an infringement at the finish line. Close call: Elise Christie was adjudged to have made an infraction on the finishing line and was disqualified . Upset: Elise Christie was penalised before being disqualified from the 1500m event in Sochi . The 23-year-old Scot was devastated to be disqualified in the final of the 500m on Thursday for crashing into Fontana and was visibly upset after her second stroke of bad fortune. Fighting . back tears, Christie said she had been the victim of threatening . messages on social media following her first disqualification. 'I have had a few people threatening me,' she told the BBC. 'It's been a tough few days.' Sportsmail understands the abuse originated in Korea. The trigger is believed to be Christie crashing, when she sent Park Seung-Hi sprawling. Controversial: But Christie still has the 1000m to look forward . Heartbreak: Christie's late burst took her over the line in the heat but an infraction meant she was disqualified . The Korean skater recovered to finish . the race and was bumped up to the bronze-medal position when Christie . was pushed down the field. Short-track . speed skating is known to have a fervent following and, insiders within . the sport, say that instances of partisanship spilling over into abuse . is not totally unheard of. Christie’s management have taken down her Twitter account. Speaking . about Saturday's disqualification, she said: 'I'm gobsmacked. I expected . the decision the other day but today I have no ideas what's going on. 'I'm finding it quite hard.' There was more disappointment for Team GB in the next heat. Gilmartin, who reached the quarter-finals of the 500m earlier in the week, also failed to finish in the top three. Upset: Christie was also disqualified after causing a pile-up in the 500m event . Ouch: Christie was penalised despite finishing second . The 23-year-old from Nottingham, current European 1500m bronze medallist, finished fifth out of six. Christie's result was initially flagged up as 'penalty' which was later changed to 'DNF' (did not finish). GB short track coach Nicky Gooch, by way of explanation, said: ""The referee has said Elise didn't cross the line. 'She has crossed inside the finish line and he has ruled that that is off-track. 'Therefore he is saying she hasn't finished the race. 'She . (has) done nothing wrong in the race, tried to make sure she was . nowhere near Arianna and get her on the line, but the referee has called . off-track. 'It has been called before but not something that normally happens. 'I was shocked. I looked at the video and you are talking centimetres.' Great Britain short-track speed skating performance director Stuart Horsepool said: ‘We are talking about the smallest margin ever. There is nothing we can do. She won the race, we are absolutely devastated. ‘She was trying to win the race, she was lunging for the line. She was making sure she was safe and she went what we are talking millimetres.

Director Bob Jack said: ‘This is probably the most unusual insurance request we have ever had, but we are delighted to provide cover. ‘I'm sure everyone who sets sail on the loch would settle for a sighting of Nessie rather than a much closer encounter.

The creature is similar to other supposed lake monsters, though its description varies from one account to the next, and there have been hundreds of supposed 'sightings' over the years. One of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon, which can grow up to 12ft long.

These CCTV images show the final moments of man who was crushed to death between a train and a platform after a vicious fight broke out with a group of passengers . The horrifying pictures captures the drunken brawl which led to Ryan Harrison's horrific death in March last year and were shown during a trial at Guildford Crown Court. The jury were told how the 20-year-old was hit with a 'haymaker' punch which knocked him down between the departing train and the platform at Guildford train station. Judge Christopher Critchlow described it . as 'a horrific way to die' and said Mr Harrison's death had a shattering . effect on his family and friends. Final moments: Victim Ryan Harrison is wearing a t-shirt in the foreground after the brawl broke out on the train . Violent: Joshua Elphick and Joel Parish, Ryan's friend, are seen fighting while the victim watches on . Three friends are now starting prison sentences for their part in the vicious brawl which began after after Mr Harrison said one of the passengers looked like Lord of the Rings character Gollum. Joshua Elphick, who had admitted manslaughter and causing an affray at a hearing earlier this year, was jailed for five years. Following a week-long trial, two of his friends, Jack Hardy and Harry Miller, both 20, were convicted of affray and each jailed for a year. The defendants, all aged 20 years and from Guildford, had been drinking at a party in Godalming on March 30 last year before boarding a train home with friends. As they got off the train they passed Mr Harrison, who was with friend Joel Parish. Both had been drinking in Guildford and they were getting on the last train home to Woking. Altercation: Mr Harrison tries to intervene while terrified passengers watch the vicious fight unfold . Aggressive: The fighting pair move towards the set of automatic dootrs while Mr Harrison stands by in the carriage . Terrified: A bystander watches in horror as the fight spills out onto the platform. Minutes later, Mr Harrison was crushed between the departing train and the platform . As the groups came across each other at the train doors the fight broke out, at first with comments being made. The war of words continued between the two groups with the train doors being kept open. Elphick and Miller got back onto the train while Mr Harrison and Mr Parish had their shirts ripped in the brawl. Elphick then rushed onto the train and started throwing punches at Mr Parish, who was dragged from the carriage, thrown to the floor and beaten. Mr Harrison was then also pulled from the train and attacked, while the defendeants 'acted like a pack', according to witnesses. The fight was initially broken up by an off-duty military police officer, Staff Sergeant Justin Wright, who protected Mr Parish from Elphick before another of the group pulled the defendant away. Prosecutor Oliver Dunkin told Guildford Crown Court: 'What then happens must have happened very quickly. Tragic: A Lord of the Rings joke was thought to have sparked the brawl which resulted in the 22-year-old's death . Jailed: Harry Miller (left) and Jack Hardy, both 20, were sentence to a year in prison after they were convicted of affray at Guildford Crown Court . 'Mr Elphick shrugged the friend off. He ran down the platform and he punched Ryan Harrison. 'It was described as something of a haymaker. It may well be that the punch itself rendered him unconscious. 'He fell to the edge of the platform and was dragged beneath the train that was then departing.' That 'drained all fight' from Elphick as he realised what he had done and said: 'Oh my God, I just killed someone.' Elphick and Miller, who admitted throwing one punch and a kick, were arrested at the scene and Hardy, who helped pull Mr Harrison off the train, handed himself in the next day. The judge accepted that the defendants did not start the fight but said that the reaction from Elphick and Miller had been 'over the top' and that the group lost control because they had been drinking. Judge Critchlow said: 'You could and should have walked away. 'Joshua Elphick, you were the primary cause of the fighting because you twice went back onto the train to be abusive and then to fight. Scene: The brawl began after Mr Harrison made a joke about another passenger at Guildford station last March . 'Once you were off the train you continued to be aggressive. 'Neither Jack Hardy nor Harry Miller were directly responsible for Ryan Harrison's death but if you hadn't participated in the way you did, he wouldn't have been pulled off the train and exposed to that further violence.' Defending Elphick, Vincent Coughlin QC said he had shown genuine remorse for his actions by admitting his guilt straight away and accepted that he must go to prison. Mr Coughlin said: 'He must face his adult life weighed down by the knowledge that his violent behaviour has caused the terrible loss of another young man's life.' Miller and Hardy's defence teams stressed that their involvement in the fight was limited and that neither had started the argument, but Judge Critchlow said their sentence would have to be a deterrent. The judge said: 'Each of you is from a decent home and that makes it all the more tragic for you that you're here and it makes it more difficult to understand how you could have behaved in such a way."" All three were told they will serve their sentences in young offenders' institutions. Earlier, a fourth man - Adam Kulikowski, aged 20 years and from Cranleigh, Surrey - was found not guilty of affray in connection with the incident.","Ryan Harrison was killed after a fight broke out at Guildford station last year .

More than 30 gay couples will reportedly wed on-air during Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' performance of Same Love at the Grammy Awards. Queen Latifah will act as officiant during the televised ceremony as the duo perform the marriage-equality anthem with Madonna at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. According to the New York Times, 34 gay, straight and interracial couples - including Lewis' sister and her boyfriend - will exchange vows. Same love: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis performed 'Same Love' at the Grammys as 33 straight and gay couples married . Macklemore & Lewis: The duo performed with Madonna as Queen Latifah officiated the wedding ceremony . Time to say I do: Dozens of couples will marry on air during Sunday night's live broadcast of the music industry's annual Grammy Awards as Macklemore & Ryan Lewis perform their nominated song Same Love . 34 couples from different orientations and backgrounds --gay, straight, of different races and so on - will be married during the 'Same Love' performance . In an interview, Lewis, whose own sister will be part of the ceremony in getting married to her boyfriend, said that the weddings 'will be in our minds the ultimate statement of equality, that all the couples are entitled to the same exact thing.' The wedding's rehearsal took place on Saturday at the Staples Center, where the couples walked up and down aisles near the GRAMMY stage -- where they'll actually be married, as show producer Ken Ehrlich stated that putting the soon-to-be-wed pairs onstage 'could be viewed as more exploitative.' ""It seemed like less of a ‘show’ than if I put them onstage,' Ehrlich explained. 'I don’t want them to feel as though they’re on parade,' he told the New York Times. Emotional ceremony: For Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, the event took on a personal note with the participation of Lewis's sister Laura, who married her boyfriend during the ceremony . The idea for the weddings originated last fall when Mr. Ehrlich sat down with Macklemore & Ryan Lewis over a fried-chicken lunch to brainstorm ideas for a possible performance. Knowing that their concerts have occasionally featured onstage marriage proposals, Mr. Ehrlich suggested taking it a step further with a full wedding. The band was into it, so a casting agency was hired to find the couples, who at first were told only that the ceremony would take place on live television. The couples each signed confidentiality agreements — promising not to tell even their families. Defending the multi-marriage stunt from critics who are already beginning to voice their opinions against the Grammy wedding ceremony, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences president Neil Portnoy says, 'I expect that people with all kinds of opinions might voice them, and that's healthy, but we don't need to stoop to the level of trying to find gimmicks and sensationalistic approaches to what we do.' Prior to the Grammys performance, Lewis said that the weddings 'will be in our minds the ultimate statement of equality, that all the couples are entitled to the same exact thing' For Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, whose 'Same Love' is up for song of the year, the event took on a personal note with the participation of Lewis's sister Laura, who will marry her boyfriend during the ceremony. 'A night that is already tremendous for me, for the music,' the Times quoted him as saying, ""but to have my sister get married and my family there watching it — that makes it a whole other level of amazing.' The group is nominated for a total of seven Grammys. The GRAMMYs will be broadcast tonight at 8 p.m. on CBS.","During 'Same Love'. gay and straight couples will be married on live television at the event .

She has admitted publicly that when it comes to her sexuality she ‘plays for more than one team’. Now model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne has shown exactly what that means by locking herself away in a London hotel with Hollywood actress Michelle Rodriguez. Burberry model Cara, 21, is said to have joined Michelle, 35, in her luxury suite at the five-star Charlotte Street Hotel in London’s West End – after they enjoyed trips together to New York and Paris. Since arriving in London last week the . couple have barely been apart. According to friends they have been . ‘hanging out’ – watching TV and indulging in room service in Michelle’s . suite. They have also indulged in a bizarre health treatment – with Cara . tweeting pictures of them hand in hand hooked up to an infusion kit . which delivers vitamins intravenously. A friend said: ‘Michelle has an amazing suite and has been entertaining. She said that Cara has been over lots.’ The . hotel has three loft suites which are designed over two floors and . include an upstairs bedroom, a drawing room and granite and oak . bathrooms with separate walk-in showers and twin basins. The . pair’s friendship has developed rapidly since they were introduced via . pop star Rihanna, a mutual friend, earlier this month, and they are now . said to be ‘inseparable’. Their . fondness for each other was first revealed during the New York trip . when Cara kissed Michelle on the lips in full view of the crowd at a New . York Knicks basketball game in Manhattan. Then the pair met in Paris . when Cara was on a catwalk assignment for Chanel. The intimate friendship has been the talk of Hollywood where Michelle, who starred in Fast & Furious, is a big star. Intimate: Cara leans in for a kiss from Michelle at the basketball . Top model: Cara modelling for Chanel in Paris . The gossip columnist Perez Hilton . recently wrote on his website that the girls appeared to be ‘going . strong’ after enjoying a day out at a wild cat reserve in Nevada. The actress has spoken openly about her closeness to Cara. A friend said: ‘Michelle keeps her private life below the radar but she is definitely enjoying her time with Cara. ‘They are kindred spirits, they love partying, and share a sense of adventure and a love of fun. Cara  has been spending quite a bit of  time with Michelle. She is very open about it all.’ Michelle has also talked openly about her sexuality, and revealed in an interview last year: ‘I’ve gone both ways. I do as I please. 'I am too curious to sit here and not try when I can.’ She added: ‘Men are intriguing. So are chicks.’ A friend of Cara said: ‘She is just a young girl finding her feet. 'One minute Cara’s with a boy, another she’s with a girl. 'She gets obsessed with people very quickly and her friendships and relationships are always intense.’ Cara was previously linked to One Direction star Harry Styles. This gruesome picture was tweeted by Cara on Friday – showing her  and Michelle Rodriguez hand in hand at their hotel having an intravenous vitamin infusion. The cushion the girls are resting their arms on has the same spotted design as those that furnish the  £500-a-night suite where Cara and Michelle are staying. Vitamin infusions are known as The Party Girl Drip and the Dial-A-Dracula Drip – because the kit can be delivered to private addresses. Gruesome: Cara and Michelle hand in hand on the intravenous vitamin drip . They are a new fad, with celebrities such as Rosie Huntington Whiteley, Rihanna and Simon Cowell paying up to £400 hoping to boost the immune system and  cure hangovers.

This . followed packets sent to Aldershot, Hampshire, on Wednesday and another . two on Tuesday to an armed forces careers office in Reading, Berkshire, . and the Army and RAF careers office in Chatham, Kent. One . of the packages bore a Republic of Ireland postmark and Downing Street . said the small but potentially viable devices bore 'the hallmarks of . Northern Ireland-related terrorism'. Scotland .

'The . claim was received on Saturday February 15 by a Northern Irish media . outlet using a recognised codeword. The claim was allegedly made on . behalf of the ""IRA"". 'The public is urged to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious to the Anti-Terrorist Hotline, 0800 789 321.' The Irish News reported that the 'IRA' had given a statement which said: 'The IRA claims responsibility for the . explosive devices that were sent to British armed forces recruitment . centres in England. Attacks will continue when and where the IRA see . fit.' Scare: An Army recruitment centre was also sealed off by police in Chatham, Kent . The . IRA disbanded in the years after it declared an end to its armed . campaign in 2005, but a group calling itself the New IRA formed just . before the London Olympics in 2012 and was linked to letter bombs sent . last autumn. A 'suspicious package' was . discovered today at naval base HMS Collingwood in Portsmouth, although . on closer inspection the parcel was deemed to be 'not suspicious'. The . MoD was unable to confirm if security levels at military bases had been . increased since suspicious packages were sent to recruiting centres . last week. However, the Home . Office's current terror threat level for Great Britain remains at . 'substantial' for international terrorism, meaning an attack is a strong . possiblity, and 'moderate' from Northern Ireland-related terrorism, . meaning an attack is possible, but not likely. Following the discovery of the packages, Prime Minister David . Cameron chaired a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergencies . committee to discuss the suspicious parcels. Worry: A suspect device was also found at the Army Careers office in Canterbury, Kent . A Number 10 spokeswoman said: . 'Seven suspect packages have been identified as containing small, crude, . but potentially viable devices bearing the hallmarks of Northern . Ireland-related terrorism. 'These have now been safely dealt with by the police and bomb disposal units. 'Guidance . has been issued to staff at all military establishments and Royal Mail . asking them to be extra vigilant and to look out for any suspect . packages and the screening procedures for mail to armed forces careers . offices is being reviewed. 'The national threat level remains under constant review.' At the weekend security sources said that the A4-sized packages were the work of ‘amateur’ Republican . terrorists seeking to impress more established rivals, security sources . believe. Scotland Yard . anti-terror detectives have been working with police officers from both sides . of the Irish border to identify those responsible. Patrick Mercer MP, a former Army . colonel who commanded UK troops in Northern Ireland, said that an . examination of the devices by forensic experts suggested the bombmakers . lacked experience. He said: ‘I understand that . they were amateurish in their construction. The devices are thought to . have been sent by members of the Real IRA, however there is currently a . feud inside this organisation about whether to mount a campaign in . mainland Britain.’ British Army recruiting centres have open since the parcels were sent, but remain on high alert. Police have . said two of the packages were posted in Dublin and a third package has . been traced to an area close to the border with Northern Ireland. No . arrests have been made. Bomb: The Grand Hotel in Brighton was targeted during the Conservative Party conference in 1984, killing five people including MP Sir Anthony Berry . The . Irish Republican Army (IRA) can trace its roots back to Catholic Irish . nationalists in the early 1900s, forming after the 1916 Easter Rising as . an amalgamation of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Irish . Citizen Army. During the Irish war of independence fought against the British between 1919 and 1921, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign fighting for the withdrawal of Britain from Ireland. When the war ended with a treaty a split occurred, with the anti-Treaty IRA and pro-treaty Free State Army fighting each other in the country's civil war. After a ceasefire was called the IRA continued to maintain that the governments of the Irish Free States were illegitimate. In . August 1969, there were fierce riots in Northern Ireland, including a three-day confrontation between Catholic residents of the Bogside and police in Derry known as the Battle of the Bogside. In December 1969, the IRA split into the Official IRA, which followed a more Marxist . ideology, and the more radical Provisional IRA over issues including . the use of arms to defend Catholic communities in Belfast during the riots. Political party Sinn Fein, which was formed in 1905, took on its current form in 1970 after a split again due to the drift towards Marxist ideas and the failure of the leadership to defend nationalists in Belfast. Although the party is associated with the IRA it has strongly denied that senior members held posts on the IRA Army Council. While the . Official IRA called a ceasefire in 1972 and fizzled out, the Provisional . IRA embarked on a 30 year paramilitary campaign against the British . presence in Northern Ireland. In the late 1970s the group re-organised itself into smaller cell-based structures that would be harder to penetrate. It is estimated that there were just several hundred members, organised into small cells. Dissident republicans targeted England on several occasions. In 1972 a bomb was detonated in Aldershot, at the headquarters of the Parachute Regiment, killing seven people and the following year two bombs were set off by IRA members in . London, including one outside the Old Bailey, which killed one man and . injured 180 others. In 1974, 21 people were killed in a . Birmingham pub bombing, while another 11 died after an IRA bomb was . planted on a coach carrying servicemen and their families along the M62. Ten years later, the Conservative Party conference in Brighton was targeted, killing five people including MP Sir Anthony Berry. The IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing. In . 1996, the IRA set off a large bomb at London’s Canary Wharf offices, . killing two people and causing millions of pounds of damage. Devastation: 206 people were injured after a 1,500kg bomb was detonated in the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester in 1996 . In . the same year  206 people were injured after a 1,500kg bomb was . detonated in the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester, and an explosive . device detonated prematurely on a bus travelling along Aldwych in . central London, killing the IRA operative and injuring eight others. On . 31 August 1994, the IRA called a unilateral ceasefire with the aim of . having Sinn Féin, admitted into the . Northern Ireland peace process. This . ceasefire ended in February 1996 but another was declared in July 1997. The IRA accepted the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 as a . negotiated end to the Northern Ireland conflict. In . 2005 the organisation declared a formal end to its campaign and had its . weaponry decommissioned under international supervision. Other dissident . groups have emerged since, including the Real IRA which formed in 1997 . and was behind the August 1998 Omagh bombing, which killed 29 people. On . March 7, 2009 Real IRA members claimed responsibility for an attack on Massereene Barracks that killed two British soldiers. A group the 'New IRA' formed in 2012 from remnants of the Real IRA and other paramilitary factions including Republican Action Against Drugs.

A woman who wanted to celebrate her 40th birthday by treating herself to liposuction was left with unsightly, lumpy legs. Debbie, now 47, had to live with the effects of her botched surgery for seven years. She had hoped to get perfect thighs but instead was forced to constantly keep her legs covered up and as a result suffered from low self-esteem. Now the married driving instructor has appeared on TV show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if they can help her. Scroll down for video . She admitted she regretted having the cosmetic treatment which sucks fat from the body. She said: 'It's not what I wanted or asked for. If I could turn back the clock I would not do it. I've been left with craters and grooves in my legs.' Debbie returned to the surgeon who botched the op leaving her with dented thighs instead of smooth skin. But he assured her nothing was wrong. 'I was told it was just swelling and it would go down with time.I believed him, why wouldn't I?' she said. Plastic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh, who operates from his clinics in London, Birmingham, Worcester and Herefordshire, was shocked by the state of Debbie's legs when he examined her for the TLC TV show. He speculated on what had gone wrong to leave her with much unsightly legs pitted with craters. He said: 'Has this surgeon just taken out too much fat? Or has Debbie had a bleed in there or has something else gone on to allow the fat to die?' Ironically, Dr Vijh said the solution was . for Debbie to have more fat put back into her thighs to smooth out the . holes. He added that botched lipo was a 'nightmare' to fix but he would . 'give it a go'. Embarrassed on the beach: The driving instructor was left with lines, left, and craters, right, in her thighs that made her feel self-conscious if her legs were ever on show . Debbie said she was prepared to go back under the knife and have fat pumped into her legs if it would help. 'I'd much rather that than stay as I am now,' she admitted. The cameras followed Debbie into the operating theatre where Dr Vijh discovered the last surgeon had left her body with 'lots of scarring and complications' that was causing the dents in her skin. By inserting small bits of fat throughout her thighs, he was able to smooth her skin out again. After the surgery, Debbie admitted she was 'really pleased with the result'. Smooth again: A second op to repair the damage has left Debbie full or confidence and happy with the appearance of her legs . Dr Vijh explained: 'It's the way it should have been done the with first time around with no lumps or bumps.' Debbie added: 'I feel more confident now. I can wear a bikini again and not worry about what people are thinking if they see me on the beach. 'Now I know people are looking at my legs . because they look good, not because they have craters in them.

The star of America Beauty may have declined to act in The Voorman Problem - but he helped Mr Gill bag Rev star Tom Hollander, who in turn brought along Sherlock's Martin Freeman. And the brass neck of the 32-year-old graduate has certainly paid off after he bagged a career-making Oscar nomination for the film, which was shot on location at Strangeways Prison and the University of Salford. The accomplished blagger is now . looking to push his luck even further with a bid for free flights to Los . Angeles for the ceremony. He was reported to say: 'At the minute we have no flights booked because we're skint, we poured all our money into the film. 'We've spoken to British Airways and we've tweeted Richard Branson, but we'll probably have to put it on a credit card. 'We'll be slumming it in the back, in steerage.' The director chose to write to Mr . Spacey after studing for a film degree from the University of Central . Lancashire, where he had won an RTS Student Award with his graduation . film. After admiring the American's . performance in Seven, he decided to try his luck and sent a letter to Mr . Spacey asking him if he would like to star in his debut film.

After admiring the American's performance in Seven, he decided to try his luck and sent a letter to Mr Spacey asking him if he would like to star in his debut film. Mr Spacey, the artistic director at the Old Vic in London, politely declined the offer but recommended Tom Hollander for the role. Mr Gill said: 'All good actors love to read a good script and we had so much belief in the project. 'We always look to work with the best and it worked here.' After bagging the Rev actor, Mr Freeman - currently starring as Bilbo Baggins in Hollywood blockbuster The Hobbit - soon followed. Mr Gill told The Times: 'He wasn't Bilbo Baggins when we called him. 'He'd just got Sherlock. 'We were just grateful to get Martin. 'He's in a  lot of short films and he's a great champion of the form.' The Voorman problem was co-written by Mr Gill along with producer Baldwin Li and was adapted from a section of the novel number9dream by David Mitchell. It won the Best Live Action Short at the St Louis International Film Festival and Best Screenplay at the Corona Fastnet Film Festival. It has also just been nominated for a BAFTA AWARD in the short film category. Mr Gill's next project is another short film called Full Time starring Chris Langham.

Two college students who discovered that they have a common sperm donor father revealed today the moment they found out they are sisters. Tulane freshmen Mikayla Stern-Ellis, 19, and fellow-Californian Emily Nappi, 18, discovered just weeks ago that they are related after a series of bizarre coincidences drew them together. Both are delighted to have a new sister, saying they already love each other. However only one of them intends to seek out their sperm donor father. Scroll down for video . Mikayla Stern-Ellis (left) and Emily Nappi, pictured today, met when they both attended Tulane University and realized that they were half-sisters . The two girls, pictured as babies, have the same sperm donor father that was used by their parents in California almost two decades ago. A twist of fate brought them together at college in New Orleans . Mikayla first made contact with Emily last summer while searching for a possible roommate on Facebook. The girls had a lot in common but their paths never really crossed at the New Orleans school. Mikayla told Matt Lauer on the Today show: 'We didn't know each other that well, we could be really compatible as friends but we were never in the right place at the right time but we've definitely got a lot closer recently.' They figured out that they were conceived by a donation from an anonymous donor after Mikayla posted a Facebook message about her upbringing. But neither thought much of it, even when they figured out that both of their donors were Colombian. Mikayla said today: 'I thought ''Wouldn't it be funny if we were sisters?''' Mikayla's lesbian mothers Heidi and Debra Stern-Ellis used an anonymous sperm donor to have their daughter two decades ago. What are the chances! Emily Nappi (left) and Mikayla Stern-Ellis (right) met during their freshman year at Tulane and discovered they shared the same sperm donor father . When the girls went home for winter break, Mikayla told her moms about her new friend with whom she had so much in common. They urged her to compare her donor identification number with Emily - and the incredible discovery was made. Emily told Lauer: 'I panicked... I absolutely freaked out... I started running around the house screaming and telling everyone, calling everyone.' Mikayla added: 'It was mind-blowing, I didn't know what to do.' Following the life-changing realization, their bond has become much more intense. Mikayla said: 'We see each other multiple times a day now. We're a lot closer. 'The first time we saw each other [since finding out], we didn't really know what to do. But we became best friends because that's what we would have done even if we weren't sisters.' Emily added: 'There was a moment at dinner when I said ''I don't know your favorite color or anything about you''. We've been catching up. 'I already tell her I love her after two weeks.' Surprise sisters: Biological half-sisters Mikayla (left) and Emily (right)  are both Californians attending Tulane . The girls said it was cool to get . more family along with a new sister and the two sets of parents were . already hanging out with each other.

Microsoft is set to appoint its cloud-computing head Satya Nadella, as its next chief executive, it has has been claimed. Experts say the move could signal a focus on business users rather than consumers for the firm, which has faced aggressive competition from Apple and Google for its software. Microsoft's board has taken five-months to search for a new boss to replace Steve Ballmer as head of the world's largest software company before turning to the 22 year veteran. Microsoft has officially named cloud-computing executive Satya Nadella, pictured, as its new CEO. Nadella, who has spent 22 years at the firm and was previously in charge of the tech giant's cloud software and services division, will replace exiting CEO Steve Ballmer . Nadella, a native of Hyderabad, India - where Microsoft has its largest non-U.S. research center - was promoted to run the company's fast-expanding cloud, or internet-based, computing initiatives in July last year. Born in 1967 and educated in India and the United States, Nadella's tech career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems. He joined Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading roles in the Office and Bing search-engine teams. He was promoted to run the company's server and tools unit in 2011. As part of the move, co-founder Bill Gates may step aside as chairman and be replaced by lead independent director John Thompson, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is private. Gates would remain a director, the source added. Bloomberg first reported the news on Thursday. Rising star Nadella, a native of Hyderabad, India - where Microsoft has its largest non-U.S. research center - was promoted to run the company's fast-expanding cloud, or internet-based, computing initiatives in July last year as part of current CEO Steve Ballmer's radical re-organization of the company. The appointment of the 22-year Microsoft veteran would make him the most powerful Indian-born tech executive in the world and put him alongside PepsiCo Inc's chief, Indra Nooyi, as the leader of a well-known, large-cap U.S. corporation. Born in 1967 and educated in India and the United States, Nadella's tech career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems. He joined Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading roles in the Office and Bing search-engine teams. He was promoted to run the company's server and tools unit in 2011. That unit now forms the backbone of Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, which Nadella runs under his official title of executive vice president, cloud and enterprise. 'He's a solid choice,' offering continuity of strategy and proven execution, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. Some investors had campaigned for an external CEO who might be more likely to shake up the company and reward shareholders with greater dividends and share buybacks, but Parakh said that did not mean Nadella would be unpopular with Wall Street. 'Any new CEO is going to have to have the shareholders' say in mind. But it's not certain that will translate into actions,' said Parakh. Experts say the move could see a more business focus, rather than a consumer focus which some said could have seen Microsoft spin off its Xbox division . If Nadella is named CEO, it is likely Thompson will help out on the crucial task of managing Microsoft's relations with its powerful Wall Street investors, the source said. Nadella has little experience of that aspect of the job, and Ballmer and Gates did not prioritize it. Gates would likely focus on technical innovation in any new role, the source said. There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to radical change and investor-friendly moves. Ballmer, who plans to retire as soon as a new CEO is named, was reelected to the board in November, but it is not clear how long he will remain there after retirement, the source said. Several people briefed on the CEO search process had previously told Reuters that Microsoft was down to a handful of candidates, including Nadella and Tony Bates, executive vice-president of business development, plus at least one external candidate. The board still has not met to finalize Nadella's offer and nothing has been signed, the source said. Microsoft declined to comment. Microsoft shares rose 0.8 percent to $37.15 after hours, after gaining slightly in regular Nasdaq trading. Company founder Bill Gates, pictured, also announced he is leaving his role as chairman to become technology adviser, and board member John Thompson will take his place. There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to radical change . Microsoft's CEO search has taken longer than most expected when Ballmer said last August he would retire within a year. In a blog post on the company's website in December, Thompson emphasized the need for a CEO with 'an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent'. Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee, said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision 'in the early part of 2014'. The appointment of a company veteran like Nadella, which follows a flirtation with outsiders such as Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Alan Mulally, could disappoint some investors who want a more radical transformation at the software giant. 'While many on the Street are now expecting Mr. Nadella to get the CEO spot, we believe filling this position with a core Microsoft insider will disappoint those hoping for a fresh strategic approach (e.g. potential breakup of enterprise/consumer, Xbox spin off) an outside executive could have brought to the table,' FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note, adding that innovation and fresh strategies were needed. 'With that said, we believe Mr. Nadella's prior roles in the Online Services Division, Business Division and most recently as president of the Server and Tools business position him as a strong internal candidate with a broad set of knowledge around Microsoft's massive product portfolio,' Ives wrote.","Cloud-computing head Satya Nadella set to be given role .

A young cancer patient has drawn up a bucket list of things to do before she dies – including going on the Orient Express and being a bridesmaid. Ann-Marie Noble, 31, had a promising career in the RAF, having progressed to the rank of flight lieutenant. However, in April she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and doctors told her there was nothing more they could do for her. Ann-Marie Noble, 31, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in March last year. After chemotherapy and radiotherapy she was given in the all-clear in October. However, in April she was told the cancer had returned . But Ms Noble, from Hartlepool, says she is refusing to give up, and is determined to live her life to the full in the time she has left. She said: ‘There’s no point getting angry and asking “why me?” - that’s not going to get you anywhere.’ Ms Noble has compiled a bucket list, with wishes including eating a meal prepared by Raymond Blanc, driving a super-fast car, and meeting Terry Wogan for a drink. She said: ‘I don’t feel any different. You’ve just got to have a positive attitude. But having terminal cancer has made me realise how much good there is in the world - people have been so supportive. I just want to enjoy my life - enjoy every minute.’ The former Durham University student has been in the RAF for five years and is currently based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. She was initially diagnosed with cervical cancer in March last year after an annual smear test. Ms Noble is still having chemotherapy to prolong her life but doctors have said there is nothing more they can do to save her . Despite various treatments, including laser treatment and a radical trachelectomy to remove part of her cervix, no tumours were found. But cancer was found in some of her lymph nodes so she had to endure gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Following a scan last October she was given the all-clear. She took a month to recover at home and by Christmas she was back on the ski slopes to celebrate. But another cruel blow was to follow after she began getting pains in her left leg. Tests were carried out and doctors told Ms Noble that the cancer had returned. Two tumours were discovered resting on her major organs, and medics said she could not have any more radiotherapy. ‘They said it was back, and there’s nothing they can do,’ she said. She explained all doctors could offer her was six months palliative chemotherapy. She . said: ‘The chemo is not going to cure me. It’s giving me some extra . time, and I will only do it as long as it’s working and can give me a . good quality of life to spend with my family.’ She has drawn up a list of things to do before she dies which includes having tea at the Ritz, going in a hot air balloon, taking her family on holiday, and wing walking . Ms Noble, whose sister Philippa, 30, is in the army, spent time with her family, parents Ann and Mick Walsh, both 53, and sister Melissa Walsh, 19, last week before returning to her RAF quarters, where friends are helping to care for her. Ms Noble has urged other young women to make sure they have regular smear tests to reduce their chances of cervical cancer. She says she has no doubt that having . her smear test last year gave her more time to spend with her family . and friends, as she thinks she may have died by now without it. She had this advice for other women and girls: 'Just take a leaf out of my book. 'I was diagnosed when I was 30 and had absolutely no symptoms. 'I would say go and get the test. It could save your life. Even if I just help one person, that would be fantastic. 'I was fit as a fiddle, endurance . running and doing five marathons back-to-back, but cancer is so . indiscriminate, it can affect anyone.' Ms Noble has been hindered in carrying out her wishes by the costs of travel insurance for people in her situation. She has set up a web page called 'Help me: As cancer sucks!' where well-wishers have been donating towards the cost of holiday insurance, which can be up to £2,000. She has a £4,000 target and insists she will match every pound donated. Her page can be found at www.gofundme.com/338gz8 and she also has a twitter blog at @annmarienoble31 . Extreme slip ‘n ‘slide .

Likely presidential candidate and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul doubled down on comments his wife made in an interview with Vogue magazine: former President Bill Clinton is a 'predator.' Paul was referring, of course, to the former president's multiple flings with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Further, Paul says Bill Clinton's past indiscretions could be fair game if his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were to also make a run at the White House. Denial: Bill Clinton infamously claimed he never had sex with 20-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky . 'Predator': Senator Rand Paul says Clinton's 'predatory' behavior undermines claims the GOP is waging a 'war on women' The Kentucky senator went on to use Clinton's affair with Lewinsky to defend Democratic claims that Republicans have 'waged a war on women.' 'One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that . bosses should not prey on young interns in their office. And I think . really the media seems to have given President Clinton a pass on this,' Paul said during an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday. 'He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his . office. There is no excuse for that, and that is predatory behavior….. Then they (Democrats) have the gall to stand up and say, ""Republicans . are having a war on women.'"" 'Define ""is""': Clinton was later forced to admit that he had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and 'misled' people about it . Billary: It is suspected that Hillary Clinton will run for president in 2016 and Paul says Bill's affairs could be fair game in criticizing his wife . Implying that it would be unfair to judge Hillary Clinton on the shameful acts of her husband, host David Gregory asked Paul if he felt the Lewinsky scandal would play a role in the 2016 presidential election if Hillary were to run. Paul was careful to dodge the question. 'It’s not Hillary’s fault, but it is a factor in judging Bill Clinton in history,' he said, adding that 'sometimes it's hard to separate one from the other. In January of 1998, Bill Clinton infamously told the American public 'I did not have a sexual relationship with that woman - Ms. Lewinsky...' Pop culture: Clinton's affair with Lewinsky has been lampooned in the media and elsewhere more than any other political scandal . Several months later, he was forced to admit that he 'misled' people, and that he had engaged in an 'inappropriate' sexual relationship with the young intern. Following Paul's appearance on the show, Democratic Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin was the guest and he defended both Clintons, saying that Bill Clinton's sexual behaviors 'were litigated in the public square for over a decade.' 'Let’s judge Hillary Clinton based on her talents and her vision of America should she choose to run for president,' Durbin continued.","Rand Paul could potentially face Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election .

Katy Perry's new album Prism has been declared a potential biohazard in Australia over fears seeds contained within the packaging may pose a risk to wildlife. The deluxe version of the album contains a small packet of flower seeds which the US singer has encouraged fans to grow to 'spread the light'. Perry's production company has assured the country's Department of Agriculture (DA) that the Australian release contains only locally sourced seeds - those of the Swan River daisy - which are not a threat to the ecosystem. But biosecurity officials say international versions of the CD bought online still pose a risk because they may not contain seeds native to the country. Danger to wildlife? Katy Perry's new album Prism has been declared a potential biohazard in Australia because international versions may contain seeds that are not native to the country . During her recent live performance on the TV breakfast show Sunrise outdoors at the Sydney Opera House, Perry said she wanted fans to grow the daisies from seeds to give them something beautiful. A spokesman for the DA said officers will now be on high alert for any foreign albums coming through customs. He said: 'Seeds or plant material of international origin may be a weed not present in Australia or the host of a plant pathogen of biosecurity concern.' Popular: Perry, seen here at the launch of Prism in Tokyo, has encouraged fans to grow the daisy seeds that come with the album to 'spread the light' Australia has some of the strictest quarantine measures in the world to protect human health, the environment and agricultural industries, which make up a fifth of the national economy. The introduction of exotic pests and diseases could have disastrous effects for the country.

Other threats include the Khapra beetle, the Giant African snail, the Asian gypsy moth and the fungal disease Karnal bunt which can all ravage wildlife. Inquiries are being made about the origins of seeds in international versions of the CD, which is currently number one in Australia and a worldwide hit. The spokesman added: 'The Australian Government has a strong system in place to detect and respond to material of biosecurity concern. 'This includes inspection of mail, cargo and baggage.'

Bob Costas returned as host for NBC's prime-time Olympic coverage Monday night after he was struck down by a bad case of pink eye. While he still isn't exactly clear-eyed, Costas looked much better and joked at the show's opening that he was 'sitting in' for Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira, who had subbed for him during a six-day absence. He thanked the two, and viewers for expressing concern. 'My apologies to everyone for the unavoidable but uncomfortable circumstance of a broadcaster's ill-timed affliction getting in the way, even for just a moment, from what we all came here for,' Costas said. He's back: NBC's Bob Costas was back anchoring again in Sochi, Russia, on Monday, pictured . Hours before his return, he told The Associated Press that his infection has to run its course of 2-3 weeks, the entire Olympics. 'It's the all-time perfect bad timing, but what can you do? It's a curve ball and you've got to go with it,' Costas chuckled during an interview, 'even though I couldn't spot the rotation on a curve ball right now.' The broadcaster who began his Olympic work as a late-night host at the 1988 Seoul Games looked relaxed at the NBC compound in a navy polo shirt and cardigan sweater. Traces of his bout with viral conjunctivitis were still visible - the infection began in his left eye and spread quickly to the right - and both are still reddened. 'I'm better than I was,' he said, 'but not as good as I'd like to be.' Costas nursed a cup of coffee and propped his feet up on the desk as he discussed his unwanted week off. He rated himself a 2 on a scale of 1-10. At one point, he thought there was about a 10 percent chance he wouldn't make it back for the games. Pink eye: Costas, pictured Sunday, was off the air for a week with an eye infection . Costas interviewed President Obama on February 6, the night before the opening ceremonies. He awakened the next morning 'and my left eye was like a slit, and I'm thinking, ""What the hell?""' Costas recalled. 'But I'm also thinking maybe I put a few eye drops in and it resolves itself. But as soon as the doctor got a look at it, he realized something was wrong.' Costas worked that night trying to cover up the redness by wearing glasses that made him look like a hipster. Drawing barbs from TV critics and snickers on social media, he finally sidelined himself after five nights of Olympic coverage when his blurred vision and sensitivity to light made working impossible. 'When something out of the ordinary happens, like with my eyes, you know (the attention is) coming, but again, the degree of attention to it makes me uncomfortable. Not because I don't understand it,' he said, 'but because that isn't the story that we came here expecting to talk about. 'So what I tried to do the first few nights - when I thought it was only going to be a few nights - is kiss it off with a candid line and move on and not dwell on it. But when it got to the point where I couldn't be on the air,' Costas added, 'you couldn't expect that people would ignore that.' Worst of it: Costas, pictured in the midst of the infection, tried to cover up the redness by wearing glasses but he finally sidelined himself when his blurred vision and sensitivity to light made working impossible . Current Today show host Matt Lauer and former co-anchor Meredith Vieira subbed for Costas. It was the first time anyone except Costas had been the host of an Olympic primetime telecast on any American network since 1998. Costas said he spent three days in a darkened hotel room awake at odd hours. The chance to watch the NBC feed kept him current, but also gave him a different perspective on the coverage. 'When they did the hookup, it really didn't matter when I slept - from noon to 8, or midnight to 8 in the morning. Generally, I was awake at 5 (a.m., Sochi time) so I watched a good portion of prime-time every night. ... I experienced it something closer to the way someone in the States would, except it was dawn when I was doing it,' he added, 'and it was a little blurry.' Costas also said he the chance to watch some of the network's cable coverage of events in real time, and thought about whether that would influence his own presentation. 'My Olympic road is closer to its end than its beginning,' he said. 'By the time I can foresee prime-time changing radically, somebody else will be doing it.'","While he still isn't exactly clear-eyed, NBC's prime-time Olympics host looked much better as he returned to the network's coverage Monday night .

Brown, 19, finished ninth and 28-year-old Abbott 12th, although both got bronze with the USA in the new team event.

Some of the Navy's . futuristic weapons sound like something out of 'Star Wars,' with lasers . designed to shoot down aerial drones and electric guns that fire . projectiles at hypersonic speeds. That future is now. The . Navy plans to deploy its first laser on a ship later this year, and it . intends to test an electromagnetic rail gun prototype aboard a vessel . within two years. For the Navy, it's not so . much about the whiz-bang technology as it is about the economics of such . armaments. Both costs pennies on the dollar compared with missiles and . smart bombs, and the weapons can be fired continuously, unlike missiles . and bombs, which eventually run out. Star Wars: The Navy now has lasers that can be used on guided-missile destroyers and plans to test a rail gun within two years . 'It . fundamentally changes the way we fight,' said Capt. Mike Ziv, program . manager for directed energy and electric weapon systems for the Naval . Sea Systems Command. The Navy's laser . technology has evolved to the point that a prototype to be deployed . aboard the USS Ponce this summer can be operated by a single sailor, he . said. The solid-state Laser Weapon System is . designed to target what the Navy describes as 'asymmetrical threats.' Those include aerial drones, speed boats and swarm boats, all potential . threats to warships in the Persian Gulf, where the Ponce, a floating . staging base, is set to be deployed. Rail . guns, which have been tested on land in Virginia, fire a projectile at . six or seven times the speed of sound - enough velocity to cause severe . damage. The Navy sees them as replacing or supplementing old-school . guns, firing lethal projectiles from long distances. But both systems have shortcomings. Lasers . tend to loser their effectiveness if it's raining, if it's dusty, or if . there's turbulence in the atmosphere, and the rail gun requires vast . amount of electricity to launch the projectile, said Loren Thompson, . defense analyst at the Lexington Institute. The future: The Navy plans to test a high-tech rail gun like the one pictured by 2016 . 'The . Navy says it's found ways to deal with use of lasers in bad weather, . but there's little doubt that the range of the weapon would be reduced . by clouds, dust or precipitation,' he said. Producing enough energy for a rail gun is another problem. The . Navy's new destroyer, the Zumwalt, under construction at Bath Iron . Works in Maine, is the only ship with enough electric power to run a . rail gun. The stealthy ship's gas turbine-powered generators can produce . up to 78 megawatts of power. That's enough electricity for a . medium-size city - and more than enough for a rail gun. Technology . from the three ships in that DDG-1000 series will likely trickle down . into future warships, said Capt. James Downey, the program manager. Engineers . are also working on a battery system to store enough energy to allow a . rail gun to be operated on warships currently in the fleet. Both weapon systems are prized because they serve to 'get ahead of the cost curve,' Ziv said. In other words, they're cheap. Each . interceptor missile aboard a U.S. Navy warship costs at least $1 . million apiece, making it cost-prohibitive to defend a ship in some . hostile environments in which an enemy is using aircraft, drones, . artillery, cruise missiles and artillery, Thompson said. Test: This photo shows the first full-energy shot from an electromagnetic launcher at a testing facility . With . a laser operating on about 30 kilowatts of electricity - and possibly . three times that in the future - the cost amounts to a few dollars per . shot, Thompson said. The 'Star Wars' analogy isn't a bad one. Just . like in the movies, the Navy's laser directs a beam of energy that can . burn through a target or fry sensitive electronics. Unlike the movie, . the laser beam is invisible to the human eye. The . targeting system locks onto the target, sending a beam of searing heat. 'You see the effect on what you are targeting but you don't see the . actual beam,' Ziv said. Other nations are developing their own lasers, but the Navy is more advanced at this point. Most folks are stunned to learn the technology is ready for deployment, Ziv said. 'It's . fair to say that there are other countries working on this technology. That's safe to say. But I would also say that a lot of what makes this . successful came from the way in which we consolidated all of the . complexity into something that can be operated by (a single sailor),' he . said.","The first laser to be installed on a Navy vessel is scheduled for later this year .
The lasers could be capable of shooting down aerial drones and other aircraft .
Rail guns firing projectiles at six times the speed of sound could be tested within two years ."

Jake LaMotta has never been shy of stepping into the ring - or placing one on the finger of the woman he loves. The 90-year-old boxing hero is to marry for the seventh time to long-term  fiancée Denise Baker, 30 years his junior. LaMotta, the New York boxer who inspired Oscar-winning movie Raging Bull, is set to tie the knot at a justice of the peace in Bisbee, Arizona on January 4. Hitched: Jake LaMotta, 90, married long-term fiancee Denise Baker after being engaged for 12 years . Ms Baker, 62, told the New York Post that they would probably 'take a nap' following the ceremony. The couple planned to have a big party two days later where a preview of a new film about LaMotta will be shown. The Bronx Bull was originally billed as a follow-up to Raging Bull before a legal dispute with the film studio forced creators to publicly say it had no affiliation with Scorsese's masterpiece. The couple also recently performed in a stage show in New York written by Ms Baker. The boxer was born Giacobbe . LaMotta on the lower east side of Manhattan in 1922. His father put him . on the street to fight other neighborhood children for entertainment in order to make money to help pay the rent. LaMotta went pro at the age of 19 and became known as the 'Bronx Bull' for his aggressive style of fighting where he stalked opponents around the ring, often taking heavy blows himself into order to land devastating punches. He won 83 fights in his career including 30 knockouts. Champion: Jake LaMotta holds up the middleweight championship belt in 1949 . Defiant: LaMotta (right) was known for his aggressive boxing style where he stalked opponents closely around the ring, taking many blows on the chin himself . Following his retirement from boxing, LaMotta owned bars and had a successful career in the film industry appearing in 15 films including  The Hustler with Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason. His memoir Raging Bull: My Story became the basis for the 1980 film starring Robert De Niro and directed by Martin Scorsese. DeNiro trained with LaMotta until he had the look and moves of a professional boxer. Later the actor famously gained 60 pounds to play the older LaMotta by gorging himself in Paris restaurants for three months. DeNiro won the Academy Award for best actor for Raging Bull. LaMotta has been married six times before. His second wife Vickie, whom he married when she was 16, is portrayed in Raging Bull by actress Cathy Moriarty. The sporting legend has six children, four daughters and two sons. Winners: Robert De Niro (left) won an Oscar for his portrayal of LaMotta's boxing career (right) in the 1980 movie Raging Bull .

An avalanche in central Idaho buried four people, killing an Idaho man whose wife survived being buried under the snow for about 90 minutes, officials in Blaine County said. The sheriff's office said the avalanche occurred shortly after 2 p.m. on Sunday in the Smiley Creek area about 36 miles north of Ketchum. Robert Swanton, 65, and Susan Swanton, 56, of Sutherlin, Ore., were able to extricate themselves and began looking for George Martin Jr., 64, of Bellevue, and his wife, Lesley Martin, 70. An avalanche in Idaho (not pictured here) killed four people on Sunday . The Swantons found Martin after about an hour, but they were unable to revive him. They couldn't find an avalanche-beacon signal for Lesley Martin, so they rode a snowmobile to the highway to flag down help. Lesley Martin, who was buried for an estimated 90 minutes, was taken to the hospital for treatment of hypothermia, the sheriff's office said. An investigation found the slide was triggered when one of the four stepped through the new snow slab and penetrated the old, faceted layer. The collapse traveled uphill and released the avalanche, which ran 1,400 vertical feet and was 300 to 400 feet wide. The debris was approximately 4 to 8 feet deep. Meanwhile, a friend of the two Wisconsin skiers killed in a Colorado avalanche said on Monday that the two were close buddies who loved to spend time on the slopes and mountain-biking trails. Joey Kindred of Tomah said he used to go skiing with 32-year-old Justin Lentz and 34-year-old Jarrard Law. The two Portage, Wis., men were killed Saturday afternoon. The avalanche occurred in the Smiley Creek area of idaho . Lentz and Law were kindhearted and smart, and both knew how to light up a room, Kindred said. Five people were caught in avalanches over the weekend in Montana. A 35-year-old woman suffered a broken leg on Sunday after she was caught in a snow slide while back-country skiing near Big Sky in southwestern Montana. Gallatin County officials said she ended up partially buried and pinned against a tree. On Saturday, a snowmobiler triggered an avalanche near Whitefish Mountain Resort that partially buried four people. The Flathead Avalanche Center said all four made it out of the area safely. On Feb. 11, an avalanche in the Wallowa Mountains of eastern Oregon killed two backcountry skiers and seriously injured two others, officials said.","The sheriff's office said the avalanche occurred shortly after 2 p.m. on Sunday .

Residents of Oklahoma were left feeling rattled over the weekend after a strong of some 20 earthquakes as powerful as 3.5 magnitude rocked the central part of the state on Saturday alone. Areas north of Oklahoma City felt the brunt of the temblors, which some say were accompanied by startling booms like the sound of an explosion. The mystery earthquake wave now has residents fearing for their personal safety and the security of their property. Meanwhile, scientists have been left scratching their heads over the quakes, which are becoming more frequent each day. Quake cluster: A map created by earthquaketrack.com shows the massive cluster of 20-plus quakes that have shaken central Oklahoma in recent days . 'Felt like bombs going off. It's just a huge loud noise and then it's like a reverb from that boom that just shakes the entire house,' Logan County resident Nancy York told KOCO. York was one of countless Oklahomans startled by the quakes, which included a 3.5 magnitude shakeup in the Edmon area. 'If I'm experiencing eight of these in one day,' York wondered, 'then when does it erupt and become absolutely horrible that takes my house down?' Unfortunately, scientists don't yet have an answer. One possibility is geological. 'We have a lot of pre-existing faults in Oklahoma,' seismologist Austin Holland told KOCO. However, with little history of seismic activity in the area, it's unclear why the quakes would become so frequent now. Another . potential cause is the change in water levels at nearby LIberty Lake, . where a swarm of the earthquakes were centered Saturday. The . controversial hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking' method pumping . millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into fractures in the . Earth. Why now? A chart compiled by the Associated Press from USGS data shows the huge spike in Oklahoma earthquakes after 2009. Scientists point to many possible explanations, including controversial 'fracking' BOOM! The largest of the earthquakes was a 3.5 magnitude temblor near the town of Edmond. Most people can feel a quake above a magnitude of 3 and many residents said Saturday's quakes were accompanied by massive, explosion-like booms . 'We've looked at hydraulic fracturing,' said Austin, but scientists have yet to blame it--or anything--for the quake swarm. What is sure is that the quakes are growing in frequency. From . 1975 to 2008, only a handful of magnitude-3.0 earthquakes or greater . occurred yearly in Oklahoma. But the average grew to around 40 annual . earthquakes from 2009 to 2013, seismologists said in an October  study . by the U.S. Geological Survey on the uptick of quake activity. Since . 2009, more than 200 magnitude-3.0 or greater earthquakes have hit the . state's midsection, according to the Geological Survey. Many have been . centered near Oklahoma City, the most populous part of the state. Some researchers and environmental groups have long suspected fracking can have seismic repercussions because it forces millions of gallons of water, sand and other materials deep underground to free pockets of fossil fuels. The energy industry has repeatedly insisted that the practice is safe. Scientists researching the theory say it's not clear yet whether fracking can trigger significant quakes. Oklahoma's strongest recorded earthquake was a 5.6-magnitude surprise that struck in November 2011 near the town of Prague. It damaged 200 buildings, shook a football stadium and rattled parts of seven states. No one has been killed or seriously . injured in the recent quakes, and property damage has been minimal. But . the frequent tremors have been enough to weaken the constitution of even . the most weather-hardened Oklahomans. The . earthquakes rumbled Logan County near Oklahoma City late Sunday, about a . week after a 4.1 magnitude temblor caused minor damage at the county . jail in Guthrie. The U.S. Geological Survey says a 3.8-magnitude earthquake struck shortly before . 11 p.m. Sunday. The USGS initially estimated the earthquake as a 4.2 . magnitude, but it was later downgraded to a 3.8 magnitude. The earthquake was centered about 7 miles south-southwest of Guthrie. Guthrie is about 30 miles north of Oklahoma City. Another . earthquake with a 2.9 magnitude was recorded about 30 minutes later . followed shortly by a third earthquake with a 3.0 magnitude. No damage . has been reported. Damages: Logan County resident Nancy York pointed out the cracks that appeared in her newly built Oklahoma home following the quake swarm . Scary experience: York also described the huge boom sounds that came with the quakes and the cracks in her new home's walls .","An area of Logan County around Oklahoma City felt the brunt of the quakes, which were as large as magnitude 3.5 .
