A woman fugitive arrested 37 years after escaping a women's prison in Michigan, was finally caught thanks to a combination of bad weather and her memorable eyes. Judy Lynn Hayman was arrested on Monday, after San Diego police received a mug shot from a Michigan officer who was going through old fingerprint cards of escapees while weathering a winter storm. Authorities had been searching for Hayman since she escaped from Ypsilanti prison in 1977, where she was serving an 18 month to two year sentence for attempting to steal clothes from a store near Detroit. Memorable: Judy Lynn Hayman was arrested by police who recognized her eyes from this 1976 mug shot . San Diego police say Hayman identified herself as Jamie Lewis and produced government documents bearing that name. Officers, however, remained suspicious because of inconsistencies in her story and her resemblance to an old Michigan mug shot, taken in 1976, that they were holding. 'Her eyes gave her away,' San Diego police lieutenant Kevin Mayer said. 'The eyes in the picture matched the eyes of this woman.' On the trail: A Michigan officer sent this mug shot and fingerprint cards to San Diego police . She acknowledged being Hayman after police took her in for further questioning, Lieutenant Mayer said. It wasn't immediately clear how long Hayman had been in San Diego. But neighbors at her well-kept, nondescript apartment complex blocks from Balboa Park said she lived in the building for almost seven years. Her 32-year-old son was visiting when police arrived, and officers said he appeared stunned by their questions. 'This seemed very much a surprise to him,' Lieutenant Mayer said. Her son, named only as Aaron, said he was worried for his mother but didn't tell NBC7 if Hayman's children knew about her double life. Aaron said his mother had ties to the San Diego community, where she attended church and PTA meetings. Neighbors had said the woman they knew as Jamie Lewis kept to herself, not speaking of her past. Hayman is being held in a San Diego County jail awaiting extradition to Michigan and is scheduled to appear in court Thursday. Michigan authorities want her returned to the state to complete her sentence for attempted larceny. She also could face a separate criminal charge for the escape. Lieutenant Charles Levens, of the Michigan Corrections Department, helped catch Hayman after sending fingerprint cards to the FBI. He explained that many police agencies had fingerprints that matched Hayman's but under different names. He gave the information to an investigator, Tim Hardville, who tracked her down in San Diego. 'I said, ""Tim, you're going to get your girl here"",' Lieutenant Levens said. 'There are two ways to get off our list: a death certificate or a [live] body. It's what the state pays us to do. ... If you're a fugitive, you have an obligation to pay your debt to society.' Hide out: Hayman, 60, was arrested at this gated community in San Diego . Hayman, using aliases, apparently had . been arrested and fingerprinted in the past and the San Diego police . 'were familiar with her,' Michigan Corrections Department spokesman Russ . Marlan said. Lieutenant . Mayer declined to give further details about the case, including whether . Hayman had prior arrests or contact with police in California. Theresa . Padilla said she lived next to Hayman for more than six years and . described her as a 'quiet loner, but basically a nice person'. Ms Padilla said Hayman spent most of her time indoors, except when she walked her chihuahua, Monty, who was old and had to be put down less than a year ago. Hayman had photos of three sons on her wall, and at least one of them visited often, taking out her trash and doing other chores, Ms Padilla said, adding: 'Her three boys seemed like they were raised well.' Ms Padilla said Hayman didn't appear to be married or have a job. She said she and Hayman spoke infrequently but did share their experiences in battling cancer. Hayman also mentioned living in Detroit and being a fan of Michigan basketball teams. Ms Padilla was shocked to learn of her neighbor's past on Monday. 'It don't make sense, going after this lady for a petty little thing,' she said. 'They need to go after the molesters, the killers, those who hurt little babies, not someone who stole something when she was 23.' Escape: Hayman was serving a sentence for larceny when she ran away from this Huron Valley prison in 1977 . Corrections spokesman Mr Marlan said all fugitives must be pursued. 'We can't just write it off,' he said. 'We don't have the ability to say, ""It's been a long time. You're free to go"".' San Diego district attorney's office spokesman Steve Walker said Hayman is scheduled for her first hearing Thursday morning. If she doesn't fight her extradition, she will be sent immediately to Michigan. If she does contest it, another hearing will be held the following day. It will be up to the state parole board to determine how long Hayman will be imprisoned.","Judy Lynn Hayman has used several aliases since escaping prison in 1977 .

His beloved X Factor format has suffered a ratings slide, despite bringing in new judges and tweaking the format. But things are looking up for Simon Cowell as finalists from the show are dominating the iTunes chart for the first time ever. Being the first year tracks from the talent show have been legible to chart, finalists Alex & Sierra have stormed to the top of the charts - alongside fellow finalist Jeff Gutt. Scroll down for video . Making Simon happy! X Factor contestants Alex & Sierra have reached number one on iTunes . The couple and singing duo have already seen their track Say Something beat Christina Aguilera. Now, their cover of Sara Bareilles' hit Gravity has reached number one on the pop charts.

'Alex and Sierra are number 1 again on iTunes! Thanks to everyone who has bought it.' he tweeted. The . real-life couple, who brought judges Demi Lovato and Kelly Rowland to . tears with their performance, currently have FIVE tracks in the Top 50 . on iTunes and eight tracks in the Top 125. Last . week, their rendition of ""Say Something"" surpassed Christina Aguilera . and A Great Big World's current radio hit by creeping up to No. 1 - and . is now at No 2. Good news: Simon took to Twitter on Thursday to spread the word about Alex & Sierra . Something to smile about: Simon Cowell will be pleased that his acts can now chart in the US for the first time whilst still performing on The X Factor . Also popular: Country crossover Restless Road reached number 65 in the charts this week . While other acts from the doing well are Jeff Gutt with Hallelujah reaching number four on the charts - hot on the heels of Alex and Sierra - and his other track Demons reaching 45. Whilst Restless Road saw their track Wanted reach number 65. Making mention of the chart success on last night's Fox show, Cowell said afterwards: 'It's incredible. 'I've . always said this about these shows - it's not about winning a silly . trophy, it's about launching an artist. It's about a career outside of . it and that's what I'm most proud of.

And while you may be hard pressed to remember the winners' names from the last two seasons, the talent show has provided a launch board for acts including season 2's Emblem 3 and Fifth Harmony, with the latter set to open for judge Demi on her next tour.

While Leona Lewis has sold 30 million records to date since winning the X Factor UK in 2006 and other acts including Little Mix and Cher Lloyd have been hits worldwide. With the future of the X Factor as yet unclear, Entertainment Weekly recently mused it may not be out of the realms of possibility for Fox to order a fourth season for 2014 - revealing the series would come back for a reduced number of episodes. The magazine said: 'We’re hearing Factor‘s fate is not yet sealed. In fact, sources say Fox and Factor producers have started renewal discussions on a potential fourth season,' adding:  'To network executives and advertisers, new shows are scary mystery boxes, while Factor is, for better or worse, a known quantity. Canceling X Factor means filling three additional hours next fall with scary mystery boxes.' Local versions of The X Factor are produced in more than 45 territories and the US version of The X Factor USA airs in over 205 countries. While artists discovered by The X Factor format have sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including 130 No 1’s, and 350 Top 10 records.

Congressional Democrats continued to insist on Wednesday that Obamacare-related job losses would be 'a good thing' in the long run, as Congressional Budget Office chief Douglas Elmendorf testified in a House Budget Committee hearing that the Affordable Care Act 'creates a disincentive [for people] to work.' House Budget Committee ranking Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland continued the White House's line from Tuesday, saying that the job losses indicate that consumers will have more choices after the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented. 'That is not a bad thing. Itâ€™s a good thing,' he said, suggesting that most of the eliminated employment would consist of older workers who would be able to retire early without losing their health benefits. New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell said that the nonpartisan CBO report didn't indicate that Obamacare would cause employers to cut jobs, but only that many Americans would chose not to work. 'This isn't employers cutting jobs,' he said. 'This is workers being empowered.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told a congressional panel that Obamacare will remove the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time employees from the U.S. workforce in the next ten years . Improbable: House Budget Committee ranking Democrat Chris Van Hollen (R) insisted that Obamacare-related job losses are a case of 'workers being empowered' to have health insurance without jobs . But Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, the committee's chairman, slammed the Obamacare law as a 'poverty trap,' calling it disastrous that so many Americans would become accustomed to receiving health insurance coverage without the need to provide for their families. 'Washington is making the poverty trap that much worse,' he said. And the effect on the U.S. economy, Ryan claimed, 'will be severe, as if 2.5 million people had stopped working full-time by 2024.' That finding is in line with the report the CBO issued on Tuesday just hours before White House officials began spinning the dour news as a positive development during a hastily assembled conference call for reporters. 'Over the longer run,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters later in the day,, the CBO 'finds that because of this law, individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods, like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families.' Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (C) exclaimed that Obamacare's job losses were pushing low-income Americans further into a 'poverty trap' Hubris: Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furman (R) and White House press secretary Jay Carney spun the CBO's news on Tuesday, saying that many Americans would simply be choosing to 'spend more time with their families' instead of working . One Democratic lawmaker, Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan, claimed during Wednesday hearing that being jobless would be a net positive for many people in his state. 'What that means is instead they might be able to tuck their child in bed at night and read a bedtime story, or go to an activity, which means theyâ€™re better off.' The CBO report doesn't specify that the projected job losses stemming from the Obamacare law would be confined to elderly Americans who remain in the workforce because they need to keep their health insurance. Most retirees rely in part on Medicare, an existing government benefit that is available to all retirees. It does, however, suggest that more and more lower-income Americans will no longer see the need to remain employed if they can get low-cost or free health coverage without working. The report also found that the result of a mass flight from gainful employment will lower U.S. economic growth, shrink the tax base and raise America's budget deficits. It estimated that the Affordable Care Act will cost taxpayers approximately $2 trillion over the course of the coming decade.","Democrats continue to insist that it's a net positive for millions of Americans to be jobless after the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented .

Scotland Yard is investigating a far-right group after members launched 'Christian patrols' to 'draw out' and confront Muslims by drinking and smoking outside one of Britain's biggest mosques. Vigilantes from Britain First, a group led by a former BNP linchpin, filmed themselves on Brick Lane in east London and told Asian men: 'This is our country. You want to live here, you adhere by our laws'. The group says it is a response to 'Muslim patrols' that walked the area and warned couples holding hands, uncovered women or those drinking . it was a 'Muslim area' and they faced 'hell fire'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Message: Former BNP councillor Paul Golding, now chairman of Britain First, has led 'Christian Patrols' in east London used to 'draw out' Muslims in the area and hand out warning leaflets . 'Bait': members stood outside the East London Mosque swigging beer and smoking cigarettes as they hoped to confront Muslims during Friday prayers . Inflammatory: Members then unfurled this banner outside the mosque on film, which contained no confrontations with worshippers . Three members were jailed at the Old Bailey last month for repeatedly trying to enforce Sharia law. Britain First chairman Paul Golding, a former BNP councillor, said they were using members with cans of lager as 'bait' for Muslims outside the East London Mosque in Whitechapel. 'This is going to be a regular thing. We’re going to be out there every weekend to draw out these ""Muslim Patrols"",' he said after the footage emerged. Golding is currently on bail for alleged harassment of hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who has been a vocal backer of 'Muslim Patrols'. The video also shows him and his 15 supporters entering the East End in Gulf War vehicles and then later unfurling a banner outside the mosque that said 'resistance'. It ends without any confrontation but uses an image of murdered soldier Lee Rigby, along with the message: 'The day Lee Rigby was murdered, thousands of patriots were born. The fightback has begun'. Response: A member smokes and drinks outside the mosque, and his group claims this is a direct reaction to previous 'Muslim Patrols' 'Resistance': Britain First members walked Brick Lane and Whitechapel in east London, and told this group of men: 'This is our country.

'Police at Tower Hamlets are aware of an internet video showing recent activity on the Borough,' a spokesman said. 'The Metropolitan Police Service takes these . incidents very seriously and any activities that may raise community . tension will be monitored'. The video has led to an outpouring of anger from east London community leaders. The Bishop of Stepney, Rt Rev Adrian Newman, said: 'East London is . proud of its generous attitude to diversity, based on tolerance and . respect. 'There is no place for vigilante patrols, Christian, Muslim or any other faith, on the streets of Tower Hamlets.' A . spokesman for the East London Mosque called Britain First 'neo-Nazis'. 'Britain First’s patrol does . not represent Christians, just as al-Muhajiroun’s patrols did not . represent Muslims. Both are tiny, extreme groups, unwelcome in our . community,' he said. 'We will not let those who espouse hatred damage our wonderful community relations.' Jordan Horner, 19, Ricardo MacFarlane, 36, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively for their Muslim Patrols.

Two weeks later, Horner and MacFarlane attacked men drinking in Shoreditch, shouting: 'Kill the non-believers.'

Australia and Israel are the latest countries to legislate against so-called 'revenge porn'. Both nations have passed laws that specifically make the sharing of intimate imagery, texts or videos of an ex-partner with the intent to cause harm or distress illegal. They are the latest governments to address the worryingly common phenomenon, which sees previous partners or lovers maliciously post private intimate content online to shame or embarrass their ex. Revenge porn: Some may live to regret posing for pictures with their partner as they could be posted on the internet if the relationship turns sour (posed by models) In Israel the law was introduced to the Knesset by member Yifat Kariv who said: 'We are witnessing more and more cases of sexual assaults that were filmed and distributed in public without restraint and without limits; this legislative intervention is necessary and will help fight the shocking phenomenon of 'virtual rape,' Time.com reports. Meanwhile the Australian state of Victoria has made it an offence to distribute, or even threaten to distribute such images. Revenge porn often sees the victim named, with personal information such as place of work, parents phone number or boss's email, being shared alongside the photo and vile hateful messages from their ex. Victims are often horrified to learn that, as well as the humiliation of highly personal information, meant for their partner's eyes only, being splashed online, that they will likely struggle to bring the perpetrator to justice, or even to get the images taken down. Violation: Revenge porn often sees the victim named, with personal information such as place of work, parents phone number or boss's email, being shared alongside the photo and vile hateful messages from their ex . There are also reports of a victim's . photo being obtained through their own, or their ex's computer being . hacked rather than being submitted, or even of a victim's face being . Photoshopped onto pornographic images, when they have never been . photographed nude. England . currently has no law to explicitly make posting revenge porn illegal, . though a charge may still be brought under existing harassment laws or . other communications laws. In part, the worldwide lack of proper guidelines and laws is due to the difficultly faced in drawing legal boundaries. If the partner took the footage or image then the copyright is theirs, and a website is not responsible for content given by others unless it is child pornography. Many revenge porn sites appallingly cash in on the lack of policing and will charge victims to take their photos down. Difficulty drawing legal boundaries: Whoever takes the picture owns the copyright (posed by models) In California, where some anti-revenge porn legislation has been passed (the law does not cover any material taken by the subject themselves such as 'selfies') a website owner has just been arrested after extorting his victims out of thousands of dollars. Kevin Bollaert has been charged with 31 offences pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in to a revenge porn website he ran. And while it may be easy to dismiss revenge porn as a side-line issue, research from the University of Indiana recently showed that more than half (52.3 per cent) of young adults have engaged in 'unwanted but consensual sexting with a committed partner.' Arrested: Kevin Bollaert, seen here with an unidentified woman, faces 31 charges relating to his operation of a revenge porn site and sister extortion campaign . By this they mean that while the person was not forced to send the text or image, they felt pressurised into it, perhaps by peer pressure or anxieties over the relationship, with women being more susceptible than men. A few victims have raised the profile of the issue such as Dr. Holly Jacobs whose ex's campaign resulted in her having to change her name before becoming an activist against revenge porn. Revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them. Law enforcement officials have been stumped on how to respond to revenge porn. Website operators aren't liable for content provided by others, unless the images are child pornography. Anti-harassment and cyberstalking laws don't apply unless the ex-partner threatens the victim or attempts repeated contact. Copyright protections wouldn't help because often the victim wasn't the one who took the photos. Suing for civil damages is another option, but that, means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner. California and New Jersey passed specific laws criminalizing revenge porn - while others including Maryland are considering a change in legislation. In California spurned lovers who post graphic images of ex face prison sentence while those convicted of malicious intent could also be fined $1,000. Australia and Israel are the latest countries to pass laws.","Victoria and Israel first to legislate against 'revenge porn'

Two conservative American bloggers who were planning on speaking at a right-wing rally in the UK this weekend, will not be allowed to enter the country. Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer are the founders of the anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America and they run the website Jihad Watch. Both were planning on speaking at an English Defence League march Saturday in Woolwich, but the Home Office has barred them from traveling to the UK. Access denied: Conservative American bloggers Pamela Geller, left, and Robert Spencer, right, have been banned from entering the UK to attend an upcoming anti-Islamic rally . The two have been banned on the basis that their presence would bot be 'conductive to the public good.' In letters sent to Geller and Spencer, the Home Department explains that it can expel, deport, or deny entry to any non-UK national who violates the British government's 'Unacceptable Behavior' policy. The Home Office explained their decision to The Guardian: 'We can confirm that Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer are subject to an exclusion decision...We condemn all those whose behaviors and views run counter to our shared values and will not stand for extremism in any form.' Matthew Collins of the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate was 'absolutely delighted' by the decision to ban the bloggers. 'These two are among some of the most extreme anti-Muslim activists in the world. They've nothing to contribute to life in this country...They only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble. Britain doesn't need more hate even just for a few days.' Both Geller and Spencer took to their blogs to voice their outrage over the decision. Spencer explained that he and Geller planned to lay a wreath at the memorial to British solider Lee Rigby, who was recently  beheaded by jihadists in Woolwich. Murder: Soldier Lee Rigby was beheaded in Woolwich on May 22 by two men who said they killed Rigby in order to avenge the killing of Muslims by the British military . Target: The rally planned for Saturday is in response to the killing of Lee Rigby, a drummer in the British military who was off-duty when he was attacked and beheaded . 'But it is not conducive to the public good in Britain to oppose Jihad violence and Islamic supremacism,' Spencer wrote. 'In not allowing us into the country solely because of our true and accurate statements about Islam, the British government is behaving like a de facto Islamic state. The nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead,' Geller wrote. Geller pointed out on The Blaze that she hadn't been charged or convicted of any crime. 'I became a writer and activist in the wake of 911. For this I am banned. I shed no tears. I am banned from Mecca, too,' Geller said. Tommy Robinson, the EDL leader, was also . outraged, saying the decision was 'embarrassing for this so-called land . of democracy and freedom of speech.' Not free to speak: Geller expressed her outrage at being banned from the UK on her blog saying, 'The nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead' Against the ban: English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson described the banning as 'embarrassing for this so-called land of democracy and freedom of speech' The EDL rally Geller and Spencer planned to attend was in response to the beheading of British soldier Lee Rigby last month by two Islamic extremists.

India looks set to trigger demands for an instant end to British aid handouts after it revealed plans for a £50million mission to Mars. Prime minister Manmohan Singh made the space journey announcement in  a speech marking the 65th anniversary  of his country’s independence from British rule. British taxpayers are committed to an eight-year, £1.6billion package of aid to India which is due to run until 2015. Giant leap: India's maiden lunar mission Chandrayaan-1, or Moon Craft in ancient Sanskrit, is seen successfully took off at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, about 63 miles north of Chennai, in 2008 . However, there is growing pressure to . end it earlier because of austerity measures in place here. Mr Singh’s . announcement will only fuel the calls. He said the unmanned spacecraft would enter orbit around the planet and collect scientific information. It is likely to be launched in November 2013 with a rocket developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation. ‘This spaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology,’ Mr Singh said. Scientists say the spacecraft is expected to take nearly 11 months to get close  to Mars. Last week, Nasa’s new robot rover . named Curiosity landed in a huge crater on Mars and has begun a host of . scientific studies of the planet. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh heralded the plan as 'a huge step for us in the area of science and technology' India is ramping up its ambitious space programme with confirmation of plans to send a probe to Mars . The Coalition earlier this year said . it would finally end aid payments to India, but not until the end of the . current programme in three years. The average annual spend on India is . about £280million a year, even though the now-booming Asian giant has . had its own space programme for years. Despite the British cash, India . rejected a British-built Typhoon fighter jet as preferred candidate for a . £13billion defence deal and chose a French option instead. India’s former finance minister, . Pranab Mukherjee, has said he did not even want Britain’s aid and that . it was just ‘peanuts’ in the booming country’s development expenditure. Unlike other Whitehall departments, . the Department for International Development’s budget is rising by 35 . per cent in real terms by 2015. And a Bill is to be introduced in this . Parliament to enshrine in law the commitment that 0.7 per cent of . Britain’s national income will be spent on aid. However, polls have shown that 71 per . cent of Britons disagree with the plan, and that two-thirds of the . country believe Britain spends too much on international development. International Development Secretary . Andrew Mitchell, accepting earlier this year that the aid to India . should end, said the Indian economy was booming and its own efforts to . end poverty were proving more effective. ‘I completely understand why people question the aid programme to India and we questioned it ourselves,’ he said. India has had an active space programme since the 1960s. Since the mid-1970s, it has launched . scores of satellites for itself and for  nearly two dozen other . countries. India sent a spacecraft into orbit around the moon in 2008. In all, there have been about 40 . missions to Mars with just about half of them being successful – with . attempts made by the USA, Russia, France, Europe and China. Critics of Singh’s Congress party say . instead of the Mars mission, the government should concentrate on . providing the basic needs of people such as electricity and safe . drinking water. Two weeks ago, the electricity grids . that serve more than 600million Indians collapsed for hours in the . world’s  largest blackout.","The cost of the mission has been estimated at $70-90million .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Sue Reid . UPDATED: . 21:36 EST, 4 February 2012 . India has snubbed British industry and awarded a £13billion deal to supply fighter jets to France. The contract was lost despite Government claims that the UK’s £1billion aid package to India would help secure the order. Yesterday’s decision also handed a propaganda coup to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who sneeringly claimed on Monday that Britain ‘has no industry’. Scroll down for video . Vive la France: The Rafale jets will replace India's ageing fleet of Russian MiGs, with the French company entering exclusive talks with the Indians to finalise the deal by March . Rejected: RAF Typhoons fell to second place, despite the belief that controversial aid packages would secure the India contract for Britain . French firm Dassault Rafale was selected as the preferred bidder to supply 126 military jets to the Indian air force. BAE Systems, which builds the Eurofighter Typhoon jet, was consigned to second place. International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said in December that Britain’s controversial foreign aid programme was partly designed to win the bid. Britain is sending £280million to India for each of the next four years, even though the country has more billionaires than Britain and has its own space programme. The aid package is 15 times larger than the £18million France sent to India in 2009. Vive la France: The decision is a propaganda coup for French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who sneeringly claimed on Monday that Britain 'has no industry' Asked to justify Indian aid last year, Mr Mitchell said: ‘It’s a very important relationship. The focus is also about seeking to sell Typhoon.’ The decision is also a setback for David Cameron, who visited India in 2010 with six Cabinet ministers and around 60 businessmen to try to establish Britain as the ‘partner of choice’ for India. Today during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, Mr Cameron said he was 'disappointed' by the decision. He said: 'We don't expect any job losses stemming from this decision and it does not rule out the Typhoon for India.' He insisted BAE Systems was still in the hunt for the contract, despite losing the first round of bidding. Yesterday, Indian officials said Dassault emerged in front because the Rafale jet was ‘much cheaper unit-wise’ than the Eurofighter. It was reported today that Dassault slashed its price demands to ensure the deal was done. One Indian defence ministry source said: ‘The Indian air force, which is well-equipped with French fighters, is favouring the French.’ The Rafale jets will replace India’s ageing fleet of Russian MiGs. The French company will now enter exclusive talks with the Indians to finalise the deal, which is expected to be signed in March. The Typhoon is built by BAE Systems and a consortium of German and Spanish branches of European aerospace giant EADS and Italy’s Finmeccanica. Last night Tory MP Peter Bone . questioned the purpose of sending British aid to India at a time when . cuts are being made at home. ‘It just goes to show that it’s a myth that . by Britain becoming an aid superpower and doling billions of pounds out . to countries like this exerts any influence whatsoever on the decisions . made by those governments when purchasing equipment. ‘We need to slash the international development money and invest the billions saved to help hard-pressed British families.’ The . Unite union last night expressed fears that the loss of the deal could . threaten 4,500 jobs at BAE Systems’ Samlesbury base in Lancashire, where . key components of the Typhoon are made, and Warton Aerodrome near . Preston, where the aircraft is assembled. Government . officials and BAE Systems insisted that they were not completely . eliminated from the process and could still land the deal if India’s . talks with Dassault collapse. A . spokesman for UK Trade and Investments, the branch of the Government . that promotes trade deals overseas, said: ‘This does not rule out . Typhoon for India. ‘Today’s . decision is about who the Indians have assessed as making the lowest . bid and therefore asked to enter into further negotiations. ‘But . the Indians have not yet awarded the contract. We continue to believe . Eurofighter Typhoon provides the best capability today and into the . future.’ A spokesman . for BAE Systems added: ‘We believe Eurofighter Typhoon offers the best . military, industrial and economic solution for India.’ Unite warned that the selection of a French fighter aircraft for the multibillion-pound contract could have serious implications for BAE Systems and the UK aerospace industry. National officer Ian Waddell said: 'We are seeking confirmation from BAE Systems that Rafale has been selected as their preferred fighter by India. 'The Typhoon is a superb aircraft which supports thousands of highly skilled jobs in the UK, both at BAE Systems and in the supply chain. 'We are concerned about the serious implications this decision may have and want urgent talks with the company about future plans for the workforce. 'There are other export orders to be won and it is critical that the company maintains its commitment to Typhoon despite this setback.' The CSEU, an umbrella body for manufacturing unions, is meeting the MoD's Procurement Minister, Peter Luff, next week and the unions will raise this issue as a priority. Unite said it will continue to concentrate its efforts to deal with the 3,000 potential redundancies at BAE Systems at Brough, Samlesbury and Warton which were announced late last year. India is racing up the league of rich nations. Indeed, its soaring economy will outstrip the UK’s by 2022. According to financial advisers Merrill Lynch, India has 153,000 dollar-millionaires — a 20 per cent rise in a year, compared with Britain’s own paltry increase of less than 1 per cent. Indians have squirrelled away more money in Swiss bank accounts (a total of £900 billion since independence from Britain in 1947) than the rest of the world combined. And when they were invited recently by the Indian Government to exchange for paper money the gold bars and jewellery stashed in their homes (so pumping cash into the national economy), a horde of £160 billion was offered up. Poor: India is a rich nation and receives billions in aid, yet many still live in poverty . Missing: This school has no desks or chairs because they had never been delivered and are presumed stolen from the factory where they were made . Such is the economic power of India that it now gives out more foreign aid than it receives, and has handed over £3.5 billion to cement relations with impoverished Africa. Meanwhile, it invests huge sums in ambitious projects: £2 billion will put the first Indian astronauts into space by 2016, and the annual defence budget tops £22 billion, with a third aircraft carrier now under construction in an Indian shipyard. Perhaps the perfect example of the garish spending of India’s newly-rich is the £2 billion, 27-storey skyscraper in Mumbai built by a local industrialist as a home for his wife and three children. It is the most expensive house anywhere in the world. Despite this enormous wealth, David Cameron has decided to give India £1.4 billion between now and 2015. The sum is almost 1 per cent of Britain’s own £159 billion debts. What’s more, it’s feared that some of this money is chewed up by corruption and fraud. Wealthy: India's first unmanned mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft, pictured in 2008 . An official report has revealed that 90 per cent of government officials have accepted a bribe for favours, from ripping up a speeding fine to rubber-stamping a building deal. Corruption, as the Indian prime minister has confessed, is as much a national sport as cricket. Officials admit that £70 million of the £388 million given by Britain towards a national flagship education programme called Sarva Shiksha Abbiyan (‘education for all’), which promises free classes for every child from the age of six to 14, has been squandered though widespread corruption and theft. The result is a hugely divided nation, with the super-rich surround by extreme poverty.Indian cities are riddled with slums - there are 500 in Bhopal alone - and thousands of families live in squalor, even those from the middle classes. Sewage runs down the muddy streets lined with shacks made of corrugated iron with no front doors.","Propaganda coup for Nicolas Sarkozy just days after he declared Britain has 'no industry'

We tend to think of Neanderthals as brutish and messy cavemen who lumbered from one meal to the next. But it turns out we may have been doing our distant cousins a disservice. New evidence suggests that Neanderthals, who vanished around 30,000 years ago, lived in organised and tidy spaces - much in the same way as modern humans. A collapsed rock shelter in north-west Italy revealed that cavemen were tidy. The site (pictured) showed how they arranged their living space, assigning separate areas for preparing food, making tools and socialising, according to a study which was published in December . Archaeologists have discovered an ancient cave shelter which shows they thoughtfully arranged their living space, assigning separate areas for preparing food, making tools and socialising. Dr Julien Riel-Salvatore, from the University of Colorado Denver, who led the research, said: 'There has been this idea that Neanderthals did not have an organised use of space, something that has always been attributed to humans. 'But we found that Neanderthals did not just throw their stuff everywhere but in fact were organised and purposeful when it came to domestic space.' Neanderthals were similar to early modern humans but belonged to a separate human sub-species. The friends and family of the Neanderthal went to great care to dig a grave and protect his body . The two tribes co-existed for thousands of years in Europe before Neanderthals vanished around 30,000 years ago, probably because they could not compete with the modern humans. The new findings, published in the Canadian Journal of Archaeology, detail the result of excavations at Riparo Bombrini, a collapsed rock shelter in north-west Italy. Investigation of three Neanderthal levels at the cave site showed how areas were divided up for different activities. The top level, containing animal remains, seems to have been reserved for butchering animals. Archaeologists from the University of Colorado found the cave as a result of excavations at Riparo Bombrini, a collapsed rock shelter in north-west Italy . The middle level was a long-term sleeping area, and the bottom level a place for shorter stays. In the middle level, containing the most traces of human occupation, artefacts were distributed to avoid clutter around the hearth at the back of the cave. Animal bones and stone tools were concentrated at the front rather than the rear of the shelter. More stone tools were found immediately inside the mouth of the cave's bottom level, suggesting that tool production took place there to take advantage of available sunlight. Dr Riel-Salvatore said: 'When you make stone tools there is a lot of debris that you don't want in high-traffic areas or you risk injuring yourself. 'There are clearly fewer stone artefacts in the back of the shelter near the hearth.' The finds add to growing evidence that Neanderthals were more advanced than previously thought. Dr Riel-Salvatore added: 'This is still more evidence that they were more sophisticated than many have given them credit for. If we are going to identify modern human behaviour on the basis of organised spatial patterns, then you have to extend it to Neanderthals as well.'","Cave was found after excavations at the Riparo Bombrini shelter in Italy .

Case: The jury at Mark Duggan's inquest will hear evidence from a witness who claims she saw police plant a gun at the scene of his death . Mark Duggan was one of the most violent gangsters in the country and was linked to ten shootings and two murders, an inquest was  told yesterday. The 29-year-old, whose death after being shot by a police marksman sparked the 2011 summer riots, opened fire in a nightclub in Christmas 2010, it was claimed. He was also a senior member of the notorious Tottenham ManDem (TMD) gang and was implicated in   other firearms offences leading up to his death, it was alleged. A police report shown to the jury at Duggan’s inquest said the alleged gangster and his associates ‘posed a high risk to the public and police alike’. It said there were ‘numerous intelligence reports to suggest that members of Tottenham ManDem have access to firearms and are prepared to use them’. Acting Superintendent Michael Foote, who was in charge of the  Met’s gun crime unit in north-west London, said his team had monitored 100 gangsters since 2008. Of these, he said Duggan was one of 48 who were considered the most dangerous. He told the jury at the Royal Courts of Justice: ‘They were considered the most violent people in London, outside London, stretching across Europe. They were closely linked to Turkish criminal organisations.’ Firearm: A photograph of a gun, shown as evidence to the jury at the Royal Courts of Justice, during the inquest for Mark Duggan, who was shot when the taxi in which he was travelling was stopped by armed police .

The officer said intelligence ‘gave a . clear indication’ that Duggan was involved in gun crime, possession of . ammunition and the supply of Class A drugs. And Duggan was considered the most likely member of TMD to get hold of a gun, he added. It was said he had shot a clubber at . Christmas 2010, and fired shots in a car park outside a nightclub in .

A major traffic route into a city centre was closed today following warnings of high winds, two years after a man died in the area during similar conditions. Leeds City Council took the decision to shut the road past the Bridgewater Place tower - the tallest building in Yorkshire - after predictions that wind speeds in the area could reach 75mph. But with pedestrians still allowed access, at around 11am today two . people were injured in the area by the gusts - including a woman in her 30s who was knocked unconscious. The move follows a recommendation made yesterday by a coroner at the inquest into the death of Edward Slaney, 35, who was hit by a lorry that flew through the air in windy conditions in March 2011. Scroll down for video . Danger: Pedestrians are battered by high winds in the notorious Bridgewater Place in Leeds, West Yorkshire . Decision: The move to shut the road past the tower (right) follows a recommendation made by a coroner at the inquest into the death of Edward Slaney (left) who was hit by a lorry that flew through the air in windy conditions . Following a lengthy inquest which examined the 367ft tower's influence on wind conditions in the area, Leeds Deputy Coroner Melanie Williamson said she was recommending the junction at its base should be shut to all road users when wind speeds reach 45mph. Leeds City Council said it was closing the junction - which is said to become a 'man-made wind tunnel' in storms - at 6am until the winds subside. The road is the main route into Leeds from the south and links the city centre and railways stations to the M1, M621 and M62 motorways. It is used by thousands of vehicles every morning and its closure is expected to cause widespread traffic chaos in the area. In a statement, the council said: ‘People are being warned to plan ahead to avoid possible major disruption around Bridgewater Place tomorrow morning as roads will be closed due to expected exceptionally-high winds. ‘Leeds City Council will shut the . junction where Yorkshire's tallest building stands due to the forecasts . of high winds of up to 75mph. Tricky: A pedestrian tries to make their way across the road as they are battered by gale-force winds . Moving: A cyclist carries his bicycle near Bridgewater Place in Leeds as the area is battered by high winds . ‘No vehicles or cycles will be allowed along Victoria Road, Water Lane or Neville Street from around 6am until wind speeds drop to lower levels. A high-sided vehicle diversion at the junction will also be in place from midnight tonight.’ The council's director of development, Martin Farrington, said: ‘Given the high winds forecast and the known risk caused by Bridgewater Place we will close the roads around the building tomorrow. ‘We appreciate the traffic disruption that this will cause, but these are exceptionally strong winds and we have to consider the safety of all road users.’ ‘While we need to take time to examine the coroner's recommendations we would have had to close the junction tomorrow anyway due to the weather forecast. ‘We apologise for the inconvenience and ask people who will be travelling in this area of the city to plan ahead.’ A . Yorkshire Ambulance Service spokesman said of the injuries: ‘We . received two calls within minutes of each other this morning at . Bridgewater Place. The first call came in at 10.57am. ‘A female in her 30s had been blown over and knocked unconscious. We sent a rapid response team and an ambulance to the scene. Blown over: A woman struggled to stay on her . feet while walking across the road near Bridgewater Place . ‘Just minutes later we received another call about another person who had suffered injuries at the same place. We sent another ambulance and both people have been taken to Leeds General Infirmary.’ Nicola Furbisher, who witnessed the winds on her way to work, said on Twitter: ‘People barely able to stay upright, being flung into the road, mum battling as pushchair is almost blown over. Very scary.’ And Richard Edwards added: ‘I've never seen wind like this before. Two men in high-viz jackets have just saved a woman from being blown into the road.’ Dr Slaney died when the truck was lifted off the road by a gust of wind. The driver said the vehicle flew like a hot air balloon. The inquest into his death heard how a series of wind-related incidents had been reported at the north end of the tower in the years before the incident. The company that owns the building, which was opened in 2007 and dominates the south Leeds skyline, is planning a range of measures to try to alleviate the problem including large gantries over the road. But Dr Slaney's family and the coroner have expressed their frustration at the pace at which this measures are being implemented.","Leeds City Council closes the road past 367ft-tall Bridgewater Place tower .

He was raised in a mock Victorian ‘monstrosity’ in the suburbs of New Jersey, but now Richard L Chilton, hedge fund billionaire, is the new owner of one of the finest homes in Britain. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Crichel House, the magnificent Grade 1 listed property in Dorset that dragged Winston Churchill into a political scandal, has been acquired by the 58-year-old financier after months of wrangling. According to friends, he is planning to restore the Classical Revival property ‘to its former glory’ after buying it from the Marten family, who sold it after the apparent heir, Napier Marten, 54, reportedly ‘heard a voice saying shave my head and go to Australia’. Richard L. Chilton, with daughter Sarah, is reported to have a £1.2billion fortune . The £100 million estate was put on the market after the death of his mother, Mary Anna Marten, goddaughter of the Queen Mother and child playmate of Princess Margaret. Its sale has captured the imagination of historians after concerns it might be left in limbo after two years on the market. But Mr Chilton, a conservationist, has now confirmed he has bought the property and plans to restore it. His spokesman told The Mail on Sunday: ‘In purchasing Crichel House, Mr Chilton, who has a rich history of preserving and restoring some of the finest architectural houses in the United States, is excited to restore and preserve its architectural integrity.’ The news has been welcomed by local people. Businessman Larry Kennedy said: ‘The secrecy surrounding the sale has been unsettling for the past two years. He’ll be embraced if he uses local labour rather than importing architects and builders from London.’ One of the finest homes in Britain, Crichel House, has been bought by the wealthy financier . The house – rebuilt in 1742 after a fire destroyed the original Tudor building – formed the backdrop to the 1996 film version of Jane Austen’s Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and the Stanley Kubrick Hollywood costume drama Barry Lyndon, and in 1954 was at the centre of a political scandal over compulsory purchase. The Crichel Down Affair, as it became known, centred on 725 acres of agricultural land that was part  of the Crichel House estate but  had been compulsorily purchased in 1938 by the Air Ministry for use  for bombing practice by the Royal Air Force. Winston Churchill promised it would be handed back to the owners at the end of the war. When this did not happen, a public inquiry backed the family’s demands and ordered that it be sold back to them. The family trust was wound up at the end of last year and Land Registry records suggest that some parcels of land and property have been distributed among Napier’s five sisters. The 10,000-acre Crichel Estate, which includes four villages with a total of 150 tenanted houses, a church, a cricket club and a school, had been on the market for £100 million, which would have made it the most expensive property sold in this country outside London. The mock Victorian childhood home of Richard Chilton was a 'monstrosity' Another of Chilton's, who is married with four children, properties, located in Connecticut . But it failed to sell, despite the reported interest of Prince Charles, who was said to have considered the property as a potential family home for William and Kate. But Mr Chilton, who is married with four children and who is reported to  have a fortune of $1.2 billion (£800 million) – has bought only Crichel House and its 400-acre parkland, which includes formal gardens and a huge horseshoe-shaped lake. The rest of the estate is to be broken up and sold in separate lots. The sum was not disclosed but one developer estimated the house and land package at about £34 million. Refurbishing the house, however, ‘could easily swallow a further £10 million’. Mark Harold, director of the National trust for the South West, said: ‘The acquisition of such an historically important property is extremely good news. This is a wonderful piece of British heritage that deserves to be preserved.’ Mr Chilton serves as a trustee of New York’s prestigious Metropolitan Museum of Art and has previously saved several historic homes in America from neglect. He grew up in a three-storey mock Victorian villa boasting a turret and a columned portico.

Tensions between the UK and Spain over the sovereignty of Gibraltar increased today after Spanish jets forced the delay of a British Airways flight. Angry government officials demanded the issue be raised at the highest levels after four fighter planes were accused of entering Gibraltar airspace during a military exercise in the area. Officials in the British territory insist no warning was given prior to the incursion and that the commercial BA flight was subsequently forced to wait on the tarmac for 12 minutes. The Gibraltar government has called on the UK to bring the matter up with Spain on the 'highest diplomatic and military levels' after four Spanish fighter planes allegedly entered its airspace . The alleged incursion delayed a British Airways flight to London by 12 minutes and 'no warning was given' Incident may intensify the diplomatic row between Britain and Spain coming just days after David Cameron confronted his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy (right) over Spanish police entering British waters . Eyewitnesses described seeing the . jets pass very close to the Rock in an incident described by military . personnel as 'being buzzed'. 'The Government of Gibraltar has called on the UK to take up the matter . of this military incursion into the airspace of Gibraltar at the highest . diplomatic and military levels,' said a government spokesman. A foreign office official added: 'We have raised this with London and Madrid.' The jets are understood to have come from a Spanish aircraft carrier, Juan Carlos I, based about 10 miles from the Rock. Spanish Defence Ministry deny that Spanish fighter jets entered Gibraltar airspace. A Gibraltar government spokesman said: 'At no time did the aircraft make . contact with Gibraltar's air-traffic control and the Spanish air . traffic authorities in Seville gave no warning of the aircrafts' approach.' The incident comes just days after Prime Minister David Cameron . complained to his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy over an incident in . which a British jet skier was allegedly shot at by Spanish police in the . waters surrounding the Rock. Incursion: This photograph shows a Spanish police boat which entered British waters off Gibraltar . Britain was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over Gibraltar after Spanish police fired shots at British jet-skier Dale Villa, pictured, in waters around the Rock . It comes after Spanish police twice entered British waters once, in a public rebuke to British warnings not to do so. Last week, the Foreign Office protested to the . Spanish government after a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered . Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode . his jet-ski close to a popular beach. Just three days later, a police boat was seen in British waters again. Mr Cameron said: ‘I have raised this . with the Spanish Prime Minister. I think this is a totally unacceptable . episode and I made that clear. ‘I think it’s very important the . people of Gibraltar know that we support them, we support their . sovereignty, we will always stand up for them and stand by them. ‘I think it’s very important countries obey all the international rules, all the international laws.’ Spain's foreign ministry denied that . any shots were fired, and accused the British Government of granting too . much credibility to a 'rumour'. But Mr Cameron made clear that he thought the Spanish police had breached international rules. The PM added: ‘We need to find out . more about exactly what happened but from all I've heard from the First . Minister in Gibraltar it’s not acceptable and that's why I raised the . issue and I think we can avoid these incidents in future.' Video: This footage apparently shows the jet ski trying to escape from the Spanish police while under fire . Worrying: The jet ski rider said he had been taking friends and family members on rides when he was chased by the Guardia Civil vessel . Father-of-three Mr . Villa described how he had been fired at on two separate occasions as he . tested his new jet-ski with family and friends on Sunday afternoon. ‘I was very shaken and furious,’ said the delivery driver. ‘When . a huge boat is hurling after you and you hear gunshots it is very . scary. There were three policemen on the boat and I actually saw one of . them with a gun in his hand. The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own . affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the . responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres. ‘I was just about to drop my friend . off at West Beach when I heard the first shot. I don’t really think we . took it seriously or believed it could be a gun, but clearly it was. ‘I . jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was . chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me. ‘I . had only just taken my friend’s ten-year-old daughter out for a spin . and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being . threatening or doing anything wrong. ‘Maybe . these guys were bored – it being a Sunday – but I really hope something . is going to be done about it, as it is outrageous.’ Shots can be heard . on a grainy video filmed by a witness. British sources said it was . thought the Spanish police fired rubber bullets at the man. The UK’s charge d’affaires in Madrid was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the Spanish capital. The . incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off-duty officer from . the Royal Gibraltar Police, which has launched a formal investigation. But a spokesman for Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ‘no . incident’ had taken place’ and ‘no shot fired’. Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty. British . sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its . waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels. From . December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions . by Spanish boats.","Spanish jets accused of entering Gibraltar airspace during military exercise .

The family of a teenage girl who died after she was refused access to potentially life-saving cancer drugs has called for a change in the laws governing who can take part in medical trials. Chloe Drury was told she was too young to take part in the drugs trials by American pharmaceutical company BioMarin while she was suffering from a rare form of bone cancer, despite pleas from her parents, doctors and politicians. She died in February, a month after her 18th birthday, from Ewing's Sarcoma after the cancer had aggressively progressed. Chloe Drury was told she was too young to take part in the drugs trials by American pharmaceutical company BioMarin . The previous September, when she was 17, she was told she could not take part in the trials as it could 'jeopardise [her] safety and the integrity of the trial data', her family have told Sky News. Chloe, from Purley, in Surrey, was allowed on the course when she turned 18, but by then it was too late. Her mother Debbie Binner told Sky News: 'We were just sitting there watching our beautiful 17-year-old daughter get weaker and weaker, knowing there is something out there she could have had and it just seems totally wrong to me, and not a world that I want to live in that treats young people like that.' The family now wants age restrictions to be lifted for trials. In a statement, BioMarin has said their deepest sympathy went to the parents. The company said: 'It is precisely because of patients who suffer from devastating rare genetic diseases that BioMarin develops therapies where there are few, if any, options.' Chloe's mother Debbie Binner has called for age restrictions to be lifted for drugs trials . The company said it was conducting a trial in several genetically defined cancers, but it added: 'It is premature to know if it is safe or effective.' Cancer Research UK's clinical research director Kate Law said the guidelines did not always make sense and sometimes stopped teenagers taking part. She said for many trials there was 'no good reason' for the restrictions.","Chloe Drury told she was too young to take part in drugs trials .

What could be more heartwarming than a picture of one of the world’s most eligible bachelors doting over the lady carrying his child? Perhaps a whole series of them? For over the past week, the public has been treated to a host of pictures documenting Simon Cowell’s blossoming romance with Lauren Silverman, the U.S. socialite who is three months pregnant. Scroll down for video . Steady on girl, you'll swallow him whole! As Simon grips the sides of his public sun lounger on the beach at  St Tropez in apparent panic, Lauren pins him down for another smooch. But why go to the beach when you have a private yacht in the bay? CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10 . Still on the beach, it’s the 'lovers strolling through the surf picture', always a classic. But they need to work on hand-holding - Simon seems to be just clutching on to her pinkie. CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10 . What better way to be seen in St Tropez than taking a spin along the seafront in an exotic open top sports car? The only problem with choosing a classic Porsche of the type favoured by James Dean is that it will turn more heads than you do. A poor choice. CRINGE FACTOR: 2/10 . Somehow, photographers always seem to know exactly where to find the couple. And, gosh, aren’t they obliging when they are found? Holding hands, strolling through the surf and, most peculiarly, kissing at an outdoor table of Cafe Rouge — an oddly public place to go when you are worth £220 million and could take your pick of London’s secluded restaurants. But it’s clear the usually private Cowell, 53, has never been keener to be pictured. Apparently he is so nervous about the negative publicity surrounding his affair with Lauren — who was married to Cowell’s friend, real estate tycoon Andrew Silverman, when she became pregnant — that he’s desperate to show the world how in love they are. Lauren puts on another show at an outdoor cafe in St Tropez. But Simon has the body language of an embarrassed man. CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10 . Later they look indulgently at a cute little girl. The intended message? That they'll make fabulous parents in February. CRINGE FACTOR: 10/10 . Simon and Lauren board a private jet to London from Nice. There is a lovely view here of their matching bumps. Both look suitably glossy and masters of the universe-ish. CRINGE FACTOR: 2/10 . Leaving his London house on his way to Harley Street - whether for Botox, or baby, it is hard to say. What the Churchill sign means is anyone's guess. CRINGE FACTOR: 1/10 . To the Cafe Rouge in Mayfair. Everything about Cowell's straight-backed posture and nonchalant chin-in-hand pose says 'act natural' - yet the effect is quite the opposite. CRINGE FACTOR: 10/10 . Still hungry? They arrive later at Scalini's restaurant in Chelsea. Simon looks a little distracted as Lauren plants a peck on his cheek. CRINGE FACTOR: 2/10 . A source close to Cowell tells me: ‘He was appalled by the reaction to the initial story, that he had run off with his best friend’s wife. ‘It made him look a right nasty b******. He has been advised to keep it as quiet as he possibly can, but she was pressing to come out and see him. Simon is hoping that people will see it as a love story, and wish him luck.’ Yet his seemingly staged Public Displays of Affection may have backfired. Critics online have declared them ‘shameless’, ‘so contrived,’ and ‘cringey’. Picture research: CLAIRE CISOTTI . In the company of not-very-publicity-shy Louis Walsh, Simon and Lauren are certainly getting the hang of this thing for Public Displays of Affection. She has a lovely smile and a pretty pink dress, but their bodies remain as stiff as a couple of mannequins in a shop window. CRINGE FACTOR: 9/10 . Simon is showing off even more cleavage than her in a shirt open to the waist. This clinch ought to be intimate at the end of a romantic evening, but it is simply unconvincing. CRINGE FACTOR: 9/10 . A classic in-car shot, with Lauren looking radiant but clingy and Simon a picture of smug satisfaction. He permitted a lot of these kind of shots to be taken when he was with his now-discarded fiancee Mezhgan Hussainy, too. And, another thing: Scalini's is a favourite restaurant of Simon's PR guru Max Clifford. CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10 .","For the past week the public have seen pictures documenting romance .

Glam rock icons Queen's Greatest Hits has topped a list of Britain's best-selling albums of the last 50 years. The album has sold a staggering 5.8 million copies in the UK since it was released in 1981 - comfortably beating the best The Beatles could manage. The Fab Four's best effort, their 1967 release Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band has had to settle for second place, with sales of 5 million. And Queen have managed a unique double - two albums in the top 10. Their follow up, Greatest Hits II, released in 1991, just a month before the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury, is number 10 in the new list. 1) Queen's Greatest Hits (1981) and 2) The Beatles' Sgt.

The top 40 in full will be unveiled today Radio 2 by veteran DJ Tony Blackburn. Blackburn said: 'This chart is a real mixed bag and I think listeners will be quite surprised. There are artists in there you would expect to see in a countdown of this nature but not necessarily at the positions that they are.' The big surprise is the absence of The Rolling Stones in the top 40 - and Blackburn expected some other big names too. He said: 'I was really surprised to see who hadn't made it in - no sign of the massively successful acts like The Rolling Stones, Elvis, Diana Ross or Marvin Gaye. Listeners are in for a real treat. There's something for everyone in the chart and it'll be the perfect way to spend the Bank Holiday Monday afternoon.'

A once-a-day pill for patients with a potentially deadly blood clot on the lungs has been given the go-ahead on the NHS. The drug is set to replace warfarin, a treatment based on rat poison which has been used since the 1950s, and heparin injections. Rivaroxaban is more patient-friendly, cutting stays in hospital for treatment and long-term monitoring. Rivaroxaban, once-a-day pill for patients with a potentially deadly blood clot on the lungs has been given the go-ahead on the NHS . Around 38,000 people in England and Wales who suffer a pulmonary embolism (PE) each year could benefit – with 6,500 expected to take it for life. The pill is one of a new generation of anti-clotting agents that have been approved for other conditions including heart rhythm disorders and are expected to become blockbuster drugs. Dr Alexander Cohen, Honorary Consultant Vascular Physician at King’s College Hospital said ‘It is excellent news that PE patients will now have access to rivaroxaban (correct lower case) on the NHS - the first oral treatment since the introduction of warfarin in the 1950s. ‘I am confident that this patient-centred, oral single drug approach will benefit patients’ quality of life and reduce the burden on the NHS.’ PE is the leading cause of preventable death in hospital, causing up to 32,000 deaths each year, more than the combined total of deaths from breast cancer, AIDS and traffic accidents. Surgery, obesity and immobility – such as long haul flights – are among triggers for PE. Ex-England footballer Paul Robinson, 33,  had a pulmonary embolism over Easter and now needs to take six months off work . New guidance (today wed) from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence means the drug will be available on the NHS throughout the UK (to subs includes Scotland). Professor Beverley Hunt, Medical Director of Lifeblood: The Thrombosis Charity said patients would get a better quality of life. She said ‘Having a PE can be terrifying for it can strike without warning, often resulting in patients having to spend time in intensive care, sometimes facing months of recovery, and always in fear of a recurrence. ‘Patients on the standard treatment of heparin injections and warfarin also have to endure regular blood testing and frequent clinic visits for dose readjustment, and have to get used to diet restriction. ‘This regime can have a huge impact on patients’ daily lives and difficulties in managing it can often exacerbate their worries of experiencing another PE.’ A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs after deep vein thrombosis (DVT), when a blood clot in the deep veins of the legs breaks off and  travels to the lungs. A PE blocks the blood supply to the lungs, resulting in the lungs collapsing and heart failure. Even if it is not fatal, it can cause long-term disability. The total cost to the UK of managing the condition is estimated at £640 million annually. A physician at King¿s College Hospital said that the introduction of the drug was excellent news and a new development in care . Ex-England footballer Paul Robinson, 33,  had a pulmonary embolism over Easter and now needs to take six months off work. The Blackburn goalkeeper developed it after an operation on his back. Rivaroxaban acts at a critical point in the blood-clotting process to prevent the formation of clots.Experts claim the daily pill costing £2.10 cuts the length of hospital stay for affected patients and aftercare. Warfarin, which is still used in large doses to kill vermin, is inconvenient for patients because careful monitoring and regular blood tests are needed to prevent excessive bleeding from cuts or stomach ulcers, requiring frequent clinic visits for testing. It can also interact badly with other drugs, alcohol and certain foods, including green vegetables and grapefruit. Patients are prescribed rivaroxaban, also known as Xarelto, for varying lengths of time, from three, six and 12 months to life, and Nice said the drug was cost-effective all durations compared with existing care. Eve Knight, chief executive of the charity, AntiCoagulation Europe said ‘As someone who has suffered a PE, I fully understand what a frightening experience this is. ‘It is important for both patients and clinicians to have a choice of appropriate treatments that will treat the disease and reduce the incidence of PE and the possibility of sudden death.’ Professor Carole Longson of Nice said warfarin treatment meant regular visits to hospital or GP appointments, and could be costly and inconvenient with some people having to take time off work. The drug was co-developed by Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson and is expected to make peak sales worth two billion euros a year in Europe.","Experts say anti-clotting agent  Rivaroxaban is more patient-friendly .

America's vast surveillance infrastructure has been glimpsed for the first time after an artist took photos of three of the United States' most powerful intelligence sites - including the NSA - and making the images available to the public. The photos were taken last year by Trevor Paglen, who used a helicopter to shoot the top-secret bureaus at night, Gawker reported. The shots were published this week in the inaugural issue of new digital magazine The Intercept. The three agencies captured are the National Security Agency (NSA), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The National Security Agency (NSA): . With a 2013 budget request of approximately $10.8 billion, the NSA is the second-largest agency in the U.S. intelligence community and is headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland . Up until these photos were released, the media have been forced to use images of the NSA headquarters provided by the NSA themselves, which are thought to have been taken in 1970s . The National Reconnaissance Office: The NRO is in charge of developing, deploying and operating secret reconnaissance satellites and is headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia. Spooky: The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is responsible for collecting, analyzing and distributing intelligence derived from maps and imagery. According to documents provided by Edward Snowden, the NGA's budget request was $4.9 billion last year ¿ more than double its funding a decade ago. It is headquartered in Springfield, Virginia . Paglen said he took on the project because, as classified documents exposed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden dominated headlines for the last eight months, the one image being used by the media in the accompanying stories was one provided by the NSA themselves. The image, available on Wikipedia, appears to have been taken in the 1970s, Paglen said. 'My intention is to expand the visual vocabulary we use to 'see' the U.S. intelligence community,' Paglen explained to The Intercept. 'Although the organizing logic of our nation's surveillance apparatus is invisibility and secrecy, its operations occupy the physical world. 'Digital surveillance programs require concrete data centers; intelligence agencies are based in real buildings; surveillance systems ultimately consist of technologies, people, and the vast network of material resources that supports them.' Outdated: This image of the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade and used in many of the articles featuring Edward Snowden, is believed to have been taken in the 1970s. The facility, just outside of Baltimore, has been expanded extensively and received billions of dollars of grants . Crucially, Paglen has donated the images to the public domain and made them available on Flickr and Wikimedia Commons. He wants people to know the agencies exist, and to feel civic ownership over them in the same way they feel ownership over their local library. 'The scale of NSA's operations were hidden from the public until August 2013, when their classified budget requests were revealed in documents provided by Snowden,' Paglen said. 'Three months later, I rented a helicopter and shot nighttime images of the NSA’s headquarters. 'I did the same with the NRO, which designs, builds and operates America’s spy satellites, and with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which maps and analyzes imagery, connecting geographic information to other surveillance data. 'The Central Intelligence Agency—the largest member of the intelligence community—denied repeated requests for permission to take aerial photos of its headquarters in Langley, Virginia.' More:The Utah Data Center, near Bluffdale, was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the NSA was stored . Storage: An aerial photograph shows the center . Stash: The government has been tight-lipped about what will be stored in the center's four 'data halls' In June of last year, photos emerged of the one million square-foot, $1.9 million facility being constructed by the government in the Utah Valley. The release coincided with the revelations that U.S. intelligence agencies had been extracting audio, video, photos, e-mails, documents and other . information to track people's movements and contacts. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, . YouTube, Skype, AOL and the lesser known Internet company PalTalk were revealed as all involved in the program PRISM, which the government insisted was for national security. Officials were tight-lipped about what would be stored at the Utah Data Center based in Camp Williams, on the Salt Lake-Utah County line. Plans released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the time of its construction showed the center had four 'data halls' to store information and two substations to power the facility. Powerhouse: These images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers, as well as data from companies including Facebook and Google . The spy center is estimated to have cost $1.9 billion and is said to employ 100 to 200 . permanent employees. The . PRISM program was launched in 2007 with the blessing of special federal . judges under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It has been described by NSA officials . 'as the most prolific contributor to the president's Daily Brief' and . the 'leading source of raw material', the Post reported. In practice, if collection managers in . the NSA's Special Source Operation Group, which manages PRISM, have . suspicion that their target is a foreign national engaged in terrorism . or a spy, they move ahead to draw in all the data which would often net in information on the suspect's contacts. President Obama has maintained that data mining 'was worth us doing' to halt national security threats . 'I think it’s important to understand . that you can’t have 100 percent security and then have 100 percent . privacy and zero inconvenience,' President Barack Obama said of the program last year. 'We’re going to have to . make some choices as a society.' Obama said the PRISM program does not . involve monitoring the email content of U.S. citizens or anyone living . in the U.S., and he repeatedly stated that both programs - the phone . spying and PRISM - have been approved by Congress. Since then, Obama has revealed a 'series of concrete and substantial reforms' he believes will address public concerns. The proposals include changing the controversial section 215 metadata program, and what Obama described as the 'unprecedented' extending of rights around monitoring to non-US citizens outside of America. Obama contrasted the NSA's data collection with how corporations like Google mine metadata for information around which advertising campaigns can be built. However, 'the standards for government surveillance should be higher' the President conceded, admitting that 'history has too many examples of when trust has been breached'.","Revelations that U.S. intelligence agencies had been extracting personal information from people across the country were exposed by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden last year .

A European probe that will map more than a billion stars in 3D is set to revolutionise astronomy, according to scientists, who have announced the start of its launch countdown. British scientists and engineers have played key roles in the design and construction of the 840 million pound spacecraft, called Gaia. The two-tonne robot is due to be blasted into orbit on a Russian Soyuz rocket from the European space port in French Guiana on December 19. An artist's impression of Gaia, the £840 million spacecraft that will map more than a billion stars in 3D. It will pinpoint many millions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, with unparalleled precision and aims to yield clues about mysterious dark matter and dark energy . The mission, which will last five years, is designed to discover thousands of previously unknown objects, including exploding stars, planets orbiting other suns and nearby asteroids. It will also pinpoint many millions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, with unparalleled precision and aims to yield clues about mysterious dark matter and dark energy. Gaia will operate from a stable location one-and-a-half-million kilometres from the Earth known as the L2 Lagrangian point. Situated with the Earth between it and the Sun, the spacecraft will be perfectly placed to observe the wider universe.

The flood of data produced by the mission will be enough to fill more than 30,000 CD ROMs. Britain's principal Gaia investigator Professor Gerry Gilmore, from Cambridge University, said: 'The results from Gaia will revolutionise our understanding of the cosmos as never before. 'Our understanding of what's out there has been driven by looking at what we can see. We've never had a genuine opportunity to look at everything, to know what's there, and to know where they are in relation to each other. 'We don't even know how much we don't know - there are sure to be objects out there that don't even have names yet, since we don't yet realise how strange they are. 'There are literally hundreds of questions like this - why is the universe the way it is? Where did the Milky Way come from? What's it really made of? Exactly how much does it weigh? How did it get to be like it is? The Gaia craft is tested in a lab in French Guiana before it was launched. It is Europe's successor to the Hipparcos satellite which mapped around 100,000 stars . 'We will go beyond what we can see to understand reality. We are going to discover completely new things - things we would think are impossible.' British universities and companies won around £67 million worth of contracts from the European Space Agency to build key components of the spacecraft, including its camera sensors and micro-propulsion system. A state-of-the-art processing centre at Cambridge will sift and digest massive amounts of raw data from the probe. Gaia will operate from a stable location one-and-a-half-million kilometres from the Earth known as the L2 Lagrangian point. Situated with the Earth between it and the Sun (illustrated), the spacecraft will be perfectly placed to observe the wider universe . Dr Floor van Leeuwen, manager of Gaia data processing in the UK, said: 'The sensors on board the spacecraft will be able to detect objects so faint the human eye would have to be nearly 4,000 times more powerful to see them. 'This accuracy is equivalent to measuring a shirt button on the moon as seen from the Earth. It means we have to have the highest-capability computers to analyse the data.' Gaia will help scientists investigating two of astronomy's greatest mysteries, Dark Matter and Dark Energy.

Passionate: Prince Albert, writing in German on November 15, 1839, told his 20-year-old fiancée he dreamed of the moment their hands touched . A passionate love letter Prince Albert sent to Queen Victoria describing his all-consuming desire will be unveiled for the first time. He describes how her beauty burned his 'whole soul', and how he dreams of the moment their hands touched. The German royal had returned to Coburg in Germany for a few weeks to settle his affairs before their wedding on February 10, 1840. But it seems even a moment from his 20-year-old fiancée was unbearable. The poetic note, dated November 15, 1839, told her: 'I need not tell you that since we left, all my thought have been with you at Windsor, and that your image fills my whole soul. 'Even in my dreams I never imagined that I should find so much love on earth. 'How that moment shines for me still when I was close to you, with your hand in mine. Those days flew by so quickly, but our separation will fly equally so.' In May, more than 174 years later, the heartfelt exchange between two of the nation's most revered leaders in history is set to be displayed at the Drawings Gallery in Windsor Castle. It is one of a number exchanged by the besotted young leaders in the months after Victoria proposed. The couple, first cousins, met in England on Princess Victoria's 17th birthday in May 1836 at the suggestion of her Belgian uncle King Leopold I. A year later, her uncle, William IV died, . and the 18-year-old rose to throne. She would become Britain's . longest-serving monarch to date. Historic: It is an unprecedented revelation of the emotional exchanges between two of the nation's most revered leaders. The first cousins are pictured here in 1845, five years after their marriage . Love: Victoria, here with Albert at their wedding in February 1840, proposed on their second meeting . The defiant young ruler was determined to stand strong and alone, but the next time she met Albert, in late 1839, she was moved by his beauty, and asked for his hand on October 15. The letter, written in his native German, Victoria's first language, shows Albert's unwavering emotion was just as strong. It starts: 'Theuerste innigst geliebtre Victoria,' which translates as: 'Dearest, deeply loved Victoria'. Albert's letter to 'deeply loved Victoria' (pictured left as a newlywed and right 15 years later) says her image fills his 'whole soul' and explains he has been ill. The document will be exhibited in Windsor Castle in May . Amidst the impassioned words, he also sends love from his brother, Ernest, and explains he fell ill on the boat ride. Lauren Porter, the curator of the exhibition, told the Sunday Telegraph the letter 'provides a fascinating personal insight into the depth of Prince Albert’s thoughts and feelings for his bride-to-be'. She added: 'Such a heartfelt expression of love and devotion is particularly striking as it sits in contrast to the popular idea of the Victorian era being a period of emotional restraint.'","Note dated November 15, 1839, says he dreams of their hands touching .

Austin Dillon, the 2012 NASCAR driver added: 'Just heard about Caleb Moore. I don't know what to say other than I'm praying for his family and friends. He was a true Action Sports Hero.' Caleb Moore was attempting a back-flip last Thursday in the freestyle event when the skis on his 450-pound snowmobile caught the lip of the landing area, sending him flying over the handlebars. Moore landed face first into the snow with his snowmobile rolling over him. First aid: Emergency personnel tend to Moore after his machine landed on top of him last Thursday during the competition . Moore stayed down for quite some time, before walking off with help and going to a hospital to treat a concussion. Moore developed bleeding around his heart and was flown to a hospital . in Grand Junction for surgery. The family later said that Moore, of . Krum, Texas, also had a complication involving his brain. Colten Moore was injured in a separate crash that same night. He suffered a separated pelvis in the spill. He was reportedly released from hospital on Saturday. B.C. Vaught, Caleb Moore's agent for almost a decade, said he first saw . Moore when he was racing an ATV in Minnesota and signed him up to star . in some action sports movies. Later, . Moore wanted to make the switch from ATVs to snowmobiles and asked . Vaught to show him how to do a back-flip. In two weeks, Moore mastered . the difficult maneuver. Moore's brother also got involved in snowmobiling, the close-knit duo pushing each other to become better. Brothers: Caleb Moore (left) and his brother Colten were both at the top of their game in the extreme sport . Way of life: Moore, 25, from Krum, Texas, adored the sport of snow-mobiling . Moore honed his skills in Krum, a . town about 5,000 people 50 miles northwest of Dallas that rarely sees . snow. Instead, he worked on tricks by launching his sled into a foam . pit. After a brief training run on snow ramps in Michigan, he was ready . for his sport's biggest stage - the 2010 Winter X Games. In that contest, Moore captured a . bronze in freestyle and finished sixth in best trick. Two years later, . his biography on ESPN said: 'Caleb Moore has gone from ''beginner's . luck'' to `serious threat.' That was hardly a surprise to Vaught, who said: 'Whatever he wanted to do, he did it.' Vaught . said Moore didn't believe his sport was too extreme, but rather 'it was . a lifestyle'. He was good at it --along with ATV racing - as he . accumulated a garage full of trophies. Fellow snowmobile rider Levi LaVallee recently described Moore as a 'fierce competitor'. 'A . very creative mind,' LaVallee said. 'I've watched him try some crazy, . crazy tricks and some of them were successful, some of them not so much. 'But he was first guy to get back on a sled and go try it again. It shows a lot of heart.' Crash-landing: Caleb Moore, 25, was performing an impressive flip when the skis of his snowmobile caught in the snow as he landed . Injured: Moore was rushed to the hospital, where doctors discovered a heart contusion and bleeding around his heart . The safety of the snowmobile events . has fallen under scrutiny with several recent accidents and mishaps. In . addition to the crashes by the Moore brothers, there also was a scary . scene when a runaway sled veered into the crowd Sunday night after the . rider fell off during a jump gone wrong. In . that incident, snowmobiling newcomer Jackson Strong tumbled off his . machine during the best trick competition. The throttle stuck on the . 450-pound sled and it swerved straight toward the crowd as fans scurried . out of the way. In a statement, X Games officials . said that they've paid close attention to safety issues during the . event's 18-year history. ESPN which organizes X Games told CNN: 'We are deeply saddened by Caleb Moore's passing and our thoughts and prayers go out to his parents, Wade and Michelle, his brother, Colten, and the entire Moore family. 'He will be remembered for his natural passion for life and his deep love for his family and friends, and he will always be an inspiration to everyone he touched in the action sports community. 'As a result of this accident we will conduct a thorough review of this discipline and adopt any appropriate changes to future X Games.' The network added: 'When the world's best compete at the highest level in any sport, risks remain. Caleb was a four-time X Games medalist attempting a move he has landed several times previously.' Vaught . said Moore's only previous injury was a bruised hip that sent him to . the hospital last year, where he was treated and released. â€˜In . sports, everybody makes mistakes, even if it's rare. Caleb made a . mistake. That's it,â€™ said Vaught, who witnessed Moore's crash. The . spills at Winter X weren't just limited to snowmobiles. Rose Battersby . suffered a lumbar spine fracture in a wipeout on a practice run before . the skiing slopestyle competition. She was transported to Denver on .

Police are investigating whether the murder of a couple shot dead in their California home on Sunday was related to complaints about their property business. The bodies of Bradford Hans Sachs, 57, and Andra Resa Sachs, 54, were found in the bedroom of their Orange County home. Their eight-year-old adopted son, who has not been named, was seriously injured in the attack, which happened at about 2am. Victims: Bradford Hans Sachs and Andra Resa Sachs were found shot dead in the early hours of Sunday . Legal proceedings and several complaints had allegedly been made about the couple, who ran businesses under several names. Although they were divorced, the couple still lived together in their San Juan Capistrano mansion, which they shared with their five children. The couple's two eldest children were away at college at the time of the murder, but their two teenage daughters, and the eight-year-old son, were at home. Neighbors were shocked to hear that the couple had been killed, but customers who had rented property from the couple said they had experienced problems with them. Ken Baum, who rents a commercial space from the couple, claimed that they changed their company name regularly and told him not to tell anyone who he was renting from. Crime scene: The couple were killed, and their son seriously injured, in this San Juan Capistrano home . Investigation: Police found the couple's bodies in their bedroom at this California home . 'After we signed the lease, we gave them a check. They walked us outside, my son and I, and they said, ""Whatever you do, don’t tell anybody you know us, you don’t know our names, you don’t know we’re here, we don’t exist"",' Mr Baum told CBS Los Angeles. His son, Bryce Baum, added: 'We were here for about a year and a half and they’ve changed business names several times. I couldn’t even tell you how people have come around looking for them, you know, due to whatever business dealings or money and something like that.' In 2011, Ms Sachs appeared on a list of California's top tax avoiders, allegedly owing $1.15 million to the state. The following year, her name had been removed from the list, and she told Patch at the time: 'The amount due is highly in dispute and contested.' Consumer watchdog website Ripoff Report contained several allegations against the couple over disputed rental agreements and claims that they took advantage of Ms Sachs's dying mother. In a post from July last year, an alleged former tenant claimed they were still waiting for the couple to pay a court order of $8,000 over a deposit dispute. Police have not yet released a motive or suspect for the double murder. Emergency services were called to the luxury home at about 2am, after reports of 'unknown trouble'.","Bradford and Andra Sachs were found shot dead in California mansion .

Detectives have made a break in the 39-year-old cold case disappearance of two young girls that shocked Washington, DC and the nation. Police say they have identified a convicted sex offender who is currently in prison as a possible suspect in the 1975 kidnapping of Sheila and Katherine Lyon. The girls, age 12 and 10, were the daughters of a popular radio personality. They vanished without a trace as they walked to get pizza in their quiet suburban neighborhood. The chilling case gained national attention and rattled upscale Montgomery County, Maryland, outside Washington. Katherine and Sheila's father, John Lyon, used his high profile to plead for tips and assistance - but his daughters were never found and no killer was ever identified. Shocking: Sheila and Katherine Lyon, age 12 and 10, vanished without a trace on March 25, 1975 while they were walking to get pizza. Their disappearance shocked the nation . Grief: Parents John and Mary Lyon have never been able to find out what happened to their daughters . Mr and Mrs Lyons are still alive and in their 70s. They have not yet commented on the development in their daughters' case. Cold case detectives have named 'a convicted child sex offender,' who is currently in prison and 'had traveled extensively throughout the United States' as a person of interest in the case. The Washington Post reports that police have reason to believe the sex offender was in Montgomery County at the time of the girls' disappearance and that he was familiar with the area. 'It’s the biggest break we’ve had in quite some time in the case,' Captain Marcus Jones, the commander of Montgomery’s major crimes division, told the Post. Detectives plan a press conference for Tuesday morning to identify the person of interest and renew their pleas for tips about the girls' disappearance. They are specifically interested in speaking to anyone who will be able to give them details about the sex offender's whereabouts in the time leading up to and shortly after March 25, 1975, according to the Post. Manhunt: The girls' disappearance spawned a massive search but no trace of the sisters was ever found . Hope: John and Mary Lyon, pictured in 2000, have never given up hope that the case will be solved . Never gave up hope: The National Center of Missing and Exploited Children produce these time-lapse photos a few years ago of what Sheila (left) and Katherine (right) might look like if they are still alive . This 1975 police sketch shows a man who was spotted with the girls at the shopping center . Shelia and Katherine were on spring break when they decided to walk a mile from their home to the nearby Wheaton Plaza shopping center to eat pizza and see the Easter display. They left at 11am. Their mother Mary Lyon told them to be home by 4pm. Mrs Lyon later said that in the quiet Washington suburb, it was common to let children go to the shopping center alone. As the Montgomery County Gazette put it years later - it was a simpler time when everyone looked out for everyone else's children. The massive investigation that followed the girls' disappearance brought in countless tips and widespread national and local media coverage. Potential clues were found, but later discounted. People were brought in for questioning, but later released without charge. Witnesses said they saw an older man in a suit with a briefcase and a tape recorder talking to the girls - though he was never found. However, the tip resulted in a widely-circulated police sketch drawing of a possible suspect. Other witnesses said they saw the girls walking home by themselves. Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. Mr Lyon became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones. The girls' brother, who was 15 at the time they vanished, became a homicide detective when he grew up.

A British journalist has spoken of her shock at being targeted for arrest by the Egyptian government over her coverage of the country's political turmoil. Award-winning reporter Sue Turton is one of 20 people singled out, accused of the trumped up charges of aiding terrorists and spreading false news. She suspects her refusal to promote the government's political agenda in dispatches caused her to fall into the regime's crosshairs. The country have been gripped by civil unrest and protests since former president Mohamed Morsi was toppled by the military and his Muslim Brotherhood party deemed a terrorist organisation. Protest: Reporter Sue Turton, right, and colleagues at Al Jazeera call for the release of journalists held by the Egyptian government and protest over the clampdown on free speech . In a bid to clampdown on the dissent and growing demonstrations, the military-backed Egyptian government has brought in a swathe of laws restricting protest and freedom of speech. Ms Turton told MailOnline: 'Journalists are paying a huge price for daring to report what's really happening on the ground.' 'The Egyptian government no longer entertains any critical voices. The Egyptian domestic media only gives the military backed government's side in TV bulletins and in the press. So any journalist who reports a different perspective is now a target. 'Just two days ago dozens of foreign journalists were arrested and beaten in what the U.S. State Department called a concerted campaign to intimidate the media. And so it continues. Our boys are in prison but so many other journalists are still being targeted.' Frontline: Sue Turton, pictured giving one of her dispatches, says she has been targeted by the Egyptian regime for refusing to promote the government's agenda . Ms Turton, who has worked for Britain's Sky News, ITN and Channel 4 news organisations, continued: 'I have no affiliation to any particular group. I have no gripe with the Egyptian government. 'My stories ranged from pollution in Cairo and TV satire to protests by all sides and coverage of the trial of former President Mohamed Morsi.' Critical: Al Jazeera reporter Sue Turton is wanted by the Egyptian government . The veteran reporter, who has now left Egypt and is currently in Doha, capital city of the state of Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, also said she feared for the fate of two colleagues who are currently languishing in squalid conditions in a Cairo prison. Thousands of the government's critics . have been killed since the military coup deposed, Morsi, Egypt's first . democratically elected, in July, last year. Ms Turton warned the crackdown has already severely hampered the free reporting of events in the country. She . said: 'The immediate impact of these charges and the imprisonment of . our staff is that we have closed down our operation in Egypt completely. No news story is worth being locked up in this way. 'And . it's impossible to operate freely on the streets of Cairo or other . cities in the country. 'When I was there last summer we received a . directive from the Ministry of Information ordering every foreign . journalist and photographer to call in every day and tell the . authorities where they would be working and who they were going to . interview. 'Refusal to do this means journalists can be picked up at any . time and detained for not complying. It's a crude attempt to fully . control all foreign media.' Responding to her inclusion on the list, Turton said she was 'astounded' that a warrant had been issued for her arrest. Former BBC journalist Dominic Kane was also named on the arrest warrant, Al Jazeera said. But the news organisation added that of the 20 people named on the list only nine were Al Jazeera staff. Three . of the employees on the list have been in detention since December 29th . - correspondent Peter Greste and producers Baher Mohamed and Mohamed . Fahmy. Campaign: The arrest and detention of journalists has sparked an outcry among civil rights groups and western governments . Giving an update on their condition, Ms Turton said: 'They are bearing up. All three are now in the same prison cell, a blessing after weeks and weeks in solitary confinement. 'Baher is a gentle guy. I was very worried that he wouldn't be coping on his own so I'm relieved he now has Peter Greste and Mohamed Fahmy to bolster his morale. 'But we are worried about Mohamed Fahmy's health. His shoulder was dislocated before he was arrested and he needs medical attention.' A . journalist from the Al Jazeera Arabic channel, Abdullah Al Shami, has . been in custody since August and is in the third week of a hunger strike . to protest his imprisonment. The Britons who are said to have been arrested have not been identified. If . found guilty at a trial, those arrested could face sentences ranging . from three years for spreading false news to 15 for belonging to a . terrorist group. Prosecutors allege that the 20 journalists set up a media center for the Brotherhood in two suites in a luxury hotel. On Tuesday, the White House called on Egypt's government to release the four journalists still in prison. Outcry: Journalists from the foreign correspondence organisation participate in a protest demanding the release of four Al Jazeera correspondents outside the Egyptian Embassy premises in Kenya's capital Nairobi earlier this month . Call for action: Demonstrators hold placards with pictures of Al-Jazeera Arabic network journalist Abdullah Al Shami who remains in custody in Egypt, during a protest calling for their release, outside Egypt's embassy in London . 'These figures, regardless of affiliation, should be protected and permitted to do their jobs freely in Egypt,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said when asked about their detention. 'We have strongly urged the government to drop these charges and release those journalists and academics who have been detained.' Calls to release the journalists had grown earlier on Tuesday when a social media campaign blossomed after the Foreign Correspondents' Association of East Africa marched on Egypt's embassy in Nairobi - where Greste is based - to protest the jailings.","Egyptian state issued Al Jazeera with a list of 20 wanted people .

Florida has become the latest state to take steps to allow the use of marijuana on prescription, as it's prominent senator Marco Rubio dodged the question of whether he had ever used the drug. The Republican rising star - who is touted as a potential presidential candidate - declined to say whether he had smoked the herb in a direct question at an education forum. 'If I tell you that I haven't, you won't believe me,' said Mr Rubio. 'And if I tell you that I did, then kids will look up to me and say, ""Well, I can smoke marijuana because look how he made it.""' 'If I tell you that I haven't, you won't believe me': U.S Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who represents Florida, speaking at a press conference where he dodged the question of whether he'd ever smoked marijuana . The senator's comments came as Florida's lawmakers introduced identical bills to legalise the use of marijuana for medical purposes. It is hoped that the proposals will be passed before Florida voters decide on a ballot initiative in November to amend the constitution to allow for the change in the law. Jeff Clemens and Joe Saunders, both Democrats in Florida's Senate, brought patients and their families to the unveiling of their bill, which would implement by statute the constitutional amendment on the November ballot. 'This bill puts patients before politics,' said Cathy Jordan of Parrish, president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, who has lived for 28 years with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig Disease. Mrs Jordan, whose speech is slurred by her illness, sat in her wheelchair next to her husband, Robert, who read her statement at a news conference in front of the Senate building. The amendment, and the newly introduced legislation, would specify tight state regulation for doctors to prescribe marijuana for treatment of conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS and other severe afflictions. Green goddess: Mr Rubio's comments came as . Florida lawmakers introduced bills to legalise marijuana for medical . purposes ahead of a November vote to amend the constitutional to allow . for the change in law . Identically worded bills were introduced in both houses of the state legislature yesterday, in an effort to ease their quick passage. The session starting March 4 will mark the fourth year such a bill has been introduced. Prominent Florida Republicans, along with Governor Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi, vigorously oppose a change in the law. Allowing the medical use of marijuana - a move already taken in 20 states and the District of Columbia - has been seen as a first step to ending the ban on recreational use of marijuana. Federal law currently classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it regarded as having a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Nevertheless, Colorado and Washington have both voted to legalise the drug for recreational use under state law. Mr Rubio, one of Florida's two representatives in the U.S. Senate, yesterday insisted that he opposed the legalisation of the recreational use of marijuana. He said like most teenagers he made dumb decisions when he was younger, and he said he didn't need the help of marijuana or alcohol to further that, the Associated Press reported. High times: New Year's Eve revellers smoke marijuana during a Prohibition-era themed party at a bar in Denver celebrating the start of retail pot sales in Colorado after the state decided to legalise the drug . The Florida Supreme Court has already . approved the ballot language on the amendment and it will become law if . 60 per cent of the voters approve it in November. Raiding the cupboards for food is a well-known effect of smoking cannabis. But for years, scientists have been unable to understand why cannabis’ active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), causes such a powerful surge in appetite. Now a European study has revealed that people get ‘the munchies’ after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened. A group of neuroscientists, led by Giovanni Marsicano of the University of Bordeaux, found that in mice, THC fits into receptors in the brain's olfactory bulb. This dramatically increases the creature’s ability to smell food and leading them to eat more of it, they said in a study published in Nature Neuroscience. If the findings hold true for humans, it may help develop treatments for appetite disorders by changing the link between smell and appetite. Polls . show it has a strong chance of success. If the amendment passes, Mr . Saunders said the 2015 Legislature will have to pass implementing . legislation specifying 'how will we grow it, how will people who need it . get access to it and how will those who are seeking to abuse it receive . consequences? While Republican leaders oppose the medical marijuana amendment, a separate bill allowing use of a non-euphoric marijuana extract known as 'Charlotte's Web' is also making progress in the Florida House.

The amendment is seen as a key driver to encourage Democrat voters to turn out at the polls in November. The petition campaign that put it on the ballot was bankrolled by Orlando attorney John Morgan, a close ally of former Governor Charlie Crist, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for another term as governor. Mr Crist supports the amendment and political observers expect the referendum will draw more young and minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic.

'I don't know why this happened': An emotional Brad George appeared in front of television cameras the day of his mother, Georgina Latshaw's death teary and in shock - claiming that he believed the whole thing was a nightmare . A 16-year-old from Washington State has been arrested for battering his mother to death with a dumbbell - one day after he gave an emotional interview questioning who could have done such a thing. Brad George was arrested on Saturday after 37-year-old Georgina Latshaw was found dead in her bedroom on Friday afternoon by police after the Everett teen called 911. He told the responding officers that he had found their apartment front door open when he returned from school and was too scared to go inside. The officers entered the home to find the bloody scene, but quickly found holes in the teen's story and arrested him on Saturday. He now faces charges of first degree murder in an adult court after admitting to police he killed his adoptive mother after suffering a psychotic episode. 'The door was open and her car was home and that never happens,' said George to KIRO TV in what now appears to be a chilling interview given alongside his two sisters on Friday afternoon. 'It is 15 degrees outside and my neighbors says the door has been like that for a while and I thought that was very suspicious. 'So I called the house phone and no one was answering and I called 911.' Scroll Down for Video . Family: Brad George is pictured here holding his two sisters and a friend the day of his mother's death. He has been arrested and charged by police in Everett for brutally battering Georgina Latshaw to death with a dumbbell on Thursday night/Friday morning . Bludgeoned: Georgina Latshaw, 37, had been the legal guardian of Brad George for more than ten years and was killed in her bed by someone wielding a dumbbell - which was found in the trash outside her Washington State home on Friday . 'The police arrived and went upstairs and they came down and told me that my mom had passed away. 'She has supported me my whole life. She always knew what was best for us. I don't know who could have done this. 'This doesn't feel real, this all feels fake.' George told authorities he broke into 37-year-old Georgina Latshaw's room on Thursday night, which had  a security lock and then waited till she was snoring. During questioning he reportedly said that he stopped taking his medications on February 1 and had not slept in three days. He . said he had become concerned on Thursday night that Latshaw was . poisoning him with bleach and in an effort to protect himself decided to . kill her with the dumbbell. Family pictured: Georgina Latshaw (left) and Brad George (right) with his sister on a day out in Everett, Washington . The Everett teen then beat her around the head at least three times before cleaning off the blood from the weight and going to school - after which he phoned police after attempting to make it appear a fatal burglary had occurred. George, who had been in Latshaw's care for ten-years then appeared in front of television cameras to express his shock and grief that anyone could have killed the woman he called 'mom' in such a gruesome fashion. George, 16, was ordered to remain in jail in lieu of $500,000 cash-only bail during a brief hearing on Monday in the juvenile division of Snohomish County Superior Court. According to police, the teen was arrested on Saturday and taken for an evaluation at a psychiatric hospital where he suddenly became catatonic. He then pulled a wooden arm off a chair and walked toward a nurse with his arm raised ready to strike her. Troubled: The teen had suffered psychiatric issues in the past and had run away twice before - the most recent in 2011 (right) and was reportedly not taking his medication before his arrest . He was disarmed by two security guards after the nurse screamed for help. The teen is a currently a student at Overlake Speciality School for troubled children with special needs and has a history of violent outbursts and mental illness. Indeed, George was admitted to Providence Medical Center's Pacific Campus in 2010 after having hallucinations of his mother as a short clown with a blood filled mouth and also having made a sculpture of her with a severed head. Detectives who have interviewed Latshaw's family discovered that George had threatened her at least once before - including one incident that involved a knife. That is why police believe his mother had a security lock on her door. According to law enforcement, George had been having trouble with the medication he was taking to control his mood disorders and the police report said that the teenager had been diagnosed with a form of post-traumatic stress. Police have told the Herald of Everett that because of seriousness of his alleged crime, he will be tried in the adult legal system. Shocking: Brad George and his adoptive mother Georgina Latshaw are pictured here in a day out before the tragic events of Friday afternoon . Law enforcement also believe the killing was premeditated because of the number of steps that George went through to try to cover up his involvement. Upon returning home from school on Friday afternoon, George called 911 to the home he shared with Latshaw and said he had become alerted to the front door lying ajar and his mother's car still being outside. Responding officers found her dead in her bed with blunt-force trauma to the head, according to the police report tiled. Investigators then discovered a purple plastic dumbbell and male clothing stained with blood in the garbage and no sign of forced entry or theft. The apartment was searched with a judgeâ€™s permission and an apparent twin to the purple dumbbell was found in the teenager's bedroom. When they confronted him about the killing, George denied any involvement but was reportedly very nervous and began to shake when questioned about the dumbbell. According to police he admitted the killing on Sunday following his violent outburst towards the nurse on Saturday. He told officers that when he tried to open her door he realized his mother had locked it after recently installing the security bar. He said that he used a coat hanger to disable the bar and then walked in and waited till he heard her snoring and then began striking her.","Brad George, 16, has been arrested for the murder of his 37-year-old mother Georgina Latshaw on Friday .

The former model and actress appeared on ITV's This Morning today to share her experiences and to urge viewers to 'cut menopausal women some slack'. Patsy decided to go back on the show after an appearance last October left many viewers fearing for her health. Frank: Patsy Kensit appeared on ITV's This Morning today to share her experiences of an early menopause - and to reassure other women that 'things do get better' Worries: Patsy decided to go back on the show after an appearance last October (pictured) left many viewers fearing for her health. The actress looked confused as she slurred through her interview - and later blamed the menopause . Speaking to hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in October, she appeared to be rambling and confused - leading some viewers to accuse her of being drunk. At the time, she put her behaviour down to her hormones going haywire and adjusting to hormone replacement therapy. The actress was forced to have an emergency hysterectomy after doctors discovered two tumours in June last year. The 45-year-old, whose mother . Margie lost a 20-year battle with cancer when Patsy was just 24, . admitted the tumours were so big that they made her look as though she . was seven months pregnant. Concern: At the time, Patsy put her erratic behaviour down to her hormones going haywire and adjusting to hormone replacement therapy . Op: Patsy (pictured outside the ITV studios) was forced to have an emergency hysterectomy after doctors discovered two tumours in June last year . That immediately led to the beginning . of her menopause at 45-years old, where then she was given replacement . oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone to take ever since. She told viewers during her interview last October:  'I had to have a . hysterectomy two months ago. I was getting these huge cysts I had one . removed in 2011 and within nine months two huge cysts had come back. 'Now I'm going through full blown menopause. My mouth is dry, I have the sweats. 'No . one talks about it. It's somehow taboo like you're not a woman any . more. Do you lose your lust for life because you've lost your womb? Advice: Patsy with This Morning's resident GP, Dr Chris Steele. The actress urged loved ones of women going through the menopause to 'cut them a bit of slack' Happy: The mother-of-two added: 'I have to say I feel better than prior to the procedure... it's like I've been given a second bite at life' Today, she told Holly and Phillip: '[The menopause] is a taboo subject that has a stigma and people don't want to discuss it.' She explained that her erratic behaviour last year had been due to her trying to get her hormones balanced. She said: 'I only wish I'd been more informed and known more about it. 'At times, my mind just seems to . snap and I lose my train of thought. I’ll go into the supermarket for a . packet of fish fingers and come out with a pair of tights and a cabbage. I’m laughing about it now, but it’s really tough because, aside from . anything else, you’re asking yourself, ""Am I less of a woman now?"" ’ She explained that the morning when she . appeared on the show last October, she had suffered from sickness and had her testosterone cream . 'which I loved' taken off her as she was using too much. Ally: Patsy told hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby: 'If one person sees this and is reassured that they can get through the menopause, then I'm glad I came on' This meant her hormones weren't as balanced as they should have been. Speaking about her symptoms, she said: . 'I've been acting since I was a child, so when that was failing me...[I . knew something was wrong]. She . told viewers: 'this is for women with a dry mouth, or who want a bucket . of water thrown over them [due to hot flushes]: Cut them some slack, . please! She also commented on the injustice of middle age that 'men buy a red sports car and women have to go through this'. She added that part of the problem was that, unlike the U.S., people in the UK don't talk about the menopause. She said: 'That morning, I knew I wasn't feeling myself. I probably should have cancelled, but I had a book coming out and didn't want to let you guys down.' Family: Patsy with sons Lennon (left) and James (right) and as nurse Faye Morton in Holby City .

Many of us have a certain pose for photos, but have you ever noticed your face has a tendency to turn to the right each time? If so, you're not alone. Research of paintings dating back to the 14th century has revealed people prefer to pose showing the left half of their face - and this might be because we consider our left side to be our best side. That's according to science writer and author Sam Kean who claims our left sides are more expressive than our right sides, because they are controlled by the part of our brain responsible for emotions. Research claims people have a natural tendency to pose showing more of the left half of their face. This is because the left-hand side of the body, and face, is controlled by the right-hand side of the brain, responsible for emotions. This in turn makes the left side look more expressive . As well as considering our own left sides to be the most attractive, research from the Wake Forest University in 2012 . found we consider other people to be most attractive when they’re . showing their left side, too. A total of 37 male and female students were asked to rate photos of 10 male and 10 female faces. The original photos, and mirrored versions of the photos, were shown. Photos showing the left sides of faces were rated more ‘pleasant’ than those showing right sides, in both sets of photos. Researchers . claimed this was because a poser’s left cheek tended to exhibit ‘a . greater intensity of emotion’, which is more pleasing to look at. During recent studies of paintings of Jesus on the cross, for example, 90 per cent of the images depicted him showing his left-hand side. While further research into the poses of pupils in yearbooks found a similar trend. According to Kean, author of The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons, the majority of people are hard-wired to believe their left side to be more attractive than their right, and this belief influences their poses for photo. Kean said: 'The best explanation is that we don’t view the left and right halves of people’s faces in the exact same way. 'People have a tendency to be more expressive with one half of the face, than the other half because out brains don’t quite work the same on the left side and the right side' The left side of the brain controls language, for example, while the right side controls spatial awareness and identifying faces. The right side of the brain also controls the left side of the body, making the left side more expressive. Kean . concluded: ‘We think we’re aware of most of what we’re doing, and it’s a . little disconcerting to see this ticks, and these little things emerge, . suddenly.’ Research from . the Department of Psychology at the University of Saskatchewan in . Canada, conducted in 2011, found people prefer looking at art when it is . lit from the left side, too. The trend has also been seen for decades in the poses of pupils in yearbooks, such as this Marine yearbook taken from 1956-1959 . During recent studies of paintings of Jesus on the cross, 90 per cent depicted him showing his left-hand side, including this image by Andra Burian . Called ‘the left-light bias’, participants said paintings with lighting on the left were ‘more aesthetically pleasing’ than when it was lighter on the right side. Yet there is an anomaly when artists create self-portraits. In February last year, Professor Marco Bertamini from Liverpool University wanted to put the right- and left-side bias theories to the test. More than 60% of famous paintings, including this image of Abraham Lincoln by George Healy, have the subject posing with their left side facing the artist . Despite evidence showing people prefer to pose for artists, or photos, with their left side facing the camera, when it comes to self-portraits, artists have traditionally depicted themselves from the right. To test whether this was only apparent in people with artistic training, Professor Bertamini asked non-artists to take selfies using a front-facing camera on their smartphones. Each participant was asked to use the camera to choose their preferred side and take a photo of it. He discovered that the trend followed suit, and the majority of participants took a photo of their right side. Yet this doesn’t rule out the left-hand bias. As Professor Bertamini explained, self-portraits are usually painted through the use of a mirror. This switches the view. For example, if an artist shows their left side to a mirror, and draws what they can see, the final image would show the head facing to the right. On smartphone cameras, the front-facing camera is a mirror that reflects what it is being pointed at. When the picture is saved, it is flipped to appear as if it was taken by another person. The trend to take selfies from the right side results in photos ending up showing the left, hence confirming the theory. Professor Bertamini said: 'Our results demonstrate that a preference for self-portraits showing one’s left side, even if this appears as a right cheek in the mirror-reversed display, can be documented in non-artists. ‘Our results can be interpreted as evidence for two separate factors affecting asymmetries in facial expressiveness, a posing bias due to the position of the mirror and an actual difference between the two sides of the face.’","People have a natural tendency to pose showing the left half of their face .

The Winter Olympics at Sochi appear to being falling somewhat flat, as hardly any spectators turn up and senior officials complain the games have no buzz. Photographs of Olympic venues show that entire banks of seats are practically deserted, while the one or two fans who did struggle out to see the world-class sporting events wrap up against the cold. Embarrassingly, an American member of a top Olympic committee said that many of the Russian spectators were seeing the sports for the first time ever, and behaved without enthusiasm - except when Russian athletes took centre stage. Room for improvement: The majority of seats at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Centre were empty yesterday . All by myself: A woman checks her phone before the start of a speed-skating event held yesterday . Mexican wave, anybody? Senior Olympic figures have spoken out about the lack of atmosphere, as seen here in the sparse crowd at a speed skating event . Anita DeFrantz, a U.S. member who sits on the policy-making executive board, said : 'Here, . people are more reserved. 'There's not a lot of rah-rah, . except for the Russian athletes who get a great reception. 'I think as . time goes on and they get used to it, there will be more excitement. A . lot of people have not seen these sports before.' Gerhard Heiberg, a Norwegian who helped organise the acclaimed 1994 winter games in Lillehammer, called on Sochi's organisers to act over the empty stadiums. Lack of enthusiasm? One senior Olympic organiser claimed that many spectators had never seen the sports before . Sparse: At least this spectator for a downhill skiing race had somewhere to put his bag . Valiant effort: These Russian fans cheer and whoop at the men's biathlon, despite rows of emptiness behind them . It's easy to assume that cold temperatures could be keeping spectators away - but in fact, the Sochi Olympics are starting to feel more like the Summer Games. On Monday, temperatures soared to 61F (16C), forcing skiers to put snow in their racing suits to cool down. The mountain venues are expected to . return to freezing Tuesday, organizers said. But from Wednesday, warmer . weather is in the forecast. Organizers said the temperature could reach 63F (16C) on Thursday. At the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center, organizers canceled the first of three jumps after sunny skies softened the snow in the landing area. To combat the possibility of high temperatures, organizers have been storing large amounts of snow and say they have enough to continue. According to Mr Heiberg, despite the . large volume of empty seats, it was still proving impossible to buy . tickets for the clearly under-subscribed events. He said: 'There are not enough people. 'They . have to see to it they fill the stadiums. 'I understand that . all tickets have been sold and people who want to buy tickets they . cannot buy tickets, so they should do something about this to get school . children, or students or even military people without uniforms out . watching.' Some events, like figure skating, have been packed. Others, like biathlon, have been half-empty. The . men's downhill - considered the marquee event of the Olympic Alpine ski . schedule - failed to draw a full house Sunday, with a turnout of about . 6,000 fans at the 7,500-capacity venue. Alpine . skiing has little tradition in Russia and the games haven't pulled in . the cowbell-ringing crowds familiar in Western Europe. However, some events, such as figure . skating, have had almost entirely Russian crowds. The speedskating venue . was also noted for its boisterousness when the Russians or . Dutch were racing. Embarrassing: Sochi organisers have said they will start calling on volunteers to fill up empty venues . Bleak: Previous Olympics have also had problems with empty stadia . The 2012 summer Olympics in London were also plagued by a lack of spectators for the early events, which many complained was down to an excess of corporate seats which were not used. Sochi organizers said today that they have started calling on volunteers to fill seats at less popular events. Spokeswoman Alexandra Kosterina said some volunteers enrolled in a motivation program are offered tickets to see competition after hours. 'It depends on the events,' she said. 'If we see that there is not a turnout and there are seats available, then, yes, we invite some of the volunteers to join in.'","Photographs reveal sparse crowds at many events .

'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,' the statement read. 'There is no official report from the Coroner's office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.' She was discovered in the bathroom of her home by her fiancé John . Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner's Office told MailOnline. Gone too soon: Nancy Motes, pictured in August (left), died on Sunday from an apparent drug overdose; she is the half-sister of Julia Roberts (right) Family: Roberts with Motes and their mother Betty Lou when the star was filming 1997's My Best Friend's Wedding . She is currently undergoing an autopsy to determine cause of death. Toxicology results will likely take 6-8 weeks to get back. Julia's rep did not return calls to MailOnline. Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee. Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts. In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep.

On top: The actress on the February cover of Vanity Fair, on stands now . The younger sibling had said she was . known as Julia's 'fat little sister' and said the Oscar-winner had . taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery . in June 2012. Roberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of . her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st. She resorted to a £20,000 gastric bypass operation last year. 'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and . very sad,' Motes said. 'When you're in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it's intimidating.' Her other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, . 48, who are also actors. Actress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric. 'I . think that growing up as Pretty Woman's little sister has definitely . made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,' she added. 'A lot . of my life I felt judged for my weight.' Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when . Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman. The actress, who had won a Golden . Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second . for Pretty Woman. Motes, who described herself as an 'awkward' child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of . her 'very pretty and very popular' sister. Thinner: Nancy Motes looked considerably thinner in August 2013 as she grabbed coffee near her home in Santa Monica . New life: Three years ago Nancy, pictured right with Julia, moved back to Los Angeles from Georgia, after meeting her fiancé John Dilbeck. But she claimed Roberts started bullying her about her weight again days after she arrived . She . said: 'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just . let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite . clear to me and in a not so nice manner. 'Julia did not want to see me go . down that path [of acting] … So I just got a lot of criticism from . Julia, which was very discouraging for me.' After . graduating from high school in 1995, Motes auditioned for roles in Hollywood while . working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned . to Georgia.

However, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn't like the groom and didn't want to get stuck paying for the wedding.

Violinist turned Olympic skier Vanessa Mae was today pictured getting to grips with conditions in Sochi after telling of the huge challenges she has overcome to qualify for the Winter Olympics. The world renowned musician, 35, will go toe to toe with the best in the world in the Giant Slalom which is set to take place on Tuesday next week. And she looked quite at ease while sizing up the snow on the slopes earlier today as she watched the Alpine Skiing Women's Super Combined Downhill on day three of the Games. Scroll down for video . On the slopes: Vanessa Mae will compete in the Giant Slalom on Tuesday, next week, but got some time on the slopes to get comfortable with the conditions . However, she told a press conference earlier that she held out no hope of getting anywhere near the medals. Instead she spoke of her pride at simply being in the same . competition as some of the sport's greats. She said: 'I have to say that the greats are here. I'm not here to compete against the best, I'm here to participate with the best. That's the real Olympic spirit and message of this movement. Miss Mae has been skiing since she was four years of age but only started training for the Olympics six months ago . She added: 'I had this idea a couple of years ago, but the real training started six months ago. 'So for me this is an enormous challenge in such a short amount of time to have reached the qualifying level.' Getting to grips: Vanessa Mae of Thailand attends the Alpine Skiing Women's Super Combined Downhill on day three of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics . She qualified for Sochi after meeting the criteria on her on her last possible chance. Thailand . were able to send one person in the skiing if they met the qualifying . standard, and despite her position as the world No 3,16. Miss Mae is British, but is allowed to compete for Thailand because of her father. Her transition from musical prodigy to Olympian has already become one of the stories of the Games so far. She . has spoken of how aiming for the Olympics has helped heal a rift with . her father which had last 10 years. But despite her amazing achievement, her estranged mother Pamela had not . bothered to contact her when she qualified for the competition. Miss . Mae, who will compete as Vanessa Vanakorn following her emotional . reunion with her Thai father, Varapong Vanakorn, told the Mail on Sunday . that her mother had not encouraged her to ski. Talent: Mae has been skiing since she was four but only started training for the Olympics six months ago . She recalled: ‘I gave up horse riding as a child because my mother didn’t like me doing anything that was dangerous. ‘It wasn’t a big sacrifice as music was more important to me. I was honestly not rebellious as a child – except when it came to skiing. ‘My mother introduced me to skiing but when the violin became a big part of my life she didn’t want me to doing something she thought could be dangerous.’ Pamela has not spoken to her daughter since she removed her as her manager when Vanessa turned 21. Passions: Former child prodigy Vanessa Mae has sold millions of copies of her albums but is now indulging her second love of skiing . ‘Unfortunately, relationships can be sometimes transient,’ says Miss Mae. ‘I accept that if I wasn’t pushed as a child I wouldn’t have achieved a quarter of things I have achieved until now.' She became a citizen of Thailand in 2011 to ensure she could compete for her father’s country – and it was through this that the pair became close once more. ‘I didn’t speak to my dad for ten years,’ says Miss Mae. ‘We just grew apart when he went back to Thailand. He was a monk for ten years, but he is now back doing what he does best – management.’ The former child prodigy has sold millions of copies of her albums and she was the wealthiest young entertainer in the United Kingdom in 2006.","Vanessa Mae will compete in the giant slalom event in Sochi .

Twenty-first century Whitehall has Letwin and Heywood. There they sat at a select committee, these two pillars of political consensus, these two gummer-uppers of the works. Oliver Letwin is a Cabinet Office Minister. Sir Jeremy Heywood is the Cabinet Secretary. They were talking to the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee about fixed-term parliaments. This committee is a stodgy pudding. Its chairman, mono-drone Graham Allen (Lab, Nottingham N), is devoted to the notion of responsible – not the same as responsive – government. Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin (left) and Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, talked to the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee about fixed-term parliaments yesterday . Notices announced that the committee is ‘piloting paperless working’; yet documents were strewn here and there. As with much in Whitehall, paperless working is a work in progress. Chris Ruane (Lab, Vale of Clwyd) let slip that his Newport colleague Paul Flynn had described Messrs Letwin and Heywood as ‘a politician who wants to be a civil servant and a civil servant who wants to be a politician’. Ha! Mr Letwin, who may have stepped straight from Restoration comedy, responded with an ‘egad, how droll, sir’ face. Sir Jeremy’s delight was less evident. Close-mown hairdo, rimless Herr Flick spectacles, pale, petite hands: it is a look that manages to be both antiseptic and diseased. You might not want Sir Jeremy to be your anaesthetist. Fixed-term parliaments, they thought, were marvellous. We heard much of ‘stability’ and ‘good order’. Fixed terms allowed for ‘planning’. The machine of government loves fixed terms. Mr Letwin is now so intellectual that he may not even carry his own A4 folder. He was accompanied by a flunkey who ferried it for him. The fellow wore a tie with a motif of white elephants. No one on the committee bridled at fixed-term parliaments. No one made the point, ‘hang on, fixed terms are profoundly unparliamentary for they prevent MPs voting a Government out of office’. Paul Flynn (pictured) had described Messrs Letwin and Heywood as 'a politician who wants to be a civil servant and a civil servant who wants to be a politician' Mr Letwin (whose voice is now indistinguishable from that of the late Nigel Hawthorne, who played Sir Humphry in ‘Yes Minister’) was able to get away with the blithe insistence ‘I’m a real believer in democracy’ quite unmocked. A vote of no confidence in the House was once enough to topple a prime minister. How fares that principle in fixed-term parliaments? Christopher Chope (Christchurch) wondered if Ukip should be admitted to the arrangement whereby Opposition parties have access to civil servants just before a general election. Quite why Mr Chope, a Tory, was pressing this argument, is not clear. Is he about to defect? After Nigel Farage’s peculiar, sub-National Front remarks about feeling like a foreigner on English trains, one hopes the decent Mr Chope might be better than that. After Nigel Farage's peculiar, sub-National Front remarks about feeling like a foreigner on English trains, one hopes the decent Christopher Chope might be better than that . At mention of Ukip and its baleful Vikings, Mr Letwin whinneyed. Sir Jeremy, the cold-blooded goldfish, just blanked the suggestion,  saying he was ‘doubtful but no decision has been taken’. From  Sir Jeremy’s lean lips, the word ‘doubtful’ sounds as chill as Capt Birdseye’s codpiece. The prospect of mixing with the Official Opposition immediately before an election was more to Sir Jeremy’s liking. A ghostly enthusiasm almost broke through the wintry mask. The process, he explained, ‘allows the politicians to inform the civil service of issues they may not want to make public’. Ye blasted gods, was there ever a more succinct expression of the anti-democratic nature of this sinister, sovereignty-fleecing flesh-pimpler Heywood? What is the point of a general election campaign if politicians do not tell voters their intentions? Yet here was Sir Jeremy, oozing satisfaction that his Whitehall lever pullers, the consensus wallahs, the stiffers and fixers, should know things the electorate must not be told. In other news, the Crimea got to have a vote on whether or not to join Europe. Lucky devils. Oh, and it was International  Women’s Day. A special debate was held in Westminster Hall. MPs made references to it. The House of Lords went almost entirely mad about it, cutting the men out  of question time. The politics of patronising gestures.","Light entertainment had Morecambe and Wise. Nineteenth century homicide had Burke and Hare.

The England Women's football captain has spoken publicly for the first time about being gay after being delighted by the positive reaction to Olympic diver Tom Daley's announcement he was in a relationship with a man. Arsenal defender Casey Stoney, who has 116 caps for England, said she has never hidden her sexuality in football circles because it is 'accepted'. She slammed the decision to award Russia the Winter Olympics and football World Cup, branding Vladimir Putin 'uneducated' over his comment that gays were welcome so long as they 'don't go near the children'. Revelations: The England Women's football captain Casey Stoney said she has never hidden her sexuality in football circles because it is 'accepted' Stoney decided to break silence following Tom Daley's announcement and that of former . Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger who recently came out as gay. She said she hopes to make it easier for more people to come out and that revelations . about a person's sexuality will eventually not be seen as important. She . told BBC Sport: 'I feel it's really important for me to speak out as a . gay player because there are so many young people struggling with being . gay'. Speaking out: England women's captain Casey Stoney insists her sexuality is accepted in football . Stuck in: Stoney, capped 116 times by her country, hopes future revelations won't be regarded as important . 'You hear about people taking their own . lives because they're homosexual, now that should never happen. They . should never feel those pressures. 'How can I expect other people to come out and speak about themselves if I'm not willing to do that myself? 'Now is the time because I'm in a loving relationship where I feel strong, I feel safe and I don't care what other people think any more.' Helping hand: Stoney says Tom Daley's announcement was positive for sport, as was Thomas Hitzlsperger (R) Stoney's sexuality was not a secret . within the game and she is now hoping that the wider world will become . more accepting of gay athletes. 'I've never hidden it within football circles because it is accepted,' she said. 'Uneducated': Stoney slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin over his comment that gays should not go near children . 'But to the outside world where I've . been employed or I've gone to meals and I've gone and met people, I've . never spoken about my sexuality.' The 31-year-old said: 'If I can help other people in some way shape or form feel more comfortable or feel at ease with themselves then this is what this is all about, this is the bigger picture. 'I looked at the response that Tom Daley got and the incredible positive response that he got and I thought ""wow, the world is changing"" and it's time for me to stand up and tell my side of the story.' Meanwhile, Stoney has slammed FIFA’s decision to hold World Cups in Russia and Qatar. She said it was ‘incredible’ the countries will host the tournament in 2018 and 2022 despite their attitudes towards homosexuality. Stoney added: ‘ I can’t imagine how frightened gay people must feel going out there and competing. ‘I won’t be going to Russia or Qatar to watch a World Cup because I wouldn’t be accepted there. 'It seriously worries me. It’s about educating the people at the top, all the way down. 'When Russian President Vladimir Putin says that gay people can come over but please don't go near the children, what sort of message is that sending if he is that uneducated and he's ruling that country? It seriously worries me.'","England Women's captain speaks out over her sexuality for first time .

Evidence from Colorado gunman James Holmes' cellphone - including eerie selfies he took just hours before the shooting spree - can be used by the prosecution, a judge has ruled. The images were taken by Holmes before he allegedly opened fire on a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado during a screening of the Dark Knight in 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70 more. Among the photos, which have only been shown in court, is one of Holmes wearing black contact lenses and a black stocking cap, with two tufts of his orange-dyed hair sticking out like horns. In another, he held a pistol beneath his . face and grinned at the lens. A third showed an assault rifle and . shotgun, magazines for ammunition, tactical gear and bags to carry . rounds arrayed on a bed. Locked up: James Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 others in shooting in Aurora, Colorado in July 2012 took eerie selfies in the hours before the massacre. A judge ruled these can be used prosecutors . Police have testified the photos were . taken about six hours before the July 20, 2012, shootings. Investigators said they also found pictures on his iPhone of movie theater doors taken up to three weeks before the attack, as part of his possible planning, the Denver Post reported. The ruling, which was made public on Monday, also allows for evidence found in Holmes' iPod, computers, emails and bank records to be used by prosecutors. Defense attorneys had argued the . warrant used to seize the phone was over-broad and unconstitutional . because it failed to be specific enough. Creepy: A court sketch shows one of the photos found on Holmes' iPhone. In the photograph, he was wearing a black stocking cap with two tufts of hair sticking out and black contact lenses . Allowed in court: In another image, he held a pistol beneath his face as he looked at the camera . But the judge disagreed and rejected eight defense motions to suppress the evidence. '[N]o date range could have been justified,' Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. wrote in the ruling. 'Officers . realized that these were no impromptu crimes; extensive planning and . preparation had obviously gone into the shooting and the booby-trapping . of the apartment. 'But they . had no way of knowing whether it had taken months, a year, two years, or . longer to complete such planning and preparation.' Holmes, a 26-year-old former . neuroscience graduate student, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity . to more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder. His . attorneys have acknowledged he was the shooter but said he was in the . grip of a psychotic episode. The case now hinges on whether he was . insane. Selfies: These images - which are not part of the contested evidence - were shared on a website, Adult Friend Finder, ahead of the attack that claimed the lives of 12 people and injured 70 others . Scene: Prosecutors are also permitted to use evidence found on his computer, which was found during a search of his apartment (above). The defense had claimed the evidence was gathered unconstitutionally . Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes' trial date is up in the air while both sides work their way through dozens of pretrial motions. As dramatic as the cellphone photos are, they will likely be less important to the outcome of the case than a mandatory sanity evaluation that Holmes underwent at the state mental hospital last month. The verdict on Holmes' sanity is up to the jury, and the evaluation will be a key piece of evidence. The critical conclusions of the evaluation have not been made public, but prosecutors have asked for another by their own experts, saying the doctor who conducted the first one was biased. Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. has not said when he will rule on the request. He held a four-day hearing on the issue last month that was closed to the public and reporters.

A woman whose five-day-old son was snatched from her home defended the half-sister now charged with kidnapping him, telling police: 'She wouldn't take my son!' Authorities have released the tearful 911 call made by 18-year-old Brianna Marshall after her son Kayden Powell vanished overnight on Thursday from her home in Beloit, Wisconsin. Prosecutors say her half-sister Kristen Smith was found with baby clothes and prosthetic pregnancy belly in her car - and had pretended to be pregnant. Scroll down for video and to listen to the 911 call . Snatched: Kristen Smith, 31 (left) has been charged with kidnapping her five-day-old nephew Kayden Powell (right) from her half-sister's home. Prosecutors say she claimed it was her who gave birth and had a fake belly . Reunited: Brianna Marshall and Bruce Powell, pictured shortly after Kayden's birth, are back with their son . Smith, 31, was arrested when police stopped her at a gas station 170 miles away in West Branch, Iowa, apparently driving back to her home in Colorado. Some 29 hours later a police chief discovered newborn Kayden, crying and wrapped in blankets in a nearby plastic storage bin. He was alive and well despite having been left in freezing temperatures. The newly-released 911 call reveals Brianna sprung to her half-sister's defence when the operator suggested she could be a suspect - despite Brianna waking up and finding Smith and the baby gone. 'My son is missing,' she told the operator through tears. 'He's like four days old... I put him to sleep in his crib and now he’s not there.' Saved: Kayden Powell, pictured after he was found, has been reunited with his parents . On the trail: A map shows the house Kayden was kidnapped from  and where he was later found . Freezing: There was snow on the ground as Kayden lay in a bin at this gas station for up to 29 hours . A friend or relative of Brianna then took the phone and told the operator: 'Her sister was here earlier. Her sister’s gone and the baby’s gone.' Brianna took the phone back and added: 'I called her, and she's balling her eyes out and told me to call the cops.' Brianna: My son is missing. Dispatch: How old is your son? Brianna: (crying) He’s like four days old. Dispatch: He’s what? Brianna: He’s four days old. Dispatch: Four days old? Brianna: Yes. Dispatch: Okay, was there forced entry into your home or where was your son? Brianna: He was in his bassinet [crib]. Dispatch: Okay, who else is in the home? Brianna: Me and my grandma, my boyfriend, and my uncle. Dispatch: Okay, and no one has seen the baby? Brianna: (crying) I put him to sleep in his crib and now he’s not there. (later) Friend: Her sister was here earlier. Her sister’s gone and the baby’s gone. Dispatch: Okay was the sister there when she laid the baby down at 1:30am? Friend: Yes. Dispatch: Okay, so the possible suspect is her sister? Friend: Yeah. Ain’t nobody else been here. (later) Dispatch: And you already talked to Kristen? Brianna: Yes I called her and she’s balling her eyes out and told me to call the cops. Dispatch: Okay, and she’s claiming she doesn’t have the kid, correct? Brianna: No, she wouldn’t take my son! Dispatch: Okay, alright. Is she going to be turning around and comingback to the house? Brianna: Most likely. Dispatch: Okay, I’ve got officers pulling up, have everyone not touch anything, okay? Wait for the officers to get inside the house. Okay? Brianna: (crying) The dispatcher replied: 'But she's claiming she doesn't have the kid, correct?' A tearful Brianna said: 'No, she wouldn’t take my son!' Authorities released the nine-minute recording after Smith was charged with kidnapping. She was originally held on an unrelated fraud warrant. Smith, 31, is being held in her own cell at the Cedar County jail in Tipton, Iowa, while she awaits transfer to federal custody to face the kidnapping charge. Cedar County Sheriff Warren Wethington said: 'I don't feel comfortable putting her in with the general population due to the circumstances and media coverage other inmates would have seen. 'Some of the inmates over there are mothers, sisters, nieces and aunts. I don't think it would be in the interest for her safety.' The FBI alleges Smith took the boy from her half-sister's home in southern Wisconsin before 4.30am on Thursday, five days after Kayden was born, and began driving to Colorado. After Marshall discovered the baby was missing and called police, an officer reached Smith on her phone while she was passing through Iowa and instructed her to stop for questioning. An officer who met Smith at a gas station in West Branch, Iowa, found no sign of Kayden. Smith repeatedly denied any connection to the disappearance, but she was taken into custody on a warrant from Texas charging her with tampering with government records and fraud. About 29 hours later, the police chief found Kayden, who was reunited with his parents at an Iowa hospital. He has since been discharged in good condition. After the discovery, the FBI claimed Smith admitted that she took the baby and put him there. Investigators said they found online communications in which she falsely claimed to be pregnant or have given birth and a prosthetic pregnancy belly in her car. Smith has an extradition hearing scheduled this Friday on the Texas charge, but authorities said they believe her next move will be to Wisconsin because the federal case will be awarded higher priority. Cedar County Attorney Jeffrey Renander said Smith was 'not going anywhere' until federal prosecutors obtain an indictment for the kidnapping charge, possibly next week. West Branch Police Chief Mike Horihan described the case to ABC7 as 'unique'. 'I . have been in law enforcement for a while and nothing ever surprises me. But it's very unique and very special and I'm just glad everything . seems to be fine,' he said. Discovery: Kayden was found wrapped in blankets and placed in a bag at this Iowa gas station .

I grew up with Baywatch and I was . captivated by her [Pamela Anderson's] look,' explains Carolyn. 'She's like an iconic cartoon . character in human form.' Her mission to look more like the star began at the age of 14, when she dyed her hair blonde and a throwaway comment from her father kickstarted what would become an enduring obsession. 'I dyed my hair blonde and he said: ""oh . you don't half look like Pamela Anderson with your hair that colour"",' she remembers. 'And from there, a lot of other people seemed to start saying it.' Her first surgery swiftly followed, although as Carolyn admits, her quest to become the Scouse Pamela Anderson hasn't always gone smoothly. 'I had my first boob job was when I was 20 just . to make me feel more confident but unfortunately, it went wrong. 'I realised after a . couple of months that they weren't placed right and one started to go hard.' But instead of seeing the doctor, Carolyn ignored the issue and continued to spend plenty of time on the sunbed - with disastrous consequences. 'I was addicted to having a Pammie style tan,' she confesses. 'At the height of my sunbed use, I . would be on it four times a week for up to 16 minutes. At times, my skin would feel . red raw.' The best: Carolyn says she's also an improvement on the original by virtue of being from Liverpool . Inspiration: Pamela Anderson, pictured with Alexandra Paul and David Charvet, in her Baywatch heyday . 'Pushing 40': The 46-year-old actress pictured at a Haiti charity benefit in LA last month . For her breasts, already delicate and dotted with scar tissue because of the implants, the excessive sunbed use proved enormously damaging. 'I started to see abrasions on one side of the breast and the . skin was raw. I could see the implant showing on the outside - it had become badly infected.' She continues: 'I . had complications on my left breast. It was infected from the inside . out so I had to have the implant removed. 'For three months, I walked around with . only one breast implant. It was very strange to me because it was . something I'd never felt before. It was was very embarrassing the first . time it happened. 'You don't want to date someone because you're . basically walking round with one breast.' Eventually, the infection spread to the right breast as well and she was forced to have the other implant removed. 'I . had to have an operation to remove it, operation to drain it and operation to put it back in... I . had around eight operations in total.' But despite the complications, Carolyn says she's still not satisfied. 'I'd like to go a size or two up,' she admits. 'Then I'd . be happy to maintain that look.' 'It's a . full time job to keep looking this good,' she adds. 'To be this obsessed with one's . appearance would seem extreme but I am willing to do what ever it takes . to maintain that character. Scouse Pammie: Carolyn uses her blonde bombshell looks to help her in her career as a Pamela impersonator . On the job: Carolyn in her Pamela Anderson get-up during a paid appearance at a party . 'It's like, I'm the real Pamela Anderson - . that's what it feels like anyway.' Despite her efforts, she admits she's rarely confused with her idol, although she blames that on Pamela's age. 'I don't think I'll ever be mistaken . for the real Pamela Anderson. I think its a compliment to the real . Pamela Anderson that she looks like me know, because she's pushing 40! Smiling, she concludes: 'I'm the world's best Pamela Anderson lookalike but I'm one better because I'm the Scouse version.' The real Pamela Anderson might have something to say about that.

The incredible sounds are the work of Ice Music, a Swedish orchestra from the town of Luleå, who have taken the concept of being ‘cool’ literally. That’s because their instruments - including guitars, violins, cellos and even xylophones - are all hand-carved out of ice sheets. Scroll down for video... Swedish musical group 'Ice Music' work with instruments made almost entirely out of sheets of ice . Different bands show up to use the icy instruments which were all crafted by ice connoisseur Tim Leonhard. Mr Linhart said he creates the ‘ICEstruments’ by hand before adding strings, fret boards and other parts to his designs. The songs are performed inside an igloo-like concert hall, which is also covered in ice, and seats around 170 people.

Different bands show up to use the icy instruments which were all crafted by ice connoisseur Tim Leonhard . All the instruments stay in tune, as long as the temperature stays cold enough . This isn't the first time someone has tried to make instruments out of ice . Terje Isungset from Bergen in Norway became known as the Iceman after he started making music with instruments carved out of blocks of ice drawn from a nearby lake. His amazing frozen creations include harps, trumpets, horns, guitars, marimbas and even a iceridoo - a frozen version of the Australian didgeridoo. Mr Isungset claims every instrument he makes has a unique sound and while one ice horn he created was used for 50 performances many only last for a single session. Both the instruments and the concert hall are lit up in colours representing the northern lights. The video, showing the local band Whiteroom covering Avicii’s ‘Hey Brother’, reveals the impressive sound that a few slabs of frozen water and some strings can make. What's amazing is that all the instruments stay in tune, as long as the temperature stays at -10°C. According to Mr Linhart, the instruments have to be re-tuned after every performance as the breath of the musicians partly melts them. For this reason, the violins are suspended from the ceiling so that the musicians body temperature doesn't melt them. 53-year-old Mr Linhart arrived in Luleå a decade ago from New Mexico. He helped build one of the world's first ice hotels, but claims music is his real passion. ‘My personal interest in this is to make it real music, not just clinking and dinking on a bunch of hanging ice cubes,’ he told CNN in an interview. Mr Linhard claims that because Ice is stiffer, it picks up all the vibrations, making the listener's hair stand on end. 'You might think the sound on a normal instrument is perfectly . clear--until you hear an ice instrument and go, ""Ah ha!"" The clarity is . crystal,' he said.

When sportscaster Bob Costas appeared on air to cover the Sochi Olympics with a swollen left eye last week, his assistant said it was a 'minor infection which should resolve itself by the weekend' Well, the weekend has come and gone and the pinkeye is only getting worse - having now spread to both eyes. On Tuesday, he spoke on Today, saying he was going to take the night off to heal since he can barely see. Scroll down for video . Poor Bob: The pink eye in the sportscaster's left eye spread to both eyes by Monday night of Olympic coverage. He announced he would be taking Tuesday night off . Sore: Costas, pictured left last Thursday without his glasses, said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red . 'as the Soviet flag' 'I might as well be playing Marco Polo, I have no idea where I am,' Costas said. Today anchor Matt Lauer will fill in for Costas tonight. His infection was so bad he broke the news to the Today show crew over the phone, even though he could have appeared in person since they're broadcasting live from Sochi. Costas last appeared on air Monday night during NBC's late night coverage of the Olympics, hosted by Mary Carillo. Carillo had just done a package on vodka production in Russia, and Costas came out to take a shot with the former tennis player. Before clinking their classes, Costas joked: 'My eyes can't get any redder. No matter what I do.' Easing the pain: The broadcaster was last on air late Monday night when he took shots of vodka with Mary Carillo . 'Tomorrow morning I'll be lying on a curb in Minsk,' Costas added after taking a swig of the hard alcohol. The two joked that it was the 'Kathie and Hoda' portion of the show - poking fun at the Today co-hosts who drink wine during their fourth hour show. Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb responded this morning by taking sympathy shots for Costas as he heels. Apparently Hoda was told that the shots were actually water, and gasped in surprise when she downed the shot only to realize it was real alcohol. Here's to you! Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford took sympathy shots for Costas Tuesday morning . Costas contracted the eye infection in Russia, before the start of the Olympics. Costas hasn't publicly stated what kind of infection he's suffering from, but it seems to be a case of pinkeye. Also known as Conjunctivitis, pinkeye is an infection of the mucus membrane that lines the eyelid - causing the eyes to become red and inflamed. Pinkeye is most commonly contracted from a virus which can spread through person to person contact or contaminated water. Doctors suggest thorough hand-washing as the best way to prevent getting the infection. Conjunctivitis can also be caused by bacteria, lack of tears, chemicals or allergies. It is not a serious infection and usually clears up within 7 to 10 days. While bacterial pinkeye can be treated with antibiotic eye drops, ointment or pills - viral pinkeye usually doesn't have a specific treatment. Costas' left eye was decidedly red, watery and swollen behind glasses as he took to the air last Thursday night. During the broadcast, he addressed his new look. 'Bear with me for a moment as I spare my . friends in the press office countless inquiries,' he said. 'I have no choice to go . all Peabody and Sherman on you for the next couple of nights since I . woke up this morning with my left eye swollen shut and just about as red . as the old Soviet flag. 'According to the NBC doctors here, it's some . kind of minor infection which should resolve itself by the weekend. If . only all my issues would resolve themselves that quickly, but that's . another story.' His assistant added to Deadspin that the infection has left it impossible for Costas to wear contact lenses. Following the primetime broadcast, the . eye became a trending topic on Twitter, spawning numerous jokes and . even a parody account. Some users poked fun at the disasters that already unfolded before the opening ceremony even began. 'Bob Costas left eye will eat his right one if he keeps drinking that Sochi water,' one quipped.

French President Francois Hollande is going stag, but the Obama administration is pulling out all the stops to entertain him with a State Dinner full of pomp, circumstance, gourmet eats, and R&B music. The Bronx singer, rapper and record producer Mary J. Blige will perform after the meal, the White House announced Monday. L'affaire américaine will take place outdoors, in a tent on the South Lawn. Secret Service will have extra protection arrayed along the perimeter of the White House property. Under the tent, White House Executive Chef Cris Comerford will serve up the best of America, with a noted nod to the French. 'This event highlights the talents of our Nation’s cheese artisans,' the printed program says. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . False advertising? The White House laid out some place settings in the ornate State Dining Room for press photographers to see, but the State Dinner will be held outside under a giant white tent . It's a salad, not a fishbowl: White House Executive Chef Cris Comerford holds the 'Winter Garden Salad' he'll offer guests Tuesday night at the State Dinner in honor of French President Francois Hollande -- a combination of mixed radishes, baby carrots, merlot lettuce and red wine vinaigrette . White House Executive Pastry Chef William Yosses holds a dessert tray  including maple fudge, biscuits and cotton candy -- the after-dinner treats for Tuesday night . Entertainment: Mary J. Blige probably won't perform her smash hit 'Family Affair' for the newly single French premier . Deputy US Chief of Protocol Natalie Jones, not the former French first lady, accompanied Hollande for his first steps on U.S. soil this week -- he's without both long-time girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler and more recent mistress Julie Gayet . And the first course will be caviar – although not the Russian kind that might cast a favorable light on President Vladimir Putin. Hollande and a hush-hush guest list will dine on American Osetra, grown in Illinois estuaries. A winter garden salad of mixed radish and baby carrots served on merlot lettuce ''pays tribute to The First Lady’s White House Kitchen Garden,' according to the program, but the White House stopped short of saying the veggies actually came from Mrs. Obama's garden. Also on offer will be quail eggs from Pennsylvania, twelve separate varieties of potatoes from three states, dry-aged ribeye steaks, a chocolate malted layer cake with vanilla ice cream, fudge made from Vermont maple syrup, lavender shortbread cookies and orange-zest cotton candy. Wines on the table will be from California's Napa Valley, and from Washington state and Virginia. The Thibaut-Jannison 'Blanc de Chardonnay' is made near Monticello, the home of the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson. Hollande and President Barack Obama made a joint visit to the estate on Monday. The multiple Grammy-winner Mary J. Blige, shown at a Super Bowl party, will entertain the French president and his entourage, but there's been no word on whether Hollande is a fan of American R&B . President Barack Obama welcomed Hollande to the U.S. at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Monday, prior to a visit to the Thomas Jefferson estate at Monticello, Virginia . News of Hollande's split from his partner Valeria Trierweiler sent shock waves through France, but the president's reputation got a boost when his affair was made public . The other woman: Film actress Julie Gayet . The French president's official visit on Tuesday marks his first journey to America since he split from his long-time girlfriend, the former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler, after news surfaced of his affair with actress Julie Gayet. His popularity in his country soared after the dalliance as revealed. Like Mrs. Obama's recent 50th birthday party, the soiree won't include any dancing – a move certain to quell any fears of embarrassing Hollande sans date. Hollande and Obama will have a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday, followed by a press conference. The State Dinner will be served on rented China. 18 years in coming: The last French leader who made a State Visit to the U.S. was Valery Giscard d'Estaing (L), who brought his wife Anne-Aymone Sauvage de Brantes (2nd R) to visit President Gerald Ford and first lady Betty Ford at the White House in 1976 .","France's president has arrived 'stag' after splitting from his longtime girlfriend, following an affair with an actress .

George Jacobs, who was Frank Sinatra's valet and confidant for 15 years, has died. Jacobs' son, Snake Jagger, says his father died of natural causes in Palm Springs Saturday night. He was 87. Jacobs was working for Hollywood dealmaker Irving 'Swifty' Lazar in 1953 when Sinatra hired and entrusted him with his personal affairs. Mr S: Jacobs (pictured with Sinatra) was the valet and confidant of Frank Sinatra between 1953 and 1968 . Jacobs' 2003 book, 'Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra,' gives an insider's look into the crooner's life, his women and his dealings with the Kennedys, the Rat Pack and the mob. Jacobs said he was fired after the gossip columns reported about him dancing at a nightclub with Sinatra's then-wife, Mia Farrow. His book begins, 'Summer 1968. The only man in America who was less interested than me in sleeping with Mia Farrow was her husband and my boss, Frank Sinatra.' Rumors of an affair with Farrow caused Sinatra to cut Jacobs off after 15 years in his service. It's a fascinating insight into the . life and times of the Chairman of the Board that dishes on Sinatra's . first wife Ava Gardner, who had a drinking problem, JFK whose ambition . was 'to f*** every actress in Hollywood,' Marilyn Monroe's lack of . personal hygiene, and of course, Ol' Blue Eyes himself. When . a gossip columnist reported that Jacobs was dancing with Sinatra's . much-younger wife Mia Farrow - whom he was in the process of divorcing - . Sinatra's wrath was quick and decisive. He fired Jacobs within 24 hours. It would be 10 years before Jacobs clapped eyes on his former boss again. The New York Times interviewed Jacobs when his memoir was released in 2003. Of . the meeting, he said, 'It's hard to talk about it. I took one look at . him and broke down into tears. I couldn't stop crying. Mr. S put his arm . around me. ""Forget about it, kid,"" he said. ""It isn't so bad.""' And . although Jacobs kept crying, Sinatra left. Last dance: Sinatra and Mia Farrow (seen here on their wedding day) were divorcing when George Jacobs danced with her and was fired by Sinatra . 'It was such a shock, it tore me apart. You have to understand, I spent 24 hours a day with him. I washed his underwear by hand on the road, I carried everything to take care of him, and it ended in such a miserable way. The way it was supposed to be, I guess. That was his way,' he said. Two of his marriages ended while he worked 24 hours a day for Sinatra. After Sinatra fired him, Jacobs worked for Steve McQueen, George Hamilton and Bill Cosby, but he never lived in with any employer again. He took off for Europe and traveled for three years, then returned and got into show business himself, briefly, appearing on The Dating Game and The Gong Show. Jacobs eventually took up carpentry and moved to Van Nys, California. He married and divorced a third time and has eight children, three of whom precede him in death. When Sinatra died in 1998, Jacobs was cut from the funeral guest list by his third wife Barbara Marx. Despite Ol' Blue Eyes' temper tantrums, Jacobs wrote that his boss treated him well.","George Jacobs, 87, died in Palm Springs Saturday night .

A Highway Patrol trooper who caught another officer speeding to an off-duty job at 120mph is suing for more than $500,000 - saying his allies harassed her after he was fired. Florida's Donna Jane Watts made national headlines after handcuffing Miami Police Department officer Fausto Lopez, while he was in full uniform and driving a police car. Since the incident in 2011 she claims she has had threatening calls on her cell phone, police cars idling outside her house and fellow officers accessing her private driver's license information. Ms Watts - who is suing more than 25 police agencies - said she is even afraid to open her mailbox. Other calls included prank calls and orders for pizza, she claimed. In a lawsuit she said law enforcement officers had long been known to band together and protect each other, but her case took things too far. According to her lawyer, she suspected her private driver's license information was being accessed by fellow officers, so she made a public records request with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. It allegedly showed at least 88 law enforcement officers from 25 different agencies accessed Watts' driver's license information more than 200 times - in just three months. Ms Watts is suing those police agencies and the individual officers under the federal Driver Privacy Protection Act, a 1994 law that provides for a penalty of $2,500 for each violation if the information was improperly accessed. Watts' attorney, Mirta Desir, said it was clear most of the officers had no legitimate reason to look up her data. If all the searches were found illegal, Watts could receive more than $500,000. 'Ultimately what it comes down to is a violation of privacy,' Ms Desir added. 'It wasn't for any legitimate purpose on the part of the police officers and it was done by people in a position of trust.' Scroll down for video . Arrest: Footage from Ms Watts' patrol car showed her handcuffing Miami officer Fausto Lopez - who was in full uniform and driving his police car to an off-duty job. He was later fired and she says his allies turned on her . According to court documents, most of . the individual officers named in Watts' lawsuit did face some . disciplinary action, usually a written reprimand. But lawyers for the agencies have asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that under the U.S. Constitution, Congress cannot hold police officers liable for merely accessing the information - only if they try to sell it. Some of the officers say they had a legitimate reason. A lawyer for fellow state Trooper Andrew Cobb said he accessed Watts' information after 'hearing rumors that other troopers were threatening' her, and that his actions were done 'out of concern for a fellow trooper' and as 'a matter of public safety.' The challenge by some Florida police agencies to the driver's license law has drawn the attention of the U.S. Justice Department, which is defending its constitutionality. 'There is value in drivers' information and a market for it,' Justice Department lawyers said in court papers. 'What the defendants fail to recognize is that there is value in drivers' information whether or not it is actually sold.' Ms Watts was on a routine patrol early in the morning in October 2011 . when a Lopez's car whizzed past at speeds that would eventually top . 120 mph. Even with her blue lights flashing and siren blaring, it took her more than seven minutes to pull him over. Not . certain who was behind the wheel, she approached the car warily, with her . gun drawn, according to video from her cruiser's dashboard camera - yelling: 'Put . your hands out of the window! Right now!' Lopez apologized and said he was late for an off-duty job, to which Watts shouted: 'You were running 120 miles an hour!' Lopez was eventually fired after the confrontation made national headlines. Some police agencies are trying to change the driver's license law to stop claims like Ms Watts'. Bill . Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police . Agencies (NAPO), said law enforcement officials are concerned lawyers . are using the law to target individual officers who access the . information. Speeding: Ms Watts was initially unsure who was in the police car and approached with her gun drawn . 'In our view, it was not what the federal law was enacted to counteract,' Johnson said. 'I think it would be unfair and outside the scope of the legislation to think individuals would get whacked like that.' NAPO is lobbying Congress to remove the automatic $2,500 penalty and change the law so that a violation could only occur if there was 'specific intent to secure an economic benefit,' according to the organization's documents. Ms Desir said anyone can ask the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for a report - known as D.A.V.I.D., for Driving and Vehicle Information Database - on who has accessed their driver's license information and how many times, but it isn't easy. 'You don't even know you've been looked up unless you make a concerted effort to find out,' she said. A judge is expected to rule on the law enforcement agency and officers' motions to dismiss the case in the next few weeks, which will determine whether the lawsuit continues. Ms Desir said Watts, who had been assigned to road patrol in Broward County, has relocated and is no longer driving a cruiser, but she still works for the Highway Patrol.","Florida trooper Donna Jane Watts pulled over Miami's Fausto Lopez in 2011 .

A mother lost almost half her body weight after she got stuck in two rollers at a children’s soft play centre. Emma Kingston, 29, put on weight after getting hooked on McDonald’s Big Macs and pizzas washed down with litres of full-fat coke. At her heaviest, the mother-of-one, who is getting married to a professional chef, tipped the scales at 18st 3lbs and was a size 24. Super slimmer: Emma Kingston, 29, was shamed into dieting after she got stuck in the equipment at a children's play centre . Her weight became such a problem that she struggled to find clothes to fit her. But Emma, a travel agent, finally decided to lose weight when she took her 18-month-old son Freddie to an indoor play zone in January last year and got wedged in the equipment. It took two members of staff to haul her out two rollers which she had tried to squeeze through as she followed Freddie around the Crazy Knights centre in Oswestry, Shrops. The day after her embarrassing rescue, Emma signed up to Slimming World and in 12 months she has shed seven stone to weigh 10st 12lbs and dropped to a size 12. At her heaviest: Emma weighed around 18st due to her love of fast food washed down with fizzy drinks . Child's play: Emma, pictured with her 2-year-old son Freddie Jones at Rocco's Play Centre, was mortified after getting stuck in between two rollers . Emma, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, said: 'I couldn’t believe it, we got to the two rollers which are meant for kids but normal sized adults can fit through them but I started and just knew there was no way I could get through it. 'I suddenly got stuck. I was with my cousin and she had to carry on with Freddie while two members of staff helped get me out. 'It was so embarrassing having to go back the way I had come against all the people coming through the play centre.

'It was then that I signed up to Slimming World because something had to be done. 'I think before then I hadn’t realised how bad it had got. When I went back to work after seven months maternity leave I had to order a new uniform because I had put on weight. 'I had been a size 18 since after I had left school and got a job because I think when I left home I didn’t have mum’s cooking. 'I never had breakfast so I just got so hungry by lunchtime and would gorge then. 'My fiance Mark is a chef so people think that was why I got so big but it was the junk food I’d eat. Before the weightloss: Emma pictured with her fiance and their son in May 2012 at her heaviest . 'I got so big I couldn’t sit on the floor because it was so uncomfortable and worried I wouldn’t be able to get up on my own so I just couldn’t play with Freddie.'

She added: 'We go back to Crazy Knights now regularly and I don’t get out of breath like I used to. I can keep up with Freddie. Before it was exhausting but I didn’t know anything else. 'Slimming World has really helped me because I can still have some of my favourite foods but have the barriers to stop me eating too much.

Seth Meyers has announced that he is stacking his new Late Night team with familiar faces including his fellow Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armisen. Armisen, known best for his acting chops on Portlandia and impersonations of President Obama and Joy Behar, actually started his career as a musician and plays the drums and guitar. The surprising pick was announced on Twitter by Meyers Monday and later confirmed by NBC. Working together: Fred Armisen and Seth Meyers were colleagues on SNL for 11 years and now will continue working together on Late Night when Seth Meyers takes over the reins on February 24 . Surprise: Meyers was the one to make the announcement about his musical staff on Monday afternoon . 'Fred will curate and lead the band, and continue to run it even when he's off shooting Portlandia,' Meyers wrote to his more than 2.2 million followers. The tweet was completed with the hashtag #8GBand, showing that the name of the group is inspired by the studio name where the show will be filmed. Armisen is the second-longest SNL cast member, losing the title to his new boss, Meyers, who was on the variety program for 13 years while Armisen was a cast member for 11 years. The news comes as NBC's late night line up goes through some serious changes as Jimmy Fallon is due to start hosting The Tonight Show next Monday. With Fallon moving to the earlier time slot, Meyers was chosen to take over the Late Night slot. Fallon is bringing his much-loved band, The Roots, with him to the Tonight Show which gives Meyers the chance to stock his own crew. Switching it up: Armisen is known best for his acting but he actually started his career as a musician and will not be stopping his work on Portlandia once he takes on the house band role . Passing the... pickle? Jimmy Fallon is leaving his post at Late Night and taking over The Tonight Show and Meyers was selected as his replacement (seen here with the 'Late Night pickle' during a January 28 show) The Roots and their leader Questlove are widely considered to be among the best in house bands in late night history considering they have won three Grammy Awards and a host of other honors in their multi-decade history. Arimsen and Questlove had a good-natured drum off when he appeared as a guest on Fallon's show in January 2013, proving that the comedic actor could hold his own. The selection of Armisen suggests that he will serve as a comedic foil for Meyers, as the two men are good friends and will likely play off each other once the show begins airing on February 24.","Former SNL star Fred Armisen is joining his friend Seth Meyers as the band leader for the new Late Night show .

The captain of a replica 18th-century ship that sank in Superstorm Sandy made a reckless decision to sail the HMS Bounty into the hurricane's well-forecast path, the National Transportation Safety Board reported Monday. The three-masted wooden sailing ship sank about 125 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras in October 2012 as Sandy churned up the Atlantic seaboard. The newly released NTSB report said Captain Robin Walbridge's 'reckless decision' to sail into the storm subjected the aging vessel and its inexperienced crew to conditions they couldn't surmount. One member of the HMS Bounty's 16-person crew died and Walbridge was never found after the sinking off North Carolina's Outer Banks, an ocean expanse with a history of shipwrecks. Doomed: The shipwrecked HMS Bounty after it was sunk by Superstorm Sandy, a disaster which has been officially blamed on the captain in a report by the National Transportation Safety Board . All at sea: The newly released NTSB report said Captain Robin Walbridge's 'reckless decision' to sail into the storm subjected the aging vessel and its inexperienced crew to conditions they couldn't surmount . Three other crew members aboard the vessel - built for the 1962 film Mutiny on the Bounty starring Marlon Brando - were seriously injured. 'Although this wooden ship was modelled after an 18th century vessel, the captain had access to 21st century hurricane modeling tools that predicted the path and severity of Hurricane Sandy,' NTSB Chairman Deborah AP Hersman said in a statement. 'The Bounty's crew was put into an extraordinarily hazardous situation through decisions that by any measure didn't prioritize safety.' Superstorm Sandy was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history. Although it had weakened to a post-tropical cyclone when it made landfall in New Jersey, its enormous size pushed a catastrophic storm surge toward much of the heavily populated East Coast. 'Put crew in put into an extraordinarily hazardous situation': Captain Robin Walbridge (pictured) was never found after the sinking off North Carolina's Outer Banks, an ocean expanse with a history of shipwrecks . In the path of destruction: The three-masted wooden sailing ship sank about 125 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras in October 2012 as Sandy churned up the Atlantic seaboard . Besides Mutiny on the Bounty, the ship was featured in several other films over the years, including one of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. When not in use by moviemakers, the ship was a pierside attraction for visitors in ports and also served as an educational ship that taught people how to sail. The 108-foot-long ship set sail from New London, Conn., for St. Petersburg, Fla. on October 25, 2012, a day after Sandy reached hurricane strength. The plan was for the Bounty to arrive in St Petersburg for a November 10 event. But early in the morning of October 29, 2012, the ship sank after taking on more than 10 feet of water. Crew members had to swim for their lives in the dark when the ship overturned. 'It was an end to a voyage that should not have been attempted. To set sail into an approaching hurricane introduced needless risk,' the NTSB report says. Struggle: A footage still shows one of the crew of the Bounty being rescued from a life raft by the Coast Guard after the vessel sank after the captain went against forecasters' advice and sailed into the storm . Dramatic: An image taken inside the helicopter shows the moment crew members were saved from the ship . During testimony last February at a Coast Guard hearing in Portsmouth, Va., surviving crew members repeatedly said Walbridge believed a ship was safer at sea in a storm than in port. Before sailing, Walbridge told nervous crew that his plan was to sail the Bounty on a southeasterly course and let the hurricane pass southwest of it. But as the ship headed south, the path of the storm changed and began heading west. Walbridge, too, decided to head west - directly into Sandy's path. 'It is possible that the captain may have focused too narrowly on the position of the storm's eye instead of on Sandy 's total expanse,' said the NTSB report, noting storm winds spanned more than 1,000 miles in diameter, and that the Bounty was heading into an area already under tropical storm warnings. 'Still, the captain seemed to believe that he could outrace the storm,' the NTSB report added. It said Walbridge had hoped winds around the storm system would push the vessel southwest toward Florida, but that he and senior crew seemingly failed to anticipate the effect prolonged exposure to the storm would have on the wooden vessel. Aging: The report also noted that while the Bounty took on water even in good sailing conditions, the captain gave no order to ensure the ship's pumps were fully working even though rough seas were expected . Hollywood star: The ship was built for the 1962 film Mutiny on the Bounty starring Marlon Brando . While the NTSB report details numerous events leading to the sinking, it places the bulk of the blame on Walbridge. Among other things, it noted that while the Bounty took on water even in good sailing conditions, he gave no order to ensure the ship's pumps were fully working before leaving Connecticut even though rough seas were expected. Some wood rot also had been recently discovered on the ship, the NTSB said. The report also says the ship's parent organization showed a lack of effective safety oversight. The HMS Bounty Organization is facing a $70 million lawsuit in Long Island, N.Y., from the mother of deceased crewmember Claudene Christian, 42. The lawsuit claims negligence, saying the vessel wasn't seaworthy and that Walbridge shouldn't have taken it out to sea. The Bounty's former engineer, Christopher Barksdale, is also suing the East Setauket, N.Y.-based Bounty organization and its owner for an unspecified amount. During the 2013 Coast Guard hearing, the owner of the HMS Bounty, Robert Hansen, declined to testify by invoking his Fifth Amendment right to be protected from incriminating himself. An email to Hansen's attorneys wasn't immediately returned late Monday.","Two died when aging wooden vessel built for Marlon Brando's 1962 film sunk off North Carolina in October 2012 .

Dramatic surveillance footage shows the moment when US Delta Force special forces surgically extracted al-Qaeda terrorist Anas al-Libi from outside his home in Libya on October 5. The early morning raid, which has been described as akin to 'brain surgery-level of precision', took the eight-man team exactly 60-seconds to ambush the terror suspect inside his car in Tripoli and then bundle him into their own white van. Al-Libi, 49, who is suspected of masterminding the 1998 bombings of the US Embassy's in Kenya and Tanzania was rushed away from his home to the USS San Antonio in the Mediterranean to be questioned by the High Value Detainee Interrogation Group before being taken to New York City. Scroll Down for Video . Rush: In this screen grab from the surveillance video obtained by The Washington post two men can be seen exiting the white van that has pulled up alongside the dark car of Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, better known as Anas al-Libi . The rare glimpse of covert operations, which was obtained by The Washington Post, unfolds just like a scene from a Tom Clancy novel and begins with al-Libi's dark car coming around the corner to park outside his Tripoli home. From behind his car a white van rushes to pull up alongside and men rush out brandishing weapons pointing them at al-Libi's car. There then appears to be a brief scuffle which ends with al-Libi being yanked from his vehicle and bundled into the van. No shots appear to be fired and once the terror suspect is inside the white van, the doors close on both his dark car and the Delta Force vehicle - at which point both drive off - presumably with a Delta Force soldier at the wheel of al-Libi's car. Another white car, which had been providing back-up at the end of the street behind the extraction then zooms away too. Captured: Anas al-Libi, a suspected terrorist, is shown in this photo released by the FBI October 10, 2001 in Washington, D.C.  Al-Libi is now in custody in New York City waiting trial for his involvement in the 1998 bombings of the US Embassy's in Tanzania and Kenya . The entire operation takes 60 seconds and one former Army special operations soldier told ABC News that having observed the video it was like watching 'brain surgery-level of prescision.' Indeed, in the immediate aftermath of the cars speeding away, bemused residents of al-Libi's home can be seen rushing out onto the roof of the house to see what the commotion was all about. After his interrogation by the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, al-Libi was then brought to New York to face terrorism-related charges for the bombings of the US Embassy's in Kenya and Tanzania. He has pleaded not guilty and al-Libi's attorney, Bernard Kleinman, told The Washington Post his client never swore allegiance to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and was not involved in the embassy attacks. 'My client is innocent of any and all actions that either directly or indirectly resulted in the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in August 1998,' Kleinman said according to The Washington Post. 'His trial will prove this beyond any doubt whatsoever.' Terror:  US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright looks 18 August at damage from a bomb at the US embassy in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania where 10 people were killed and 72 injured when the device detonated on August 7, 1998 . The raid was the result of 13-years of planning by the CIA, FBI and the US Army's Delta Force as they hunted the man accused of being responsible for the deaths of more than 200 people in East Africa at the end of the 1990s. He is awaiting trial in New York, held in the special housing unit of a jail across from the federal courthouse. In his defense, al-Libi has reminded the courts that he offered assistance in the 2011 overthrow of Gaddafi, after he moved back to Libya when Iran asked him and his family to leave in 2010 without explanation. Devastation: Construction workers prepare to fence off damaged shops and offices 17 August at the scene of a bomb blast that killed 247 people in Nairobi on August 7 in 1998 . However, US officials have said that they were concerned at his presence in Libya following the removal of Gaddafi and believed he was a serious threat to the American embassy in Tripoli. They added that official permission was sought from Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan to conduct the raid which was granted. However, the Libyan government is now paying for al-Libi's defense according to State Department sources.","Surveillance footage shows Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, better known as Anas al-Libi being grabbed from outside his Tripoli, Libya, home on October 5 .

From music video clips on YouTube to album plugs on social networking site Twitter, Sophie Ellis-Bextor is just a click away on the internet. But while she is happy for the public to have access to her on the web, she adopts a different approach when it comes to her children. Yesterday it emerged the 2013 Strictly Come Dancing finalist has banned her children from having mobile phones and imposed strict limits on how much TV and internet use they have to protect them from encountering inappropriate images or information. Rules: Sophie Ellis-Bextor with her husband Richard Jones and son Sonny. She has banned her children from using mobile phones and limits the time they spend watching TV . The 34-year-old singer who has three sons:  Sonny, nine, Kit, five, and 22-month-year-old Ray with her husband Richard Jones, bassist with band The Feeling, admitted they may have been ‘naïve’ in the past but they control the internet access their children have at home. Miss Ellis-Bextor said: ‘We are quite controlled with Sonny’s internet use and therefore he is only allowed to use the internet at the weekends. ‘Because otherwise he would be on it all the time – like some of his friends are. He loves gadgets and technology, and is obsessed with it so if we let him on it all the time we would lose days to it. ‘My children don’t have Facebook –they have one in Sonny’s name which we use more as a family thing.

Children don’t need that. It’s just unhealthy clutter rather than allowing them to use the internet to explore and find out interesting things.’ Control: The singer who has three sons:  Sonny, nine, Kit, five, and 22-month-year-old Ray. She admitted they may have been 'naïve' in the past . ‘It may sound silly but even my baby who is nearly two can touch screens and swipe through pictures, so of course I fear what he could stumble across. ‘I want them to be confident with the internet because it’s part of the world they live in. It shouldn’t intimidate them.’ The Murder on the Dancefloor singer made her comments as she highlighted Disney’s Club Penguin internet safety campaign, It Starts With You (Subs, please keep). A study commissioned to coincide with it found 80 per cent of parents feel so concerned about online safety they believe it should be taught in schools. She has insisted her children will not be given a mobile phone until they start secondary school and only allows them to watch half an hour of television a day. However it is their online activity that worries her most: ‘My five-year-old is constantly asking questions, he sees things on TV or hears things on the radio and he has a question to ask. As a parent on some topics you find ways of scooting around them because they are too adult and you answer them appropriately. She has insisted her children will not be given a mobile phone until they start secondary school and only allows them to watch half an hour of television a day . ‘Online it doesn’t work like that, that ‘do I want them to know that’ filter isn’t in place. ‘If Kit was left to his own devices and could write and type then he could find a series of images he finds disturbing. ‘I don’t want him to be looking up anything and not being able to control the result. ‘I want them learn about adult subjects in a healthy, controlled manner. If you were walking your children into school, you want them to walk into a class with children in the same age group – rather than going straight to the sixth form. When they are only little and the same thing applies for the internet. ‘It should be used to educate children or allow them to play – it shouldn’t be a tool which distresses them or cause them to think differently about themselves.’ The Daily Mail has also been campaigning for safer internet access for our children, including automatic blocks on online porn, with over-18s able to access adult material only following a strict age verification check. Last year Prime Minister David Cameron announced a compromise ‘default on’ solution, under which all families will be asked whether a filter should be applied. In November the Government decided to dramatically accelerate this default, encouraging 20million families to decide whether or not they wished to have access to online pornography. The filters, which have been backed my service providers TalkTalk and Sky, will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network and across any public network.","Strictly Come Dancing star limits the time family spend on gadgets .

A former Delaware pediatrician defended himself in court yesterday where he's accused of waterboarding his longtime companion's daughter by holding the girl's head under a faucet. Melvin Morse, 60, will be cross-examined by prosecutors today in his trial on endangerment and assault charges. He testified Monday that he was simply trying to get the girl's hair clean. He told the court that he and the girl's mother, Pauline Morse, became exasperated trying to wash the girl's hair in the shower when she was 8-years-old after she insisted she was too old to take a bath. The girl, now 12, and her mother have said Morse used hair-washing as a threat or punishment when she misbehaved. Trial: Melvin Morse, 60, pictured, will be cross-examined by prosecutors Tuesday in his trial on endangerment and assault charges. He testified Monday that he was simply trying to get the girl's hair clean . Morse, who became household name in the . 1990s through appearances on 'Larry King Live,' 'The Oprah Winfrey . Show' and 'Unsolved Mysteries,' and his research into near-death experiences . with children, could face more than 20 years in prison if convicted on all charges. Morse denied police claims that he may have been experimenting on the girl for his research. Monday . was the eighth day of Morse's trial and he took the stand to explain . how he cared for the girl, who he said had faced difficulties in her . young life. He denied he treated the girl any different from her younger sister, who was biologically his child. For instance, he said, he made sure to give them the same number of Christmas presents. According to DelawareOnline, he described the alleged victim as 'a burst of sunshine' up until age 5. However, Morse said she changed after she experienced sexual abuse at the hands of her stepsister, which was discovered in 2007. 'She became defiant,' he said. 'She was, naturally, angry at us for not protecting her.' He . denied water-boarding the girl, claiming that he was simply trying to . wash her hair after she declared she was too old for baths. Torture: The girl, now 12, and her mother, Pauline Morse, pictured, have said Morse used hair-washing as a threat or punishment when she misbehaved . 'It . pretty much was always a thrash,' he said of Pauline Morse's efforts to . wash the girl's hair and admitted trying to rinse the girl's hair under . a faucet on four or five occasions. 'I . did say to her, ""I'm not waterboarding you, this isn't some kind of . torture. I just want your hair to be clean.""' Morse testified, according . to Delaware Online. When the girl testified last week, she claimed Morse forced her under running water as a punishment . whenever he felt like it. She eventually ran away front the home in . July 2012 and told police she'd been abused, which led to the arrests of . both parents. Morse added that he still considers himself a doctor and is 'determined to go back to full-time practice.' The testimony comes after the former . pediatrician's wife testified Thursday about the extensive abuse she . believes took place in their home and her reluctance to put a stop to . it. Pauline Morse said she . saw Morse holding the girl's head under a faucet one day and doesn't . believe his claims of washing her hair. She also told the Delaware jury of him dragging her across a gravel driveway by her ankle and down the stairs of their home. Pauline Morse testified that she . walked into the kitchen one time and surprised Morse while he had the . now 12-year-old girl's head under the faucet. She said he jumped and . quickly released the girl, who was coughing and shaking. 'He called it washing her hair, but I knew it wasn't washing her hair because there was no soap or anything,' she recalled. He would routinely use 'hair washing' as a threat or punishment for the girl, she continued. 'He would just say ""I'm going to wash your hair,"" and he would say ""I will do it again,""'  she testified. She . pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor child endangerment charges for . doing nothing to stop the several instances of abuse she says she either . saw or heard. Television personality: Melvin Morse made many stops on the talk show circuit, including this 2010 appearance on 'Larry King Live' 'A lot of times I would just go up in my room and ignore the whole thing,' she said, adding that she was afraid of 'undermining' him. Melvin Morse made the girl stand with her arms outstretched for long periods of time, she said. She was awoken several times to hear bumping and crying she assumed was him dragging her down the stairs, but said she stayed in bed. 'I didn't want to see.' The waterboarding claims came from the girl after Melvin Morse was accused in July 2012 of grabbing the girl by her ankle and dragging her across a gravel driveway - for which he was arrested and released on bail. The then-11-year-old girl told investigators about the waterboarding when they questioned her about the initial dragging incident, she said the torture happened at least four times, according to Reuters. Pauline Morse also told the jury he would starve the girl and deprive of her of using the bathroom. Morse shot into the national consciousness through a series of books and articles on paranormal science and near-death experiences involving children. Those writings led to appearances on 'Larry King Live' and the 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' 'Unsolved Mysteries' and in an article in 'Rolling Stone' magazine. A pediatrician by trade, his license to practice medicine was suspended after he was charged despite denying police claims that he may have been experimenting on the girl. Waterboarding simulates drowning and has been used in the past by U.S. interrogators on terror suspects. Many critics call it torture. Sussex County Courthouse: Morse's trial is taking place in this Delaware courthouse . If convicted on each of four felony counts of reckless endangering, Morse could face up to 20 years in prison, but the presumptive sentence for each count is up to 15 months in prison. He faces up to a year in prison for each of five misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child, and up to a year on one misdemeanor assault charge. The girl admitted under cross-examination Wednesday that she had lied in 2010 when she accused a family member of molesting her, WBOC reported. Pauline Morse testified that her husband had violated a no-contact after his arrest by making calendar entries with messages on his cellphone, which was synched to hers because they shared the same account. One message presented by prosecutors reads: 'I have repented and I am suffering my own created hell.' She said they also discussed ways of covering the abuse up when he was home on bail. Pauline Morse said her motivations for testifying against Melvin Morse included hoping to be reunited with the girl and her younger sister, who are now in foster care, and because she wanted him 'out of our life.'","Delaware doctor Melvin Morse, 60, will be cross-examined by prosecutors today in his trial on endangerment and assault charges .

This is the tiny bedroom castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga will call home when he arrives back in El Salvador on Tuesday. Alvarenga is used to cramped conditions, after apparently spending 13 months floating helplessly in a 24-foot boat in the Pacific Ocean. He was given a brief taste of the high life in the luxury Marshall Islands Resort Hotel after he was found washed up on the remote atolls almost two weeks ago. But he will be brought back to earth with a bump when he arrives back in the tiny village of Garita Palmera on the Pacific coast of El Salvador. A humble but good life: This is the room and bed where castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga will be living once he arrives home . Grateful: Ricardo Orellana, father and Maria Julia Alvarenga, mother of castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga await for his return to El Salvador . Patience: Arely, wife of castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga attends the family store. She awaits for his return to  the small costal town of Garita Palmera located in the western part of El Salvador . His mother Maria, father Ricardo, wife Arely Barrera and daughter, Fatima, 13, have prepared a ten by ten feet room just behind the family shop, which sells drinks and snacks. The bedroom is only separated from the local store by shelves, stacked with goods. At present it has a queen bed, covered in a turquoise sheet, a small bedside table and a single window, without any glass. There is also another bed in there for his younger sister. It was his old room before he fled the country in 2001, following a brutal bar fight which almost cost him his life. And today his mother insisted she will keep him out of harm's way in the future, even saying she will ban him from his fishing career and make him become a baker. Maria told MailOnline: 'I never want him to go out on the sea again, never. I want him to do anything but fishing. He used to be a baker years ago, we've got a clay oven here, so he can do that again.' Weak: Jose Salvador Alvarenga washed ashore late last month (left) in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year drifting across the Pacific Ocean living on what he could catch. After hospital treatment, some proper food and a shave (right), he will return home on Tuesday . Never again: The castaway's father added: 'He can do farming or something agricultural; we just don't want him to be a fisherman again' Going home: People see off Jose Salvador Alvarenga, the Salvadoran man who says he drifted in an open boat across the Pacific for more than a year, as he is flying home at an airport in Majuro, Marshall Islands on Monday . Return: Jose Salvador Alvarenga (right) of El Salvador shakes hands with Marshall Islands President Christopher Loeak prior to his departure at the airport in Majuro on Monday . Ricardo added: 'He can do farming or something agricultural; we just don't want him to be a fisherman again.' Maria added: 'We don't have much, but he will be home. We may only be able to feed him rice, beans and tortilla, but he will live humbly and he will live well'. Alvarenga, 37, set off on his long journey home at around 3am Eastern Standard Time, flying from The Marshall Islands to Honolulu. The nervous flyer was given a window seat in the economy section and enjoyed a meal of lasagne and vegetables. That was followed by fruit salad, cookies from the island nation of Guam, and accompanied by a soft drink and water. After four-and-a-half hours in the air he landed in Hawaii and got to spend a few hours in the airport's VIP lounge. Then he boarded a United Airlines flight to Houston, Texas. On arrival in the United States he will make the final leg of his journey, a three hour flight to San Salvador, the capital of his homeland. From there he will be driven for two hours along a winding coastal road to the tiny village of Garita Palmera, where his family will be waiting to finally welcome him home. Greetings: Fatima Maeba Alvarenga, 13-year-old daughter of Alvarenga, prepare to receive her father at her house  in Garita Palmera, 118 km west of San Salvador . Ready: Alvarenga's family members  prepare to receive him in Garita Palmera on Tuesday . It is believed one of his six US based brothers and sisters will travel with him from Houston, but his family in El Salvador are still in the dark as to exactly when he will return. Ricardo said: 'We honestly do not know when he will be back, we have very little information. 'The one thing we have been told is that he might be taken straight to a hospital to be checked out, because he is still unwell.' The fisherman's remarkable story hit the headlines after he washed ashore late last month. He claims he set off on a shark fishing trip from the Chiapas region of Mexico, but after winds blew him off course, he spent the next 14-months drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch. Having told doctors that he had kept himself alive by eating raw fish, the flesh of sea birds and turtles and drinking their blood and his own urine, there was concern about his kidneys and liver. While he looked in remarkably good health and overall condition when seen on the atoll of Ebon after coming ashore for the first time since he had set out on an ill-fated fishing expedition, his health deteriorated when he was brought to Majuro in the Marshall Islands. Such was the concern of doctors that a day after he was released from hospital and taken to a lagoon-side hotel to relax he was returned to hospital and placed on a rehydration drip. Preparations: The family gets ready for a reunion . Then he was taken back to the hotel as arrangements were made to fly him home to his family. A police guard was placed outside his room to prevent journalists talking to him and every step was taken to ensure that details of his return journey did not leak out. An El Salvadorian diplomat who flew from Japan brought with him a special passport-making kit, allowing him to prepare an emergency passport for Alvarenga so he could pass through US airports on the way home. He also needed the document to enter his country of birth.","Castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga who says he was adrift in the Pacific for 13 months will return home to El Salvador on Tuesday .

Irish actor Chris O'Dowd has revealed he is a big X Factor fans but believes many viewers are racist as strong, black singers get voted off early . Viewers of the X Factor have been branded racist because they never vote for the best black singers, a Hollywood star has claimed. Irish actor Chris O’Dowd said he was a big fan of the ITV reality show, but accused viewers of discriminating against black contestants by voting them out in round five every year. His comments – which come after a series of X Factor contestants complained they were exposed to racist abuse after appearing on the show – prompted campaigners to call for more protection to be given to those who appear on the show. The 34-year-old, who is known for his starring roles in hit sitcom The IT Crowd and romantic comedy Bridesmaids, told the Radio Times: ‘I’m a big X Factor fan. Generally my favourites go out in the first few weeks and, of course, because the viewing public is so racist, all the black, strong singers go out in round five every year.’ Two of the X Factor’s past winners, Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke, are mixed race while the boyband JLS which was runner-up to Burke are black and the show has featured many black contestants. But it has also been hit by a series of complaints that ethnic minority singers are discriminated against as they reach the later stages of the competition. One of the favourites to win last year’s series, 17-year-old Hannah Barrett, complained she faced a barrage of online abuse about her colour before she was voted off in the seventh week. She had to compete in a sing-off three times before her eviction because she received such a low number of public votes. Scroll down for video . Hannah Barrett, 17, pictured with Nicole Scherzinger on X Factor last year, was one of the favourites to win but was voted off in the seventh week. She claimed she faced a barrage of online abuse about her colour after the show . Reflecting on her experience, she said: ‘I’ve received a lot of horrible, racist comments on Twitter. People say I’m too dark to be a singer. People say, ‘You’re black and ugly’, nasty things like that. ‘The sad thing is most of them are made by black people who just have lighter skin than me. I’m just like, ""Whatever"". I know they are talking rubbish.’ Meanwhile boy band Rough Copy, who made it to week nine of last year’s competition, also claimed they faced online abuse from viewers. Singer Kazeem Ajob said he was described as a ‘monkey’ online, while his bandmate Joey Thomas said: ‘Someone said on Twitter, “You black ***** can’t even sing – you should get off X Factor”’. In 2011, another show favourite, 19-year-old Misha Bryan, sparked a race row after she was evicted in the semi-finals. Attacked: Boy band Rough Copy revealed they received racist online abuse from viewers . Many attributed her failure to win to . the fact she was accused of bullying other contestants by judges Louis . Walsh and Tulisa Contostavlos. But some commentators said she was a victim of racism. One, Erica Sebastian, said: ‘African and African Caribbean people are a minority in this country, so in order to win, you’ve got to appeal to the masses. This means less keeping it real and more keeping it bland — like chicken korma.’ Another campaigner, Paul Boakye, said at the time that 2006 winner Miss Lewis was only able to win because she was not black but ‘international beige’. And he claimed 2008 winner Miss Burke only succeeded because her popular show mentor Cheryl Cole supported her so strongly. He said: ‘All manner of attempts were made throughout the series to persuade us that we were really voting for Cheryl Cole, our new English Rose, to win the competition between judges that year.’ Misha Bryan, 19, pictured centre next to Janet Devlin and Amelia Lily, sparked a race row when she was evicted in the semi-finals in 2011 . Yesterday, Mediawatch-UK director Vivienne Pattison said the X Factor’s creators could not be held responsible for the reactions of viewers towards contestants. But she added: ‘There does need to be a debate around what sort of controls we put on Twitter, because appearing on a show like this can expose you to a lot of vitriol and it is easier than ever for vile abuse to be written about you anonymously online. ‘It could be that we need to protect contestants more from this type of material, even if there is nothing the producers can do about the votes that are cast.’ Last night an X Factor source said: ‘The X Factor has a long standing record of celebrating a diverse range of artists including two former winners, Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke, and numerous others who have reached the final stages of the competition including this year’s semi-finalists Rough Copy, along with JLS, Marcus Collins and Jahmene Douglas in previous series.’","Irish actor claims he was a big fan of the popular ITV reality show .

Opening up: Cooper, seen earlier this year, told a crowd of students that he initially kept his homosexuality private for fear that it would interrupt his work . Anderson Cooper has said that his decision to come out as gay has not stopped some persistent female admirers from trying to seduce him. Cooper joked that he decided to come out in July 2012 because he wanted to get more interested men, but said that there are still some 'very determined young ladies'. 'Being born gay is one of the great blessings of my life,' he said during a talk at the University of Texas-Arlington on Monday night. The 46-year-old has been in a longterm . relationship with partner Ben Maisani since 2009 and the couple lives . together in his converted firehouse in Manhattan's West Village. There . was speculation that the pair split shortly after Cooper came out since . Maisani was spotted kissing another man in Central Park but they have . appeared to moved past it. Cooper . and Maisani, who owns a number of bars in New York, were seen together . at a friend's club opening in September but tend to keep a low profile. For . years, Cooper kept his sexuality a secret to the public but was open . with his friends and colleagues, claiming that it was because he thought . that it would interfere with his work overseas in less tolerant . countries. He explained that further during the talk on the college campus, with the school's newspaper The Shorthorn reporting that he said it made him less anonymous. 'It’s harder to tell a story when people know about you,' the CNN anchor said. Together: Cooper has been dating night club owner Ben Maisani since 2009 (seen here in May 2013) 'In order to tell a good story, you want to be a sponge for the information they want to tell you.' The topic of coming out was made pertinent during the Monday talk because of the news over the weekend that college football player Michael Sam announced he is gay. Sam is expected to be a top NFL draft pick which would make him the first openly gay professional football player. When asked how Cooper thought it would be for Sam moving forward, being a 'gay football player', The Star Telegram reports that Cooper suggested that it was a similar barrier to that of race or religion- likening Sam to those who were the first Jewish football player or the first black football player. A segment about Sam's coming out and the possible changes to locker room dynamics also aired on Cooper's CNN show AC360 on Monday night.

An American translator and an Egyptian filmmaker were arrested in Cairo and have been held for three days in an undisclosed location, their lawyer said on Saturday. Ahmed Hassan, a lawyer with the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, told The Associated Press that U.S. citizen Jeremy Hodge, 26, and Egyptian filmmaker Hossam Eddin el-Meneai, 36, were arrested Wednesday before midnight from their apartment in Dokki district in Western Cairo. He said that officers at the local police station first acknowledged they are holding the two but later denied that they were in custody. It is not immediately clear why the two were held. Captive: The U.S. embassy in Cairo confirmed that 26-year-old translator Jeremy Hodge has been arrested by Egyptian spy agency . The Ministry of the Interior in Cairo declined to comment on the incident. Hassan said he believes they are being held by the domestic spy agency, National Security. He said he has filed kidnapping reports for the two. Hassan called the detention part of a 'wave of intimidation of journalists' in Egypt. There has also been a rise of cases where citizens detain journalists and foreigners, reporting them to authorities amid a rising nationalist fervor and panic over foreign plots to destabilize the country. An official at the American Embassy in Cairo confirmed a U.S. citizen was in detention. 'We are aware that a U.S. citizen has been detained in Egypt and are providing all appropriate consular assistance,' the official said on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. He had no further comments. Hodge is a free-lance translator who has worked in Egypt for a number of publications and with Berlin-based Transparency International. His roommate el-Meneai is a filmmaker, originally from the restive Northern Sinai province where militants have upped their attacks on security and military forces. A press statement issued by friends of the two included text messages that Hodge sent out after they were detained. 'They're asking Hossam about Sinai and his camera,' Hodge wrote. 'They're asking me how I know him, and where I learned my Arabic.'  In another text message, he wrote:  'Hossam is being investigated, I'm waiting around.' Hodge suffers from asthma, his friends said. It is not clear if he has access to his medication. In a separate incident, Egyptian artist and filmmaker Aalam Wassef was briefly detained along with a Swiss citizen on Friday, according to lawyers, and was later released without charge. It was not immediately clear why the two were taken from Wassef's apartment that overlooks Tahrir Square, where rallies are expected on the third anniversary of the 2011 uprising Wednesday. Wassef has made videos critical of the government and former longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. He worked under a pseudonym when Mubarak was in power and continued to put out videos under his own name since Mubarak's fall, under both military and Islamist rule.

Wearing a pork pie hat and riding in a pushchair along the tarmac of a Marshall Islands airport, Jose Alvarenga, the 'miracle survivor of the Pacific' began the long journey home today. And while his flight home was to take more than 24 hours, it is considerably shorter than the almost 14 months he spent drifting across the world's largest ocean. Accompanied by a burly El Salvadorian diplomat, 37-year-old Alvarenga was given a window seat at the very front of the economy section, where he slumped down in a deliberate attempt to be photographed by other passengers who learned of his fame. Precious cargo: Jose Alvarenga is wheeled onto the United Airlines flight home in the early hours of this morning . Real life castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga has crossed the Pacific again - but this time in a plane. He is pictured in the airport lounge, ready to leave for home . The fisherman washed ashore late last month in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch . Mr Alvarenga's arrival time at Majuro's Amata Kabua International Airport had been kept secret. At the last moment, however, the republic's President Christopher Loeak chose to give a brief photo opportunity in the airport's VIP lounge . For . the evening meal on the four and a half hour flight from the Marshall . Islands to Honolulu he was given a choice of grilled chicken and . vegetables or lasagne and vegetables. He . chose lasagne - possibly because it was the closest to his favourite . tortilla, the central American meal that he cried out for when he first . struck land nearly two weeks ago. That was followed by fruit salad, cookies from the island nation of Guam, and accompanied by a soft drink and water. As . the United Airlines jet soared across the Pacific, Alvarenga did not . bother looking out of the window at the ocean he had so painfully . crossed in his open boat - because it was dark there was nothing to see. So . he dozed most of the way and airline staff ensured he was not bothered . by passengers curious to learn more about his extraordinary adventure. But he told a passenger as the flight landed that he had enjoyed his first 'ride' in an aeroplane. His . immediate plans on landing in Honolulu were not known but he has told . his minders in the Marshal Islands that he is looking forward to once . again greeting the family he has not seen for 15 years since he fled El . Salvador after a brutal bar-room dispute. But now the 37-year-old El Salvadorian, who looks remarkably healthier than the bloated and bedraggled figure who hit headlines two weeks ago, is heading back to his family, who have not seen him for 15 years after he fled to Mexico following a brutal bar-room brawl . It was claimed that before moving to Mexico, Mr Alvarenga belonged to a guerrilla army in his native El Salvador, where he was trained in jungle warfare . Doctors . in the Marshall Islands said before he left for the flight that he had . been given the all clear to fly, although he was still having trouble . walking, which was why he required a wheel chair to be taken to the . aircraft at Majuro airport. The fisherman washed ashore . late last month in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year . drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch. He . reportedly asked the Mexican Deputy Head of Mission in Majuro, the . Marshall Islands capital: 'What do I do when I get on the plane? What . happens?' He was told: 'You don't do anything but sit there and people come along and bring you food and drink.' 'That sounds good,' he said with a grin. Mr Alvarenga's arrival time at Majuro's Amata Kabua International Airport had been kept secret. At . the last moment, however, the republic's President Christopher Loeak . chose to give a brief photo opportunity in the airport's VIP lounge. He said: 'Jose is welcome back here any time. We are very proud that we were able to help him.""' When asked if the he believes Jose's story, President Loeak said: 'I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I have not seen him, but also I have no reason to doubt him. 'This is a mind-boggling story of surviving for 13 months.' Initially Mr Alvarenga was to fly out on Friday, but eventually he left on Monday evening, headed for Honolulu. His flights home will see him fly from Honolulu to either San Francisco or Los Angeles and from whichever one to San Salvador, capital of El Salvador. New look: Looking clean shaven Alvarenga spoke briefly in a low voice at a press conference last week, thanking the government and his friends for their help . Boat: Willing Kajidrik also released a photo of police checking the 7-meter fishing boat of Jose Salvador Alvarenga after it was pulled onto the shore following his rescue, on Marshall Islands . Weak: Jose Salvador Alvarenga sits on a couch in Majuro in the Marshall Islands last Monday, after he was rescued from being washed ashore on the tiny atoll of Ebon in the Pacific Ocean . Having told doctors that he had kept . himself alive as he drifted across the Pacific for 14 months by eating . raw fish, the flesh of sea birds and turtles and drinking their blood . and his own urine, there was concern about his kidneys and liver. While . he looked in remarkably good health and overall condition when seen on . the atoll of Ebon after coming ashore for the first time since he had . set out on an ill-fated fishing expedition, his health deteriorated when . he was brought to Majuro. Father: A family picture of castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga holding his daughter Fatima . Such . was the concern of doctors that a day after he was released from . hospital and taken to a lagoon-side hotel to relax he was returned to . hospital and placed on a rehydration drip.

A . police guard was placed outside his room to prevent journalists talking . to him and every step was taken to ensure that details of his return . journey did not leak out. An . El Salvadorian diplomat who flew from Japan brought with him a special . passport-making kit, allowing him to prepare an emergency passport for . Alvarenga so he could pass through US airports on the way home. He also needed the document to enter his country of birth.","Jose Salvador Alvarenga washed ashore last month in Marshall Islands .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 09:42 EST, 13 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:45 EST, 13 February 2014 . An NSA employee who gave Edward Snowden his passwords in order to access classified information has resigned after the agency stripped him of his security clearance. Two others- one member of the military and one contractor- have both been banned from NSA facilities after being 'implicated' for helping Snowden. NBC News reports that the National Security Agency has launched an internal inquiry into Snowden and the way in which he was able to collect classified information while working as a consultant before releasing it publicly and causing an international debate over surveillance procedures. None of the individuals have been named, but the civilian employee who has been fired was apparently used as a way for Snowden to gain greater access to agency information. Trickery: A new memo finds that a civilian NSA employee logged into Snowden's computer at the hacker's request but didn't realize he was able to record his keystrokes and used the password at a later date . The unclassified memo, which was sent to both the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees on February 10, states that Snowden once asked the person to log into their account on Snowden's computer. 'Unbeknownst to the civilian, Mr Snowden was able to capture the password, allowing him even greater access to classified information,' the memo states according to NBC. This new report comes in contrast to what Snowden and some of his other former colleagues have described. Snowden, whose days are numbered under his temporary asylum status in Russia, previously claimed that he never deceived colleagues or used their passwords without them knowing. Defending their tactics: General Keith Alexander testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on December 11 saying that at the time they had three cases they were reviewing . He also said that in the rare instances where colleagues asked him to log in for them for whatever reason- for instance, if they were on holiday- he said he never used those opportunities to dig deeper into classified NSA data. The civilian employee may have been duped into giving his password to Snowden, the memo says that it still shows that they 'failed to comply with security obligations'. The civilian is the only one of the three to resign at this point, while the other two are having their cases reviewed by their superiors. No further details about the contractor and military member's involvement, or what prompted their credentials to be revoked. Ironic fashion statement: Snowden apparently wore a sweatshirt just like this one to work at the NSA and his colleagues thought it was just a funny fashion choice rather than a warning sign . The memo comes almost two months to the day since the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings with NSA Director General Keith Alexander. At the time, he said that they were 'currently reviewing' three cases. There has been no official confirmation that the three cases mentioned in this week's memo were the three that Alexander was referring to. If they are, however, it also does not make the timeline clear as to when the civilian resigned and when the other two were barred from NSA facilities in relation to both the December 11 hearing and the February 10 memo release.","New memo reveals that a civilian NSA employee logged into Snowden's computer but he captured the password and was able to use it later .

A 23-year-old legislative intern in Florida - who had hopes of going to law school next year - has been missing for over a week, and authorities are running short on credible leads in their effort to find him. Ryan Uhre, an intern in the Tallahassee office of state Representative Richard Stark, was last seen on February 2 - which was Super Bowl Sunday - at a bar just blocks from the Florida State Capitol. Sunday also was the last time he responded to text messages or phone calls from his family. Missing: Ryan Uhre - a 23-year-old legislative intern in Florida - has been missing since Super Bowl sunday . Vanished: Uhre was last seen leaving a bar in Tallahassee on February 2, and has not been heard from since . 'We're just still baffled why in one week we havenâ€™t heard a word from him,' his father, Michael Uhre, told NBCMiami. The night he disappeared, Uhre was at a bar in Tallahassee called Clyde & Costello's. Credit card records also indicate that he went to another nearby bar called Andrews Capital Grill and Bar. He was last seen wearing a white, Hawaiian-style t-shirt with surfing Santas on it. Different leads have taken law enforcement officials all across the state looking for Uhre after cell phone records showed that Uhre's cell phone had briefly been turned on and then quickly turned off near Pompano Beach in Fort Lauderdale - which is nearly 500 miles from Tallahassee - on Thursday. Uhre went to high school near Fort Lauderdale. Search: Uhre's family and law enforcement officials have been canvassing the entire state looking for the 23-year-old . Family members tell the Miami Herald that authorities also were investigating a possible sighting of Uhre and Rosie's Bar and Grill in the Wilton Manors section of Fort Lauderdale. Employees at the restaurant, however, say they couldn't remember whether they saw the 23-year-old. Uhre graduated from Florida State University in December and was planning on going to law school, his family says. In the meantime, he was interning in Representative Stark's office, but had been there just a few days before his disappearance. Intern: Uhre had started an internship with Florida Representative Richard Stark just days before his disappearance . 'In the few days that Ryan has worked with us, he demonstrated . exemplary knowledge and performance in all of his tasks,' Stark - who knows Uhre's father - said in a statement. 'My thoughts and prayers are with Ryan and his family, and I . sincerely hope that his disappearance will have a positive outcome.' At the moment, authorities don't suspect Uhre's disappearance is the result of foul play. Anyone with information about Uhre's whereabouts is asked to call the Tallahassee Police Department at 850-606-5800.","23-year-old Ryan Uhre was last seen on February 2 .

Disney has dropped the voice of Donald Duck in the Middle East after he said Israel should be demolished. Wael Mansour no longer works for the global corporation - whose founder Walt Disney was famously accused of being racist and anti-semitic - after he tweeted: 'I truly wish #Israel is demolished, I hate Zionism, I have so much hate inside me with every single child they murder or land they seize'. He insisted his message was 'anti-Zionist', claiming Israelis were 'just a bunch of Polish / Ethiopian immigrants roughly 70 years old'. Outrage: Wael Mansour has been dropped over this tweet, which said: 'I truly wish #Israel is demolished, I hate Zionism, I have so much hate inside me with every single child they murder or land they seize' Aw, phooey! Wael Mansour (left) said he was the Arabic voice of Donald Duck (right) for seven years . Quack? Mr Mansour received support and derision for his tweet, which came after he posted photos of himself dubbing cartoons which featured the Disney character into Arabic for use in the Middle East . He told his 5,000 Twitter followers: 'Disney decided I am no longer the official voice of DonaldDuck in it's middle-east dubbed cartoons because of an anti Zionism tweet. Proud!' His total has since rocketed to 30,000 followers. The media personality, who lives in the Egyptian capital Cairo, had previously posted photos of himself dubbing the character's famous quacking voice into Arabic. His tweet prompted outrage among some quarters when he posted it in August last year, drawing attention from the Jewish media and commentators on Twitter. One, Paolo Salom, told him: 'Israel is there to stay, u genocide lover. Try and think more to ur Arab Countries and how u are demolishing 'em from within.' Others, however, offered their support. Anger: Despite many people being offended, some of Mr Mansour's followers leaped to his support . Divisive: Walt Disney had a mixed reputation and was dogged by allegations of anti-Semitism . Mr Mansour is still a radio personality in Egypt, hosting a show on Cairo radio station MegaFM. Speaking to Jewish newspaper The Algemeiner in August, a Disney spokesman said Mr Mansour was employed by a 'third party in the past' and 'should not be painted as a Disney employee'. The spokesman added: 'Disney is a large, multinational corporation and we have policies guiding the correct behavior of all our employees.' Speaking to MailOnline today a Disney spokesman confirmed that view, adding: 'He's not an employee of Disney and he never has been. He's a contractor.' Pressed on whether there was a reason for Mr Mansour to speak out now, she said: 'If he does then that's for him to share. I don't have any information or background to share on that. 'There's nothing more to really say on the matter other than he's a contractor who's done work in that region for character voices, as we do the world over.' Mr Mansour said he had done . occasional voiceover work since 2006 with his last job believed to have . been shortly before his tweet last summer. War propaganda: Donald Duck in a hellish Nazi munitions factory in Disney's anti-Nazi propaganda film Der Fuerer's Face, which won the 1943 Academy Award for best animated film . Disney's founder, Walt Disney, long faced claims that he was anti-Semitic, racist and misogynistic. Last . month Meryl Streep used a speech to attack his reputation, saying the . cartoons legend was a 'gender bigot' who had â€˜formed and supported an . anti-Semitic industry lobby'. Mr Disney's niece Abigail came out in support of the comments, saying: 'I know he was a man of his times and I can forgive him, but Saving Mr Banks was a brazen attempt by the company to make a saint out of the man. A devil he was not. Nor an angel... So I say Brava Meryl.' Disney did, however, make pro-American anti-Nazi films for three years during the Second World War at the request of the U.S. armed forces. One of the films, Der Fuehrer's Face, pictured Donald Duck as a worker in a hellish Nazi munitions factory. It was used as propaganda to sell war bonds in the U.S. and won the 1943 Oscar for best animated film.","Wael Mansour said he was the Arabic voice of Donald Duck for seven years .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:34 EST, 12 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:48 EST, 13 February 2014 . Chelsea Clinton was the butt of jokes at Stanford University in the late 1990s as her father battled impeachment and fended off the national scandal of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. And first lady Hillary Clinton kept careful track of her experiences in the White House, especially during her ill-fated 1994 'HillaryCare' effort to nationalize the health care industry, confiding in long-time friend Diane Blair that she might one day need her notes for 'revenge.' The new revelations come from a previously unknown archive of Blair's papers, willed to the university after the political science professor passed away in 2000. The Washington Free Beacon first unearthed the treasure trove, setting off a mad scramble of journalists eager to scrape up the bombshell collection's remains. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE DOCUMENTS . Political science professor Diane Blair (R) kept meticulous notes of her conversations with Hillary Clinton . Photos like this 1992 post-victory snapshot made the rounds on TV at the height of the Clinton impeachment, drawing jeers from Stanford classmates of the then much older Chelsea (L) Hillary (C), kept notes about friends and foes during her 1994 attempt to reform the U.S. health care system, saying she would need them someday for 'revenge' Hillary Clinton told Blair that although her daughter Chelsea was a solid student at Stanford, her classmates mocked her whenever they saw family photos of the Clintons. '2 or 3 hissed; [it] just killed her,' Blair wrote in an excerpt found by ABC News. But she added that Hillary ultimately did ‘give Bill [Clinton] credit for being aware of pain and anguish he’s caused [Chelsea].' CNN spotted a reference to a question Hillary Clinton asked Blair about 'how best to preserve her general memories of the administration and of health care in particular.' On June 20, 1994, Blair's diary mentions that she asked Clinton why she would need notes about the episode. 'Revenge,' Clinton replied. She also predicted she would need recollections of her staff's insights for a future book project, according to Blair's diary on that same day, 'just to get it down while still fresh, so when everyone else is writing their books, she will have materials – dates, meetings, events, to write hers, and for at least that story to be told.' Other woman: Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern whose presidential affair launched the Clinton impeachment, testified in the Special Counsel investigation where the president later lied under oath . Chelsea (R) had to put up with Stanford classmates' jokes about her father's dalliance with Lewinsky, and with headlines like one the Daily Mail ran in 1996 . But Blair wrote the following January that Hillary decided not to keep any records of personal or 'intimate thoughts and conversations,' for fear of 'subpoenas' in years to come. Blair first befriended Bill Clinton, who later introduced her to his then-girlfriend Hillary. Her archived papers include a love letter to an unnamed woman, written by Bill Clinton. It's unclear why she had the letter, raising the possibility of a romantic relationship between the two. The Free Beacon noted that the intimate letter came with an attached photo of Bill playing the saxophone, telling his lover that 'I thought you might get a kick out of this – I was once even younger.' Blair was eight years older than the future president, who is one year older than his wife Hillary. Bill's reference to his 'even younger' self suggests that the letter was written to an older woman. Water under the bridge: As Hillary ran for president in 2008, Chelsea and Bill were by her side and all seemed forgotten . Fourteen years after the Drudge Report broke the news of the Lewinsky scandal and shamed the U.S. newsweekly that sought to cover it up, the Clintons were all smiles at Chelsea's 2010 wedding to millionaire banker Marc Mezvinzky, the son of a liberal former Pennsylvania congresswoman . The Blair archive caught political fire on Sunday for Hillary's reference to Monica Lewinsky as 'a narcissistic looney-tune.' Also drawing focus were the conclusions of a secret poll conducted by pollsters Celinda Lake and Stan Greenberg in 1992 that painted Hillary in a horible political light. 'While voters genuinely admire Hillary Clinton’s intelligence and tenacity, they are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman,' the public opinion gurus determined.

A note had been attached to a parcel containing a bomb that killed a retired Tennessee attorney and gravely injured his wife Monday, it was revealed today. Jon Setzer, 74, was pronounced dead from his injuries at the scene and 72-year-old Marion Setzer was in critical condition at Vanderbilt University Hospital, police said. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation officials declined to say what kind of parcel was sent to the couple’s Lebanon home. Scroll down for video . Targets: Jon Setzer, 74, died in the blast and his wife Marion Setzer, 72, is in critical condition . CNN reported Wednesday that the letter was discovered inside the home of the Setzer couple following the deadly blast. The contents of the note have not been revealed. Investigators . are still trying to determine how the parcel was delivered to the home. They are also looking into Mr Setzer's past to see if he had been . involved in any disputes over the course of his career as a bankruptcy lawyer. 'It doesn't make sense at all,' family friend Ken Caldwell told he station WTVF. 'When I've heard it said that it was targeted, I thought, well, they must have targeted the wrong person.' Setzer's former law partner, George Cate Jr, described his slain friend as a dedicated professional who in his spare time served as a pastor at several country churches. Cate, who first met Setzer when the two of them served in the Army Reserve, revealed that he and his wife had lost their son in a dog attack when the child was only 3 years old. In the years that followed, whenever the Setzers heard a news report about a child's death, they would reach out to the victim’s family to commiserate with them and offer them emotional support. Cate and Jon Setzer opened a law firm together in 1979, with the late attorney specializing in living trusts. Mr Setzer retired in the early 1990s due to growing health problems. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Officials would not say what kind of parcel was sent to the Setzer residence . Along with the TBI, agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were investigating at the home on a rural cul-de-sac. Official vehicles filled the yard of the red brick two-story home with white dormers Tuesday. ‘We will be here night and day trying to come to the quickest resolution to this issue as we can,’ Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said. Earlier, alcohol bureau spokesman Michael Knight said investigators had ruled out accidental causes like gas leak or electrical malfunction. Later authorities confirmed it was a package, but would not speculate on a possible motive behind the attack. Deadly blast: An officer and a dog inspect a fence near a home in Lebanon, Tenn., where police said a package exploded, killing 74-year-old Jon Setzer and injuring his wife . Shocking incident: A neighbor said Setzer and his wife had gone to the mailbox to retrieve a package at and returned to the house when the blast went off . According to a neighbor speaking to WZTV, Setzer and his wife had gone to the mailbox to retrieve a package at around 5pm Monday and returned to the house when the blast went off. The impact blew out windows and several rooms were damaged in their house located in the 500 block of Vance Lane just outside city limits. First responders who arrived on the scene pronounced Mr Setzer dead. The Lebanon Democrat reported that his wife was transported by a medical helicopter to Vanderbilt University Hospital for treatment. This afternoon, police announced an $8,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the case. Neighbors said the couple was friendly and sometimes looked after other people’s pets when they went out of town. Ongoing investigation: Officials said at a press conference Tuesday they are trying to determine the motive behind the bizarre attack . David Hughen arrived at his house about an hour after the blast Monday, and noticed that the front and back windows of the Setzer home had been shattered. ‘With the house as well-built as it was, it had to be a huge explosion,’ Hughen said of the home built four years ago. ‘It's just a huge mystery that a terrible thing has happened to good people.’ Crews in white hazardous materials suits were walking around the property on Tuesday. Another neighbor, Charles Thompson, said the blast in the small neighborhood has left him shaken. ‘It didn't appear that they were the kind of people this would happen to,’ Thompson said. ‘It's very scary.’ In a release, TBI officials asked residents to remain vigilant and contact police if they locate any suspicious packages. Records show Jon Setzer was a retired lawyer who specialized in bankruptcy cases.  State court system and bar association records show no public disciplinary actions against the victim.","Jon Setzer was pronounced dead on the scene while his 72-year-old wife was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition .

The National Security Agency's Korea division chief has been charged . with murder in the alleged beating death of his 3-year-old son who he . and his wife adopted from Korea just months before his tragic death. Brian . O'Callaghan, a decorated Iraq War veteran who was awarded the Marine . Corps Achievement Medal for his part in a gun battle that helped lead to . the rescue of captured soldier Jessica Lynch, is accused of beating his . adopted son, Hyunsu, so badly that he ultimately died two days after . the alleged beating. O'Callaghan's family, including his wife, Jennifer, say the boy's death was a tragic accident, and not murder. They say the NSA chief - who has top secret clearance with the agency - isn't capable of hurting the boy. Accused: Brian O'Callaghan is charged with the murder of his adoptive son, who police say had injuries 'from head to toe' Tragic: Hyunsu O'Callaghan (right), who the family calls Madoc, died of his injuries Feb. 3 at Children's National Medical Center . 'He was so loving of him,' a family member told the Washington Post. Montgomery County, Maryland, prosecutors, however, believe the boy's death was a case of cold-blooded murder. 'An absolutely horrific crime on an absolutely innocent young victim,' said Assistant State’s Attorney Donna Fenton, listing injuries to the . boy’s head, neck and back. 'Basically this child was beaten to death . from head to toe.' O'Callaghan contends that his son's death was the result of an accidental slip the boy suffered in the shower two days before he died. In a police interview, O'Callaghan told police that on the night of January 31, he helped the boy take a shower, noting that Madoc didn't like it when the water hit him. At the time, O'Callaghan's wife was out of town and his other son, a 7-year-old, was in a different part of the house. 'During the shower, Hyunsu was crying and upset,' Detective Mike Carin wrote in court papers, summarizing his conversation . with O’Callaghan. 'After the shower had ended, Hyunsu slipped in the . bathtub, falling backwards. As he fell, he hit his shoulder. Brian . consoled him and he went to bed without incident.' The following day, O'Callaghan took Madoc and his other son to to breakfast and then to a swim center, Carin wrote in his report. O'Callaghan and his sons returned home and Madoc took a nap. Bonded: Brian O'Callaghan, seen her with wife Jennifer, told police he had failed to bond with his adoptive son. Now he's charged with his murder . According to the report, at about 4 p.m. on February 1, O'Callaghan . went to check on Madoc during his nap. He says he noticed pink stains on . the boy's sheets and mucus coming out of his nose. O'Callaghan told police he changed the sheets on his son's bed and went back about an hour later to check on him again. When . he went back the second time, O'Callaghan noticed that the boy's . condition had gotten worse - he was unresponsive, O'Callaghan told . investigators, so he washed him off in a bathtub and then took him to . the hospital. At the hospital, 'O'Callaghan could not provide an explanation' for the boy's injuries. 'These . facts are strong, these facts are horrific, and what this man did to . this child is murder,' Fenton, the prosecutor, said in court. An . autopsy revealed that Madoc had injuries consistent with having been . beaten - he had  a 'fracture at the base of skull, bruises to . the forehead, swelling of the brain and wounds to other parts of the . body. There was also “blunt impact to the back from a linear and . triangular shaped object.' NSA: O'Callaghan currently works as a specialist on the Korean peninsula for the NSA . However, O'Callaghan's attorney, Steven McCool, said in court Tuesday that medical tests performed at the hospital don't support the findings in the autopsy. 'There was a full CT scan done of Madoc, and . there were no skull fractures,' he said. O'Callaghan and his wife . had to work through Catholic Charities to qualify to adopt a child with . special needs. Because of his honorable military background and current . job with the NSA, in October the couple was told they could adopt . Madoc. 'I find it impossible to believe that he’s been . indicted for murder because he’s worked so hard to get this baby,' O’Callaghan’s grandfather William Rose told the paper. 'He was so loving with him. He’s been so wonderful with his other . child. I’ve never seen him do anything that would make me believe he is . capable of that.' O'Callaghan has been charged with one count each of first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. he is being held without bond.","Brian O'Callaghan and his wife adopted the boy from Korea in October .

Z06 Corvette and 2009 White 1.5 Millionth Corvette. Two vehicles on loan from General Motors, a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder and 2009 ZR1 'Blue Devil', were also damaged, according to WKYT. Museum executive director Wendell Strode Strode has not released the total value of the damage, but said it was 'substantial'. 'There's a story behind every single one of them,' he told New York Daily News. 'I'm going to have to make a phone call and tell them we lost their babies.' According to automobile website ZePerfs.com, a 1993-1995 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 is priced at 76,200 Euros or $104,000. Moments before disaster: This video footage from the National Corvette Museum's security cameras captured the vintage cars on display seconds before they were gobbled up by the sinkhole .

Sinkholes are cavities in the land caused by underground water erosion and are common in Kentucky, which is one of the most famous karst areas in the world. This means springs flow under most of Kentucky's land. According to a University of Kentucky geological survey, sinkholes form in two ways. First, the roof of a cave becomes to weak to carry the bedrock above it and collapses. More commonly, however, is when bedrock under an area is dissolved and carried away under ground, causing the soil to slump. Tragic loss: Among the eight damaged cars are the vintage 1993 Ruby Red 40th Anniversary Corvette (top) and 1962 Black Corvette (bottom) Engineers have been called in to assess the situation at the 20-year-old museum. 'Before . we do anything, like remove the other cars, we want that assessment so . we know if thereâ€™s been any structural damage to the Sky Dome,' Strode . told courier-journal.com. 'Weâ€™ll try to get back to business as usual as soon as we can and keep moving forward.' Bowling Green city spokeswoman Kim Lancaster said the 40-foot-wide sinkhole has forced the closure of the Sky Dome - an original part of the facility was completed in 1994 - but the rest of the museum is open. Lancaster said information was still being gathered about what exactly happened, but this appeared to be the first incident of its kind at the property. Bowling Green sits in the midst of the state's largest karst region - the Western Pennyroyal area, where many of Kentucky's longest and deepest caves run underground. No injuries were reported and the damage has not been valued. Damaged: This 2001 Mallet Hammer Z06 Corvette was also swallowed by the sinkhole this morning . Vintage: One of the damaged cars was this 1993 ZR-1 Spyder, on loan from General Motors . Preservation Staff have managed to move some of the Corvettes out of the destroyed room to avoid further damage . The museum is set to host the 2014 Corvette Caravan in September, a celebration marking the 20th anniversary of the museum. Although the event is still a year away, 1,200 people already are registered for the 2014 Corvette Caravan that will mark the 20th anniversary of the National Corvette Museum.

This is the shocking moment a police officer shot a dog dead because it wouldn't stop barking. Officer Tarek Hassani, of the Filer Police Department in Idaho, was filmed firing his gun at point blank range after being called to the scene of a nine-year-old's birthday party where dogs were said to be wandering in the street. The clip, filmed on the police patrol car's dashboard recorder, outraged the seven-year-old Labrador's owner who accused the officer of being 'trigger happy', but incredibly the local police force will take no action as they say the officer was left with 'no choice' but to kill the 'aggressive' dog. Shooting: Tarek Hassani, of the Filer Police Department in Idaho, was filmed firing his gun a point blank range after being called to reports of dogs wandering in the street . Death: After being shot at point blank range, the dog is seen twitching on the floor and yelping in agony, before shuffling out of shot and dying . Beloved: Mr Clubb's labrador was called Hooch . The incident took place at around 5.30pm on Saturday after officers were called to reports of number of dogs escaping from a home in the town of Filer during a child's birthday party. One of the dogs in question was a seven-year-old black Labrador named Hooch, who acted as a service dog for Parkinson's disease sufferer Rick Clubb. It was Mr Clubb's son who was celebrating his ninth birthday at the time. Within seconds of arriving at the scene, the police officer was greeted by the barking Labrador, a Chihuahua and another unidentified dog, although none appeared to be displaying a particularly high level of aggression until Officer Hassani began shouting 'get back' and kicked one of them. When the dogs began snarling and barking in a more threatening way, Officer Hassani was seen pulling out his gun and shooting the Labrador at point blank range. Working: The seven-year-old black Labrador named Hooch acted as a service dog for Parkinson's disease sufferer Rick Clubb . The dog is then seen twitching on the floor and yelping in agony, before shuffling out of shot and dying. The shooting subsequently led to a heated exchange between Officer Hassani and Mr Clubb, who was not just unhappy that his dog was dead, but also that the killing took place directly outside his son's bedroom window. Mr Clubb was later given a fine for allowing his dogs to run loose in the neighbourhood. Revealing that Officer Hassani would not be facing any punishment over the incident, Filer Police Chief Tim Reeves said: 'He had to kick one to keep him away... Hassani had no choice but to put the Lab down after it kept taking an aggressive posture behind him.'","Officer Tarek Hassani was filmed shooting the dog at point blank range .

Jay Inslee said Tuesday he was suspending the use of the death penalty in Washington state, announcing a move that he hopes will enable officials to 'join a growing national conversation about capital punishment.' The Democrat said he came to the decision after months of review, meetings with family members of victims, prosecutors and law enforcement. 'There have been too many doubts raised about capital punishment, there are too many flaws in this system today,' Inslee said at a news conference. 'There is too much at stake to accept an imperfect system.' Suspended: Democratic Washington Governor Jay Inslee has suspended executions for as long as he is governor, he announced Tuesday . Reprieve: Inslee won't pardon death row inmates, but if their execution is scheduled while he is governor he will grant a reprieve to delay the sentence . Inslee said that the use of the death penalty is inconsistent and unequal. The governor's staff briefed lawmakers about the move on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Inslee's moratorium, which will be in place for as long as he is governor, means that if a death penalty case comes to his desk, he will issue a reprieve, which isn't a pardon and doesn't commute the sentences of those condemned to death. 'During my term, we will not be executing people,' said Inslee, who was elected in 2012. 'Nobody is getting out of prison, period.' Last year, Maryland abolished the death penalty, the 18th state to do so and the sixth in the last six years. Nine men await execution at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. The state Supreme Court just last month rejected a petition for release from death row inmate Jonathan Lee Gentry, sentenced for the murder of a 12-year-old girl in 1988. Debate: So far, 18 states have banned capital punishment as the debate over the death penalty wages on . Gentry could be the first execution in the state since September 2010, when Cal Coburn Brown died by lethal injection for the 1991 murder of a Seattle-area woman. A federal stay had recently been lifted in Gentry's case, and a remaining state stay on his execution was expected to be lifted this month. The decision by the governor comes following a recent decision by the state Department of Corrections, which is in the process of changing its execution protocol to allow witnesses to executions to see the entire process, including the insertion of intravenous catheters during a lethal injection. The new witness protocol, currently a draft that is in its final stages of approval, includes the use of television monitors to show the inmate entering the death chamber and being strapped down, as well as the insertion of the IVs, which had both previously been shielded from public view. Spared: If not for Inslee's order, Johnathan Lee Gentry could have been the first person executed in Washington in 10 years . Through public disclosure requests, The Associated Press had sought information about any potential changes to the execution protocols. State corrections officials spoke with the AP about the new procedures late last month. The change is in response to a 2012 federal appeals court ruling that said all parts of an execution must be fully open to public witnesses. That ruling was sparked by a case brought by The AP and other news organizations who challenged Idaho's policy to shield the insertion of IV catheters from public view, in spite of a 2002 ruling from the same court that said every aspect of an execution should be open to witnesses.","Inslee says 'too many doubts' have been raised about capital punishment to continue executing people .

Hundreds of skeletal remains have been found scattered around ranches along the U.S.-Mexico border, during a police search for missing people. The remains had been left in the open and burned, making identification difficult for the Mexican authorities. The discovery, announced by Coahuila state prosecutor spokesman Jesus Carranza on Monday, came as 12 bodies were unearthed in southern Mexico, and two months after 67 bodies were found in the west. Lost: Pictures of missing people hang in a public square as a support group for families tries to publicize their disappearance . Gone: Support group Fuundec displays photos of hundreds of missing people. Members of the group fear evidence from the ranches where the latest bodies were found will be contaminated . Such discoveries remain common despite government claims that the number of killings has gone down in the past year. Police in Coahuila haven't said whether an organized crime group is suspected in the discovery of skeletal remains, but the area is known to be dominated by the violent Zetas drug cartel. Officers have arrested 10 men, including four police officers suspected of aiding a criminal group, the state attorney general's office said in a press release. The police operation took place on ranches in 11 different towns around the border city of Piedras Negras, right across Eagle Pass, Texas, after interviews with family members and at least 32 former local officials. Usually, remains like these have been found in mass graves, but these were left on the surface in the region known as Five Springs, Carranza said. At some of the ranches, investigators found bullet casings as well as barrels of diesel fuel that was likely used to burn bodies. The remains were found on ranches around Piedras Negras, on the Mexico-U.S. border . 'We are still not sure how many skeletal remains and how many victims we are talking about,' Carranza said. 'But this operation was launched to try to locate missing people.' An organization that supports families of missing victims has gathered 321 cases between 2007 and 2013 in just Coahuila. Families were worried that the government contaminated the crime scenes after seeing images from local media showing the use of heavy machinery at the search sites. 'It makes you want to cry. It's unbelievable how they handle evidence. It just complicates the identification of the remains,' Guadalupe Fernandez, a member of Forces United for our Disappeared in Coahuila, said. Her son Jose Antonio Robledo, an engineer, went missing in 2009. The state prosecutors' office said it followed protocols of preservation in crime scene investigations. In Guerrero state, the attorney general's office said a dozen bodies were found Sunday in the town of Mexcaltepec by military personnel after they received an anonymous tip Saturday night. In the same state and only a few days before, members of armed self-defense groups found a clandestine grave in the town of Cajelitos near the state capital of Chilpancingo and reported the skeletons of three men and two women. Two months ago, authorities excavated for several days in recovering 67 bodies that had been bound or gagged in a remote town by Lake Chapala, a popular spot with tourists and American retirees. It is a region where the Knights Templar and New Generation drug cartels are fighting each other. Local police officers who confessed to handing over people to the New Generation organization led investigators to the scene, officials said.","Skeletal remains found during police search for missing people in Mexico .

Two men were arrested in Oklahoma on Monday for breaking into an apartment and using a carpet staple gun to staple a homeowner's lips together, authorities say. Police were called to the Windsor Village Apartments in Tulsa about 1:15 a.m. Monday to respond to an armed robbery that had occurred moments earlier. The robbery victims told police that three men kicked down the back door to their apartment and held four residents - including a 2-year-old child - at gunpoint and demanded they hand over drugs, cash and other valuables. Busted: Angel Rodriguez is one of two men suspected of robbing a house in Oklahoma and stapling a victim's lips together . The suspects then bound the victims with duct tape as they robbed the apartment. The victims, however, recognized two of the men who had broken into their home, and identified them to police as 21-year-old Angel Rodriguez, 21 and 19-year-old Mario Mediano. The victims told police that the men had lived next door to them in the apartment complex, but they had been evicted after one of the victims reported them for using drugs,. The alleged thugs made off with multiple phones, tablets, a purse, wallets and then fled the scene in a stolen 2012 black Dodge Challenger, police said. Before fleeing in the stolen car, authorities say the men stapled one of the victim's lips together with the staple gun. Oops: The suspects were arrested after Mario Mediano posted on Facebook that he was at a local burger restaurant . 'Apparently, these people reported drug use and thatâ€™s why the suspects . were initially evicted from next door,' Tulsa Police Department Cpl. Brandon Disney told KFOR. 'One of the victims tonight had a . staple from a carpet staple gun put in his face, on his upper lip, so . two small puncture marks. EMSA removed that.' He says the stapling of the victim's lips could have served as a warning to the victims to not cooperate with police. Nobody else in the home was injured. After the three suspects left the house, authorities used social media to track them down after Rodriguez posted on Facebook that he was heading to a nearby Whataburger. Neighbors: The two suspects are neighbors of the victims but were recently evicted for drug use . Rodriguez and Mediano were arrested at th Whataburger about 3 a.m. The third suspect, described as a white male, about 5-foot-6 and 180 pounds remains at-large. Rodriguez and Mediano likely will be charged with first-degree robbery, armed robbery and other charges relating to the stolen vehicle.","Two of the suspects were arrested when one posted on Facebook that he was at a local burger restaurant .

Militant Islamists on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula appear to have threatened tourists saying they should leave 'before it's too late'. The warning came after three South Koreans and a driver were killed in an bomb attack on a bus on Sunday in Taba, near the border with Israel.

Egyptian officials have called the attack a suicide bombing, but the statement did not contain the usual phrasing, such as the word 'martyr' or 'God bless his soul' used in previous claims for attacks in which the bomber also died.

The rooms are adorned with furniture from the Jacobean, Georgian and Victorian eras and even comes with tapestries and suits of armour which can be bought separately. Fit for a king: Caverswall Castle, near  Stoke-on-Trent, dates back to 1275 and is on the market for £3million . But like with any property this size, there are huge running costs. Its current owner, property developer Robin MacDonald, says the oil, gas, electricity and water billsamount to £10,000 to £12,000 year alone and that is before any repairs. He bought the castle eight years ago for £1.7million and has spent £1million doing it up. One of the main reasons why Mr MacDonald has decided to sell is because of an ongoing battle with the council planning department. Grandeur: The rooms are adorned with furniture from the Jacobean, Georgian and Victorian eras . The castle, classified for residential use, was briefly used as a wedding venue but this was stopped because the correct planning permission had not been sought. An application has been submitted for the castle to be transformed into a 'fat camp' where people can eat healthily and exercise but Mr MacDonald is still awaiting a decision. According to Mr MacDonald, town hall bosses have suggested that the castle could be turned into aboutique hotel. There are also three converted turret cottages with self-containing living quarters includingbedrooms and lounges. One of the main reasons why Mr MacDonald has decided to sell is because of an ongoing battle with the council planning department . Previous residents include the Wedgwood pottery family who lived in the castle between 1878 and 1890. However they too were forced to leave, according to English Local History, because they found the castle 'damp, cold and in need of constant repairs.' Robin MacDonald stands in front of the castle he bought eight years ago which is back on the market . Mr MacDonald told Bricks & Mortar in The Times: 'When I bought it, it was a shell. 'It had been a long time since anyone with money had owned it, so it was in a state of neglect. I originally came across it on Rightmove, I was looking for a nice home to retire to - not that that happened - and this moated castle popped up. I thought to myself, ""Wow, it's a castle.""' The . property is on the market with Strutt & Parker estate agency and . the 20,000 sq ft floorplan spans five pages in the marketing brochure. David Henderson, a partner at Strutt & Parker, said the castle had been owned by a 'succession ofsuccessful people who wanted a statement of wealth and power.' He also said it was very rare to find a moated castle on the market for sale these days. As for Mr MacDonald, he is planning to downsize and plan more time with his young family. But he added: 'I don't see us moving from Caverswall to a two-up, two-down, put it that way.' Robin MacDonald bought the house eight years ago for £1.7million and has spent £1million renovating it .

The penthouse apartment owned by disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile has been sold for the second time since he died there in 2011. The fifth-floor property, which he lived in for more than 30 years, was bought for £300,000, despite its poor state and the fact some of Savile's garish 1970s features remain inside. It was bought for £250,000 a year ago, but the owners expected the property, which has impressive  views of Roundhay Park, to fetch £325,000. Lair: The property was bought by Savile in the 1970s. He died there on October 11, 2011, aged 84 . Cut-price: His lair was snapped up for £300,000 - £25,000 below what the previous owners wanted . The description of the property says it is not 'for the faint-hearted or DIY enthusiast' and needed a 'complete development'. The description on property website Rightmove says: 'Enjoying outstanding panoramic views over Roundhay Park and Waterloo Lake, all the way round to Soldiers Field is a fifth floor penthouse apartment which requires complete redevelopment, yet offers scope and potential for discerning buyers to create what could be a unique and enviable home. 'The apartment has lift access via a private code and the lift opens directly into the apartment's hallway. 'The current accommodation has windows to three elevations providing panoramic views with a wrap-around balcony which includes terrace areas to both the front and rear elevations. 'There is a large split level living room, kitchen, master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two further bedrooms and an en-suite shower room. There is a double garage with electric door, situated in the underground garage.' The flat formed part of the extensive investigation into Savile's sordid past. West Yorkshire Police probed his hosting of 'breakfast clubs', where officers would visit his flat for coffee and cake. Malcolm and Angela Statman, Savile's neighbours, intended to knock down the property when they bought it over a year ago for £250,000, according to The Sunday Mirror. They said it was in a 'terrible condition', but opted against the renovation and instead decided to sell, making a £50,000 profit. Land registry documents show a couple are the new owners of the penthouse. Balcony: The three-bedroom flat is three miles from Leeds city centre and has views of Roundhay Park . Decor: The gaudy pink and black kitchen in Savile's former apartment. It did not have an oven or hob as Savile preferred to eat out . Changes: The apartment requires extensive refurbishment. This room, with its blue shagpile carpet, still holds exercise equipment and posters from Savile's wrestling days . They confirmed they knew the disgraced DJ had previously owned it but would not comment on why they purchased the property. The flat was bought by Savile in the 1970s. He died there on October 11, 2011, aged 84. It can only be accessed through a private lift with a pass code. A pine-panelled hallway leads to a large lounge with a stained blue shagpile carpet. The kitchen is covered in pink tiles and has no cooker as the former DJ usually chose to eat out. In the master bedroom, the wallpaper is peeling and damp patches cover the walls. However there is an en-suite bathroom. Past: The 1970s-style bathtub is pictured with a Jim'll Fix It badge wrapped round a tap . Security: A private lift for the sole use of visitors to the penthouse opens up on to a hallway that looks straight out of the 1970s .

In September 2012 . allegations that Savile had sexually abused under-age girls and boys, and adults, became widely reported.

Eighteen patients in North Carolina may have been exposed to a fatal brain disorder similar to 'mad cow' disease after undergoing surgery with instruments that had not been properly sterilised. Surgeons at the Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem operated on the patients on January 18 using tools that had been used on a man suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the hospital said in a press statement. The surgical instruments were sterilised using standard hospital procedures, but were not subjected to the enhanced sterilisation procedures necessary on instruments used in confirmed or suspected cases of CJD, the hospital added. Patients have been put at risk of contracting the human form of 'mad cow' disease after they were operated on at the Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center (above) using tools that had not been sufficiently sterilised . Jeff Lindsay, president of the medical center, said at a news conference, said: 'On behalf of the entire team at Novant Health, I apologise to the patients and their families for having caused this anxiety.' CJD causes failing memory, blindness, involuntary movement and coma, and kills 90 per cent of patients within one year, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The possibility of contracting the disease through surgical exposure is very remote, the hospital said. Julie Henry, spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is aware of the possible exposure of the 18 patients and is closely monitoring the situation. Apology: The surgical instruments were sterilised using standard hospital procedures, but were not subjected to the enhanced sterilisation procedures necessary in confirmed or suspected cases of CJD, the hospital said (file picture) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. Symptoms include memory loss, change of personality, abnormal jerking movements and blindness. The incubation period can last years before initial symptoms surface, but most sufferers will die within around four months of when they do emerge. The exact origin of CJD is not clear, but it appears to be caused by an abnormal protein called a prion which causes irreversible damage to nerve cells. One form of the disease, known as variant CJD, is thought to be caused by consuming meat from cows infected with BSE - also known as 'mad cow disease'. There is currently no cure. CJD is similar to mad cow disease, but is not linked to beef consumption. The incubation period - before initial symptoms surface - can last years, the statement said. After the first sign of symptoms, most patients die within four months, it said. There are no treatments for the disease, which affects about 300 Americans each year, it said. Every year, one in a million people around the world is diagnosed with the disease, which can be contracted through organ transplants or operations, said Florence Kranitz, president of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation. 'This is not something where there is a possibility they could operate and get rid of it,' Kranitz said. 'It is a 100 per cent fatal brain disease robbing its victims of their humanity pretty fast,' she said. Last year, health officials said at least . 15 patients in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire may have . been exposed to the disease in a case similarly tied to unsanitary . surgical instruments.","Tools had been used on man suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease .

The NSA has been graphing American’s social networks and plotting them as they do organized crime since at least 2010, according to the latest published Edward Snowden leak. The highly secretive intelligence agency has been mapping out American citizens’ social connections – identifying associates, determining locations, and logging who they talk to – by taking advantage of loosened rules previously meant to restrict surveillance actions. As far back as November, 2010, the agency authorized spies to conduct ‘large-scale graph analysis on very large sets of communications metadata without having to check foreignness,’ the New York Times revealed Saturday. Mapped out: THe NSA has been putting together diagrams of people's social networks similar to how the FBI maps out criminal organizations . The agency augmented that information with bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls, property records and tax data, the Times further divulged. There does not appear to be any restriction on the types of data culled, or who it is gather on, the Times noted. First disclosed to the Times by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, the documents provided to the paper did not divulge how many Americans were surveilled, nor do the documents  detail who – if anyone – was snagged by the extensive spying. Asked about the agency’s spying on Americans, an agency spokesperson told the Times that ‘all data queries must include a foreign intelligence justification, period.’ Wanted man: Edward Snowden has been granted a one year asylum in Russia while he continues to leak NSA documents to the press . ‘All of N.S.A.’s work has a foreign intelligence purpose,’ the spokeswoman added. ‘Our activities are centered on counterterrorism, counterproliferation and cybersecurity.’ The agency’s spying was detailed enough to ‘pick up sensitive information like regular calls to a psychiatrist’s office, late-night messages to an extramarital partner or exchanges with a fellow plotter,’ the Times explained. ‘Knowing things like the number someone just dialed or the location of the person’s cellphone is going to allow them to assemble a picture of what someone is up to,’ law professor Orin Kerr told the Times. ‘It’s the digital equivalent of tailing a suspect.’ Requests by the agency for this capability date as far back as 2006, when the NSA asked the Justice Department for permission to spy on phone and email data, the Times noted. First denied permission by the Bush administration, President Obama’s predecessor green lit the operation shortly before leaving office in 2008, according to the Times. Not long after that, the agency modified policies to permit spying ‘without regard to the nationality or location of the communicants,’ the Times reported. Nerve center: An aerial view of The National Security Agency and Central Security Service (NSA CSS) building . Additionally, the agency’s main phone call and email-linking tool, called Mainway, was being fed at least 1.1billion mobile phone records a day from an unnamed mobile operator during the height of its use in August 2011. GPS services such as TomTom were also used to further enrich the personal mapping of American citizens’ daily activities, the paper reported. All of this data can be held for ‘up to five years online and for an additional 10 years offline for “historical searches,’ said the Times.","The NSA has been mapping American citizens' social networks since 2010 .

Both the floors and walls are lined with bamboo plywood . The compost toilet is used for the garden outside, while the red walls are covered with sheet metal . The finished product also features many innovative and environmentally-friendly qualities, starting with the 'upcycle' of the container itself. Built into the roof is a garden that provides air-flow to reduce the amount of heat retained by the container. The garden is watered by an irrigation system that uses grey water from the sink and shower. The bathroom is a composting toilet. The interior is insulated with spray foam then lined with bamboo plywood, equally appropriate for the floor as the walls. The rooftop garden helps stop the container from retaining heat from the sun . The emphasis was on sustainable strategies-- first, the recycling of a container for a new and permanent use .

'Killer driver': Marek Wojciechowski, 26, pictured with his wife Agnieszka, 'deliberately' crashed into an Irish family's car - killing a father, his unborn child and his son . A woman lost her husband, toddler son and unborn child when a suicidal driver ploughed head-on into their car, an inquest heard yesterday. Elber Twomey, 36, was the only survivor of the crash caused by taxi driver Marek Wojciechowski, who had earlier written a suicide note after splitting up from his wife. Wojciechowski died, along with Mrs Twomey’s husband Con, their 16-month-old son Oisin, and the baby she was carrying. She was 24 weeks pregnant. After reading his suicide note, Wojciechowski’s wife alerted police, who followed him but were unable to stop him before he smashed into the family’s vehicle. Oisin was killed immediately and Mr Twomey, who was 39, suffered serious brain injuries and died ten months later. The crash happened on the last day of the family’s summer holiday in Devon. An inquest into the deaths heard that Polish-born Wojciechowski, 26, had left a four-page suicide note after breaking up with his wife Agnieszka. She alerted police who spotted his vehicle and turned on their siren and flashing lights. But instead of stopping, witnesses say Wojciechowski sped on, veering across into the opposite carriageway and straight at the Twomeys’ car making it ‘impossible’ for the family to avoid him. Elber Twomey (right) survived the collision but her baby, Oisin, husband, Con, and their unborn child were killed . Crash scene: The Polish taxi driver's Vauxhall Vectra (right) crashed into the Irish family's Volkswagen Gold (left) in Torquay, Devon . Crash victims: Con Twomey (right) suffered a severe brain injury and died 10 months after the crash in July last year. His wife Elber (left) survived the collision but lost her unborn baby girl . Before the crash, Wojciechowski spent 40 minutes driving his black taxi 12 two-mile circuits around the Hamelin Way loop . Witness John Onions said he still suffered flashbacks after letting the Twomeys’ VW Golf overtake him at an earlier junction. Describing . the collision, Mr Onions told the inquest into the deaths of Oisin and . Wojciechowski that the Pole’s Vauxhall Vectra ‘just took off’. He continued: ‘It just went straight across into the car in front of me. ‘It . sounds awful now, but the crash looked deliberate. It decided to . accelerate and go straight across the road. The image was that the . Vectra seemed to shoot straight across. ‘It was impossible for them to do anything. The oncoming car decided to turn and go straight into it. It’s as simple as that.’ He added: ‘It dawned on me afterwards that if I hadn’t let them in, it would have been me.’ Wojciechowski was arrested at the scene and taken to hospital but died from his injuries later that day. The . inquest in Torquay heard how the Pole had driven up and down the same . stretch of road for 39 minutes before finally ploughing into the . Twomeys’ car. CCTV . cameras recorded him driving in a continuous two-mile loop between two . roundabouts in Torquay before he was spotted by police. PC . Ben Bickford approached with his lights flashing and siren sounding in . an attempt to get him to pull over but Wojiechowski sped on. The . officer told the jury he spotted a black car driving in the opposite . carriageway and followed ‘on a hunch’ to see if it was Wojiechowski. Crash victim Elber Twomey (left) leaves the coroner's court today after hearing evidence about the crash which killed her husband, toddler son and unborn baby girl . Split: Agnieszka Wojiechowska, the Polish taxi driver's wife, who raised the alarm and said he had left a suicide note . He drove between 70 and 80 mph to catch up with the Vectra and flashed his lights four times to signal the driver to pull over. Crash victim: Oisin, aged 16 months, was killed in the accident on the last day of his family's holiday in England . PC . Bickford said: ‘When I saw that he wasn’t going to stop I pulled back. I . am not a trained pursuit driver. The driver was aware of my presence. 'As . we approached the single carriageway he made a deliberate act of . accelerating and driving straight into the other carriageway. ‘The back end of the vehicle dipped dramatically, turning directly into an oncoming car. I was just in shock.’ Mrs Twomey asked questions through her barrister about the lack of a specific police procedure to deal with suicidal drivers. But Chief Superintendent James Nye told the court that PC Bickford was operating within standard police procedures. He . added: ‘No one foresaw that outcome. It is tragic and it affected the . whole policing community but it was in line with guidelines.’ The court heard Wojciechowski’s suicide note said he did not blame his wife for their split and that he loved their children. He had taken a job as a taxi driver working six nights a week after the couple got into financial difficulties. Interviewed . by police a week after her husband’s death, Mrs Wojciechowski, a . housekeeper, blamed herself for the accident in July 2012. She . told officers: ‘Marek wasn’t coping well. He didn’t kill himself – I . killed him. I took hope away from him. I took everything away from him.’ Anguish: Con Towmey's coffin is carried out of St Joseph's Church, in Meelin, Cork, in May. He never recovered from a brain injury sustained in the collision and died 10 months after the crash in July last year . Mr Twomey was transported back to a hospital near his native Cork in Ireland but died in May. It is understood his wife visited his bedside on a daily basis before his death. The inquest continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 01:41 EST, 11 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:04 EST, 11 February 2014 . A pregnant Canadian woman who was declared braindead more than a month ago gave birth to a healthy baby boy this weekend. She was taken off life support and passed away one day later. Doctors were keeping Robyn Benson, of Victoria, British Columbia, alive in the hopes that her young son could have a few more weeks to develop. Their gambit appears to have paid off on Saturday when Mrs Benson delivered Iver Cohen Benson at 28 weeks. Mrs Benson's husband, Dylan Benson, posted a picture of himself holding his tiny son on his Facebook page. Joy: Dylan Benson posted a photo of him with his brand new son Iver Cohen after he was born on Saturday. His mother was braindead for six weeks before she gave birth . He updated his tens of thousands of supporters about the news, which was both joyous and heartbreaking. 'It is with a heavy heart but also with extreme proudness that I am posting this update,' he wrote. 'On Saturday evening, my beautiful and amazing son, Iver Cohen Benson, was born. Iver is healthy and is the cutest and most precious person I have ever met. 'As to be expected, it will still be a bumpy ride for he and I as he continues to grow under the care of the wonderful staff at the hospital.' Mrs Benson was 22 weeks pregnant when she suffered a massive and inexplicable brain hemorrhage on December 28. There was nothing doctors could do to save her. However, they were able to give her son six more weeks to develop. At 28 weeks, Iver was born very premature. In love: Dylan and Robyn Benson at their wedding last July. The couple had been high school sweethearts. She was declared dead on Sunday . Mr Benson also shared sad news with his friends: . 'On . Sunday, we had to unfortunately say goodbye to the strongest and most . wonderful woman I have ever met. I miss Robyn more than words can . explain. 'I could not . be more impressed with her strength, and I am so lucky to have known . her. She will live on forever within Iver, and in my heart.' His Facebook status update was shared by more than 4,700 people in just a day. Mr Benson was able to raise more than $144,000 to pay for his wife's funeral and to support his son's future. Hope: A scan shows baby Iver who is growing healthily despite his mother being declared brain dead . In an interview last month, Mr Dylan said he awaited his son's arrival with the same mixed emotions he expressed in Sunday's Facebook post. 'On one hand, I canâ€™t wait to meet my son and try, and give him the best life possible and try my hardest to be a great dad for him. On the other hand, I know that the day or the day after he is born will be the day that I have to say goodbye to Robyn,' Mr Benson told CBC. Although Mrs Benson has been declared brain dead, doctors are trying to keep her body alive for another seven weeks, so the baby can be safely delivered by cesarean section. 'Pretty much her body is doing everything but her brain isn't there anymore,' he said, adding that he recently felt the baby kicking for the first time. The couple, who had been high school sweethearts, married in July and were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of their first child. When the baby is born, Mr Benson plans to call him Iver - a name the couple had chosen before Mrs Benson's sudden illness. On the morning that she suffered the brain hemorrhage, Mrs Benson had woken with a piercing headache and asked her husband to go out and buy painkillers. When he returned, Mrs Benson was slumped unconscious in the bathroom. Tough times: Dylan Benson is keeping a vigil at the bedside of wife, Robyn, who is being kept on life support until their son is born . She was rushed to hospital but the following day, on December 29, she was declared brain dead. Mr Benson, who works for an IT company, has had to take time off work to keep a vigil at his wife's bedside. A You Caring fundraising site has been set up to help Mr Benson, who will be welcoming a baby into the world at the same time as burying his wife. Initially, the family hoped to raise $36,000 - enough to cover Mrs Benson's annual salary - but in an outpouring of support for Mr Benson and baby Iver, more than C$115,000 ($103,000) has been raised. In an update on Iver's progress, Mr Benson posted a message on the site saying how touched he was by the support. He added: 'We had another ultrasound today and things are still looking good for Iver, and Robyn is still holding on strong.' Money raised through the fund will be used to pay for baby supplies, daycare, housing and an education fund for Iver. 'It is very difficult to know that our son will grow up never meeting his wonderful mother, and that we will have to say our goodbyes to Robyn within hours of seeing Iver for the first time,' Mr Benson said.","Robyn Benson was 22 weeks pregnant when she had a massive brain hemorrhage that left her braindead .

Attempting to reach an agreement on the key issue at the G20 summit - military intervention in Syria - looked futile this afternoon as leaders wrapped up with closing speeches. Russian president Vladimir Putin said strikes against Syria would be 'counter productive' and disrupt the world economy. While David Cameron warned the international community that it cannot 'contract out' its morality by allowing Russia to block intervention in crises such as that engulfing Syria. Happy families: The world's leaders pose for a 'family photo' at the G20 summit in St Petersburg where opinion remains deeply divided over intervention in Syria . Opinion is deeply divided among the G20 nations, which met at St Petersburg, Russia, on the critical issue of Syria and what role the international community should play. President Putin, a belligerent ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, has been revelling in British MPs' rejection last week of UK participation in US-led military action. He said in a press conference after his final speech that more countries at the summit opposed military intervention in Syria than supported it. He said only the US, France, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Turkey backed the use of force against the Assad regime. US President Barack Obama (R) talks with Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff (C) as Mexicos President Enrique Pena Nieto looks on before the 'family photo' is taken . World leaders at the G20 summit on Friday failed to bridge their bitter divisions over US plans for military action against the Syrian regime . While David Cameron has flown the flag for military intervention, Putin reminded reporters that the British parliament had rejected the idea. Of Germany, he said the Chancellor was 'cautious' and 'is not going to participate any military action'. Putin claimed the public opinion in those countries backing strikes was against such a move. Of those opposing military action he said: 'Who was condemning and opposing that way of action? Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Argentinian, Brazil, South Africa, Italy. And also the secretary general of the UN voiced his protest against military intervention. And let's not forget the address by the Pope, who directly voiced the inadmissibility of military intervention.' Russian president Vladimir Putin said strikes against Syria would be 'counter productive' and disrupt the world economy. 'We stuck to our guns,' Putin said according to a live translation. Host: Russia's President Vladimir Putin has hinted that he would be prepared to help Syria should Obama push U.S. military intervention . Stance: Russia's President Vladimir Putin (2L) has said military intervention would be 'counter productive' and 'disrupt the world economy' David Cameron, meanwhile, continued to advocate for military intervention and criticised the decision-making process of the UN Security Council. The Prime Minister insisted military action had to be possible without an endorsement from the UNSC. He said:'If we are saying there can only be a response if the UN security council votes positively, we are in fact contracting out our foreign policy, our morality to the potential of a Russian veto. 'That is a very misguided approach. That was what was frustrating in some ways about the debate last night. Some of the participants were saying this has to be decided by the UN security council, knowing that they sat on the security council and could veto any decision.' All smiles: While the leaders laughed in unison for the G20 'family photo' they were unable to reach consensus on the critical matter of Syria . Mr Cameron said he believed there was a case for taking action to prevent a humanitarian emergency. He added: 'We should have learned from some of the genocides in our world that there is an imperative for a line to be drawn.' Taking to the stage this afternoon, US president Barack Obama, told reporters he was 'listening to all ideas' on Syrian foreign policy, but said: 'So far we have not seen any ideas emerge that as a practical matter that would be capable of of doing the job.' The president refused to be drawn on whether the US would strike Syria without approval from Congress - a position UK is now in. Obama dodged the question, saying: 'You're not going to get a direct response.' Earlier in the day President Obama held a surprise meeting with the Russian President. Putin said the discussion focused on Syria during the 20 to 30 minutes and that while the two leaders disagreed he said the meeting was 'substantial and constructive'. The meeting came Friday as Obama sought to build international backing for military action. But three days after he left Washington, it's unclear whether the global coalition the president has been seeking is any closer to becoming a reality. Putting up stiff resistance to Obama's appeals, Russia on Friday warned the United States and its allies against striking any chemical weapon storage facilities in Syria. The Russian foreign ministry said such targeting could release toxic chemicals and give militants or terrorist access to chemical weapons. 'This is a step toward proliferation of chemical weapons not only across the Syrian territory but beyond its borders,' the Russian statement said. Moreover, China remained a firm no. The . European Union is skeptical about whether any military action can be . effective. Even Pope Francis weighed in, urging leaders gathered here to . abandon what he called a 'futile mission'. Angela Merkel looks distracted as the G20 leaders wave fr the camera . World leaders look no closer to agreeing on international military intervention to stop the conflict in Syria . Still, Obama was undeterred. He and French President Francois Hollande, the US's strongest ally on Syria and a vocal advocate for a military intervention, met on the sidelines of the summit about attracting European support for action. 'It's clear that there are many countries that agree with us that international norms must be upheld,' Obama said. Holland told reporters invited into their meeting that they came to summit 'wanting as large a coalition as possible,' but without saying whether they picked up more support for military intervention. 'To do nothing would mean impunity,' Hollande said. 'We must take our responsibility' and act. As the president pressed his case on the world stage, he was dispatching his UN ambassador, Samantha Power, to a Washington think tank to argue that the global community cannot afford the precedent of letting chemical weapons use go unpunished. Illustrating the risks associated with a strike, however, the State Department on Friday ordered nonessential US diplomats to leave Lebanon, a step under consideration since Obama said he was contemplating military action against the Syrian regime last week. The travel warning said it had instructed nonessential staffers to leave Beirut and urged private American citizens to depart Lebanon. In Syria, conflict raged today as people were pictured fleeing flames and caused by a bomb hit Binnish town, Idlib province, Syria . Devastation: A video, obtained from the Shaam News Network, showed the devastation and destruction in the immediate aftermath of the bomb . The video, authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, showed smoke rising from further bombardments and clashes between Free Syrian army fighters and government forces in Binnish, Idlib province . Yet even as Obama sought the global buy-in that could legitimise a potential strike, his aides were careful to temper expectations that the world community could speak with one voice. Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said the president wasn't asking his peers to pledge their own militaries to a US-led strike, but simply to say they agree a military response is warranted. 'We don't expect every country here to agree with that position,' Rhodes said Friday at the Group of 20 economic summit, where Obama was huddling with foreign leaders. Standing on Russian soil, Rhodes suggested the US had given up hope that Russia - a stalwart Syria ally - could be coerced into changing its position. 'We don't expect to have Russian cooperation,' he said.","Putin says Syria military intervention would be 'counter-productive'

A partially-sighted woman who suffered crippling back pain killed herself after her disability benefits were stopped following an assessment lasting just two minutes, it has been claimed. Despite being in almost constant agony, Jacqueline Harris, 53, was told she was told fit for work in November 2012 following a Government health assessment. Ms Harris's sister claims that the ruling drove the former nurse, from Kingswood, Bristol, to take her own life. Tragic: Half-blind Jacqueline Harris, who suffered crippling back pain,   killed herself after her disability benefits were stopped, it has been claimed . Widow Ms Harris was only able to walk with the aid of sticks after she suffered slipped discs in her back and neck. She was also unable to use one wrist properly after she was later attacked by a dog. Her sister Christine Norman, 57, says arthritic Ms Harris was asked just one question in the 'lightning-speed assessment', carried out by private firm Atos Healthcare. Mrs Norman said: 'They asked her one question - ""Did you get here by bus?"". 'Jacqueline replied with one fateful word - ""yes"". 'She hadn't even had the chance to take her coat off. 'Jacqueline said couldn't do it anymore and that no-one was listening to her and no-one cared. She told me she couldn't work and that nobody believed her. 'She just wanted her benefit so she could have avoided the pressure of work - it wasn't a massive amount of money.' Ms Harris suffered from arthritis in her neck and back and her pain worsened after an unsuccessful operation on her neck last year. She was left in agony every time one of her arms was touched, while bones from her hand had to be removed after she was attacked by a dog. Anger: Christine Norman says her sister Ms Harris committed suicide after being put under pressure by the Government to return to work . Ms Harris had received incapacity benefit but late last year was asked to attend a fitness-to-work assessment in order to claim its replacement - Employment and Support Allowance. After she spent two hours struggling on two different buses to get to the centre run by Atos Healthcare her appointment lasted just two minutes. In January her benefits were stopped. Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) replaced the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) as part of the government's welfare reforms. Under DLA, most people filled in their own application forms, and did not have to re-apply for the benefit, even if their circumstances changed. The government claimed PIPs would see resources delivered to those who need it most - as money would be distributed more fairly. But one charity warned almost a fifth of claimants - 600,000 people - could be in danger of losing their benefits as they would be put through strict in-person tests. Since April new claimants in the north of England were told to apply for PIPs. By October new claimants of working age in the rest of the country were told to apply for the new benefit rather than a DLA. The government began to re-assess existing DLA claimants last month, but only those whose circumstances changed. A majority of the 3.2 million people who claimed DLA will not be re-assessed until 2015 or later. Mrs Norman, a nurse, said: 'If she was addicted to alcohol or drugs, she would have been given a sick note. 'Being a nurse and a health professional I am so disappointed - anyone could see she wasn't fit to work. She would have loved to have had a job but couldn't. 'How much grief, pain and anguish do you have to go through before they realise?' It is believed she was later then reassessed after coming forward with additional evidence of her condition, and was found to be eligible for Employment Support Allowance. She was placed in a category of people who receive the allowance, and who one day - with support - may be able to return to work. But Ms Harris had contested the ruling and her first appeal against the decision failed. A second Department for Work and Pensions tribunal hearing in Cardiff was due to take place on November 15. However, Ms Harris was found dead at her home on November 2, having taken a suspected overdose. Paying tribute to her sister, who lost her husband Brian six years ago, Mrs Norman said: 'She was gregarious and loved dogs, and music and to boogie as much as her back would allow. An inquest into Ms Harris' death has been opened and adjourned. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: 'Our sympathy goes out to the family of Mrs Harris. ' ‪ A decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken following a thorough assessment which takes into account the WCA and all supporting medical evidence provided by the claimant. ‬ . ‪'Often claimants come forward later with additional evidence, in which case we will look at their claim again or people can also appeal.‬ . 'Someone placed in the work-related activity group for ESA is not considered fit for work at the moment, nor are they expected to look for work.‬' An Atos spokeswoman said: 'Our sympathies go out to Ms Harris's family. 'Atos Healthcare carries out assessments on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions and under its guidelines. 'But we do not make decisions on people's benefit entitlement, nor are we involved in the appeal process.'

Killed: Syrian Islamist leader Abu Khalid al-Suri, pictured, was killed in a suicide attack on a compound in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo . Two suicide bombers killed a senior al-Qaida operative on Sunday, blowing themselves up inside the militant leader's compound in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, rebels and activists said. The killing of Abu Khaled al-Suri, who rebels said was serving as al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri's representative in Syria, falls against the backdrop of bloody rebel infighting between an al-Qaida-breakaway group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and an array of ultraconservative and more moderate opposition fighters. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's assassination, but rebels quickly accused the Islamic State. Al-Suri had been critical of the group, reportedly blaming it for the internecine conflict among rebels that has killed thousands of people across northern Syria since it began in early January. If an Islamic State role in al-Suri's death is confirmed, it could further complicate efforts to resolve the infighting, which has undermined rebel efforts to oust President Bashar Assad in Syria's nearly 3-year civil war. Since the rebel-on-rebel clashes began, government forces have chipped away at opposition-held areas, including around Aleppo. A native Syrian with longstanding ties to al-Qaida, al-Suri was a co-founder of Ahrar al-Sham, a prominent, hard-line rebel group in Syria that is part of a powerful alliance of seven groups known as the Islamic Front. Akram al-Halabi, a spokesman for the Islamic Front, described al-Suri as ""a big figure in global jihad,"" and said he was appointed by al-Zawahri last year to mediate a dispute between the two al-Qaida affiliates in Syria: the Islamic State and the Nusra Front. High-ranking: Assassinated Abu Khaled al-Suri was said to be serving as the representative in Syria of al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri, pictured . Speaking via Skype, Al-Halabi said al-Suri had criticized the Islamic State for its antagonistic approach toward other rebel factions. He said rebels believe the Islamic State, which al-Qaida publicly disowned earlier this month, was behind Sunday's bombing. 'The first fingers of blame point to the State,' al-Halabi said. 'Unfortunately this is going to make the infighting worse.' He did not provide any evidence to support his assertion that the Islamic State had a hand in al-Suri's killing. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said two others were also killed in the attack, which it attributed to the Islamic State. The Observatory obtains its information from a network of activists on the ground. Al-Suri had long been on the radar of Western intelligence agencies. In 2002, Spanish officials described al-Suri, whose real name is Mohamed Bahaiah, as the courier for the late terrorist leader Osama bin Laden between Afghanistan and Europe. Islamic extremists have emerged as a powerful force in Syria's civil war. The rise to prominence of hard-line Islamic militants like al-Suri has sent jitters through Western capitals, and dampened enthusiasm for the anti-Assad opposition. Charles Lister, an analyst with the Brookings Doha Center, said al-Suri's activities in Syria had been a source of concern for the U.S. and its allies. ""He is essentially a core al-Qaida veteran who almost certainly ... had extensive, close relations with (Osama) bin Laden,"" and other senior leaders, Lister said. ""The fact that he had such a high position in Ahrar al-Sham, and confirmed it himself, his al-Qaida history â€” it made elements in the U.S. administration potentially consider Ahrar al-Sham as a terrorist organization."" Syria's uprising began with largely peaceful protests in March 2011 before turning into a civil war that has killed more than 140,000 people. The conflict has also forced 2.5 million to flee the country, left millions more in desperate need of aid and caused immense suffering across the nation. On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding immediate access everywhere in Syria for humanitarian aid. The resolution, which marked a rare instance of unity on the security council, doesn't threaten sanctions but it does express the council's intention to take ""further steps"" if the resolution isn't implemented . Syria's Foreign Ministry on Sunday welcomed the resolution, voiced its readiness to cooperate but said that top priority must be respecting national sovereignty. It also said that to address the humanitarian crisis demanding dealing with ""foreign-backed terrorism."" Damascus says the crisis in the country is caused by an international conspiracy against Syria. Also Sunday, a car bomb exploded near a charity field hospital close to the Turkish border, wounding mostly medics and patients who had fled violence elsewhere in the country, activists and Turkish media said. Turkish ambulance crews evacuated at least 11 of the wounded, including a 5-month-old baby, to Turkey, said Syrian activists of the Idlib News group. Zidane Zenglow, a journalist working for the pan-Arab al-Arabiya network, said at least one person was killed in the blast â€” a young girl, his cousin. ___ .

The U.S. government has fined Asiana Airlines $500,000 for its response to the San Francisco plane crash after making families of the victims use an automated phone system to find information. Even once the airline set up a proper hotline, it would take five days before the South Korean airline connected with the families of all 291 passengers. Asiana's response to the deadly crash last summer near San Francisco earned quick criticism for its disarray. Asiana Airlines has been fined $500,000 for breaking laws requiring prompt and generous assistance for the loved ones of crash victims following the incident in San Francisco . Three people died and dozens were injured on July 6 when Asiana Flight 214 clipped a seawall while landing at San Francisco International Airport . It was yesterday fined $500,000 by the U.S. Department of Transportation. It is the first time federal officials have concluded that an airline broke laws requiring prompt and generous assistance for the loved ones of crash victims. Three people died and dozens were injured on July 6 when Asiana Flight 214 clipped a seawall while landing at San Francisco International Airport. One of the victims, a 16-year-old girl, apparently survived being ejected onto the tarmac, only to be run over by a fire truck. Many families live in South Korea or China, meaning the airline was their main source of information on the crash half a world away. 'The last thing families and passengers should have to worry about at such a stressful time is how to get information from their carrier,' U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a prepared statement. Many families live in South Korea or China, meaning the airline was their main source of information on the crash half a world away . The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the cause of the crash . In a statement, Asiana has said the airline 'provided extensive support to the passengers and their families following the accident and will continue to do so' Under a consent order the airline signed with the department, Asiana will pay a $400,000 fine and get a $100,000 credit for sponsoring conferences and training sessions through 2015 to discuss lessons learned from the situation. In a statement emailed to The Associated Press, Asiana spokeswoman Hyomin Lee said the airline 'provided extensive support to the passengers and their families following the accident and will continue to do so'. Asiana said in the consent order that its response was slowed because the crash occurred on a holiday weekend when staffing was short. Ye Meng Yuan, left, 16, was hit by a fire truck after the Asiana plane crash. She died along with her schoolfriend Wang Linjia, right . The airline said it was not alone among foreign airlines with 'few trained employees to attend to post-accident responsibilities'. Asiana argued that it recovered quickly, noting that within a few days of the crash it had assigned a special representative to each passenger and family, flown in family members from overseas and provided professional crisis counseling. The consent order also laid out findings from the Department of Transportation's investigation. These included: . Congress required carriers to dedicate significant resources to families of passengers in the late 1990s, after airlines were roundly criticized for ignoring desperate requests for information after crashes. Last fall, the AP reviewed plans filed by two dozen foreign airlines and found cases in which carriers had not updated their family assistance plans as required. Since AP's story, several airlines have updated their plans with the Department of Transportation. Among them is Asiana's bigger rival, Korean Air. Under a consent order the airline signed with the U.S. Department of Transport, Asiana will pay a $400,000 fine and get a $100,000 credit for sponsoring conferences and training sessions through 2015 to discuss lessons learned from the situation . Many airlines invest in crash preparedness and family assistance planning, but a minority are 'using lip service and euphemisms in their plans', said Robert A. Jensen, whose company has contracts with hundreds of airlines to help after an accident. 'It's time that some of the airlines that have been flying under the radar be held accountable,' said Jensen, CEO of Kenyon International Emergency Services. 'Somebody finally got caught.' The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the cause of the crash. Family members of some passengers have sued the airline in federal court.","Three people died and dozens injured in crash at San Francisco on July 6 .
Families were made to use an automated phone system to find information .
Once hotline was set up, it took five days for airline to speak to all families .
Asiana generally 'failed to commit sufficient resources' to help families; it wasn't until five days after the crash that its employees were meeting all responsibilities under U.S. law. The airline lacked translators and personnel trained in crash response.
It took Asiana more than 18 hours to staff a reliable toll-free hotline.
The law requires family notification as soon as practical, but Asiana had contacted just three-quarters of families within two days. It would take five days to contact every family."

A classic restored Ferrari has been transformed back to original owner Steve McQueen's personal spec - thanks to its Le Mans-winning owner. The screen icon was the first owner of the 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 after he took delivery while on the set of Bullitt. King of Cool McQueen was a huge fan of the coupe, which is regarded by many as one of the ultimate Ferraris, and held on to it until 1971. Steve McQueen's Ferrari 275 gtb/4 after restoration back to how he owned it in the Ferrari Museum in Italy . The classic restored Ferrari has been transformed back to original owner Steve McQueen's personal spec - thanks to its Le Mans-winning owner . McQueen was the first owner of the 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 after he took delivery while on the set of Bullitt . He had the original silver car re-sprayed to red and fitted the wheels from his Ferrari NART Spyder, which he had previously crashed. But a later owner decided to spend $10,000 controversially having it transformed from a coupe (Berlinetta) into a convertible (Spyder). The result was a stunning conversion - but the Ferrari had lost the McQueen factor. It was later resprayed yellow and then silver before it was bought in 2011 by Australian racing star Vern Schuppan. Mr Schuppan, a McQueen fan who won Le Mans in 1983, decided to ‘bite the Bullitt' and have the car returned to the identical condition as when his Hollywood hero owned it. He handed the car over to Ferrari and its Classiche department which certifies, restores and repairs special cars from the Italian marque.

Original condition: The motor was silver before McQueen had it sprayed red . Ferrari jumped at the chance to work on the McQueen 275 GTB/4, describing it as 'one of the more interesting cars ever to leave the factory'. They reproduced the roof and buttresses with hand-beaten steel panels, before respraying the car from silver to the dark red which The Great Escape star had opted for. Incredibly, the original rear deck, rear glass and chrome surround, internal rear pillars and other related pieces were reunited following its 1970s roof removal.

Vern Schuppan with his son Kerrin who also helped to refit the car . Marco Arrighi, director of Ferrari Classiche, said: 'Ferrari Classiche's ethos is to assist clients and collectors in ensuring that their car accurately reflects how it was when it left the factory. 'As only ten NART Spiders were ever built, as you can imagine, over the years a number of coupes have been converted into replicas, so the client's decision to restore the car to its original configuration was one we welcomed with open arms.' After commissioning the restoration and making various trips back and forth from the factory, Vern was delighted with the results and loaned the Ferrari to its museum at the factory in Maranello, Italy.

He said: 'I have always wanted a Ferrari 275 GTB/4 and the McQueen ownership of this one certainly added to the appeal. Aesthetically I think it is one of the most beautiful Ferraris. 'In my opinion, the decision to convert it back was a no brainer, I don't think any car from the 1960s was quite as beautifully done as it. 'The finished conversion is outstanding and I couldn't praise the Ferrari Classiche centre more.' Steve McQueen's Ferrari 275 gtb/4 after restoration back to how he owned it in the Ferrari Museum in Italy with Luca di Montezemolo, the Ferrari boss . Under the bonnet of the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 is a 3.3-litre V12 engine which develops 300bhp. This gives the sleek sports car a 0-60mph time of around 6.5 seconds and a top speed of more than 160mph. A Ferrari 275 GTB/4 with a Classiche certificate is typically worth around £1 to £1.5 million, but a world record £1.9 million was paid for a model at auction earlier this month. Steve McQueen took delivery of the car when he was on the set of Bullitt, which was released in 1968 . But adding the Steve McQueen factor helps sends values soaring. In 2011, the racing overall worn by McQueen in the 1971 film Le Mans sold for more than £600,000 at auction. During the same year a Porsche 911 once owned by film star sold for £830,000 - more than 12 times its typical value. But Vern, an Adelaide-based Aussie who spends a lot of time in the UK, is more than happy that Ferrari has seen fit to put the car on show in the new wing of Ferraris Museum which was recently inaugurated by Luca di Montezemolo where it currently resides today. He added: 'At the moment it is in the Ferrari Museum and I am happy to leave it there.' Ferrari has announced record profits - by deliberately selling fewer cars. The Italian manufacturer delivered 6,922 cars in 2013, a reduction of around 5.4 per cent. But the sales drop allows the firm to 'maintain exclusivity' by selling fewer models to customers who spend more on optional extras. As a result, overall revenues were up five per cent to 2.3bn euros, with net profit of £246m euros, an increase of 5.4 per cent. The UK market grew slightly with 677 cars delivered, setting a new record to become Europe's leading market, overtaking Germany. With 2,035 deliveries, the USA was the largest market for Ferrari. The policy of pushing optional extras is paying off, with 100 per cent of cars sold undergoing some sort of personalisation. Options on Prancing Horse cars are notoriously expensive, with dustcaps costing £79 and little badges setting back owners £675. And the firm's Tailor Made programme, where buyers can deck their vehicles out with denim seats and other odd materials, continues to grow. Ferrari also confirmed its Classiche Programme was going from strength to strength. This part of the company deals with restoring and classifying cherished models such as Steve McQueen's Ferrari 275 GTB/4. Luca di Montezemolo, Ferrari president, said: 'This is a very important result that comes as a direct consequence of the huge effort made by everyone. 'We wanted to maintain a high level of exclusivity, designing amazing products such as the LaFerrari, the 458 Speciale and the just launched California T, the result of significant investment in product and technological innovation.' The LaFerrari is the Italian firm's fastest and most expensive road car ever. It is capable of 220mph and costs £1 million. But despite its price-tag, the 499 planned were quickly sold with desperate punters rumoured to be willing to pay a £500,000 premium to own one.","Screen icon was the first owner of the 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 .

A Wisconsin man who locked his daughter in the basement and starved her down to only 68 pounds is headed to prison. Chad Chritten, 42, kept his daughter locked in the basement for six years while her stepmother beat her and her stepbrother sexually assaulted her until she escaped in February 2012 and was rescued by a good Samaritan. Mr Chritten was found guilty Friday of three felonies – second-degree reckless endangerment, child abuse and causing mental harm to a child, according to reports. He was found not guilty of false imprisonment. Failed father: Chad Chritten, 42, was found guilty of starving and neglecting his daughter for a number of years until she escaped wearing only pajamas . The trio was arrested after the girl told investigators the sordid details of the torture she suffered at the hands of those she loved. She was locked in the basement and denied food despite pleading to be fed. Her stepmother Melinda Drabek-Chritten often beat her and even threatened to throw her down a flight of stairs. Stepbrother Joshua Chritten, now 20, repeatedly forced her to perform oral sex on him, officials contend. The brave girl was wearing only pajamas when she escaped the house of horrors, she is now only 16-years-old. Her depraved family first tried to explain her shocking departure from the growth of a girl her age by telling authorities she suffered from bulimia, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. Family affair: Stepbrother Joshua Drabek (left) will stand trial next year to face sexual assault allegations, stepmother Melinda Drabek-Chritten (right) is serving a five-year term in prison for beating the teen girl . Assistant District Attorney Matthew Moeser argued during the trial that she instead was forced to forage for scraps of food from the kitchen floor and trash. The tortured teen was forced to go to the bathroom on her own bed because of an alarm that alerted her tormenters if she tried to leave the basement. He explained while testifying in his defense that he put her in the basement after a psychologist said she should live on a different level of the home than the rest of the family. He boarded up the windows so she wouldn't climb out and raid the neighbors' trash, he said. He denied ever locking her in or withholding food. She refused to eat the meals he made for her and chose to dine on crumbs and garbage, he said. He called the girl's suffering 'a mistake.' Supposing that Mr Chritten’s intent was to ‘dehumanize and degrade’ his daughter, Mr Moeser said the evil man made ‘her blame herself for what he was doing to her,’ according to the Journal. ‘This was so far from reasonable parenting, and to call what was done to (the girl) a mistake is an insult to the English language,’ he continued, referring to the vile man’s testimony earlier during the trial, according to the Journal. ‘This is so far from a mistake.’ 'This is so far from a mistake': Assistant District Attorney Matthew Moeser argued during the trial that the abuse ongoing, and hardly an error in judgement . He's a simple man: Defense attorney Jessa Nicholson tried to convince the jury her client didn't have the smarts to mastermind the torture - they didn't bite . The defense also tried to argue the girl suffered from mental illness. ‘It's about a person who thought he could commit these crimes against his daughter and get away with it; this cloak of mental illness, this cloak of health problems,’ said Mr Moeser, according to Channel 3000. The wicked stepmother has already been sentenced to five years in prison for her role in the scheme, the stepbrother will stand trial in February. The only defense attorney Jessa Nicholson could muster for her warped client was that he wasn’t smart enough to hatch such a plan, and that neighbors suspected nothing. No master plan: Mr Chritten is alone with his thoughts as he hangs his head in court . ‘You saw him testify for five hours,’ she argued. ‘I’m not picking on him, I’m just saying. You think he’s a tricky, clever, wily guy? Did he appear to have an understanding of mental health?’ Mr Chritten’s first trial resulted in a conviction of child neglect, but a deadlocked jury on all other counts. This time his daughter finally got justice. Two down, one to go. The failed father hung his head as the verdict was read and his bail was revoked. The judge ordered him held until his sentencing hearing in two months – he faces 34 years behind bars.","Chad Chritten, his stepson and wife locked his now 16-year-old daughter in the basement for six years .

With its idyllic beaches and seemingly limitless sunshine, most of us have long known that it is the lucky country. And according to an international league table of happiness, Australia truly does take some beating on its quality of life. It has ranked number one on the OECD’s first such chart – and, somewhat unsurprisingly,  well ahead of Britain, which  came tenth. Winner: Australia is the best place in the world to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . But while Britons may not be quite as . content as our friends Down Under, we’re happier than the Germans or the . French, according to the rankings. Australia’s strong economy, good . public health, low pollution and low levels of crime were some of the . reasons why it is better off, the OECD said. The attraction is already well known . to the tens of thousands of Britons flocking there each year in search . of a better life. In 2011 49,000 emigrated Down Under. The OECD’s Better Life Index is based . on 11 categories, including income, jobs, housing and health, surveyed . in 36 nations. Overall, the UK was beaten by a string of Scandinavian . countries, among them Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Britain scored highly on income . levels, high employment, low crime, and community spirit – measured by . polls that found almost everyone knew a person they could rely on in . times of trouble. It also ranked highly on the environment, based on . lower air pollution and water quality. But it was marked down because of . overcrowding, a school system which ‘favours the rich over the poor’, . and because the OECD says state spending and benefit cuts ‘will affect . many families’. Feeling good: In general, Australians are more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average, with 84 per cent of people saying they have more positive experiences in an average day . Its report added: ‘Progress in child . poverty reduction in the UK has stalled; social protection spending on . families needs to be protected. ‘Providing services such as affordable . and good quality local day-care centres, with flexible opening hours, . is key to helping families with children on low incomes into work.’ Specifically on happiness levels, . grumpy Britons lagged behind. In surveys on life satisfaction, recently . introduced to national statistics by David Cameron, they rated . themselves at 6.8 out of 10. However, the French are even less cheerful, . giving themselves 6.6 out of 10. Australians, by contrast, scored 7.2, . well above the OECD average of 6.6. France came 18th due to high . unemployment and poor education for some of its people, beaten by the . Germans, who were in 17th place. Despite high life expectancy and levels . of health spending, they rated poorly on health. However, if work-life balance is given . the most weight, Australia becomes one of the worst developed nations . in which to live. More than 14 per cent of Australian workers put in . more than 50 hours a week, way above the OECD average of 9 per cent. Eurozone countries, many struggling . with debt crises and high unemployment, did badly in the index. France, . Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece were all rated in the bottom half of . the table.

A teenage hit man sentenced to three . years in prison for beheading four boys in Mexico may be sent to the . United States when his sentence ends next month. It's not known where Edgar Jimenez Lugo’s will head to given that it is likely he would face violent reprisals at his former home in a working-class village south of Mexico City. The governor of Morelos, the state where . Edgar is being held, wants him sent to the United States when his . sentence is completed on December 3rd. Aged 14 when he committed his crimes, his time behind bars was just three years - the maximum penalty allowed under Mexican law. The request by the governor for him to be sent to the U.S. is not an unreasonable one. Lugo was born in the United States and is therefore an American citizen. Beheading: A video allegedly shows The Ponchis and his associates preparing to cut the neck of a victim . Heinous crimes: Mexican authorities  arrested 14-year-old Lugo who was accused of serving as a drug cartel hitman and beheading the victims . 'We have 13 days to see if he can be . deported to the United States so that he can be placed in an institution . there,' Gov. Graco Ramirez told a radio station in Mexico on Thursday. 'He is an American citizen.' Edgar was 14 in August 2010 when he . killed the young men — a student, a cook at a university, a gas station . attendant and a small-business owner. Lugo, nicknamed 'El Ponchis,' received a . three-year term, which was the maximum allowed under law, after he . admitted to beheading the four boys in central Mexico. The beheaded . bodies were hung from a bridge in the tourist town of Cuernavaca. When he was arrested, he calmly . admitted to the killings but said he was kidnapped at age 11 and had . been forced to work for the Cartel of The South Pacific. Violent: The military stopped a group of young people in the town of Jiutepec aged between 12 and 23 who were linked to the South Pacific Cartel .

At . the time he told reporters, 'I participated in four executions, but I . did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't, they would kill me.' Mexican and U.S. officials are now trying to weigh the appropriate response to concerns about what comes next for the 17-year-old whose birth certificate confers the rights of U.S. citizenship. Lugo became notorious due to his age and . online videos that discussed him. There was also a Youtube video of him . beating a man with a two-by-four while the man was hanging from the . ceiling. Edgar was convicted in juvenile court in July 2011 of homicide and organized crime charges, and sentenced to three years in custody, the maximum allowed. With time served before his conviction, he’s now due for release. Jailed: Edgar Jimenez Lugo, of California, known as 'El Ponchis' (The Cloaked One), was given the maximum sentence allowed for a minor in Morelos, Mexico but his sentence ends in one week . Back in 2011: 'El Ponchis' is transported by Mexican police officials with a bag over his head. The 14-year-old boy was on trial for murder, organized crime and drug trafficking . Once freed, Edgar will face no clear legal obstacles to crossing into the United States. 'He can come live here when he turns 18 . (in May) without any supervision.

The schoolgirl who ran away to France with jailed Jeremy Forrest has found love with another teacher, it was reported today. The girl was aged just 15 when she sparked an international manhunt after eloping with maths teacher Forrest, 31, who is currently serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence for abducting her. But she is now said to be 'ridiculously happy' after falling for a 20-year-old PE teaching assistant and part-time security guard. The schoolgirl who ran away to France with jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest has reportedly found love with another teacher . The girl, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, posted a picture showing the new man giving her a kiss on . the cheek while she sticks her tongue out, reported the Sun on Sunday. And . her mother is understood to wholeheartedly approve of the relationship, . telling the newspaper: 'He is really nice and we have welcomed him into . our family and I am very happy for my daughter.' Because the girl is now 16 and the new teacher does not work at her current school, their relationship is not illegal. Friends of the teenager are also said to be keen on the new man and see him as a positive influence. The news is expected to come as a devastating blow to Forrest who is currently serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for abducting the girl . The . pair are said to have connected over a shared love of music and . exchanged a series of flirty tweets before things became more serious in . mid-February. They reportedly spent two nights together last week and have bought tickets to see one of their favourite bands. Last . week she posted on Twitter that she was annoyed when people said that when someone moves on it meant they did not love the person they were with . before. The news is expected to come as a devastating blow to Forrest who was arrested in September 2012 when the runaways were spotted in Bordeaux after spending a week on the run. Just last month it was claimed the girl had written to him in prison to say she still loved him and wanted to rekindle their relationship when he has served his sentence. Forrest, whose wife left him after his betrayal, was not allowed to . read the letters and has been transferred to tough Dartmoor Prison after . making a complaint, it  was reported. Forrest, who taught at Bishop Bell . School in East Sussex, first kissed the girl when she was 14. The pair . had sex after she turned 15. When . police were alerted they fled to France by ferry, travelling under . false names. He was spotted and arrested eight days later. Last June at . Lewes Crown Court he was convicted of sex offences and abduction, and . jailed. Afterwards the girl . said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with . him and maybe once he’s out, we can marry and have children.’ 'Torture': Forrest, 31, has been moved from Bristol's Ashfield jail to the remote Dartmoor Prison (pictured) Forrest . began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles . when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something . she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with . bulimia.

Everything, from the custom-built PrivatOS to web browsing and apps, are encrypted, or have been fitted with an extra layer of security. Scroll down for video . Almost follow-proof: The Blackphone is an Android-based handset built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy . Internet access on the phone is carried out through a virtual private network (VPN) that sends and receives data in a way that’s designed to keep it hidden. When the phone boots up it asks for a password and PIN before a wizard guides users through the security options. For example, it shows users which apps want access to which data. The BlackPhone owner can then decide to restrict access to that information and handpick the apps and the data they share. Mike Kershaw, chief architect from Blackphone told MailOnline the smartphone was designed to have ‘the benefit of security without having to have an in-depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure.’ The company says that it is 'anti-personal data from the ground up'. They say the phone will appeal will appeal to those who don't want any data collection, those who agree with principle of collecting data and businessmen . Kershaw continued that there are existing products, such as Red Phone, that lets customers communicate securely to each other, but ‘Blackphone extends this concept to everyone.’ ‘We're anti-personal data from the ground up. 'There are a number of people this handset will appeal to; there's the people who don't want any data collection. 'There are people concerned about data collection for data collection sake. 'Then there are people concerned about secondary data collection, such as business men who want to communicate securely while travelling - they want to be as anonymous as they want to be. ‘Today, once data is collected somewhere it's only a subpoena away for the authorities. We explicitly don't collect data and it's architected so it can't fulfil subpoenas.’ The encryption on the Blackphone extends to voice calls, video calls, voicemail, texting, file transfer and storage, web browsing and apps. This encryption is done via the Silent Circle and SpiderOak privacy and security software. Subscriptions are included for two years with the Blackphone, and they can then be renewed.Alternatively, customers can upgrade to the next-generation Blackphone handset. The phone costs $629 (£376) plus delivery. Blackphone claims the price for all the individual services totals $1508 (£903). The mobile has a 4.7-inch HD IPS display, although the precise resolution is yet to be announced. It also comes with a a 2GHz quad-core processor, 16GB of storage, an 8-megapixel camera and 4G.

When asked to address these concerns, Blackphone’s managing director, Toby Weir-Jones told MailOnline: ‘The availability of a tool does not create the intent for mischief. 'If you’re a bad guy, the fact [Blackphone] is making cryptography usable doesn’t mean you’re going to take that a step further; you're not going to become bad because of that knowledge either.’ Samsung is the latest firm to launch a phone with a fingerprint scanner to improve security on its new Galaxy S5, following Apple’s lead last year. Weir-Jones said that Apple made biometrics fashionable, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best way to protect your data. ‘We have plans for a whole family of Blackphones and we'll see which security measures, such as biometrics, have legs and which are legitimate. We want to introduce something people can use, that’s easy, simple and familiar.’ Kershaw added that the company decided to run the PrivatOS on top of Android because it means users can install any Android app, and Blackphone will support private features with it. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, told MailOnline that the revelations that we are increasingly being tracked online, it was only a matter of time before companies started to promote themselves as being privacy friendly. 'Everyone from lawyers to people with sensitive illnesses are concerned about how safe their information is on their devices, so technology that enables both security and privacy will undoubtedly be popular,' he said. 'The longer the legal framework around surveillance fails to reflect the modern world, the more people will rely on technology to protect their privacy. 'It is clear that previously trusted systems are far less secure than we thought, as encryption has been undermined and private companies secretly compelled to turn over information in bulk on users, so this phone is the first step to restoring the balance where people’s data is not collected unless they are under suspicion.'","Phone is an Android-based .

Conservatives suggested Mr Miliband¿s ¿appeasement¿ of Russia, a staunch ally of Bashar al Assad, had contributed to the current crisis . Senior Tories last night prompted an angry row with Labour by claiming Ed Miliband’s vote against military action in Syria helped embolden Russia to invade part of Ukraine. Several prominent Conservatives suggested Mr Miliband’s ‘appeasement’ of Russia, a staunch ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar al Assad, had contributed to the current crisis. Treasury minister Sajid Javid, a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, said there was a ‘direct link between Miliband’s cynical vote against [the] Syria motion and Russia’s actions on Ukraine’, adding that this made the Labour leader ‘completely unfit to lead Britain’. Tory planning minister Nick Boles said David Cameron ‘was right to urge Parliament to stand up to [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin and punish Assad’s use of chemical weapons,’ adding: ‘Look where Miliband’s weakness has led us.’ Penny Mordaunt, parliamentary private  secretary to the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, agreed that the ‘car crash’ of last summer’s vote against intervention in Syria had a bearing on the current crisis. Mr Miliband and several backbench Conservatives voted down a Coalition motion on missile strikes against Syria last August, despite chemical weapons attacks on hundreds of civilians by its regime. In the wake of Mr Cameron’s worst defeat as Prime Minister, Tories accused the Labour leader of privately indicating he would support a motion paving the way for military strikes but then changed his mind, something Labour denies. The Labour leader has since taken credit for persuading the world to turn back from a rush to war in Syria, since the shock defeat in Parliament was followed by retreats by the US and other western allies. Putin repeatedly warned that any western military action in Syria would be illegal and threatened to prop up the Assad administration. Damascus has since agreed to destroy its chemical weapons arsenals. Some analysts say the failure to act against one of Putin’s key allies has encouraged the Russian president, but have blamed President Barack Obama rather than Mr Miliband. Bashar Assad is a known ally of Russian and President Putin. Senior Tories said there was a 'direct link' between Miliband's vote against the Syria motion and the Ukraine crisis . Obama talks on the phone in the Oval Office with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the situation in Ukraine. The US called movements today an 'incredible act of aggression' Former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind agreed that some of Putin’s boldness can be traced back to the Syrian situation, when Mr Obama insisted the use of chemical weapons by Damascus would be a ‘red line’ but then failed to act. ‘It was one aspect of what has given Putin, he believes, the confidence to do what he’s doing, yes,’ he said. Mr Obama spoke with Putin for 90 minutes on Saturday. An official described the talks as ‘candid’. Last night Mr Miliband dismissed the attacks on him, saying: ‘At this dangerous time for the world, the British people do not expect politicians to be indulging in petty point-scoring. What we need is for all parties in Britain to put politics aside so we can find a swift solution to the crisis in Ukraine.’ Mr Miliband suggested diplomatic and economic sanctions offered the ‘best hope’ of persuading Russia to back down and ruled out backing western military action. Armed men in military uniform walk outside the territory of a Ukrainian military unit in the village of Perevalnoye, outside Simferopol . He agreed there was a case for looking at whether the UK should boycott the forthcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia. ‘All of these options need to be looked at because we’re in such a deeply worrying situation and because we’ve got to protect the sovereignty of Ukraine,’ he said. ‘The international community needs to speak with one voice to say that this is unacceptable, this kind of military incursion is unacceptable. It breaks the terms of the Budapest agreement of 1994 and the diplomatic and economic pressure we can put on Russia is the best hope we have of what everyone wants to see, which is the de-escalation of the crisis.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘There can be no excuse for outside military intervention in Ukraine – a point I made to President Putin when we spoke [on Friday]. Everyone must think carefully about their actions and work to lower, not escalate, tensions. The world is watching.’","Tories say Miliband's 'appeasement' of Russia contributed to crisis .

As the centenary of the First World War approaches, Britain prepares to mark the outbreak of one of the largest conflicts in history with sombre remembrance ceremonies. However, musician Ricky Wilson and actor Bill Nighy have raised eyebrows over their decision to write and record a 21-century war poem inspired by the likes of Wilfred Owen and Sigfried Sassoon. Called The Occupation the verse talks about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and will be released as part of the band's new album, but has drawn thinly veiled criticism for making commercial gain on the back of the centenary. Kaiser Chief's lead singer Ricky Wilson (left) has written a 21-century war poem for the band's new album to commemorate the First World War centenary this year, which will be read by Bill Nighy (right) A spokesman for The Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which is leading the centenary memorial efforts, said: 'Britain is marking the centenary of the First World War because of its huge impact on world history and as a tribute to the sacrifices made by British and Commonwealth servicemen and civilians. 'The Government’s programme to mark this takes remembrance as its theme, with an emphasis on youth and education. 'But we appreciate that others will mark the anniversary in different ways, some of which will be challenging and controversial, and some for commercial gain. Wilson is also now a judge on The Voice taking over from Danny O'Donoghue who abandoned the programme along with Jessie J last year . 'In the end it’s for the public to judge how appropriate each offering is to the memory of those that made the ultimate sacrifice 100 years ago.' The spokesman added that the Department will not be involving itself with the recording. Poet and Wilfred Owen scholar Merryn Williams added: 'Obviously it is not a great poem, but it is very amusing. 'I'm not being rude by saying that it doesn't compare to Wilfred Owen because he was one of the best writers this country has produced and he worked at it for years. 'It is up-to-date in a way Owen isn't, although his poetry is timeless.' The two-minute poem is read by Nighy over a soundtrack of battlefield noises, calls to prayer and hubbub from within the Houses of Parliament. Speaking to The Independent, Wilson said: 'When I was writing the lyrics for the record, the whole World War One centenary thing was flying around. So if you’re writing honestly, it’s going to leak in there. 'I wrote the poem as an exercise originally. The original story was an imaginary assault by a superpower – not necessarily the USA, trying to take over Hell. 'They are invading Hell, wiping out Hell. Then going ""now what do we do, where do we go next?""' Nighy said he decided to read the poem, which contains references to 'infidels' on their knees and oil pipelines that will 'bleed the place dry', after becoming 'interested by the concept'. The Kaiser Chief's fifth album, called Education, Education, Education & War in reference to the Tony Blair election slogan, is due for release at the end of March. While the band enjoyed both popular and critical success in the mid-2000s with their debut album Employment, and the follow-up Yours Truly, Angry Mob, their influence has since waned. The band took a hiatus after their third album between 2009 and 2011, before releasing their fourth album with the online gimmick of being able to pick between 20 tracks so listeners could create their own record. They lost drummer Nick Hodgson in 2012 after issuing a compilation album of singles, and front-man Wilson is now a judge on BBC show The Voice, replacing Danny O'Donoghue who walked out along with Jessie J last year. At the time of publishing, Ricky Wilson could not be reached for comment. True master: First World War soldier and poet Wilfred Owen who wrote Dulce Et Decorum Est . The Occupation .

Health workers such as GPs, nurses and dentists make up eight of the top ten professions for car crashes. Experts suggest the stressful nature of the jobs that make up most of the top accident prone professions could explain why health counsellors, nurses and dentists all feature on the list. Accident-prone: Health workers like GPs make up eight of the top ten professions for car crashes (file photo) In the study, GPs claimed the number one spot - with almost a third (29 per cent) making at least one car insurance claim in the past five years. The proportion of those with a claim was not only the highest of any occupation in the UK, but more than double the national average for all professions (13 per cent). And it is not just GPs dishing out bad medicine on the roads. The overwhelming majority of drivers with claims worked in the medical profession, holding eight of the top 10 spots and making up 75 per cent of the top 20. Number one: Almost a third of GPs (29 per cent) have made at least one insurance claim in the past five years . While those working in health care are racking up claims, the safest occupation on the road was car dealers, with only three per cent of drivers in the profession making a claim in the past five years. Other occupations less likely to make a claim included bar staff, van drivers, painters, plasterers, tattoo artists and professional footballers. Professor Andrew Smith, an expert on occupational and health psychology from Cardiff University, said: 'Healthcare is typically considered a highly stressful occupation, which could explain why GPs and other health professionals seem to make more insurance claims than others. 1. GP - 29 per cent . 2. Hospital consultant - 26 per cent . 3. Clinical psychologist - 25 per cent . 4. Drug addiction counsellor - 25 per cent . 5. Probation officer - 24 per cent . 6. Dentist - 24 per cent . 7. Health visitor - 24 per cent . 8. Community nurse - 24 per cent . 9. Hospital manager - 23 per cent . 10. Town planner - 23 per cent . 'Stress can dramatically affect a person's health and cognitive functions. For instance, if you are having a particularly stressful day, you may find that you become absent minded when it comes to day to day activities and find it difficult to concentrate on tasks. 'You might even find that you become especially clumsy at times. This is due to the effect stress can have on the brain, and while this can be serious in any context, it is an especially bad combination while behind the wheel. 'Typically, the types of accidents that are attributed to stress tend to be relatively minor bumps, caused by lapses in concentration whilst driving.' Lee Griffin, of online brokers Gocompare, said: 'It's interesting to see an apparent trend when it comes to occupations and accidents, with such a large proportion of drivers with claims working in the medical profession. 'It would appear that a stressful job is a common link between drivers with a high proportion of claims, and that these accidents are due to distraction or breaks in concentration while on the road rather than reckless driving. It's ironic that GPs having their mind on the patients while driving could result in them needing medical attention themselves. 'This study highlights the importance of being in the right state of mind while behind the wheel. Driving when stressed or angry can lead to accidents, so if you find yourself particularly frustrated, it might be a good idea to take some time to calm down before driving, or find a safe place to pull over for a while until you are in the right frame of mind to continue your journey.'","Family doctors are most accident-prone drivers in Britain, study found .

Facilities: This makeshift toilet will be used for protestors to use as they settle in to camp life . Surrounded by activists, Dame Vivienne called for a public debate on fracking as she believed it could store up trouble financially and environmentally for generations to come. 'I'm anti-fracking and I'm here to protest. There has been no debate. They are trying to rush this thing through, for what?' she said. 'It's not going to go away. We don't know whether it will do good or bad. I'm sure it's bad and the only people who are going to benefit from it is this energy company who are associated with the Government. 'They all have vested interests. It's kind of a club. They just do it to boost the companies. It will never go into our bills. 'In fact it won't supply energy security whatsoever. It will actually store up trouble for the future, financially as well as environmentally.'

There has been no debate' Protest: Activists celebrated as energy bosses announced they would 'scale back' operations on the advice of the police . Raising the banner: Activists set up their Reclaim the Power action camp, which is set to last for about five days . Dame Vivienne added: 'I'm really against the idea that the Government is trying to push through legislation so that the councils can't even stop them. 'Who do they think they are when I would say most of the country is really against fracking, particularly at this point in time when we don't know what is at stake. 'You can't push it through.' Sussex police's deployment of extra officers and the cost may soar to more than £500,000. Drilling company Cuadrilla is building a 20ft steel wall around its site and will suspend operations. It is currently doing exploratory drilling, but many fear fracking could follow. Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure underground to split shale rock, releasing oil and gas. Stacking up: Police vehicles, including several riot vans, are ready for the climate camp . Preparations: Police guard a lorry waiting to enter the Cuadrilla drilling site in Balcombe, after campaign group No Dash For Gas threatened a weekend of civil disobedience . Upset: Climate camp protestors are setting up camp in a farmers field near to the fracking in West Sussex . Where to go: One activist chalks up a makeshift map to direct people around the site in the coming days . Leaders of campaign group Occupy, which camped at St Paul’s Cathedral, called for ‘a huge show of force’. Senior . Tory MP, Tim Yeo, thinks local communities like Balcolmbe should be forced into supporting shale gas drilling - for their own good. Mr Yeo said today that small towns have a lot to gain from fracking which could significantly reduce energy costs. 'Local concerns have to be . respected, but we must compel communities to accept this new method. There are reserves here we can exploit in the best interest of the country.' Police have held talks with protest organisers No Dash for Gas, but it is hardline splinter groups they are most worried about. A source said: ‘Professional anarchists will travel from towns and cities across Britain hell bent on causing trouble.’ Alison Stevenson, chairman of Balcombe Parish Council, wrote a letter to activists warning trouble makers to stay away. She said villagers supported peaceful demonstrations, but said they had fears about the intentions of the camp. ‘If the No Dash for Gas group is coming here in the full knowledge it intends to break the law then it should stay away,’ she added. But other residents welcomed the protests, saying they feared millions would be wiped off property prices in the area if fracking were to go ahead. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, has voiced concern about safety on the site and has called on protesters intent on breaking the law: 'Please don't do it.' Around 1,000 protesters are planning to descend on Balcombe for a five-day camp next week. Anti-fracking protesters are pictured at the site on Monday . Police escort a lorry on to the Cuadrilla fracking site in Balcombe, Sussex, this week . Sustained: Protestors have been outside the site for weeks to make their views on fracking known . He told ITV News: 'I'm quite worried about safety on the site. We have a group who are relocating a camp to the site, who have said publicly that they will be taking direct action against the site. 'It's a small site. There are a small amount of workers on the site. We are doing something that is legally approved and I am worried about the safety implications for our workers, for peaceful protesters.' Mr Egan's sentiments were echoed by Sussex Police. Superintendent Lawrence Hobbs said: 'We will continue to facilitate peaceful protest, but newcomers to the site should be aware that if they commit criminal offences, then we will collect the evidence and they will be arrested.'","Designer Vivienne Westwood arrives to join campers and 'stop fracking'

The actor admitted that he was 'heavily courted' for the iconic role as 007 when producers were hunting for somebody to replace Roger Moore. But Neeson was told by his then-girlfriend Natasha Richardson that she wouldn't marry him if he played the spy, and he duly turned the part down. Scroll down for video .

'Courted': Liam Neeson, left, has revealed that he came close to playing James Bond in the 1990s, but gave up the role so he could marry. Right, Daniel Craig as 007 in Skyfall . Neeson went on to marry Richardson, and the two lived together until she died in a tragic skiing accident in 2009. 'I was heavily courted, let’s put it that way, and I’m sure some other actors were too, he told the Hull Daily Mail. 'It was about 18 or 19 years ago and my wife-to-be said, ""If you play James Bond we’re not getting married!"" And I had to take that on board, because I did want to marry her.' The actor also opened up about his grief following her death, when Richardson hit her head while skiing without a helmet. He said: 'You just get this profound feeling of instability ... the Earth isn’t stable anymore.' Piers Brosnan was eventually given the role, and played the spy in films including GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies before handing over to current Bond Daniel Craig.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:04 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:24 EST, 20 September 2012 . A Syrian military helicopter clipped the tail of a Syrian passenger jet with 200 people aboard in mid-air Thursday, but the larger aircraft landed safely and no one aboard was hurt, Syria's state TV said. The helicopter crashed near the capital of Damascus, though it was not clear if there were any casualties in that crash or what had led the two aircraft to touch in mid-air. The close call came at a time when Syria is embroiled in a civil war between the supporters of President Bashar Assad and those trying to topple him. Heart of conflict: The mid-air collision took place on the outskirts of Damascus, Syria . The 18-month rebellion has claimed the lives of more than 23,000 people, according to activists, and Syria has descended into chaos. The Syrian government has increasingly been using helicopters and other aircraft in its fight against the rebels. Rebels have claimed to have shot down helicopters and warplanes in the past, although the regime has blamed most of the problems on mechanical difficulties. Today Syrian military aircraft struck in the rebellious city of Aleppo, near to the border with Turkey, where many rebel groups have their strongholds. A Syrian Army fighter was pictured dropping two bombs over the city's Bustan Al-Bashar district, followed by an explosion which sent plumes of smoke soaring into the sky. Death from above: A Syrian military jet drops bombs over the Bustan Al-Bashar neighborhood of Aleppo . Destruction: Smoke rises over the rebel-held district after the jet drops its payload . In Thursday's incident, the helicopters rotor clipped the tail of a Syrian Arab Airlines jet, the state TV said. The passenger plane 'landed safely at the airport and none of the 200 passengers were harmed,' the report said. The helicopter crashed southeast of Douma, a Damascus suburb that has witnessed repeated military crackdowns to purge fighters seeking to topple Assad. No further details were made available. 'We heard the sound of several . explosions and some gunfire, and a few minutes later, we were told that a . helicopter had crashed,' said Mohammad Saeed, an activist in Douma. This . comes on the same day as the United Nations learned that Iran has been . using civilian aircraft to fly military personnel and large quantities . of weapons across Iraqi airspace to Syria to aid President Bashar . al-Assad in his attempt to crush an 18-month uprising against his . government, according to a Western intelligence report seen by Reuters. Earlier . this month, U.S. officials said they were questioning Iraq about . Iranian flights in Iraqi airspace suspected of ferrying arms to Assad, a . staunch Iranian ally. On Wednesday, U.S. Senator John Kerry threatened to review U.S. aid to Baghdad if it does not halt such overflights. Arming: The accident took place on the same day that a report was released revealing Iran is sending arms and soldiers to Syria via commercial airplanes . Iraq says it does not allow the passage of any weapons through its airspace, but the intelligence report obtained by Reuters says Iranian weapons have been flowing into Syria via Iraq in large quantities. Such transfers, the report says, are organized by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 'This is part of a revised Iranian modus operandi that U.S. officials have only recently addressed publicly, following previous statements to the contrary,' said the report, a copy of which was provided by a U.N. diplomatic source. 'It also flies in the face of declarations by Iraqi officials,' it said. 'Planes are flying from Iran to Syria via Iraq on an almost daily basis, carrying IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) personnel and tens of tons of weapons to arm the Syrian security forces and militias fighting against the rebels.' It added that Iran was also 'continuing to assist the regime in Damascus by sending trucks overland via Iraq' to Syria. Although the specific charges about Iraq allowing Iran to transfer arms to Damascus are not new, the intelligence report alleges that the extent of such shipments is far greater than has been publicly acknowledged, and much more systematic, thanks to an agreement between senior Iraqi and Iranian officials.","Helicopter crashed outside of Damascus but plane was able to land safely .

With its A-list approval, high price tag, long list of apparent benefits and rather bizarre formula, it sounds like the recipe for a miracle product. But critics have questioned whether Gwyneth Paltrow’s favourite face cream has one key ingredient – the evidence to back it all up. Experts claim that the £50-a-bottle Restorsea – which contains brown algae and an enzyme from salmon eggs – is no more effective than an everyday moisturiser. Criticism: Claims made in advertisements for Restorsea, backed by 41-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow, pictured, have been called into question by Harley Street medics who said the sample size of 40 was too small . Endorsed: Miss Paltrow said she would never give her name to a cream which she didn't use herself . And they condemned the decision to sign up Miss Paltrow to promote the cream as shameless marketing. In a new advertisement, the actress, 41, is quoted as saying: ‘I love how it smells, that it works, the story and that fact that it is a brand started by a woman entrepreneur. I never promote anything that I don’t use, love and believe in.’ Praise: Miss Paltrow said she liked that the cream was founded by a female entrepreneur . The brand, meanwhile, claims its key ingredient, the ‘Vibransea’ salmon egg enzyme, exfoliates and adds protein while giving the same benefits as anti-ageing products such as glycolic acid and Retin-A. But dermatologists in London’s Harley Street were less enthusiastic, claiming the product has not undergone rigorous clinical tests, the sample size of 40 used to test it was too small and there was little evidence that it worked. Bruno Ballardin, from the London Skin and Hair Clinic, said: ‘In order to truly support the benefits of skincare products, manufacturers need to test the formulation on enough subjects to be statistically significant, i.e. hundreds.’ And skin expert Louise Thomas-Minns, from Uandyourskin.co.uk, said: ‘I think once again we are being seduced by a so-called “miracle product” that happens to have a great celebrity endorsement.’ But Restorsea yesterday insisted their products have undergone rigorous third party clinical testing on women between 35 and 60. A spokesman said: ‘Clinicians saw statistically significant improvement to the skin after two, six and 12 weeks.’","Restorsea contains brown algae and an enzyme from salmon eggs .

"By . James  Nye . PUBLISHED: . 13:19 EST, 2 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 2 February 2014 . Last minute: Missouri late on Wednesday executed Herbert Smulls after the U.S. Supreme Court denied last-minute appeals that in part challenged the drug used in the execution . A Missouri death row prisoner on the phone to his attorney discussing his appeal was hauled away in the middle of the call and put to death four minutes before the Supreme Court denied his final stay request. Herbert Smulls, 56, was pronounced dead at 10.20 pm after receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a fast-acting barbiturate, but emails reveal that state officials were aware that the justices of the US Supreme Court were still considering his appeal. It was Missouri's third execution since November and the third since switching to new drug, pentobarbital, for the lethal injection - which Smulls' legal team said might not be as pure and as potent as it should be, which could cause undue suffering. Smulls' attorneys said last week that this was the  third straight case in which Missouri has moved ahead with an execution while the case was still in court. While Missouri says it's perfectly legal to carry out executions before all appeals are exhausted, legal experts say the practice is rare. And the concerns from defense attorneys come as the death penalty in general is getting increased scrutiny amid separate questions about the drugs states are using to execute inmates. Execution: Herbert Smulls was pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. local time on Wednesday at a state prison in Bonne Terre after receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital, a fast-acting barbiturate, Missouri Department of Corrections spokesman Mike O'Connell said . Smulls, 56, was put to death late Wednesday after a protracted legal battle that lasted more than two decades, a legal fight that extended to his final day of life. Smulls was scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, but various appeals pushed the case deep into the evening. Attorneys for Smulls made one final push just before 10 p.m. for a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court, which had already ruled on other appeals that the execution could proceed. Timing was becoming a factor because the death warrant expired at 11:59 p.m. A new execution date would be required if Smulls was still alive at midnight. He wasn't. The execution began at 10:11 p.m., and Smulls was pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. Joseph Luby, an attorney for Smulls, said he received an email at 10:30 p.m. from the Supreme Court, saying the stay application was denied at 10:24 p.m. - four minutes after Smulls was pronounced dead. 'It's just troubling and fundamentally lawless,' Luby said. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, in an emailed statement, said the state did nothing wrong. 'The United States Supreme Court has ruled that pending litigation is not sufficient to stop an execution,' Koster wrote. 'The legal mechanism for a federal court to stop an execution is a court-ordered stay.' Pensive: Missouri officials similarly executed a man named Allen Nicklasson (pictured left and right) before his appeals were concluded . Koster wrote that the state 'directly asked the United States Supreme Court if the execution of Herbert Smulls should be stayed; for the third time that day, the Court said no. No stay of execution was in effect at the time of execution.' Missouri has executed three convicted killers in the past three months. Luby said that in all three cases, appeals were still pending. One of the people executed was Allen Nicklasson. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had refused to grant a stay, but the full appeals court had not yet heard the case, Circuit Judge Kermit Bye wrote in a dissenting opinion days after that execution. 'In my near fourteen years on the bench, this is the first time I can recall this happening,' the judge wrote. Columbia Law School professor Jim Liebman said it is unusual, but not unheard of, for an execution to proceed with an appeal still pending. He agreed that corrections officials could reach the point of believing that enough is enough. 'You wouldn't be surprised if the state felt that way, maybe with justification, but the procedure is to have a court say that, not for the state to say that,' Liebman said. Final moments; Smulls, 56, did not make a final statement. He mouthed a few words to his two witnesses, who were not identified, then breathed heavily twice and shut his eyes for good. Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state, generally waits until all appeals are exhausted before carrying out executions. In a few cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has put a halt to the stream of appeals by issuing an order that it would no longer accept petitions in a case, Liebman said. The court issued no such halt in Smulls' case. 'What that does is sort of put a legal end to the matter,' Liebman said. Attorneys for Smulls filed several appeals in the weeks and days leading up to the execution, and on the final day. Many centered on concerns about the way Missouri obtains its execution drug from an unnamed compounding pharmacy. At least two recent executions have raised concerns about the effectiveness of drugs used in executions, putting increased scrutiny on how states carry out the death penalty. Two weeks ago, Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire took 26 minutes to die by injection, gasping repeatedly as he lay on a gurney with his mouth opening and closing. And on January 9, Oklahoma inmate Michael Lee Wilson's final words were, 'I feel my whole body burning.' Some of the other appeals centered on that fact that Smulls, who was black, was convicted by an all-white jury. Florence Honickman called all the appeals a 'travesty.' She has permanent injuries after being shot by Smulls in the 1991 jewelry store robbery in suburban St. Louis that killed her husband, Stephen. Smulls was the sixth person executed in the United States in 2014 and the third in Missouri since November . Honickman and her two adult children spent most of Tuesday and Wednesday at the prison in Bonne Terre, Mo., waiting through the late appeals until finally witnessing Smulls' death. 'I believe it is cruel and unacceptable both to the criminal about to be executed and to the victims' family that after endless appeals, 20-plus years on death row and after the execution date has been set, the criminal is given hope of a stay based on absurd technical and procedural matters,' Florence Honickman said. Smulls was convicted of shooting Stephen Honickman while robbing his jewelry store in July 1991. Honickman's wife Florence, who was also shot during the attack, sustained permanent injuries. Smulls was originally scheduled to die after 12:01 a.m. Central Time on Wednesday and so had his final meal of fried chicken, steak, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, candied yams, corn bread, chocolate cake, and cola on Tuesday afternoon. Missouri and several other states have turned to compounding pharmacies, which are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to prepare drugs for executions after an increasing number of pharmaceutical manufacturers objected to their drugs being used in capital punishment. The increasing use of in some cases untested compounded drugs has revived the debate over the death penalty in the United States. In Oklahoma, an inmate said he felt burning through his body when the drugs used to kill him were injected during an execution in early January. Later in the month, an Ohio man gasped and convulsed during his execution with a two-drug mix never before used in the United States.","By the time the U.S. Supreme Court refused a last-minute request to stay the execution of Herbert Smulls, the Missouri inmate was already dead .

CNN host Wolf Blitzer blasted Nugent hours later, drawing parallels between that language and words Nazis used to justify exterminating Jews during World War II. Nugent's comments came at the SHOT show in Las Vegas, an annual event organized by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The camouflage cowboy hat-wearing musician is a prolific hunter and a regular defender of gun rights. Abbott brought Nugent aboard, he said, in order to 'expose' the gun-control views of his opponent in this year's race for governor, state Senator Wendy Davis. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Texas gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott, the state's Republican attorney general, embraced the support of controversial rocker Ted Nugent on Tuesday in a pair of campaign appearances . Nugent is getting hammered as a racist for his shocking statement that President Obama is a 'communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel' He introduced the 1970s singer of hits like 'Cat scratch fever' as his 'blood brother' and 'friend.' And he's making the calculation that Texans will give him – and Nugent – a pass because they dislike the president more than they want civility in political debates. 'Wendy Davis is more associated with Barack Obama than anybody in the state. I don't think there's anybody in the state who is more disliked than Barack Obama,' Abbott said Tuesday in the city of Denton, the site of a rally he held with Nugent at a Mexican restaurant. But Abbott also told reporters that he is unaware of some of Nugent's more inflammatory statements. 'I don't know what he may have said or done in his background,' said Abbott. 'What I do know is Ted Nugent stands for the Constitution. He stands against the federal government overreaching.' See the full interview on Guns.com . Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, Abbot's Democratic opponent, called the alliance 'repulsive' Nugent spoke on behald of Abbott, who claimed he was unaware of the rocker's most shocking past statements . Last month at the SHOT show, Nugent half-facetiously told a group of onlookers – many with video cameras – that he accepted the blame for President Obama's success in politics. “I have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame, enough Americans to be ever vigilant,' he said, 'not to let a Chicago communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America.' He also complained about weak-willed politicians on both the political right and left who 'check their scrotums in at the door – even Hillary.' Video of his statements was first published by GUNS.com. Davis, who came to national attention last year for a lengthy filibuster against a bill restricting the availability of abortions, has taken a knife-in-the-teeth approach to the GOP alliance between Nugent and her November opponent. 'Greg Abbott's embrace of Ted Nugent . and his ideals is an insult to every woman in Texas, and it should be an . insult to every man, every husband, brother, father, son in Texas,' she . told KDFW in Dallas. 'I think the fact that Greg Abbott is embracing those values is repulsive.' She also enlisted the help of Annie's List, a political group that works to elect female candidates, to circulate Nugent's past insults of women politicians. He once called Hillary Clinton a 'worthless b***h.' Davis made foot-in-mouth headlines recently for claiming Abbott, who is wheelchair-bound, 'hasn't walked a day in my shoes' Nugent appears to love the limelight despite being branded a racist whose language would be welcome in Nazi circles . Nugent shied away from most journalists on Tuesday, but seemed to laugh off the idea that Davis would make his views a campaign issue. 'She ought to because she has nothing meaningful to campaign on so she has to be a [Nancy] Pelosi attack dog,' he told a few reporters of Davis and the U.S. House minority leader. 'They're dishonest, anti-American people,' he said.On Tuesday CNN host Wolf Blitzer blasted Nugent on his show 'The Situation Room,' drawing parallels between the outspoken activist's 'subhuman mongrel' language  and Nazis. 'That's what the Nazis called Jews to justify the genocide of the Jewish community,' said Blitzer. 'They called them untermenschen – subhuman mongrels.' And today's Nazi party, he added, has 'a long history of that specific phrase he used involving the president of the United States.' Fact-checkers writing for the Politifact website have backed up Blitzer's claims.","The 'Cat scratch fever' legend and National Rifle Association board member railed against the president during a January gun show .

Suspect: This booking photo released by the Volusia County Division of Corrections shows Ebony Wilkerson, 32, who is accused of driving a minivan carrying her three young children into the ocean in an attempt to kill them . The pregnant South Carolina mother who drove a minivan containing her three children into the ocean in Florida has been arrested and charged with attempted murder, investigators said Friday. The woman, 32-year-old Ebony Wilkerson, from Cross, South Carolina, was booked into Volusia County Jail after undergoing a mental evaluation in a hospital Thursday. Her children are currently in state custody. Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson announced this afternoon that Wilkerson is facing three counts of first-degree attempted murder and three counts of aggravated child abuse involving great injury. ‘She did intentionally try to kill the children,’ the sheriff’s told reporters during the press conference. Wilkerson made international headlines Tuesday when she drove her minivan into the ocean on a Florida beach with her three children, ages three, nine and 10, in the car. Good Samaritans and lifeguards came to the kids' rescue, rushing into the water to remove them from the vehicle as it filled with water. In . response to questions about Wilkerson’s mental state, the sheriff . stated Friday that investigators have found no information suggesting . that the suspect was suffering from any psychiatric or emotional issues. Johnson . explained that the decision to charge Wilkerson in connection to the . incident was based on several factors, including interviews with . witnesses and the woman’s own children, who told deputies that their . mother drove the minivan straight into the surf.

In this image made from video and released by Simon Besner, lifeguards rescue children from a minivan that their mother drove into the Atlantic Tuesday in Daytona Beach, Florida . Race against time: The rescuers managed to grab all the children from the car as it was submerged in the surf . Johnson added that when questioned by police, Wilkerson claimed that she had tried to drive out of the ocean, but eyewitnesses insisted that she was going in the opposite direction and then tried to hamper the rescue efforts, suggesting intent to kill them. ‘She tried to stop one of the beach rangers from getting into the window,’ Johnson said. The sheriff also revealed that Wilkerson's young son tried to fight his mother in a bid to gain control of the steering wheel. ‘She actually told them, ""close their eyes and go to sleep, mama's taking him to a better place,""' the law enforcement official told the press. Wilkerson, who is 27 and a half weeks pregnant with her fourth child, was described by officials as calm, cooperative and 'very lucid.' Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson announced attempted murder and aggravated child abuse charges against Wilkerson . Sheriff Johnson , right,  with investigator Sgt. Richard Forton, center, talks with the media on Friday . Wilkerson was stopped in her vehicle by police officers two hours before she . drove into the ocean. Her sister called police worried since Wilkerson . had been talking about demons. The officers found her lucid and let her go, Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. According . to Wilkerson's sister, Jessica Harrell, the 32-year-old woman was . trying to escape from an abusive spouse when she drove from her home in . South Carolina to stay with her in Florida. 'Her . husband beat on her, so she came down to my house from South Carolina,' said Jessica Harrell in a call to a 911 dispatcher just hours before . Wilkerson attempted to end her life by driving her minivan into the . surf. Harrell, 28, asked the . operator to send officers to perform a welfare check because her . sibling appeared emotionally distraught. 'She's . talking about Jesus, that there are demons in my house, that I'm trying . to control her, but I'm trying to keep them safe,' Harrell said on the . call. The woman revealed that she made an attempt to take Wilkerson to a hospital the day before, but the 32-year-old left. Unstable: The pregnant South Carolina woman who drove the minivan carrying her three young children into the ocean surf had talked about demons before leaving the house . A lifeguard carries one of the three children rescued from the minivan . Frantic: Stacy Robinson, left, was the Good Samaritan who ran into the water and carried the two older children out of the surf after hearing their cries for help . When . officers caught up with Wilkerson and interviewed her, the woman . allegedly told them that she was heading to a shelter for abused women. She also added that she was going to her ‘safe place.’ Wilkerson . was let go because she did not meet the criteria to be detained under . the Florida Mental Health Act, which allows people to be involuntarily . committed if they appear to present a danger to themselves. In the 911 call, Jessica Harrell said that she had tried to take her sister to a shelter, but it had no vacancies. Police in Myrtle Beach said Wilkerson filed the domestic violence report March 1, accusing her husband of sexually assaulting her. Court records uncovered by the Post and Courier indicate that Wilkerson was married to Lutful Ronjon, 31, of Cross, who was arrested in May 2005 on domestic battery charges. The report stated that Ronjon beat up his wife during an argument about receipts while the couple were vacationing in Myrtle Beach. The battery charge was later dismissed after Ronjon underwent a domestic violence pre-trial service program. The Post and Courier in Charleston also found that Wilkerson was involved in a deadly crash in Delray in February 2007. On . the day of the accident, Wilkerson was going northbound on Interstate . 95 when she switched lanes and slammed into the rear of a Nissan . operated by Douglas Krane, of Fort Lauderdale. Desperate: Tim Tesseneer, in the bright jacket, was driving along the beach with his wife when they spotted the boy trying to climb out of the car and call for help . Pushing them away: Footage shows Wilkerson (on the far left) appear to push the lifeguard away from her door as she gets out of the car without being helped- but leaves her three children trapped inside . Running to the rescue: Three lifeguards helped the Good Samaritans and are seen trying to bring the car in from the surf after the children had been saved . What remained: Just moments after the children were taken out of the car, it flipped over completely and waves tore through it . Emergency responders: The Good Samaritans led the charge but then beach patrol took over . The . impact sent Krane's car skidding across the road and into a concrete . barrier. The driver's wife, Jennifer, suffered critical injuries in the . collision and died several days later. Wilkerson . was cited for improper lane change, lost her license for a year and was . ordered to serve 132 hours of community service, according to court . records. Witnesses to the dramatic rescue Tuesday reported hearing Wilkerson's children - . two girls and a boy, aged three, nine and 10 - screaming that their . mother was trying to kill them. Two hours earlier, police officers stopped Wilkerson and questioned her at her sister's request. 'The children were in the back seat, . they were buckled in and were not in distress. Although the sergeant . said she looked like she had some mental illness, she did not fit the . criteria for going into custody under the Baker Act.' 'If . she made any statements that she was suicidal or homicidal officers . would have taken her into custody,' said Volusia County Sheriff Ben . Johnson. Help: The woman's sister called police and . warned them that she was talking about demons, prompting them to do a . welfare check but they released her because she was lucid . The . children were turned over to welfare authorities. Officials said they would be . released to a relative in Orlando once released from Halifax Hospital . where they are being treated for minor injuries. Sheriff Ben Johnson said it's too early to say whether Wilkerson will . face criminal charges. 'They have been through a very rough ordeal,' Florida Department of Chidren and Families spokesman John Harrell said. 'We would not want to have the children placed in an environment in which they would not be cared for.' Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that the 31-year-old mother was physically able to escape the vehicle. In video taken by Simon Besner, a . tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards . try to pull her children from the vehicle. Witnesses . described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children . remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her . under the van. 'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner. In the video, several men frantically . try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's . side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan. The small child is eventually pulled to safety. Defending their actions: Sheriff Ben Johnson said that his deputies had to let her go because they had no legal justification to hold her . Another tourist described watching with horror. 'My . friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the . beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin . visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6. 'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.' 'That's . when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out . two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and . brought a little toddler out of the car'. Many added that there was no way the incident was an accident. 'When she first was drifting into the ocean, we thought maybe an accident,' Donna Pratt told the broadcaster.","Ebony Wilkerson, 32, charged with three counts of first-degree attempted murder and three counts of aggravated child abuse .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 18:45 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:15 EST, 8 March 2014 . A transgender woman in Northern California has sued the company behind the popular CrossFit workouts for refusing to let her compete in the female division of its annual fitness competitions. The lawsuit brought Thursday by Chloie Jonsson, 34, accuses CrossFit Inc. of violating her rights under a California law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Jonsson's complaint says she was born male but has been living as a woman since she was a teenager and underwent sex reassignment surgery eight years ago. The surgery, coupled with the female hormones she takes, satisfied the state's requirements for her to be recognized as female on her birth certificate and other official documents. Scroll down for video . Chloie Jonsson, 34, is suing CrossFit for not letting her compete in the women's division because she was once a man . Her surgery, coupled with the female hormones she takes, satisfied the state's requirements for her to be recognized as female on her birth certificate and other official documents . Her lawyer, Waukeen McCoy, said Jonsson, who works as a personal trainer and is an avid CrossFit practitioner, first spoke to company representatives about her background a year ago after a teammate learned that participants in the Reebok CrossFit Games were required to register according to their gender at birth. 'They said she has an advantage over other women because of the sex she was born with, and that is completely untrue, scientifically,'  McCoy said, noting that the International Olympic Committee and other sports governing bodies allow athletes who have undergone surgery, taken hormones and secured legal recognition to compete in the category that corresponds to their affirmed gender. CrossFit's general counsel, Dale Saran, would not comment on the lawsuit, which seeks $2.5 million in damages. Saran directed The Associated Press to a CrossFit online discussion board, where he posted that Jonsson had never supplied medical documents to back up her assertion that she was a woman. He also dismissed McCoy's suggestion that transgender athletes are engaged in a struggle as valid as the one black baseball players waged to be accepted in the major leagues. 'The fundamental, ineluctable fact is that a male competitor who has a sex reassignment procedure still has a genetic makeup that confers a physical and physiological advantage over women,' Saran wrote in a letter to McCoy that's linked to the discussion board. 'That Chloie may have felt herself emotionally, and very conscientiously, to be a woman in her heart, and that she ultimately underwent the legal and other surgical procedures to carry that out, cannot change that reality.' CrossFit argues that Jonsson has a psychological advantage over women because she was a man . Even though Jonsson is dissatisfied with CrossFit, the fitness company is talking about having it's own transgender competition if enough transgender come fporward . Saran said CrossFit may create a separate division for transgender athletes if enough step forward to compete. 'Our decision has nothing to do with ""ignorance"" or being bigots - it has to do with a very real understanding of the human genome, of fundamental biology, that you are either intentionally ignoring or missed in high school,' he said. CrossFit is headquartered in Washington, D.C., but its founder, Greg Glassman, launched it in Santa Cruz, Calif. in the late 1990s. The company has 7,000 affiliate gyms around the world where classes offer an intense, military-style mix of weight-lifting, core conditioning and cardio exercises, according to its website. Individuals and teams compete every year in the timed CrossFit Games to determine who can complete the most repetitions of various exercises. Chloie has wanted to be a woman ever since high school .

Defiant: Piers Morgan declared that he is now looking forward to doing higher profile interviews with bigger names after his live show was axed by CNN . Piers Morgan will end his show in three weeks and at the end of March will temporarily be replaced by a rotating team of hosts Jake Tapper and Bill Weir, announced CNN. Unfortunately, despite being off to strong start with his show Piers Morgan Live, the British host was never really able to build an American audience. Morgan said in an interview with The New York Times that he has never really been able to connect with Americans. 'It’s been a painful period, and lately we have taken a bath in the ratings,' Morgan said. Morgan is also known for disputing the U.S. Constitution, namely the 2nd amendment of the constitution which gives Americans, 'the right to bear arms.' 'Look, I am a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarizing, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it,' Morgan said. 'That’s run its course, and Jeff and I have been talking for some time about different ways of using me.' Breitbart reports that CNN is testing both Jake Tapper and Bill Weir as well as a few other mystery hosts to see if they will be able to build and audience for the hour. Tapper is a former ABC Senior White House Correspondent and Weir was a former ABC anchor on Nightline. 'Bill Weir was not brought to CNN to replace Piers Morgan,' CNN officials said late last year. Now Weir is simply auditioning for Piers Morgan's place on television. There have even been rumors that CNN is talking about giving Jay Leno his own evening show. Piers Morgan has claimed the imminent . end of his much-vaunted nightly show on CNN will actually allow him to . do the kind of interviews he always wanted to do on the cable network. Jake Tapper (left) and Bill Weir (right) are auditioning for a Piers Morgan's former time slot . Morgan, who confirmed the axing of his eponymous live show last week after three-years of inconsistent ratings, said that he will be staying on at CNN. 'I’ll make a deal to do 20 to 25 shows a year, all interviews with big names. That’s what I wanted to do in the first place, not reports on snow storms and that kind of thing,' said Morgan in typically forthright fashion. Indeed, in a sidewalk interview with TMZ, Morgan said that he was relieved his show was over and appeared to imply that some of his daily output through CNN was not substantial enough. 'I'm ready to move on,' Morgan said. 'I want to do big interviews.' He told TMZ that his favorite shows were the ones where major names like the Dalai Lama, former president Bill Clinton and Oprah were interviewed. 'I came to do the show to do big interviews,' he said. 'I wasn't doing enough. I want to do less shows, more big interviews.' Scroll down for video . Morgan's guests in 2014 have included Jordan Belfort, the subject of the movie The Wolf Of Wall Street . Three years after taking over from Larry King in the coveted 9pm slot, ratings for Piers Morgan Live have not matched rivals such as Fox News and MSNBC, causing network president Jeffrey Zucker to pull the plug on the British journalist. The show's ratings have fallen from an audience of two million to around 270,000. The date of the last show has yet to be decided. ‘It’s been a painful period and lately we have taken a bath in the ratings,’ Morgan, 48, told The New York Times. CNN's audience has tired of hearing a Brit weigh in on American cultural issues, Morgan said. During his tenure, he adopted a polarizing stance on controversial topics, in particular on gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, where 26 people, including 20 children, were killed. Morgan said: ‘Look, I am a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarising, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it.' More of the same? Piers Morgan claimed that his interview with former President Clinton was one of the high-points of his reign as nightly talk-show host in the United States . Morgan replaced the acclaimed presenter Larry King, pictured here interviewing Paul McCartney . Plans for a replacement are underway, but Morgan and the network are in talks about him remaining on the air in a different role. ‘Jeff and I have been talking for some time about different ways of using me,’ said Morgan, whose contract with the network ends in September. Morgan made a promising start when his show, previously called Piers Morgan Tonight, aired on CNN on January 17 2011. His first guest was Oprah Winfrey – and he managed to reduce her to tears. During points in the interview Oprah teased Morgan, pointing out that she could cry, but wasn't going to. However, right at the end of their exchange, the 56-year-old broadcaster began to well up as she talked about Martin Luther King. For his final question, Piers sought Oprah's approval, asking her: 'How did I do?' Morgan reduced Oprah Winfrey to tears on his first show in January 2011 . And despite Oprah telling Morgan 'you're good' at various points throughout the interview, she chose to describe him as 'surprising' when asked directly. 'Surprisingly bad?' Piers questioned. 'No just surprising. And that's good. Who doesn't want to be surprised?' Some media critics also warmed to Morgan. 'The premiere of Piers Morgan Tonight revealed host Piers Morgan to be clever, tenacious, vain, a flatterer, and fitfully funny,' said EW.com. Politico said 'Morgan might be just the solution that CNN needs’ and the Philadelphia Inquirer remarked: 'If [Morgan] shows the judgment, skills and news sense he showed… with the toughest first-night assignment a TV talk-show host ever had, he'll make people forget Larry King even more quickly than they already have.' However, others weren’t so kind. One of Morgan’s most difficult shows saw him interview pro-gun campaigner Alex Jones. Morgan had waded into the gun debate in America, publicly calling for a nationwide ban on military-style semi-automatic weapons. Radio host and conspiracy theorist Jones responded by organizing a petition to have Morgan deported, which received over 100,000 signatures. Morgan's world famous interviewees included former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . Morgan interviewed Jones about gun control shortly afterwards, but Jones spent the majority of the interview shouting at Morgan, often preventing him from expressing his views. The show ended with Jones yelling: 'Don't try what your ancestors did before'. Morgan - who has also presented ITV show Life Stories - has said in the past that he believes he is the best at his job in Britain. He said he rated Michael Parkinson but said he thought he was better than everyone else. Earlier this month, Morgan - former editor of the Daily Mirror - confirmed he had been questioned over claims of phone hacking. He was interviewed under caution at the end of last year by officers investigating claims of illegal interception of voicemails by Mirror Group journalists. No arrest was made and it's thought the matter has gone no further. The Mirror Group was brought into the phone-hacking investigation for the first time in March last year when detectives from Operation Weeting arrested four journalists in dawn raids.","Piers Morgan Live confirmed to be canceled last week after the presenter said his talk show has 'taken a bath in the ratings'

A Minnesota father had to choose which of his seven children to save when a fire broke out in his Minneapolis duplex on Friday night. Tragically, 60-year-old widower Troy Lewis was only able to save two of his children, 9-year-old Shaca and 5-year-old Electra. The children who died in the blaze ranged in age from 8 years to just 19 months. Lewis cried from his hospital bed, describing the choice no parent wants to make. 'I wanted to get all of my babies,' Lewis told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'All of my babies. I wanted all my babies.' Scroll down for video . Regis Woodson and Chris Anderson embrace each other as they visit the home where a fire broke out Friday, Feb. 14, 2014, in Minneapolis . Blaze: Lewis managed to save two of his seven children before the flames, pictured, became too much . Shaca and Electra are still in critical condition according to a Hennepin County Medical Center spokesman. The . fire broke out around 4:30am on the top floor of the duplex. According . to the building's landlord, Lewis and his children had been living there . for the past six or eight months. The children's mother Kim Davis, 31, . died in November from cancer. Lewis had to jump out of his second-story window to escape the blaze. He injured his back in the fall, but went right back into the house to save his children. First he grabbed Shaca who was gasping for air. Then he went for 8-year-old Christopher, but found his son already dead. 'He was dead,' Lewis told the Star Tribune. 'I saw him burned. I saw my baby burn.' Two . other children shared a bedroom with Christopher, 5-year-old Fannie and . 3-year-old Troy, so Lewis moved on to look for the other kids knowing . those two children didn't make it. Tragic: Five of Troy Lewis' seven children died in a duplex fire Friday morning . Cause: Authorities say the fire started on the second floor, and likely was caused by a space heater . 'I had a choice to make, a dead child here or...a live one,' Lewis said. After rescuing Shaca and Electra, Lewis again attempted to get back into the house but by then it was engulfed in flames. 'I ran back upstairs to get the third child, that's when I stopped. I couldn't do it no more. Out of seven, I have two. I have to be strong for them,' Lewis told WCCO. 'All I can say is that they were beautiful children,' Lewis added. Should have never moved into that house.' The Minneapolis Fire Department was still investigating the cause of the Friday fire. A space heater was found on the ground of the upper apartment, but officials don't know if it was in use when the fire began. Temperatures reached a lot of 0 degrees on Friday, Valentine's Day. Landlord Paul Bertelson’s company identifies distressed . or foreclosed properties, refurbishes them and rents to low-income . families. He said the 102-year-old duplex had smoke and carbon monoxide . detectors. The upper unit is heated by permanent baseboard units. There were no current code violations on the duplex where 15 people lived. Neighbor Brandi Craig awoke to the children's cries when the fire broke out before dawn. 'They were all screaming,' Craig said, her face twisting with emotion. 'Once they stopped screaming, it was over.' Craig said that just the night before she and her fiance had stopped by to give the kids some soft drinks. 'We gave them hugs and kisses and told them we’d see them in the morning,' she said. Instead she woke up to see the house engulfed in flames, a blaze already too dangerous for her to do anything but watch as firefighters broke down the door and tried to rescue the kids. She saw them bring two apparently already dead children from the building. At that point, she said, she couldn’t watch anymore. Lucky: A man living on the first floor of the building smelled smoke and evacuated the house with his family . Neighbors say the second and third floors of the home were occupied by a man and his seven children ranging in age from 1 to 9 . 'It just took everything away from me,' she said. Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel said three children died at the scene. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed the two additional deaths but did not release any information about the victims. Fruetel said firefighters encountered heavy smoke and fire on the second and third floors of the duplex as they searched for victims and survivors. It took firefighters about 2½ hours to put out the blaze. He said investigators were still trying Friday to determine a cause, but it appeared the fire started on the second floor, in the center of the building. He said the building was up to code and smoke detectors were hard-wired and appeared to be working. He said he didn’t know if the smoke detectors went off before this fire. Gov. Mark Dayton issued a statement offering condolences to the family and friends of the victims, and thanking firefighters and other first responders 'whose heroism saved lives this morning.' Minneapolis Public Schools confirmed two of the children killed were students at Bethune Community School, in the first and second grades. City records show an inspection report last summer called for repairs to smoke detectors in the unit, among other violations. City spokesman Matt Laible said all of the violations were taken care of and that the unit’s rental license was renewed just a week ago. One of the more than 40 firefighters who responded to the scene was injured. Fruetel said he suffered a muscle strain. The Red Cross was assisting three adults and four children who were displaced by the fire. The father of the seven children made it out of the house and now in satisfactory condition .

Sacking means something quite different for NFL coaches on the first day following the end of the regular season. Five coaches have already been fired today in a tradition known as Black Monday, as teams not progressing to the playoffs try to get a head start on next year. As of noon today, the head coaches of the the Detroit Lions, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Washington Redskins, Minnesota Vikings, and Cleveland Browns have all been let go. If any more firings are announced today, it may be one of the worst Black Mondays in recent history. Last year was noted as being an especially brutal year with six firings. Scroll down for video . First to go: The Cleveland Browns got a head start on Black Monday by announcing the firing of head coach Rob Chudzinski late last night . Now unemployed: Minnesota Vikings head coach Leslie Frazier (left) and Washington Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan (right) were the first to be fired this morning as the NFL's struggling teams clear house in hopes of a better season next year . The dismissals started early this year, with news that the Cleveland Browns would not be keeping coach Rob Chudzinski being released late last night. As Monday morning dawned, two other coaches expected to be fired joined Chudzinksi on the unemployment line. The Minnesota Vikings fired head coach Leslie Frazier and the Washington Redskins fired head coach and Executive Vice President Mike Shanahan in announcements made before 10am. Shanahan was among those expected to be out of the job for the way he dealt with quarterback Robert Griffin III's ACL injury last season. Griffin injured his right knee in a game against the Baltimore Ravens on December 9, 2012. Surprising: By noon today Greg Schiano of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . (left) and Jim Schwartz of the Detroit Lions (right) were also let go. Schiano's dismissal was unexpected since an NFL insider previously . tweeted that his job was safe . Instead of letting Griffin recover from the injury, Shanahan put him back on the field after missing just one game. On January 6, the Redskins went up against the Seattle Seahawks in an NFL wildcard game and Griffin aggravated the injury, having to undergo surgery three days later. Griffin was back playing this season but the leg injury seems to have slowed him down noticeably. By lunchtime, two other coaches had been fired: Greg Schiano of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jim Schwartz of the Detroit Lions. Bad move: Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan was expected to lose his job for the way he dealt with quarterback Robert Griffin III's leg injury. Above, Griffin aggravated his injury in a game against the Seattle Seahawks last year . Schiano's firing was unexpected as NFL insider Jay Glazer tweeted yesterday that the Tampa Bay coach was safe. Tampa Bay General Manager Mark Dominik was also let go. Out early: The Houston Texans broke tradition and fired head coach Gary Kubiak earlier this month, before the end of the regular season . While five firings may seem relatively tame, the dismissals have impacts far beyond one man since it means their assistant coaches are also out of the job. But most won't be unemployed for long as they'll get snapped up by one of the other now head coach-less teams. This quick turnover process helps the struggling teams get a fresh start on next year before the combine and draft. 'Everyone’s in such a competitive environment, there’s a race to get things done because there is the same group of candidates out there,' former Jets General Manager Mike Tannenbaum told the New York Times. 'It’s to clear the decks and move on.' While it's not certain when Black Monday officially became apart of the NFL culture, the Times reports that it originated about 10 to 15 years ago around the time when sports channels switched to become 24 hour news sources. But not all teams take part in the annual ritual. The Houston Texans fired their head coach Gary Kubiak at the beginning of this month far before the end of the regular season. 'We normally would wait until the end of year to evaluate our staff; under these extreme circumstances thought best to start the process now,' team owner Bob McNair said at the time.","Every year, struggling teams announce their firings the first day following the regular season to get a head start on next year .

The family of a California girl declared brain dead after complications from tonsil surgery was running out of time Sunday to find a new facility to take her in and keep her on a ventilator. A judge's ruling will allow Children's Hospital Oakland to remove 13-year-old Jahi McMath from life support at 5pm Monday unless her family appeals. The family is now pinning its hopes on a New York facility after two California care homes withdrew offers to accept the teen. Next steps: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal. Her parents now must find a nursing home to take her and a doctor willing to perform the procedures she'll need for transfer . Unthinkable: Jahi McMath's mother Nailah Winkfeld has an emotional moment in court on Tuesday as a judge announces the Oakland Children's Hospital may take her daughter off life support next Monday. Pictured with her husband and Jahi's stepfather Martin Winkfield . Chris Dolan, the family's attorney, said he was waiting to hear from the New York hospital after its facility director and medical director speak. He wouldn't provide the hospital's name, saying the media attention could hurt Jahi's chance of being transferred there. 'The family is together, and today everybody is praying and being together,' Dolan told The Associated Press Sunday. He said no decisions had been made about legal options for Monday, and would not comment on progress with the New York facility. The hospital said it had not heard from the New York, or any other, facility about a transfer. 'We need to be able to talk to the other facility to understand what it is they are capable of doing,' Cynthia Chiarappa, a hospital spokeswoman, said Sunday. The hospital also said it would need to confirm there is 'lawful transportation' included in any plan to transfer Jahi, and written permission from the coroner. 'This is not transferring an individual in a vegetative state, but a dead body.' Last photos: Mrs Winkfield snapped this picture of daughter Jahi the morning she took her to the hospital to undergo a tonsillectomy that ended up all but ending her life . Unexpected: After coming out of surgery, Jahi started bleeding for the mouth and was eventually ruled brain-dead. The hospital that performed the procedure no longer wants to keep the girl on life support . Still hope? Last week, Jahi's family released this picture of Nailah Wakefield holding her daughter's hand. The family has until January 7 to get the girl transferred to a facility that will take her or face pulling her plug . Jahi underwent a tonsillectomy at the hospital on December 9 to treat sleep apnea. After she awoke from the operation, her family said, she started bleeding heavily from her mouth and went into cardiac arrest. Doctors at Children's Hospital and an independent pediatric neurologist from Stanford University have concluded the girl is brain dead. The hospital wants to remove her from life support, but the family said they believe she is still alive. Upsetting: Makhai McMath, 8, blows a bubble with her gum as she marches in support of her 13-year-old sister . Dede Logan, of Oakland, adds red stars to a poster in support of Jahi McMath in front of Children's Hospital Oakland in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, Dec. 23, 2013 . Hope: Jahi's family believe she is still alive, despite being pronounced brain-dead by an independent doctor . Before Jahi can be transferred, she must undergo two more medical procedures - the insertion of a breathing tube and a feeding tube, both of which would be necessary for her long-term care but which a nursing home is not equipped to perform. The hospital has refused to perform the procedures. 'Children's Hospital Oakland does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice,' David Durand, its chief of pediatrics, said in a statement Thursday. Douglas Straus, a lawyer for the hospital, said in a letter made public Friday that before the hospital would comply with the family's request to move Jahi, it would need to speak directly with officials at any nursing home to make sure they understand her condition, 'including the fact that Jahi is brain dead' - and to discuss needed preparations, including transportation. 'Children's Hospital will of course continue to do everything legally and ethically permissible to support the family of Jahi McMath. In that regard, Children's will allow a lawful transfer of Jahi's body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and Children's can legally do so,' Straus wrote in the letter. He also said the Alameda County coroner needed to sign off on the move 'since we are dealing with the body of a person who has been declared legally dead.' The letter was sent to Dolan after Dolan said he was preparing a federal civil rights lawsuit to force the hospital to outfit Jahi with breathing and feeding tubes. He said the hospital's refusal to cooperate violated her family's religious, due process rights and privacy rights. Another hospital spokesman, Sam Singer, said Sunday in an interview with KRON-TV that Children's Hospital will facilitate a transfer if the family finds an outside physician to insert the breathing and feeding tubes needed to make it happen. 'We'll do our best, if it is within the confines of things that are legal and medically correct, to be of assistance to them,' Singer said. 'At a certain point, they have to be able to look themselves in the eye and realize that this young lady is dead and is not coming back under any circumstances.'","Jahi McMath, 13, experienced complications following a tonsillectomy and was officially declared brain dead on December 12 .

Great responsibilities will rest on his shoulders one day. But in the meantime, Prince William is going back to being a student. The future king starts a ten-week course in agricultural management at Cambridge University next week. The ‘bespoke’ course has been organised for the 31-year-old Duke of Cambridge to give him an understanding of issues affecting farms and rural communities. It will also, no doubt, come in handy when he inherits the Duchy of Cornwall, one of the biggest private estates in the country, from his father. The second in line to the throne, who has a geography degree from St Andrew’s University, will have around 20 hours a week of timetabled lectures, seminars  and meetings. He will also be expected to undertake extensive study in his own time and may be sent on field trips. Although he will still be based at Kensington Palace with the Duchess of Cambridge and son George, staff have organised private accommodation for the prince when he needs to stay in Cambridge. He is likely to be away from home two or three nights a week. The course is run by Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership, an institution within the university’s School of Technology and has Prince Charles as its patron. However, Prince William will be based in the Department of Land Economy, teasingly referred to by other students as the ‘Department of Grass Management’. The Duke will not be awarded any qualification at the end of the course, which he is set to finish in mid-March – shortly before he sets off on an official tour of New Zealand and Australia with his family. An aide said: ‘Like his father, the Duke is very much a countryman, he enjoys and is passionate about the countryside and its people. Student life: These are the lecture rooms for the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership in the city of Cambridge where Prince William is going to be studying agriculture for the next ten weeks .

Sarah Ferguson has lost two stone after embarking on a gruelling three-month bootcamp in the Swiss Alps. The newly-trim Duchess of York, 54, who once weighed almost 16 stone, shed the pounds with the help of her personal trainer of 20 years Josh Salzmann. She has reportedly seen the weight fall off after sticking to a strict diet of blended foods, daily runs and mountain hikes over the past 12 weeks. All change: Sarah Ferguson pictured in July before embarking on her health kick (left) and showing off a svelter silhouette earlier this month (right) But while she has been put through her paces daily, it hasn't all been so tough.

A former New York call girl who claims to have been choked by Eliot Spitzer during an X-rated encounter has also accused the Manhattan District Attorney's Office of 'pimping' her out to catch a notorious madam. In her new tell-all book, Rebecca Woodard, now-37, alleges she was pushed by prosecutors working under ex-District Attorney Robert Morgenthau to keep up her pricey prostitution after she agreed to wear a wire to help catch Anna Gristina in 2008. 'They wanted me to keep breaking the law so they could get more information,' Woodard writes in 'Call Girl Confidential.' 'It was like sex slavery at the behest of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.' Informant: Rebecca Woodard, pictured left and right, claims she was pushed by prosecutors to keep up her pricey prostitution after she agreed to wear a wire to help catch Anna Gristina in 2008 . Tell-all: Woodard wrote the book, Call Girl Confidential pictured, under the alias 'Rebecca Kade' According to The New York Post, she . claims an assistant DA, who she doesn't name in the book, told her to . keep working so she could garner information to help the case. Woodard, . who writes for Simon & . Schuster under the alias 'Rebecca Kade,' also alleges she was told to . give the cash she earned in her sessions and any gifts she was given by clients to the . office. 'Technically, this ADA was my pimp,' she writes. Woodard . explains she had already begun servicing high-rolling johns as part of Gristina's . prostitution ring when the DA's office asked her to go undercover. But she writes in the book the operation was so secret that even Morgenthau had no idea. Boss: Robert Morgenthau (pictured) was Manhattan's District Attorney at the time however, Woodard writes in the book that she doesn't believe he was aware of the 'shenanigans' of his staff . Guilty: Woodard went undercover to help authorities gather enough evidence to prosecute Anna Gristina, pictured . 'I highly doubt District Attorney Morgenthau was aware of the ADA's shenanigans,' Woodard writes. 'God knows if somebody pocketed the . money (earned through the prostitution). (And) this cowboy still has a . job in law enforcement, in another state, at an even higher level' as . 'an assistant US attorney.' A spokesman for the Manhattan DA's office declined comment to MailOnline. Woodard described the people she worked with as bumbling fools when it came to surveillance, the Post reports. She . describes one occasion when they tried to fit the wire around her waist . and up her chest so she could record Gristina's accountant Jonas Gayer . during a meeting at his apartment. 'Client': Eliot Spitzer, pictured, enjoyed violence in the bedroom, pinning a former call girl to a bed and clutching at her throat until she struggled to breathe, she claims . '""Are . you kidding me?"" I nearly screamed,' Woodward writes. '""It's not going . to work to wire my body, because the very first thing heâ€™s going to do . is feel me up.""' In the end, the DA's office bought her a designer handbag to hide the wire in. After a while as an informant, she felt Gristina was becoming suspicious and she writes that she wanted out. 'The ADA stared at me, and his face was turning red,' Woodard explains. 'He stormed out of the room... I never heard from him again.' After that former prosecutor Seema Iyer became her public defender. Appalled at her treatment, the lawyer told her she could bring a lawsuit against the city, Woodard writes. Later, the assistant DA left his job for another role and his replacement allegedly told her all her hard work had been for nothing and would be 'thrown out because it would be inadmissible in court.' They then asked her to wear a wiretap again, and she writes that they threatened to arrest her for prostitution if she didn't. 'It was blackmail,' she claims in the book. 'I felt like he was trying to intimidate me into going back to work for them under these threats.' Also in the book, Woodard names Eliot Spitzer as a former client and claims he enjoyed violence in the bedroom, at one point even choking her. He has denied being involved with the woman.","Rebecca Woodard, now-37, claims she was pushed by prosecutors to keep up her pricey prostitution after she agreed to wear a wire to help catch Anna Gristina in 2008 .

She's been rocking a make-up free, low-key look this week on the beaches of Barbados, but, as if to remind us she can scrub up rather glamorously, images of Cara starring in a polished new YSL beauty campaign have just been released. The model is the face of the beauty and makeup Spring 2014 campaign for the renowned Parisian luxury brand. The sneak peak of the new campaign sees the 21-year-old showing off the company's new cosmetics range, with a glossy red pout, matching nails and perfect flicked eyeliner. Cara smoulders in the latest snap from the beauty and make up Yves Saint Laurent Spring 2014 campaign . Standing against a bright red backdrop, Cara wears a belted black dress with a daring cut-away  polka-dot mesh panel. Cara, who fronted the brand’s adverts for their false-effect Babydoll mascara earlier this year, is following in the footsteps of Claudia Schiffer and Jessica Chastain who have both modelled for YSL beauty. The model is currently enjoying a break from her work-hard-party-harder lifestyle, holidaying on the Caribbean island of Barbados. The 21-year-old model fronted the adverts for the brand's Baby Doll mascara earlier this year . Cara also posed for YSL's Rebel Nude lip glosses this year . Cara shared a snap on Saturday night of her cuddling up to her Barbadian-born pal Rhianna, 25, who has also been staying on the island over Christmas. The darling of the fashion world also used her holiday to show off a new tattoo. Cara appears to have had the words 'Don't Worry Be Happy,' perhaps inspired by the 1988 Bobby McFerrin song, tattooed under her breasts. The inking comes despite having been given a warning from her modelling agency to stay away from the tattoo parlour after getting a distinctive ‘Made in England’ tattoo on the base of her foot. Cara has been sporting a much more low key look this week on holiday in Barbados, where she revealed her new tattoo .","New picture shows Cara in YSL's 2014 make-up range .

A closeted gay student living in West Monroe, Louisiana has written a powerful essay, criticizing the town's most famous residents - Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson. Robertson made headlines after issuing homophobic comments in a GQ article, at one point comparing gay sex to bestiality, which got him put on suspension by the A&E network. But the network announced yesterday that they would be reinstating Robertson to the show, who so far has remained unapologetic about the comments. In an essay posted on Times-Picuyne columnist Robert Mann's blog, the communications student writes that Robertson probably didn't mean to hurt anyone with his statements, he nonetheless created a hostile environment. 'He . encouraged - hopefully unintentionally - a two-week-long ""fag bashing"" in Monroe and around the world. He made me feel unsafe in my own home. I . can't count how many times I heard ""faggot"" over the Christmas visit . home.' Hurtful words: A closeted gay student has come out to condemn Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson over his homophobic comments . The author says he's never met Robertson but was raised by a man just like him, revealing that his father called him an asshole for coming out to his mother and told him that his boyfriend would never be welcomed at his house. 'My Phil Robertson threatened my life because I had the audacity to be who I am,' he wrote. Like many southerners, the writer grew up in a religious family and always felt a deep connection to the Christian church. But when then he realized that people like Robertson believed he had a 'second class soul' and wouldn't be eligible for salvation because of who he loved. Not accepted: In an anonymous essay posted on a Times-Picayune columnist's blog, the student writes about what its like to grow up and live in the same community as Robertson (far right) - surrounded by people who don't accept gays . He says the church gets closer to welcoming gay members every year but something always happens to bring back the worst in people. 'One year it was Chick-fil-a. This year it's Phil Robertson.' Worse than not being accepted by his church is not being accepted by his own family. He says he came out to his parents but was told to keep it a secret from everyone they know: 'The family isn't ready to hear that,' they said. People like Sarah Palin have come out to defend Robertson, saying he shouldn't be persecuted for his beliefs but the writer points out a flaw with this reasoning. Back in the game: Robertson's views briefly got him suspended from the network but that ban was officially lifted yesterday and he will appear in future episodes of Duck Dynasty . 'You don't know persecution until you're a 12-year-old boy sitting in a church pew when your preacher encourages everyone to vote to make gay marriage illegal because they think you don't deserve the same joy of raising a family due to your depravity...When you know that, then you can talk about persecution.' The writer ends the letter on a positive note, saying that though Robertson's comments can cause homophobia to flare up in the south, he doesn't let it discredit him. 'My love isn't different. It isn't unholy. It isn't wrong because a man with a beard said so in a GQ article. My love is real. And it's not going away.'","Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson caused controversy last week over homophobic comments he made in GQ magazine .

Almost half of women say they feel guilty about their carbohydrate consumption, a new study revealed . With Christmas over and New Year looming, many of us are turning our thoughts to diets and New Year’s resolutions. And this year it seems carbohydrates will be on the hit list. New research suggests nearly 50 per cent of women feel guilty about eating them. The study of 3,000 people revealed many believe removing carbohydrates from their diet is an effective way to shed the pounds. However, Jane Ogden, professor in health psychology at the University of Surrey, and designer of the new survey, claims this is dangerous as carbohydrates are an ‘essential’ part of people’s diets. She said: ‘If they realise that carbohydrates have an essential part in their diets, not only for energy but also for building long-term sustainable healthy habits, then carbohydrates can resume their place as a central part of how they eat.’ Professor Ogden added that rather than cutting out all carbohydrates, people should try to steer clear of sugary ‘bad carbs’. She says the problem with avoiding carbohydrates altogether is that it means people feel hungry and that this leads to snacking on fatty, sugary foods. This, she explains, can lead to an unhealthy, vicious cycle. The new survey, which was conducted from the weight-loss supplement XLS-Medical Carb Blocker, . also revealed that women are twice as likely as men to feel guilty . about their carbohydrate consumption - despite the fact they are less . likely to be overweight. One . in ten women say they constantly feel bad about their carb consumption . while a quarter say they try to avoid eating them during the week so . they can eat more at the weekends. It also found that most people are unsure how much carbohydrate they ought to eat each day. A quarter of women say they avoid carbs during the week so they can overindulge at the weekends . The . government currently recommends that about half of a person’s daily . calorie intake should be in the form of carbohydrates but most people . surveyed significantly underestimated the amount of food that would . amount to. In reality, this would add up to about one bowl of cereal, two slices of bread, a portion of pasta and three oatcakes. While . Professor Ogden is clear in her opinion that carbohydrates should . remain a key part of people’s diets, nutritionist Zoe Harcombe . disagrees. Many women believe cutting carbohydrates from their diet is a quick and effective way to lose weight but some experts fear this is dangerous as they are 'essential' She claims it is illogical to say people should avoid carbohydrates that are high in sugar, because all carbohydrates break down into sugar. She . told MailOnline: ‘This shows nutritional ignorance. Telling people to . cut down on sugar but to eat more carbohydrate is like telling people to . use the car less but to consume more petrol. ‘All carbs break down into sugars. Whether polysaccharides (many sugars), disaccharides (two sugars) or . mono saccharides (single sugars) - all carbs break down into sugar.’ She . added: ‘Carbs are not essential. Essential in nutrition means that the . substance must be consumed - the body doesn't make it. ‘There are essential fats. There are essentials proteins (certain amino acids). There are no essential carbs.’ She added: ‘Women are right to be wary of carbs - they make us fat.’ She explained that women only need about . 500 calories a day for energy and that these needs can be met from fat . or carbohydrates. The other 1,500 calories a woman requires are for functions such as cell repair and fighting infection and carbohydrates cannot meet these needs. As a result, she says people who eat more than 500 calories of carbs every day are likely to be overweight. While there is debate about the importance of carbohydrates in people’s diets, there can be no argument about obesity statistics. In Britain last year, 58 per cent of women and 65 per cent of men were overweight. In 1993, 58 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women were overweight or obese. Carrie Ruxton, an independent dietician, said that carbs are the body’s main source of energy – and the brain’s only source. Echoing Professor Ogden’s concern, she said: ‘It is completely wrong to demonise carbohydrates.  Those who do have the wrong end of the stick.’","Many people think cutting out carbs is an effective way to lose weight .

Reputations count for so much in football and Howard Webb will appreciate that when he reads reviews of Sunday's Chelsea v Liverpool game. When refereeing appointments are made the tenet 'big names for big games' is used and the key to these matches is getting the big decisions right. At Stamford Bridge Webb failed to make the right call too many times despite being in excellent positions to see incidents clearly. Man in the middle: Howard Webb was in charge of Chelsea against Liverpool but he got a few decisions wrong - like failing to send off Oscar (left) and Lucas (sitting down) when the two Brazilians clashed late on . Crunch: Oscar went flying into Liverpool midfielder Lucas at Stamford Bridge . Get a grip: Lucas let Oscar know he wasn't happy with the challenge and grabbed his opponent by the neck . THE KEY INCIDENTS . Contact: Eto'o clipped Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and brought him down in the penalty area . Going down: Suarez hit the deck after he was caught by Eto'o during Chelsea's victory over Liverpool . Ref justice: Suarez was fuming when Webb did not give a penalty for Eto'o's trip on the Liverpool star . Analysis of these incidents points to a poor performance by England’s leading referee but neither manager condemned him which supports Pierluigi Collina’s view of what makes a great man in the middle. The Italian says that an official has a great reputation if he has earned the right to be regarded as a good referee who has made poor decisions rather than a poor referee. That Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wrongly attacked the referee after Liverpool’s previous game and Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho won the Champions League final when Webb was in charge will have helped. But Webb will still not enjoy reviewing the game. Welcome to Chelsea: Samuel Eto'o's high tackle on Jordan Henderson happened early on . Another one slips through: Webb did not send Eto'o off for his nasty challenge on Reds midfielder Henderson . We are the halfway point of the season and Webb has refereed on 16 of the 19 Premier League rounds of fixtures, more than any other ref. He is yet to award a penalty or send a player off in the top division despite having plenty of opportunities to do both. It could be that World Cup selection is affecting him and he is perhaps trying to avoid controversy in the build-up to Brazil 2014 - the list of referees for the tournament will be announced in May. Referees believe that you are remembered for decisions you make and not those you ‘miss’. That is only true for a limited period, as is a reputation for being a great referee. Webb now needs to review his approach and prove one last tenet – form is temporary, class is permanent.","Howard Webb should have sent off Samuel Eto'o, Lucas and Oscar .
The ref should also have given Liverpool's Luis Suarez a penalty .
Webb hopes to be selected to referee at next summer's World Cup in Brazil .
He has refereed more Premier League games than any other official this season without showing a red card or giving a penalty .
Samuel Eto’o should have been dismissed for a shocking, high, studs-up challenge on Jordan Henderson after just two minutes.
Chelsea should have been awarded a penalty when Lucas tripped Eden Hazard – despite Hazard moving his leg towards Lucas to ensure contact.
When John Terry appeared to climb on Luis Suarez there were loud penalty appeals and Webb was for once not well positioned and waved them away. This time he was right as Suarez caused the contact by backing in.
Liverpool should have had a penalty when Eto’o inexplicably tripped Suarez.
Oscar and Lucas should both have been dismissed in the final few minutes when the Chelsea midfielder committed a two-footed lunging tackle on his fellow Brazilian who reacted by grabbing him by the neck. Incredibly Webb, who saw the incident clearly, indicated for play to continue with the ‘advantage’ signal. He was forced to stop play as the fracas escalated and eventually Oscar was cautioned."

President Obama's party is nervous that he might face impeachment proceedings â€“ or at least it wants potential donors to think so. The Democratic National Committee send a fundraising email on Saturday, titled 'Impeachment,' that warned several Republicans have raised the spectre of a move to bounce the president from office. 'Republicans are actually excited about the idea,' the email said. 'Show these Republicans that they are way, way off base and give President Obama a Congress that has his back.' The email was sent to supporters of Obama For America, the president's political campaign organization, The Daily Caller reported, and sought contributions for 2014 congressional campaigns. It featured quotes from Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Michigan Rep. Kerry Bentivolio, and Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold, all Republicans who have openly used what Democrats call 'The ""I"" word.' Feeling the heat, but it's just Hawaii: Barack Obama is vacationing while his political party floats the threat of impeachment as a fundraising tool . President Bill Clinton denied allegations of a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky in 1998, and his similar denials in sworn testimony led to his impeachment . Rep. Blake Farenthold (L) predicted that an impeachment vote against Obama would pass easily in the House of Representatives, and  Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R) salivated about writing the articles of impeachment . Only two U.S. presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither was convicted of his charges in the U.S. Senate, a step that's necessary before a president can be removed from office, . In February 1999, after Clinton easily won acquittal on a perjury charge and dodged conviction for obstruction of justice by a single vote, Democrats linked arms and sang the civil-rights anthem 'We Shall Overcome' on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about an extramarital affair he carried on with a young White House intern. Obama's troubles, by contrast, are more the stuff of political scandal than of legal jeopardy. His State Department staff altered CIA-approved talking points that named the terrorist group behind a 2012 attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Tea party groups and other conservatives were targeted for harassment by his Internal Revenue Service beginning in 2010, a program that was later covered up. Both of those choices, Republicans say, were calculated efforts to secure Obama's re-election in 2012. The Democratic Party sent out an email with infographics raising the spectre of an Obama impeachment and using the idea to raise money . Obama 'has committed impeachable offenses,' said Rep. Michele Bachmann, the tea party darling that Democrats love to hate . Obama is also under fire for lying to the American public with his assurances that they could keep existing health insurance plans and doctor-patient relationships under the Affordable Care Act. And his Department of Justice repeatedly spied on journalists, including some at Fox News and the Associated Press, in an effort to ferret out the source of national security leaks. As Obama struggles to change the subject from Obamacare to jobs and the economy, the Democratic Party is focused on the 2014 congressional elections. They need to flip 17 Republican seats into their column in order to take back control of the House of Representatives, an outcome that no national pollster has suggested is possible. But Republicans stand a chance of taking over the Senate, something that would require victory in 6 of the 20 races where Democratic incumbents are defending their seats. The GOP would also have to hang on to the 15 Republican-held seats that are up for grabs. Texas congressman Steve Stockman warned in 2013 that he would move to impeach the president if he introduced new gun 'unconstitutional' gun-control measures . Conservatives have kept the idea of an Obama impeachment alive since his early years in office, beginning with so-called 'birthers' who believe he is foreign-born and ineligible to be president . Write caption here . Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky, a liberal Democrat, warned this year that the Benghazi affair is 'a potential impeachment issue as long as the Republicans are in control of the House' Fox News host and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee predicted in May that the president 'will not serve out his full term.' At present, however, no member of . Congress has officially filed articles of impeachment against President .

A woman spoke of her shock after she gave birth to a baby daughter on Boxing Day - despite no signs that she was pregnant. Mhairi Murdoch, 29, spent Christmas suffering from an upset stomach and feeling bloated - but she had no idea it was because she was about to give birth. She went for a glass of orange juice before bed late on December 26 when a sharp pain in her stomach brought her to her knees. After the unexpected arrival, which took place around 11.50pm, Mhairi was taken to hospital where she and Russell were given the good news that little Casey was fit and healthy . Hearing her scream, terrified husband Russell, 33, quickly ran to help - as Mhairi realised she was about to have a baby on the kitchen floor. Just 10 minutes later Russell delivered Casey, a healthy 7lbs 6oz - and completely unexpected - addition to the family. Mhairi said yesterday: 'It’s the biggest Christmas surprise we’ve ever had. 'In the morning I had a bit of an iffy stomach and wasn’t feeling too great. 'I thought I would have some orange juice before I settled down in my bed. 'All of a sudden I got this searing pain right through my stomach. Mhairi says that she had no signs of pregnancy until she went into labour . 'Before I knew it I was on the kitchen floor. 'Russell heard me screaming in pain from the top of the stairs. 'He came running down and basically found me on all fours on the floor. 'I was getting this very big urge to push - I thought there’s something not right here. 'At that point I just screamed at him ‘I think I’m having a baby’. 'The colour just drained from his face.' Mhairi, from Aberdeen, had no idea until that point that she was pregnant and had not experienced any of the usual symptoms over the previous nine months. She had even taken precautions such as getting the contraceptive injection. She said: 'I’d had regular periods and I was still getting the contraceptive needle. 'I hadn’t put on any weight as such - I was still getting into my normal clothes. 'All I had was a slight bloating - there was no movement or any indication. 'Everything just seemed normal.' But, having given birth to three other children -- Callum, 12, Caitlin, seven, and John, 22 months - she quickly realised what was happening. Russell and son Callum rushed to the aid of Mhairi with towels and helped her through a difficult but speedy breech birth. Mhairi said: 'They did a cracking job - I’m very proud of both of them. It was very quick. 'A lot of people have said that’s the way to do it - but it’s nice to have the warning beforehand.' Partner Russell helped Mhairi through a difficult breech birth on their kitchen floor . After the unexpected arrival, which took place around 11.50pm, Mhairi was taken to hospital where she and Russell were given the good news that little Casey was fit and healthy. The doctors said that Mhairi had probably not felt any movement during the pregnancy due to the baby being in the breech position. The surprised mother and her new daughter were allowed home from Aberdeen Maternity Hospital on Sunday night. Their stunned family and friends grouped together to help out with catching up on the lost months of preparation. They rushed out in the Boxing Day sales to pick up essential items for the newborn. Mhairi said: 'All our family and friends have been rallying round and getting us everything. 'It’s been chaos for everyone but they managed to pull it off. 'Now that we are over the shock it’s great. 'We wouldn’t change it for the world but it’s definitely not an experience we would want to ever go through again.'","Mhairi had no idea she was pregnant when she gave birth on Boxing Day .

Michael Bloomberg spent more than $650million of his own fortune as mayor of New York, spending on everything from installing and cleaning tropical fish tanks for City Hall to funding a small theater in Queens and $268million for three election campaigns. The lavish spending by New York's second-richest man, worth an estimated $27billion, is unprecedented in city history. He used his incredible fortune to prop up city agencies, fund the arts, launch and maintain charitable initiatives and make political contributions to causes like gun control and immigration reform. Some spending was personal - paying for breakfast and lunch for his staffers and personally financing trips around the country and around the world in his private jet. Regular guy? Mayor Michael Bloomberg often rode the 6 train to work - but quietly spent $650million of his fortune as mayor . Of lesser means: Bill De Blasio, who takes over as mayor on Wednesday, lives in an un-renovated brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and is married to a poet . Critics, and even some of his own advisers, say the spending essentially bought him City Hall. He dramatically outspent rivals in each of his election campaigns and they argue his generous donations to key charities helped secure the support - or at least the silence - of key political groups. The New York Times analyzed city records, philanthropic databases and travel itineraries to estimate that Bloomberg spent at least $650million in his 12 years in City Hall. The newspaper says this tally is undoubtedly low and does not account for private dinners Bloomberg threw at his own home and a variety of other expenses. Bloomberg leaves office at 12.01am on Wednesday. A decidedly less wealthy successor will take his place. Bill De Blasio, a lifelong public servant who is married to a poet, lives in an un-renovated brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Bloomberg himself has publicly expressed his distaste for talking about his own wealth and refused to speak to the Times about the $650million figure. Bloomberg spent a reported $24million on his personal jet, a Dassault Falcon 900LX, and another $6million flying around the world on mayoral business . The New York Times account of Michael Bloomberg's spending while mayor offers insight into the Billionaire's priorities. Here are a few excerpts from the Times' account: . The 71-year-old Boston native made his extensive fortune by founding Bloomberg LP, which designs and sells advanced financial software. His company, which brought in $7.1billion in revenue last year alone, helped pioneer the use of computers on Wall Street and made Bloomberg an exceedingly wealthy man. He is the seventh richest man in the United States and the second richest in New York - behind only David H. Koch, co-founder of Koch Industries, according to Forbes. The politically-active Koch brother, who had grabbed headlines for his support for the Tea Party and other libertarian-leaning causes - is worth an estimated $34billion. Bloomberg's spending was diverse and touched nearly every corner of the nation's largest city. He spent $263million on New York city charities, including the arts and programs for the poor. He gave the Metropolitan Museum of Art $30million to pay for wifi and audio tours that reaches 'everyone who walks through the door' of the museum, officials said. He also spent $30million on a program to help poor black and Latino men. On a smaller scale, he gave $100,000 a year to Queens Theatre in the Park, a small outer-borough arts organization. Organizers describe the grants as 'manna from heaven.' He also committed heavily to politics. His three election campaigns - including for a highly controversial third term - cost him $268million. He also gave out $23million in campaign donations to allies and candidates he believed shared his ideology. He also paid $7million for his gun control campaign - including stirring post-Newtown school shooting TV spots. Pro-immigration reform causes got $5.7million and a campaign encouraging volunteerism cost the mayor $6.2million. Bloomberg also spent lavishly to make his life at City Hall easier. He turned down the $2.7million salary he would have earned in 12 years, taking just $1 a year instead. The mayor likes tropical fish, so he paid to install two giant aquariums in City Hall. Then paid $62,400 to have them cleaned every week for the last 12 years. He also spent $5million renovating Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the mayor, even though Bloomberg himself never lived there. De Blasio and his family are expect to move in after he takes office. He paid for breakfast and light lunch for his entire staff every day - a cost of about $890,000 over the course of his tenure. Then there's travel. The mayor doesn't fly anywhere if it's not on his private jet. Price tag: $28million. He's used the plane to ferry himself and a cadre of city aides and security guards around the world - including a $500,000 trip to China. The Times estimates he spent $6million on travel during his tenure.","Bloomberg is the city's second-richest man, worth an estimated $27billion .

Not so long ago the idea of tourist day trips to the edge of space and back was dismissed as hot air. But tickets have just gone on sale for the ultimate balloon flight to see the wonders of our planet from 19 miles up. An American firm yesterday announced plans to take eight passengers to within touching distance of space inside a gondola attached to a helium balloon in 2016. Views: Passengers will be able to see the curvature of the Earth . Even though the balloon’s space-age basket will be pressurised those on board might want to hold their breath when paying for their prized seat. The flight, lasting less than eight and a half hours, will cost £45,500. They will however be able to see Earth’s curvature and experience a few moments of weightlessness – as well as sup a cocktail at the bar and beam back ‘selfies’ with the stars to their envious social media friends thanks to the on-board wi-fi. ‘We want to give people the experience of seeing the Earth from space for hours and contemplating the curvature of the planet and all that comes with that,’ said Jane Poynter, chief executive of the Arizona-based company World View Enterprises. The 40 million cubic-foot (1.1 million cubic-meter) balloon will take off from Sir Richard Branson’s spaceport in the New Mexico desert. Ground control: The flights will launch from Sir Richard Branson's spaceport in the Mojave desert, which can be seen beneath the Virgin Galactic craft, pictured . The craft will take two hours to reach its maximum cruising height of about 100,000ft and where the sky turns dark. It will then cruise across the stratosphere to allow the starry-eyed passengers to gape in wonder at the blue planet below, our galaxy and the wider universe. The gondola will then disconnect from the balloon and return to earth under a para-wing. Space proper starts at 62 miles but the passengers will experience a few seconds of weightlessness during the rapid 20-minute controlled descent, said Poynter. The craft will stop a few miles short of the point reached last year by the Austrian Felix Baumgartner, 44, who set the world’s skydiving record by jumping from a helium balloon 24 miles above Earth. ‘Think of this as a super-first-class high-end luxury experience,’ said Poynter’s husband, Taber McCallum, the company’s chief technology officer, who used to design life support systems for Nasa. The couple spent two years as ‘bionauts’ sealed inside a simulated space station in the Arizona desert in the 1990s, an experiment that shaped scientific thinking about man living on Mars. There company is only one of several racing to offer regular tourist space trips, among them SpaceShipTwo, a suborbital six-passenger, two-pilot vehicle owned by Virgin Galactic, an offshoot of Richard Branson’s Virgin Group. ‘Ten years ago this was all science fiction,’ said  Burt Rutan, who designed SPACESHIPONE, the first private craft to fly into space in 2004 and the prototype for Branson’s new fleet currently under construction. ‘Now it’s an engineer’s everyday fact,’ he said.","American firm World View Experiences announced the trip yesterday .

The couple, who had five children, filed for divorce more than a decade ago but continued to live and run several profitable ventures together. The bodies of Bradford Sachs, 57, and Andra Sachs, 54, were found February 9 in the bedroom of their sprawling Pepperdine Bend home in Orange County home following the 2am shooting. Scroll down for video . Victims: Bradford Hans Sachs, 57, and Andra Resa Sachs , 54,were found shot dead in their bedroom in early hours of February 9 by their teenage daughters . Crime scene: The couple were killed, and their son seriously injured, in this San Juan Capistrano home . Following his arrest in San Diego Thursday, Ashton Sachs was described by police as a 'lone suspect' in the killings. Orange County Register reported the Ashton Sachs had no previous run-ins with the law. Ashton Sachs had been attending college in Washington state and lived in Seattle since 2013. His older brother, Myles, was away at school at the time of the murders, but their two teenage sisters and the eight-year-old brother were home. According to court records obtained by the paper, two weeks after the shootings, Myles and Ashton Sachs filed for guardianship of their three younger siblings. Although the Sachs couple continued cohabiting and working together nearly 15 years after their split, their separation was marked by restraining orders and hostility. The couple separated in 1999, but continued living and running several businesses together . Following their divorce, which had been characterized by Andra Sachs as a 'financial decision,' according to a friend, the couple adopted a boy and girl from Russia. Neighbors were shocked by the brutal killings of the seemingly pleasant couple, but their business associates and customers described the Saches as difficult to work with. Legal proceedings and several complaints had allegedly been made about the couple, who ran businesses under several names. In 2011, Ms Sachs appeared on a list of California's top tax evaders, allegedly owing $1.15million to the state. Investigation: Police found the couple's bodies in their bedroom at this California home . The following year, her name had been removed from the list, and she told Patch at the time: 'The amount due is highly in dispute and contested.' Consumer watchdog website Ripoff Report contained several allegations against the couple over disputed rental agreements and claims that they took advantage of Ms Sachs's dying mother. In a post from July last year, an alleged former tenant claimed they were still waiting for the couple to pay a court order of $8,000 over a deposit dispute.","Ashton Sachs, 19, arrested in San Diego Thursday in his parents' murders .

Eliot Spitzer's alleged madam has accepted a plea deal after being charged with dealing prescription drugs. Kristin Davis, the so-called 'Manhattan Madam', could potentially face five years behind bars as a result of the deal. The guilty plea comes after months of negotiations with state prosecutors after she was arrested in August and charged with four counts of drug distribution. Making a deal: Kristin Davis agreed to a deal where she will be charged with only one of the four counts of illegal drug sales that she faces (seen here outside of court in January) Avoiding prison: She has not yet had her sentence handed down but her lawyer hopes that she can stay out on probation rather than serve the maximum of five years . The New York Post reports that as part of the deal, she only plead guilty to one of the four counts. The count that she accepted was connected to the sale of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers as opposed to the other charges which involved oxycodone and amphetamines. She previously told Judge Edgardo Ramos that she had the prescription pills because there was a multi-year stretch when she was heavily medicated but now she only uses Ambien as a sleeping aid. Between January and April of last year, she was caught selling the pills to a dealer who she had previously bought drugs from. New lady: Davis was sentenced to jail for her work as a madam during the Spitzer prostitution scandal, and she has used her role as his alleged madam as part of her backstory in two political campaigns (Spitzer pictured last month with his new girlfriend) What Davis did not know at the time . was that the dealer had been arrested in 2012 and was working as an . informant for the state. 'Today Ms. Davis took responsibility for her actions,' her lawyer Dan Hochheiser said after the deal was announced Friday. Mr Hochheiser said that he hopes she will actually be able to avoid jail time all together but that will not be finalized until her sentencing hearing on July 25. He said that she hopes to 'get on with her life' and go back to school but he did not explain her plans any further. Failed campaign: Davis ran in the New York gubernatorial race in 2010 and lost to Andrew Cuomo (pictured that year) Davis, 38, previously served four months in jail in 2008 for promoting prostitution and was arrested amid then-New York Governor Spitzer's prostitution scandal. She went on to run for governor in 2010, and there was speculation that she had been given political support from Spitzer's political enemies. Throughout her campaign, she touted how she had paid her price for her role in the prostitution scandal and repeatedly criticized Spitzer for never having been found on criminal charges. She followed him back to the political arena last summer, and announced that she was running as a libertarian candidate when he made his bid to be New York City's next comptroller. Her campaign never materialized and Spitzer ended up losing to Scott Stringer.","Kristin Davis has accepted a plea deal for one of the four drug charges she faced after her August 2013 arrest .

A couple who were seriously injured in the Boston Marathon bombings this April have celebrated the birth of their first child together. Caroline Reinsch, 39, and Christian Williams, 42, first found out they were to become first-time parents when they were rushed to ER following the horrific terror attacks. They revealed to MailOnline that they welcomed a little girl called Marlowe to the world on December 18 - six days before her due date - weighing a healthy 6lbs 14oz. Hello baby Marlowe! Caroline Reinsch and Christian Williams, who were seriously injured in the Boston Marathon bombings this April have celebrated the birth of their first child together . Reflecting on the whirlwind chain of events, Mr Williams said: 'I don't think that Caroline or I view Marlowe's conception as a miracle. 'But, we do think that her timing was quite miraculous. 'When we could have been focusing on the hardships of recovery, we instead turned our attention on our future as a family. It was just what we needed.' Christmas baby: Marlowe was born on December 18 - six days before her due date - weighing 6lbs 14oz . Bright-eyed: The couple picked the girls' name Marlowe because of its 'uniqueness and beauty' and they liked the nickname, 'Marley' Mr Williams, who works as a filmmaker and photographer, originally met Ms Reinsch through his sister several years ago. They ran the Boston Marathon together in 2012, raising thousands of dollars for charity, but this year attended the race to cheer on a friend. They settled for a spot beneath the flags near to the finish line. As the terrifying blast went off on April 15, Mr Williams' legs and right hand were ripped open, and Ms Reinsch suffered a bloody hole in her thigh and a split quad muscle. Flashback: Mr Williams (circled) near the marathon finish line following the blast on April 15 . Safety: Ms Reinsch is pictured on the day of the bombings, unaware she was a couple of weeks pregnant . Images from the day show her being rushed away on a stretcher, while Mr Williams is seen on the ground; she went to Faulkner Hospital and he was taken to Beth Israel. 'Is there a possibility you are pregnant?' an X-ray technician asked her when she arrived at the hospital, and she answered that no, she didn't think she was. 'Discovering that I was going to be a father is how I'll always remember the Marathon' The couple had been trying to conceive since fall 2012 without any luck. When Ms Reinsch left the hospital after 11 days, her first stop was Beth Israel, where she had an emotional reunion with her boyfriend, who was coming out of his sixth surgery. Mr Williams had survived the blast but doctors were still trying to save his right leg. A . few days later, Ms Reinsch's doctor called to talk over her discharge . papers and asked if she had been given a pregnancy test. Moving on: The couple, pictured in Boston this June, both suffered leg wounds in the blast . Big surprise: Ms Reinsch's doctor told her to take a test after her discharge papers showed a 'slight positive' for pregnancy . Records showed a 'slight positive' but it was too early to tell for sure. Ms Reinsch was advised to take a home pregnancy test - which was positive - before taking another in a hospital restroom down the hall from Mr Williams' room. Again, it turned positive. Back in his room, she told him: 'I have something for you' - before handing over the little stick. She learned that she must have been just one or two weeks pregnant when the bomb went off. They decided to go public with their news on Father's Day. 'Discovering that I was going to be a father is how I'll always remember the Marathon,' Mr Williams said at the time. Content: The couple eat lunch in Copley Square by the bombing memorial site . Learning to move on: The couple say they will 'never quite return to 100per cent' of what they were before the Boston Marathon bombings . Following the birth of their baby, he and Ms Reinsch told MailOnline that they 'feel very much like all other first-time parents. We're excited, nervous, optimistic, and hopeful.' The couple picked the girls' name Marlowe because of its 'uniqueness and beauty' and they liked the nickname, 'Marley'. They spent Christmas introducing their newborn to friends and family. 'We feel very much like all other first time parents. We're excited, nervous, optimistic, and hopeful' Mr Williams says that he and Ms Reinsch will 'never quite return to 100per cent' of what they were before the Boston Marathon bombings. Although they no longer have to wear leg braces, their limbs remain scarred and the emotional turmoil lingers. Mr Williams is also set to go in for another surgery on his right hand in January. The blast partially 'degloved' his hand meaning he had no skin left on his last three fingers. To pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance a friend of Mr Williams and Ms Reinsch's set up a gofundme.com crowdfunding page. Currently it has raised $111,836. Summing up 2013 in three words, Mr Williams said: 'Fortunate and blessed.'","Caroline Reinsch, 39, and Christian Williams, 42, welcomed a baby girl called Marlowe on December 18 .

Couples who have been together for decades find it easier to pick out their partner’s voice in a crowded room, according to a new study. The quirk, which is evident in partners who have spent more than 18 years together, also lets those who have been together for a long time screen out their partner’s voice more easily if they are not interested. Researchers at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada found new evidence for the ‘cocktail party effect’ after testing 23 couples, aged 44 to 79, who had been married 18 years or longer. Long-distance hearing: The 'cocktail party effect' shows that, even above the hubbub of a crowded room, people who have been together long enough do not struggle to pick out their partner's voice . The subjects were asked to listen to three voices speaking at once. In some tests one of the voices was their partner’s and in some all were strangers. In each case the listener was asked to focus on a particular voice and remember specific pieces of information. The phenomenon is named after a cocktail party as it may explain how members of a couple can pick each other out in social situations when they choose to, but can also seem completely oblivious when their attention is elsewhere. The study found that whenever a partner’s voice featured, it was easier to retrieve the right information, according to NBC News. Participants were able to ignore the other voices and focus on their partner for a better success rate. Equally, when their partners were not speaking the key information, they found it easier to ignore them and focus on the strangers’ voices. Even older couples, whose hearing had declined naturally with age, remained very perceptive when it came to their husband or wife. Long service: The effect was pronounced in couples who have spent 18 years together. A fledgling study of couples of less than five years did not show the same results . The ability to screen out the voice of a spouse was strongest in under-60s, as older participants found it less easy to ignore their loved ones. Lead researcher Ingrid Johnsrude said that the effect may occur because long-term partners are so familiar with each other’s voices that they find them easier to separate from the noise around them. If the husband or wife thinks the sound is significant, this could enable them to pick up on it, and if not it allows them to more easily discard it in favour of whatever sounds are significant at that time. Dr Johnsrude said: ‘People were amazingly good at hearing their spouse when their spouse was the target voice, so when they choose to, people can target and report what their partner was saying.’ Giving an example, she added: ‘You’re at a party and you’re trying to listen to a stranger who’s talking to you, a very interesting stranger - and at the same time your partner is yammering away. 'This suggests you can ignore what your partner is saying so as to focus in on what that very interesting stranger is saying.’ However, it appears that for the effect to take place, the couples need to have spent a significant number of years together. Another study, which is still in progress, that features couples who have spent fewer than five years together, has shown that newer couples are far more likely to go wrong – and even mistake the voices of complete strangers for their partner.","Researchers from Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, studied the effect .
It is named after the apparent ability of partners to ignore or hone in on each other... depending on how interested they are .

Young people used to worry about getting friend requested by their parents on Facebook, but now they should be on the look out for grandpa and grandma. A whopping 71 per cent of all online adults are now members of the social network, and membership among senior citizens has grown a full 10 per cent in the last year - from 35 to 45 per cent of those ages 65 and older according to a new Pew Research study. Facebook has remained the dominant social networking site. Eighty-four per cent of people who reported using just one site say their membership is for Mark Zuckerberg's creation. Growing: Facebook is still the dominant social networking site. It grew to include 71 per cent of all online adults this year, compared to 67  per cent last year . But competing with Facebook isn't necessarily the game plan for other popular sites like Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, who have focused their branding on specific groups of people. For example, Pinterest, the online bookmarking site, is especially popular among women over men. Thirty-three percent of online women use Pinterest compared to just 8 per cent of men. And the branding seems to be working for the sites, since more and more online users are joining different social networking sites. This year 42 per cent of users had taken up using two platforms. Diversifying: Another trend in this year's report is how more social network users are branching out to more platforms . 'People are diversifying their portfolios when it comes to [social networks],' Pew Senior Researcher Aaron Smith told Mashable. 'The addition of a Pinterest user is not necessarily taking away a Twitter user of a LinkedIn user.' Click habit: The study also tracked how often social media users logged into their sites. Almost just as many Instagram users uploaded and checked that site as did users on Facebook . LinkedIn is another more specialized site that attracts a high amount of college-educated users since its purpose is job networking. It's also the only site to have a higher percentage of users 50-64 years old than the 18-29 age bracket. Twitter and Instagram on the other hand are significantly popular among young people and African-Americans. Twenty-nine per cent of blacks use Twitter and 34 per cent use Instagram. Both had a majority of users in the 18-29 age group, 31 per cent on Twitter and  37 per cent on Instagram. This similarity in user make-up is also probably why many Twitter users are also on Instagram, and vice versa. This was the first year that Pew released a social media matrix, and it showed a strong correlation between the two sites, with 53 per cent of users on one using the other as well - the highest rate of reciprocity for any two sites excluding Facebook.  The study also looked into how often users check their social networks every day. While its not surprise that 63 per cent of Facebook users check the site at least once a day, visiting rates were nearly just as high over on Instagram where 57 per cent of users uploaded or checked photos once a day. And that's good news for both platforms since Facebook bought the picture-sharing site earlier this year. It should also be noted that all of the companies in the study, except Pinterest, are publically traded. Pinterest is estimated to be worth $4billion and is expected to go public at some point. The study was conducted between August 7 and September 16, 2013. The interviews were conducted over the telephone by Princeton Survey Research Associations International of 1,801 adults across the country, 18 and older.","A new Pew Research study revealed that Facebook is still the predominantly used social networking site .

Hundreds of the most vulnerable victims of the civil war in Syria will be able to seek refuge in Britain, in a deal brokered last night. Precedence will be given to the most extreme cases such as women and children at risk of sexual violence, the elderly, survivors of torture and people with disabilities, Nick Clegg announced. The Deputy Prime Minister said Britain had a ‘moral responsibility’ to help alleviate the suffering in the region, where more than 100,000 people have died and many millions displaced from their homes. Poverty: A Syrian woman lies in an empty . building in the Kucukpazar district of Istanbul yesterday. Destitute . refugees are filling houses in the Turkish capital which have been . evacuated for urban development projects . Misery: A Syrian refugee carries his son along the market street at Zaatari refugee camp, near the Syrian . border in Mafraq, Jordan. Millions of Syrians have been displaced . by the three-year civil war in their country . The plan was agreed last night after . weeks of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats about how . to respond to the Syrian conflict, which has raged for almost three . years. David Cameron has . come under pressure from Mr Clegg, Labour’s Ed Miliband and Ukip leader . Nigel Farage to join the countries currently offering sanctuary to some . of the refugees. More than . 11.5million people inside Syria and those who have fled to neighbouring . countries are in need of food, shelter and medical treatment. Mr . Cameron appears to have overcome objections from the Home Office by . agreeing to let in ‘hundreds’ of vulnerable people, but without joining . the United Nations quota system. 'Moral responsibility': Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Britain had to act . The . UN High Commission for Refugees is calling for Western nations to admit . 30,000 Syrians between them. But last week immigration minister Mark . Harper said the quota system only provides ‘token relief’. A . government source said there were concerns that quotas would encourage a . ‘box ticking culture’ among other countries who have not matched . Britain’s record on aid to the region. The UK is the second largest bilateral donor having given £600million aid to help refugees in the region. Sources said the deal was supported by Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg and there had not been a ‘Whitehall battle’ over it. ‘We . will be looking case-by-case at the most vulnerable to see if we can . help them’, a source said. The number is expected to be ‘in the . hundreds’ to be brought here over the coming months and to start ‘very . quickly’. Home Secretary Theresa May will set out the new policy today in a parliamentary debate about the UK’s response to the crisis. At . least 1,500 people have already been able to settle in the UK through a . programme to help those with existing family ties. But in the Commons . last week, the Prime Minister warned that small quotas would have to be . considered carefully in a crisis involving millions of people. Mr . Clegg said last night that Britain had now agreed to provide refuge to . those ‘most traumatised’ by the crisis without setting specific targets. The UN, which backs the UK’s stance, will help identify these people. Mr Clegg said: ‘I am pleased to be . able to announce that the UK will be providing refuge to some of the . most vulnerable Syrian refugees. The Coalition Government wants to play . our part in helping to alleviate the immense suffering in Syria. ‘The . £600million we have provided makes us the second largest bilateral . donor of humanitarian aid in the world. But as the conflict continues to . force millions of Syrians from their homes, we need to make sure we are . doing everything we can.’ He said they intended to target those . ‘in greatest need’ and continue to support the peace talks underway in . Geneva between the Assad regime and opposition forces to find a . political solution. Mr Clegg . added: ‘We are one of the most open hearted countries in the world and I . believe we have a moral responsibility to help. 'Britain . has a long and proud tradition of providing refuge at times of crisis. This Coalition Government will ensure it lives on.’ More Syrians in Istanbul: It is estimated that . more than 11.5million people inside Syria and those who have fled to . neighbouring countries are in urgent need of food, shelter and medical . treatment . No target will be set for the numbers of . refugees to be admitted, with the UK instead working with the UNHCR on a . case-by-case basis to identify those most in need of assistance. Refuge . will be offered to some of those most traumatised by the crisis, . including vulnerable women and children, who are expected to arrive on a . gradual basis over the coming months. Shadow home secretary Yvette . Cooper said: ‘Vulnerable Syrian refugees, torture victims, abandoned . children and those struggling to cope or survive in the camps . desperately need sanctuary and Britain has a moral obligation to help. ‘I am very glad the Government has finally bowed to pressure before tomorrow's opposition vote. The . UK representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Roland . Schilling, said: ‘This decision will help to provide much needed . solutions for vulnerable Syrian refugees many of whom have been deeply . traumatised and face immense hardship. ‘It is also a concrete and . important gesture of solidarity and burden sharing with the countries . neighbouring Syria as they continue to bear the brunt of the refugee . crisis. ‘Today's decision is an encouraging and important step, . reaffirming the UK's commitment and contribution to international relief . efforts in support of more than 2.3 million Syrian refugees and the . countries hosting them.’ Human cost of war: A Syrian woman sits with her . children as she cooks a flat bread outside a tent at Quru Gusik refugee . camp on the outskirts of Arbil, in Iraq's Kurdistan region, in a picture . taken last week .

Britain has a proud tradition of protecting and welcoming refugees and . we will continue to lead the way in offering refuge to people in their . greatest hour of need. ‘We commend the Government for upholding this . reputation by going the extra mile and offering protection to some of . the most vulnerable refugees who will now have chance to rebuild their . lives in safety.’ Syrian refugee children play at Jordan's Al .

Even when he was the new boy on the block at Everton, it didn’t take much to wind Wayne Rooney up on the training ground. He played every game to win it. And the status and age of the player didn’t matter if he wasn’t happy with you. You’d know about it if you were on the receiving end of his tongue or one of his bad-tempered, x-rated challenges. Wayne was often reprimanded for flying in during training matches but it was always a pleasure to see him in full anger mode. There aren’t many like him so he was a breath of fresh air. Young star: Kilbane (left) was at Everton when Wayne Rooney (right) made the breakthrough to the first team . Love him or hate him, he is at his best when he shows that little bit of devilment and passion, although there are times when he oversteps the mark and he does have to calm down. He should have been sent off at Cardiff recently and he could have been sent off at Hull on Thursday if Michael Oliver had been stronger and more alert. There were times when he tried to bully the referee and, for such an influential and leading player, he has a responsibility to set a better example to young football fans. His manager also knows when he channels that anger into his football, no team can handle him and he wins matches for Manchester United. They are still in this title race and it’s mainly down to Wayne Rooney. Lucky escape: Rooney (right) was lucky to still be on the field when he kicked out at Cardiff's Jordan Mutch in November . Volley good show: Rooney leathers the ball into the net for his 150th Premier League goal for United . Chelsea obviously got a lot of positive signs in the summer that he was willing to leave Old Trafford and they were prepared to pay big money make the transfer happen. There may have been a bit of mischief from Jose Mourinho initially, but he knew what a difference Rooney would make to the squad he inherited. But David Moyes had different ideas. And it’s just as well. Imagine Wayne Rooney in the Chelsea team. They would be 10 points clear at the top of the table, title in the bag. David knew he had to do everything to keep one of his real stars out of the clutches of his main rivals. Back together again: David Moyes handed Rooney his Everton debut and convinced him to stay at United . We all saw the devastating impact Robin van Persie’s exit from Arsenal had on those two teams last season. And imagine Arsenal this season with a full fit van Persie now. No Chelsea striker has scored away from home for more than a year and Rooney has scored more goals than Torres, Ba and Eto’o combined. How he would have thrived from the service of Mata, Hazard, Willian, Lampard or Oscar. I am always reluctant to use the phrase `one man team’ and that would be unfair on other players in the Manchester United side this season who have performed, but Rooney’s performances remind me of Steven Gerrard in the season Liverpool won the Champions League. Hit and miss: Fernando Torres has failed to deliver the goals for Chelsea like he did at Liverpool . Misfiring: Rooney has scored more goals for United this season than Eto'o (left), Ba (right) and Torres combined . This season he has inspired his team-mates and have dragged them through matches. They have lost one in the last nine, and that just happened to be at home to Newcastle United, when Rooney was suspended for reaching five bookings. Rooney was not the same player last season. He was left out of key games, like the Champions League clash with Real Madrid, and his subsequent disagreement and unhappiness was with Alex Ferguson, not his successor. My understanding is that the pair were reconciled after Rooney left Everton for Old Trafford but of course they didn’t have the benefit of working together to show that to everyone else. David had to wait until he took over from Ferguson to get that one-to-one contact and clearly had numerous meetings to convince Rooney that he would be a key figure in his team. Players will be sacrificed as the club goes through a rebuilding process but he has recognised Wayne’s talents and I think he will have been looking forward to working with him again, and getting the best out of him, after giving him his debut at Everton and helping to nurture him in those early days. Issues: Last season, under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson, Rooney was left out of key games . Rooney has been playing in his favourite and most effective position, in the number 10 role, which also happens to be the number on his back. And with good reason. He is the perfect fit. He is one of those players who could genuinely play in every position, and he has an array of passes up there with the very best. But he has the most influence in that central area where he has the dynamic to use the freedom to create chances for others, and get behind the defence to score goals, or force defenders like James Chester to put in their own net. He also showed at Hull that he can score goals outside the box. Hull took full advantage of Manchester United’s poor start at the KC Stadium. The United bus was late, and the team looked like they were still sat in their seats for the first 10 minutes when they went two down. They conceded poor goals, and Rooney was one of the guilty parties for Chester’s opening goal. But when he has that devil working overtime, he has the ability to change matches. Hull found that to their cost, and plenty of others will in the title run-in. Change isn't always the answer, just ask Wolves . Malky Mackay inevitably became the latest manager to lose his job on Friday. Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan is gambling with his club’s Premier League status by appointing a new manager at this crucial point of the season. If, as seems likely, he turns to Ole Gunnar Solksjaer to keep the club up, he is employing a young coach with an excellent reputation, forged back in Norway, but with absolutely no experience of top flight management in English football. Centre of attention: Malky Mackay has been sacked by Cardiff after days of speculation . Controversial: Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has courted controversy for his attitude towards Malky Mackay . Since the start of the season, several clubs have pushed the panic button and, in fairness, they have seen a positive response. Tony Pulis, for all the criticism of his style of play at Stoke City, took Crystal Palace out of the bottom three this week and he has undoubtedly made a difference to a team which looked doomed two months ago. Pulis has never been relegated and gets results, even if it isn’t always pretty, by organising his team and playing to their strengths. The wins for Palace so far have been typical of the type he gained at Stoke. Impact: Crystal Palace have improved under Tony Pulis (left) and Dwight Gayle's goal was enough to beat Villa . Martin Jol was another manager who seemed to be harshly treated by Fulham. But Rene Meulensteen has found a way to get performances out of Taarabt, Kasami and Ruiz and even Berbatov, before he was injured. Improvement: Rene Meulensteen (right) has got the better performances out of Fulham than Martin Jol (left) did . And although they remain bottom, there are signs of improvement at Sunderland too under Gus Poyet. The win at Everton was arguably the best win in midweek. Sunderland looked solid and well organised at Goodison and restricted the home side to long range efforts. Massive goal: Ki Sung-Yueng of Sunderland scores the winning goal from the penalty spot against Everton at Goodison Park . While there are some positive signs at those clubs, sacking the manager and appointing a new man is not always guaranteed to bring success. Just ask Wolves. Would Wolves be in the division they are in now if they had shown some loyalty and faith in Mick McCarthy? I doubt it. Ipswich moved into seventh this week as Mick continues to work his magic in the Championship and prove once again he can get teams out of that division – at the right end. On the up: Wolves are now in League One but Mick McCarthy is doing a superb job at Ipswich Town in the Championship . West Brom have taken a similar path to their neighbours and are also on the brink of bringing in a foreign manager with no experience of the Premier League. Steve Clarke may have had a wretched record over the calendar year, but I suspect the West Brom players would be more comfortable with the man they know. The board at West Ham must be watching all this with great interest, particularly after slipping into the bottom three this week. And I just hope they are strong enough to stand by Sam Allardyce and show the loyalty he needs. There is clearly some discontent among the owners about the Andy Carroll transfer. They need goals and he’s not going to score them from the treatment room. Carroll came with poor injury record and spending £16million on him was always going to be a gamble because managers are judged on their signings, as much as results. Down the bottom: The absence of Andy Carroll (left) is increasing the pressure on Sam Allardyce (right) The sooner he is fit, the better because Carroll being unavailable is putting Sam under more pressure. But the funny thing is, if you were looking for a manager with experience and the know-how to keep a team up, you wouldn’t look much further than Sam Allardyce. I just hope West Ham realise they have the right man in the job. Thumbs-up . Gus Poyet . I made my Sunderland debut at Everton in 1999, three years after they last won there. We lost 5-1. To go to Everton and end their record of remaining unbeaten at Goodison Park in 2013 was a fantastic achievement by Sunderland. They just have to do it more consistently to have any chance of survival. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet shakes hands with a young Sunderland fan at Goodison Park where his side beat Everton 1-0 . Thumbs-down . Martin Skrtel . Since when did the Liverpool defender take up WWE? In the last two games, the Slovak has . been blatantly pulling opponents’ shirts at set pieces and wrestling . with them before the ball is anywhere near. It has been highlighted so much that he needs to cut it out or face the consequences of conceding penalties. Reputation: Skrtel needs to stop blatantly pulling opponents' shirts at set pieces .","Moyes deserves praise for making sure Rooney stayed at Old Trafford .

"Premier League has divide between top eight and bottom 11 . If you want to know why Mackay was sacked, look at the table . Will Orient and West Ham meet at Olympic Stadium as equals? By . Jeff Powell . PUBLISHED: . 12:26 EST, 27 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:56 EST, 27 December 2013 . A game of two halves? Now it’s a table of two halves. The Great Divide, in football, is not between north and south. It is the gap which separates those who might have been described by F Scott Fitzgerald as The Beautiful And The Damned. The Beautiful and The Damned: Arsenal's Theo Walcott (left) celebrates his second goal against West Ham on Boxing Day but the Hammers' George McCartney (right) despairs . Hull of a difference: Wayne Rooney (second right) celebrates but the Tigers players hold their heads . Plenty to celebrate: Manchester City, led by Vincent Kompany (centre) will challenge for the title . There are now two divisions within the Premier League: . 1)   A Super League comprised of the eight top clubs – the rich and the famous; . 2)   A Sub-Division made up of the 11 teams all anxiously hunched within five points of relegation. Marooned between them, in a no man’s land of neither great aspiration nor fearful desperation, are Southampton. Stoke are six points behind them but the real void is the 10 points which separate the Potters from the Spurs. Tottenham are bringing up the rear of the major clubs but are still in a different league from those toiling below them, a league predicated on money and influence within the game. As we approach this weekend, the exact half-way point of the season, we know already that the title and Champions League places will be shared among four from the top eight of Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Everton, Newcastle, Manchester United and Tottenham. This, of course, is exactly what the Premier League moguls had in mind – the executives as well as the bosses of the major clubs – when they broke away from the good old-fashioned Football League. Namely the power and the glory and the TV money to the big boys. Witness this half-term Super Sunday on Sky – Newcastle v Arsenal followed by Chelsea v Liverpool. Fill your boots. The irony – cleverly hidden behind all the glitzy hype and grasping propaganda about the self-proclaimed Greatest League In The World -  is that this has been achieved by a dumbing down of standards. Switch off the rah-rah-rah television . volume – either that or go to games which are more dead than live – and . watch some of the basement brigade try to play football against each . other. The great divide: There is a gap between the top eight (above) and the bottom 11 (below) Unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool supporter of one of the clubs, you can lose the will to live. Many of these matches are morasses of clumsy ball control, wayward passes, Neanderthal tackles, lumbering movement and missed chances. Empty seats at grounds around the country are reminders that you can’t fool all the people, all the time. And yet the Premier League takes delight in pointing out that, on a given day, these teams can give the giants a run for their vast amounts of money. What that really tells us is that the good are not as great as they would have us believe. Take the three dominant teams of recent seasons, none of whom are as impressive as they used to be. Heavyweight battle: Chelsea's Eden Hazard (left) faces a Liverpool side featuring Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho (right) on 'Super Sunday' Manchester United, by their own admission, are in a flux of transition following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Manchester City’s indifferent away form, by common consensus, does not reflect their vast expenditure in the transfer market. Chelsea, by Jose Mourinho’s admission, are not the force they used to be. Yet all are still up there. Only Arsenal have maintained their level. Consequently their flowing, if somewhat fragile, football has taken them to the top… and may keep them there. Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle are also beneficiaries of the slippage above them – as well as  the deficiencies below. This is not to say the second half of the season will be unexciting. Down but not out: It's tight at the bottom and both Gus Poyet's Sunderland and Crystal Palace, for who Dwight Gayle (right) scored the winner, secured victories on Boxing Day . Entertainment, more than quality, is the name of the Premier League game and this division of the haves from the have-nots serves their purpose. It will be fascinating finding out if Arsene can end the Arsenal trophy drought.  And whether Everton or Newcastle can dislodge one or two of the Even Bigger Four from Champions League qualification. Also, with so many teams hovering around the drop zone, the Sub-Division promises to be a cliff-hanger to the end. But as Fitzgerald wrote, The Beautiful were privileged but not so lovely as they were made to appear. And of The Damned 11, three are most certainly doomed. How the Premier League has concentrated power into the hands of the richest few: . This is how the table looked on Boxing Day night in the year of the Premier League’s inception, 1992, through key stages down the decades: . Shock leaders: Norwich were top after Boxing Day 1992 and finished the first Premier league season in third . Flying Canaries: Chris Sutton (left) and Ruel Fox (right) were key players in that Norwich side . Villans were heroes: Aston Villa topped the table after Boxing Day 1998 . Main man: Dion Dublin was the star for Villa that season, especially in scoring this hat-trick against Arsenal . United on top: Sir Alex Ferguson's men led after Boxing Day but Arsenal won the title . Invincible: Thierry Henry and Arsenal were second after Boxing Day but won the league and were unbeaten . Is it really such a surprise Malky Mackay has been sacked? Take a look at the table. Cardiff City are one point above the Premier League relegation places. Of the four teams below them, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Sunderland all changed managers - and all achieved improbable victories on Boxing Day. Only West Ham have stuck with their man. But although they lost on Boxing Day and fell into the drop zone, to be brutally honest they looked more convincing against leaders Arsenal than Cardiff did against a middling Southampton. Time's up: Malky Mackay has been sacked by Cardiff... but given their league position, is it such a surprise? Mackay did a near-miraculous job in bringing top-flight football back to South Wales. So while Cardiff’s slide is being blamed on their weird-seeming Tan Man owner, Malky can get out with his reputation intact, a hefty pay-off and high prospects of immediate re-employment. It is, as football managers are so prone to saying, a result. Can the day really be fast approaching when Leyton Orient, currently League One leaders, will have the ironic pleasure of going to the Olympic Stadium to play West Ham, now in the Premier League relegation places? We O’s fans are beginning to believe. Not that we wish misfortune upon our blood brothers at Upton Park. Even better if we end up doing it in the Premier League.","Premier League has divide between top eight and bottom 11 .

Some people claim they’re born to sing, while others openly admit they’re tone deaf, but what if you could take a pill and become pitch perfect? That was the basis for a recent study that wanted to test the effect mood-stabilising drugs had on a person’s ability to learn new skills. Researchers from France, Canada and the UK gave valproic acid (VPA) - a known mood-stabliser - to participants before training them to identify musical pitches. In tests, those who took VPA scored higher, and correctly identified more pitches, than those who were given a placebo drug. Researchers gave participants a mood-stabilising drug before testing their ability to them to determine perfect, or absolute, musical pitch. Those who took the drug were able to accurately identify the correct pitch more often than those who took a placebo. Mozart, left, and Stevie Wonder, right, are said to posses absolute pitch . VPA is what’s called a . histone-deacetylase or HDAC inhibitor. It is used to treat depression, . epilepsy and bipolar disorder by altering how the brain reacts to . certain stimulants. According to the study, the optimum age to develop absolute pitch (AP) is between the ages of four and six. This age range is known as the ‘critical period’ and is when the brain has what’s called ‘neural plasticity.’ By proving VPA can restore this plasticity could help doctors develop new neurological drugs. VPA contains histone-deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor. It is used to treat depression, epilepsy and bipolar disorder by altering how the brain reacts to certain stimulants. According to the study, the optimum age to develop absolute pitch (AP) is between the ages of four and six. This is known as the 'critical period' and is when the brain still has 'neural plasticity', and can absorb, process and develop certain complex skills. This includes the ability to learn how to recognise and identify different musical pitches accurately. Famous musicians with absolute pitch include Mozart and Stevie Wonder. The 24 participants who took part in the study were ‘healthy, right-handed, monolingual, English-speaking adult males.’ According to the research, only males were included due to the health risks VPA might have on pregnant women. Each participant was shown a video designed to teach them to associate pitch classes from the 12-tone musical system. Each of the notes C, D, E, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, A#/Bb were assigned a proper name including Sarah, David, Francine, Jimmy, Karen, and Leo, Eric, Rachel, Tyler, Irene, Owen, and Peggy, pictured . Of these 24 subjects, 11 took valproic acid (VPA) and 12 took a placebo drug during training and testing. None of the participants had received any complete musical training, and those who reported having partial training did not have any training during the critical period. Participants were then tested on what they had learnt. During the first test, participants who took valproate scored five out of seven, on average, compared to the placebo's score of 3.5, pictured . Each participant was shown a training video designed to teach participants to associate six pitch classes from the 12-tone Western musical system. For example, each of the notes C, D, E, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, A#/Bb were assigned a proper name over different octaves. These names included Sarah, David, Francine, Jimmy, Karen, and Leo and for the second they were Eric, Rachel, Tyler, Irene, Owen, and Peggy. They were chosen because they were common first names and the first letters of each appears on the same row of a keyboard. Half of the names were female, and the other half male. Training videos taught the participants which name corresponded with which pitch class. Participants were then tested on what they had learnt. During the first test, the six proper names appeared in a horizontal row on the screen in the same order for every subject. Participants heard one synthesised piano tone per trial, for a total of 18 trials, in a semi-randomized order. Following each tone, participants had to identify the proper name associated with the pitch class of the tone by pressing the keyboard key corresponding to the first letter of the associated name. More than half of the responses correctly identified the exact pitch in the valproate group, left, while in the placebo group, right, the results were more evenly spread across a -3 and +3 range . During tests, participants who took valproate scored five out of seven, on average, compared to the placebo’s score of 3.5. More than half of the responses correctly identified the exact pitch in the valproate group, while in the placebo group, the results were more evenly spread across a -3 and +3 range. In conclusion, the researchers said: ‘Our study is the first to show a change in absolute pitch with any kind of drug treatment. ‘The finding that VPA can restore plasticity in a fundamental perceptual system in adulthood provides compelling evidence that one of the modes of action for VPA in psychiatric treatment may be to facilitate reorganization and rewiring of otherwise firmly established pathways in the brain.’","Researchers wanted to test the effect mood-stabilising drugs had on the brain’s ability to learn .

He is currently the Robert Walmsley University Professor and Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the age difference between the two is 16 years.

An app that lets you save and re-open Snapchat messages, without the sender ever knowing, has now been launched. Snapchat is a picture-sharing app that lets you send photos, text, messages and drawings to your friends. SnapHack, a $0.99 (62p) app, lets you look at old images sent through the Snapchat app at anytime . Snapchat is a picture-sharing app that lets you send photos, text, messages and drawings to your friends. You can choose how long you want the picture to be viewable, up to ten seconds, before the app 'deletes' it. To use it, open the app and create your message. Special effects and even text can also be added. Choose a recipient from a list of friends. Specify how long you want the picture or video to last, up to 10 seconds, then send. In theory a user can choose how long they want the picture to be viewable - up to ten seconds - before the app deletes it. But now SnapHack, a $0.99 (62p) app, lets you look at old images sent through the Snapchat app at anytime. The creator, Darren Jones, has developed a number of other apps under DAP Logic. According to Business Insider, Jones is now working on an improved version of SnapHack which will allow Snapchat users to forward saved messages to other friends. Snapchat photos are only meant to last up to 10 seconds before they are erased from a recipient's phone . An improved version of SnapHack will allow users to forward saved messages . The app follows an announcement by a forensics firm in Utah that discovered a way to find the so-called deleted pics, and created a way to download them from the 'hidden' location. In May, Orem-based firm Decipher Forensics discovered that Snapchat was saving the images. And the group said the app's code suggests that it isn't a bug; the developers appeared to have coded the app to do this, despite claiming that all images are automatically destroyed. Richard Hickman, a digital forensics examiner from Decipher Forensics said: 'The actual app is saving the picture.' '[Snapchat] claim that it's deleted, and it's not even deleted.

President Barack Obama has canceled a long-planned trip to Asia next week because of the government shutdown. The President had already shortened the trip from four countries to two but then on Thursday the called the trip off all together. The White House announced earlier in the week that Obama would be unable to visit Malaysia and the Philippines because the partial shutdown of the federal government was impacting personnel needed to set up the stops. Calling it off: President Obama and his advisers decided that they had to cancel his planned trip to Asia due to the ongoing government shutdown . The White House had held out hope that the president could attend to economic summits in Indonesia and Brunei. But he decided to skip the entire trip to stay in Washington to continue pressing for a budget bill that would reopen the government. He reportedly told the leaders of Malaysia and the Philippines that he will be making visits to their countries later in his term but there has been no such public declaration for Indonesia- where he lived as a young boy- or Brunei. 'The cancellation of this trip is another consequence of the House Republicans forcing a shutdown of the government,' White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. Disappointment: Dancers in Bali, Indonesia were performing at the welcome reception for the APEC conference on Friday when it became clear that President Obama would not be attending. He was due to arrive Sunday . Celebrating far away: Secretary of State John Kerry will visit the four countries in the place of the President. He was already in Asia, seen here on Thursday with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in Japan (it was Hagel's birthday) 'This completely avoidable shutdown is setting back our ability to create jobs through promotion of U.S. exports and advance U.S. leadership and interests in the largest emerging region in the world.' Obama had been due to depart Washington late Saturday night, and it is still unclear whether or not the shutdown will carry on until that point. Even if Congress and the Senate are able to agree on a budget by that point, the President's advance teams will not have enough time to prepare. A New York Times article about the effects of the shutdown on the White House revealed that all but one of the members of the Presidentâ€™s advance team have been furloughed. After the first stops on the trip were canceled, deputy press secretary Josh Earnest was tasked with cancelling the private planes that had been booked for the flight, and now he will surely be making some more calls. Continued confusion: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defended the Democrats stance against Republican attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act as part of the budget approval process . Secretary of State John Kerry, already on a trip to Asia, is visiting all four countries in place of the president. The White House said Obama called the Sultan of Brunei and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Thursday night to express his regret. Prior to their announcement, some thought that there would be some benefits for the President to be seen as global leader. 'Timing is everything, and if the moment is right to contrast leading on the world scene to being stuck in Washington gridlock, going on the road makes some sense,' said Mike McCurry, who served as former President Clinton's press secretary during the last federal shutdown.","President was originally scheduled to visit Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Brunei .

An online petition calling on Vladimir Putin to invade eastern Ukraine was dramatically deleted today after it went viral on the Russian-language web. A map linked to the petition showed how Ukraine would look if Moscow annexed its eastern regions, creating a separate country or super-region called 'New Russia'. In less than 24 hours, almost 100,000 had expressed support for dividing the country. A map linked to a petition calling on Vladimir Putin to invade eastern Ukraine, showed how Ukraine would look if Moscow annexed its eastern regions, creating a separate country or super-region called 'New Russia' (in red) from Ukraine (in green) A similar map shows the political divide that has developed since the country gained independence in 1991. Marked is the Black Sea city of Sevastopol, where the country's fugitive president is believed to have fled . Politicians who have taken power in the new Ukraine clearly see a threat in such a scenario and yesterday issued strong warnings over the risk of separatism in Russian-speaking areas. Ukraine's interim president Oleksandr Turchynov warned of 'very dangerous signs of separatism' in several regions and was yesterday locked in meetings with his security services on how to prevent the country fracturing. Retired heavyweight boxing champion  Vitali Klitschko launched his bid to become president hoping his fame could reach across the divisions now splitting the ex-Soviet state and unify Ukraine. Another politician who led opposition to toppled leader Viktor Yanukovych warned of a risk of Putin grabbing control of the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol - which is also the HQ of the Kremlin's Black Sea fleet. 'The situation in Sevastopol has always been complex, and is even more so now. We are calling on our Russian partners not to abuse it,' said Arseniy Yatsenyuk, leader of the Fatherland faction. 'Russia has military presence in Ukraine,' he said. 'We will not tolerate any separatist attempts.' Yesterday it was confirmed that Russian military units in Crimea had increased their state of readiness but denied reports they were involved in an operation to smuggle ex-president Viktor Yanukovych to Moscow.

Photos of those killed in recent violence are seen at a make-shift memorial. Ukraine's parliament voted on Tuesday to send fugitive President Viktor Yanukovich to be tried by the International Criminal Court for 'serious crimes' committed during violent anti-government protests in which scores were killed . While Putin has so far remained silent on his intentions, he met with his top security aides yesterday to discuss Ukraine. Moscow MPs, meanwhile, demanded passports for ethnic Russians in Ukraine, with new legislation this week introduced into parliament. MP Leonid Slutsky - in charge of parliamentary links with ethnic Russian abroad - warned: ""Ukraine is a gunpowder keg and any provocations could result in bloodshed."" In Crimea last night, he claimed: 'We think that Yanukovych is still the legitimate president.' It was too early to discuss potential help for mainly Russian areas of  Ukraine, such as Crimea, he said. But a raft of measures would be drawn up in the near future. 'We will not abandon our brothers in Ukraine and more than a million of our compatriots in the current clashes. They have found themselves in a difficult position with the sudden impending collapse of the Russian-speaking sphere.' The opposition Communist Party in Russian appealed to Putin not to recognise the new authorities in Kiev, while senior senator  Mikhail Margelov claimed there was 'a lack of order' at Ukraine's nuclear power stations.

'This cannot but worry Ukraine and its neighbours.' The  Russian-language petition website had envisaged these regions being swallowed up by Russia: Odessa, Nikolaev, Kherson, Crimea, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhie, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Lugansk. The petition was styled: 'To the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin - to annex the South-East of Ukraine to Russia.' It was backed by at least 93,436 people before being abruptly deleted. It is unclear who organised it. Nor is it known if it had any official sanction. There were signs last night the Kremlin was seeking to calm a political and media frenzy over Ukraine, with foreign minister Sergei Lavrov toning down the rhetoric. Russia had a 'position of non-intervention in Ukraine's internal affairs,' he said.","In under 24 hours, almost 100,000 had signed support for dividing country .

It may be 47 days away, but online shopping giants Amazon are already getting ready for Christmas by employing thousands of seasonal workers in their enormous warehouses. The temporary recruits have been brought in to prepare for Cyber Monday, the day where millions of British shoppers are expected to flock online and purchase hundreds of products every minute in time for the festive season. One enormous storage facility in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, will process a huge number of yuletide gifts in the next month while another in Swansea, South Wales, will package and ship hundreds of presents ranging from dog biscuits to the new PlayStation 4 every second. Gearing up for Christmas: The enormous Amazon warehouse in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, is already starting to fill up with thousands of boxes in preparation for the festive season . Organised: Toys and gadgets are placed in the 'sortable' areas which are divided up by cardboard screens scattered across the floor . The hub: Employees frantically type away at their computers as trollies of gifts are dragged around by employees . Items are placed on a conveyor belt around the clock and sent down the enormous warehouses to waiting delivery trucks which leave every 130 seconds. Last year on Cyber Monday, Amazon received orders for more than 3.5 million items - a rate of around 44 items per second. At the online shopping giant's Swansea Fulfilment Centre, where 1,500 extra employees are being taken on over the festive season, the 35-year-old general manager announced: 'We're ready for Cyber Monday...bring it on!' As toys and other gifts whizzed overhead in the centre's cavernous 'sortables' area, she added that the number of part-time associates taken on this Christmas was the biggest ever. She said: 'We'll wait to see if Cyber Monday - always the first Monday in December - proves to be the busiest yet, but here in Swansea we are definitely prepared if it turns out that way.' Time consuming: Staff have to scan every individual item which goes through the massive storage area so their progress through the delivery process can be monitored . System: An letter and number code is used to distinguish the thousands of rows of gifts which employees have to sort through . Prepared: Hundreds of yellow containers are stacked up in front of the seemingly endless collection of goods, ready to move the items so they can be shipped to thousands of addresses across the UK . The 700,000 sq ft centre in South Wales was opened in 2008 and employee numbers have been growing ever since with, 2,000-plus staff now working on the site. In the UK Amazon fulfilment centres, staff including 'pickers' and 'sorters' work four 10-hour shifts a week which means employees now benefit from three days off. Company spokesman Fran Waite added: . 'Fewer visits to work are also likely to save associates both time and . money on a weekly basis and could reduce the impact on the environment . due to less commuting.' At . the Jersey Marine Amazon warehouse yesterday - the size of 10 football . pitches - a team of workers in an area known as 'wrapland' were . attaching shiny gold and red paper to items which customers asked . to be gift wrapped. Packaging: The loading area in the centre of the warehouse sees employees sorting the purchased items. Around 50 per cent more staff have been hired to cover the busy Christmas period . Storage: Stacks of nappies are separated by cardboard dividers which are set to make the routine more efficient . Busy: Some of the thousands of seasonal workers taken on by the online shopping giants this year navigate their trollies around the warehouse while a woman folds up cardboard boxes ready for presents to be packaged and posted . Clockwork: The computer 'brain' tracks every item as it makes it way from the lorry to the shelves before it is put into the boxes . Ready: A worker packs up a Nintendo Wii console next to a stack of flyers . Keeping track: A woman scans a DVD while nestled in between a set of shelves which are organised by an extensive system of yellow dividers . Miss Waite said: 'A lot is done by computer but some things are done better by hand.' The Amazon fulfilment centre workers have a non-stop regime which involves receiving items from suppliers at its lorry dock. These are then scanned so the building's computer 'brain' knows the stock before they are placed on conveyor belts and taken to a storage house where millions of items from surfboards to toys and kettles to motorcycle parts are kept. When an item is ordered staff are guided to it by the shortest route using a satnav and after wrapping it is sent by lorry to its new owner. Searching: An employee looks for an item in the shelves during his hectic daily routine which starts with workers receiving items from suppliers at its lorry dock . Process: A male employee scans a copy of Delia Smith's Christmas. It is then transferred to a conveyor belt which moves the item down the warehouse so it can be prepared for delivery . Ready: Another worker moves yellow boxes in preparation for December 2nd, which Amazon says will be the busiest shopping day of the year .","The giant storage facility in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, will process millions of items over the festive season .

Fears have been raised that the Houses of Parliament have been infested with a breed 'mutant' rats which are becoming immune to traditional poisons. Up to £6,000 a month is being spent on pest control at Westminster, according to figures released in response to a Freedom of Information request. The amount being spent on tackling pests at the Commons has risen 15 per cent in the last two years. Concerns have been raised that the number of rats resistant to poison is on the rise at the Houses of Parliament . According to the Daily Star, while officials have attempted to play down any concern of an increase in the recently publicised 'mutant rats', one source told the paper: 'You can see from the pest control figures that this is a mounting problem.' Experts have warned the rats are on the . increase across parts of the country after building up a resistance to . normal toxic pellets and powders. Conservative MP Sir Paul Beresford, a member of the Commons Commission, told MailOnline he was not aware of mutant rats at the Houses of Parliament but said there was a 'constant battle' against rodents. He said: 'It is an old building and it is on the river and like all buildings on the river and old buildings we have a constant battle. 'All sorts of techniques are used to deal with this, right through to using a kestrel, but I don't know about the so-called mutant rats.' According to The Mirror, scientists at the University of Huddersfield found three in four of a group of rats they tested were resistant to the poisons. Up to £6,000 a month is being spent at Westminster on pest control, a rise of 15 per cent in two years, according to reports . Scientists have warned that in parts of southern England, up to 70 per cent of rats could be resistant to poisons. Richard . Moseley, the British Pest Control Association's technical manager, told . MailOnline that 'cases of resistance in rats have been known for . decades'. He said: . 'While the studies show that the resistant rat population is spreading, . you can be assured our members have the skills and products to solve . this problem.' The . resistant rats have the ability to multiply rapidly as the gestation . period of rats is around 22 days and they reach sexual maturity by eight to . 12 weeks. Experts have warned the 'mutant' rats are on the increase across parts of the country after building up a resistance to normal toxic pellets and powders . Mr Moseley . said: 'Normal rats are being killed off by poison, so these resistant . species are taking their place - it’s only natural that their numbers . are expanding.' In December last year MailOnline reported how West Berkshire Council was asking the Health and Safety Executive to change rules on how poison is used in a bid to tackle a plage of 'super rats' that were resistant to conventional poisons. Homes in Berkshire, Oxford and Hampshire had reported increased numbers of the ‘super-rodent’ which is resistant to normal poisons and can transmit life-threatening diseases to humans and farm animals. But wildlife experts feared that if stronger poisons were allowed to be used against the rat-threat it may harm innocent local wildlife. Graham Chappell, from Rapid Pest Control in Newbury, who is contracted by West Berkshire Council, said: ‘It’s becoming more of an issue now simply because of the number of rats that are being seen. ‘They’ve also mutated genetically and are bred to be immune to standard poisons. ‘We have to start using different methods such as trapping and gassing, which can be less effective and more costly.’","Up to £6,000 a month being spent to combat pests at Westminster .

Growing: A sinkhole in Louisiana that is already the size of 20 football fields has gotten even bigger after the level surrounding it cracked for the second time in less than two months . Muck: The water expanse is full of oil . In late October, the earth-and-limestone levee sank some and cracks developed. The Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness director John Boudreaux said Monday that a new hairline crack was discovered Sunday in exactly the same spot as the largest crack, that stretched about a foot wide, from October. The new crack had spread from a few feet on the levee top on Sunday to all the way across it by Monday, he said, adding that a second crack had formed along the inner side of the southern levee where the previous round of tremors had caused the levee to sink. Boudreaux said its shape suggests a small section of levee top may slide into the sinkhole. Huge: Boudreaux said its shape suggests a small section of levee top may slide into the sinkhole . Enormous: The 26 acre Bayou Corne sinkhole developed in August 2012, when a salt dome operated by Texas Brine Co. collapsed deep underground . Since last week, micro-earthquakes have been increasing until around 180 per day were recorded near the sinkhole by Sunday. This has halted work to fight the growing water mass. Louisiana state is suing Texas Brine as it tries to recoup $12 million spent in an attempt to deal with the sinkhole, including bringing in a team of scientists. While no homes have yet been sucked in, officials warn that the gases being emitted could ignite, which would leave the Louisiana swamp looking like 'the gates of Hell'. Boudreaux filmed the sinkhole in August, uploading the iPhone video to YouTube showing it burping and sucking in trees in the throes of a violent growth spurt.

'They're going down,' Boudreaux says on the viral video of a grove of cypress trees. This week he spoke to Newsweek about the frightening expanse, which has largely emptied the town of Bayou Corne. 'How often do you see a tree go straight down?' he asked. State officials guess the sinkhole will expand from its current size to at least 40 acres over the next several years. It's currently 750 feet deep in some points and has methane bubbling up from it. The sinkhole is located in a stretch of about 100 miles between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that is not-so-affectionately known as Cancer Alley for its 150 or so petrochemical plants and high incidences of cancer among residents.

The two officers standing in Giardina’s doorway were content to write him a summons for the pipe, but the dope invited them inside while searching for identification, said police. The heroin was found almost immediately. Police arrested Giardina and were able to seize the drugs after obtaining a search warrant. A department spokesperson said it was too early to tell if the stash house was linked to the recent spate of heroin deaths from drugs labelled ‘bud ice,’ ‘income tax’ and ‘theraflu.’ Giardina was hit with three counts including possession greater than eight ounces and intent to sell.","Frank Giardina, 49, answered the front door to his apartment while holding a marijuana pipe .

Michael Handley, 20, suffered a severe head injury after becoming airborne part way through a run before tumbling 200 metres downhill. He was treated for his injuries in the nearby Grenoble University Hospital on the same ward as Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher, who was injured in a skiing accident last year. Tragedy: Michael Handley, 20, died in a snowboarding accident after being taken to the same hospital as Michael Schumacher in Grenoble . After two days of intensive care, he passed away with his family by his side. Devastated parents Tony and Tracey said their son was popular, lively and 'the life and soul of the party'. Tony added: 'He was an inspiration to me. He was my son and he made me want to do more with my life.He was so young but he'd achieved so much. He'd travelled all over and made friends all around the world. He really lived life to the full.'

Investigators believe they have finally solved the mysterious murder of a California woman almost 25 years to the day her body was found wrapped in a quilt at San Jose International Airport. Cathy Zimmer’s remains were found March 10, 1989, and it took until this week for husband David Zimmer, 66, and his brother Robert Zimmer, 69, to be charged with murder. The slain woman's husband had made about $400,000 off life insurance and a home sale shortly after her death, but investigators were unable to implicate him until now. The arrests came only weeks after authorities released pictures of Cathy Zimmer and the colourful patchwork quilt she was covered in after being strangled to death, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Horrible: Mother of three Cathy Zimmer was found 25-years-ago wrapped in a quilt after being strangled to death . ‘Cathy Zimmer was slain two and a half decades ago, but her family has never forgotten her,’ prosecutor Ted Kajani said last month in a prepared statement, according to KTVU. ‘We, too, have never forgotten her.’ The two men were both arrested within the last week and charged with first-degree-murder, officials said. Initial evidence pointed to at least Robert Zimmer being involved, his DNA was found on an ‘intimate’ area of the murdered woman’s clothes, investigators said. The brother-in-law insisted all along he did not have a physical relationship with the 38-year-old, but investigators kept pursuing his guilt. The couple was in the middle of a divorce and her soon-to-be ex-husband mysteriously cashed two life insurance policies worth $183,000 before selling their home for $225,000 shortly after her death at only 38-years-old, according to KTVU. Undignified: Cathy Zimmer's was found stashed in the backseat of her car and wrapped in this blanket . A quarter century later: Cathy Zimmer's car was parked at San Jose International Airport's short-term lot, her accused killers were finally arrested this week . They had two teenaged children when she disappeared after driving her children to school and failing to show for an eye appointment later that afternoon, KTVU reported. Police found her car parked in the airport’s short-term lot two days later, her body was wrapped in the blanket and stashed in the backseat. Robert Zimmer’s daughter Paula recalled in 2010 to investigators that his father obsessed over his fingerprints being found in her car as police combed it for evidence in the days after the discovery. He insisted he never had any type of personal or sexual relationship with Cindy Zimmer, but could not recall if he was ever alone in a car with her, authorities said. It now appears he was much more involved with the slain woman than he was willing to admit, and officials think they have found her killers. ‘When I reinstated the cold case unit to assist county law enforcement with the investigation of unsolved homicides and sexual assaults, it was these kinds of arrests that I had in mind,’ district attorney Jeff Rosen told the Mercury News. ‘We do not forget victims, nor do we ever give up on justice.’","Cathy Zimmer's body was found March 10, 1989 wrapped in a quilt at the San Jose International Airport .

The unidentified man told police he quickly got lost in the labyrinthine drainage system after jumping into a sewer in Lawton, Oklahoma. He said he had no choice but to chase the cash. Unable to find an exit, the man yelled for help for two days before a group of high school students heard his cries and called police. Responding officers Sergeant John Chelenza and officer-in-training Alicia Redding said they couldn't believe what they saw.

Rescue: Police said the man could have been wandering underground indefinitely if students hadn't heard his cries for help coming from the manhole in the middle of this street . Lost: The man said he dropped his $20 bill down a drain pipe that looked like this . The pair removed the manhole cover in the middle of a suburban intersection, and found the injured man cowering in a pipe about 15-feet underground. The 42-inch pipe was so narrow, the parched man was forced to get around on his hands and knees. 'I was amazed,' Redding told KSWO. 'I was confused how he had gotten down there and amazed that he was still okay.' Sgt. Chelenza said the man would have needed a ladder to get out of the cold, dark pipe. 'That's the first time in going on 28 years that we have found somebody down in a storm drain,' he said. First responders: Police officer-in-training Alicia Redding (left) and Sergeant John Chelenza (right) were shocked to find the man cowering in the drain pipe when they removed the manhole cover . Police said the dehydrated man, from Lawton, was completely disoriented and couldn't remember the date, how long he'd been underground or the location of the drain pipe he initially entered. 'He had a bump on his head, he may have hit his head against a wall down there because it obviously pretty dark unless he is next to a storm drain where light could get into,' Sgt. Chelenza said. He said the man is lucky students responded to his cries for help because a map is necessary to navigate the pipes and anyone could go blocks without ever finding an exit. 'The kids were observant and astute. They did right by calling 911, and who knows they may have saved a man's life,' Sgt. Chelenza said.","An unidentified man chased after $20 he dropped down a storm drain in Lawton, Oklahoma .

Serial felon: Peter Jones, 46, whose father is a retired university professor, is charged with strangling and stabbing pensioner Bernice Schaufele in the neck in her condominium in Novi, Michigan, on January 13 . An ex-convict accused of murdering his 84-year-old neighbour should have been behind bars at the time of her killing ... but was walking free on jail credit that he was not entitled to, it has been reported. Peter Jones, 46, whose father is a retired university professor, is charged with strangling and stabbing pensioner Bernice Schaufele in the neck in her condominium in Novi, Michigan, on January 13. But an investigation by the Detroit Free Press has revealed that the former engineering student turned crack addict was given 1,825 days of jail credit that he wasn’t allowed under Michigan law while serving time for a fatal stabbing in Detroit in 1998. He had been in and out of prison for robbery and burglary and had been convicted of a brutal attack on a Florida cab driver in 1997 and a fatal stabbing in Detroit a year later. It was for those two crimes that he received the credit, but nobody in either state corrections office could say why. 'There is nothing that allows him to have credit under the case law of the State of Michigan (for the time he served in Florida),' said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office. 'There may have been a factual reason to allow him to have the credit, but we don’t know because the people handling the case don’t have a memory of it because it’s so old.' Had he not been given those 1,825 days of jail credit, his earliest possible release date from prison — based on a formula — would have been February 6, Michigan Department of Corrections told the Free Press. Kim Lukacs, Schaufele’s daughter, said: 'All the things that he has done and the severity of his crimes ... it doesn’t make sense. Why was he out? I just don’t understand it.' Jones, whose father is a retired professor  emeritus of education at Florida A&M University, comes from a high-flying family including a brother who is an orthopedic-surgeon, sister who is a physician and another sister who is a high-ranking member of the U.S. Airforce. But while studying for his own degree in engineering at Florida A&M, Jones began dabbling in crack and soon slid into a life of petty crime to fund his habit, snatching purses and mugging ATM users. That, however, soon turned to assault and then murder. Quiet street: Mrs Schaufele's body was found around 2:45 p.m. on January 13 inside her condominium on West Glen Haven Circle in Novi, Michigan . In 1997 he attacked Anthony Davis, a Yellow Cab driver, after he picked him up in Leon County, Florida, stabbing him in the arm before trying to strangle him with his radio-mic cord. The fight spilled out of the cab and Jones fled when another motorist approached, leaving Davis injured but alive. A warrant was put out for his arrest. A year later the Florida fugitive murdered Cory Hardy, a small-time drug runner, stabbing him 32 times as he baby-sat a drug house in Detroit, Michigan. He was finally picked up in 1999 in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana for robbery and possession of eight rocks of crack cocaine. With warrants in both Florida and Michigan for his arrest, it became a race between authorities in both states to get to get there first and bring him to justice. Florida won. 'He should have been located after the warrant was issued — he wasn’t,' Michigan prosecutor Kim Worthy said in a statement last week. 'Years later, we should have been . able to trump Florida in getting him first — we couldn’t match their . resources.' He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2002 to five years in prison and given 883 days of jail credit for time served while waiting for sentencing. His Florida prison sentence ended in 2005 and he was returned to Michigan to face charges for Cory Hardy’s killing. In 2006, he was sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison, receiving credit for 278 days for the time he had spent behind bars waiting to be prosecuted for that killing. Then, in January 2007, the Florida Department of Corrections told Jones he had served 942 days in prison there, and had 883 days of credit while he awaited sentencing, for a total of 1,825. The next month, Jones was allowed to carry over his credit for the time served in Florida to his jail time for the Michigan murder. Exact details of the deal struck are not clear. 'So Jones ended up getting credit in Michigan for all the days he served in Florida for the attack on Davis,' reports the Free Press. 'Michigan authorities can’t explain why his jail stay in Michigan was shortened by the time he was credited on an unrelated case in Florida.'","Peter Jones accused of strangling and knifing Bernice Schaufele in January .

As a result, Facebook users who downloaded contact data for their list of friends obtained additional information that they were not supposed to have. Breach: Facebook has admitted it has accidentally given out the phone numbers and email addresses of six million users . Facebook's security team was alerted to the bug last week and fixed it within 24 hours. But Facebook did not publicly acknowledge the bug until yesterday afternoon, when it published an 'important message' on its blog explaining the issue. A Facebook spokesman said the delay was due to company procedure stipulating that regulators and affected users be notified before making a public announcement. 'We currently have no evidence that this bug has been exploited maliciously and we have not received complaints from users or seen anomalous behavior on the tool or site to suggest wrongdoing,' Facebook said on its blog. Questions: The Facebook data leak comes as a number of internet giants, including Google, are coming under fire for their use of confidential user information . While the privacy breach was limited, 'it's still something we're upset and embarrassed by, and we'll work doubly hard to make sure nothing like this happens again,' it added. The breach follows recent disclosures that several consumer Internet companies turned over troves of user data to a large-scale electronic surveillance program run by U.S. intelligence. The companies include Facebook, Google Inc, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Yahoo Inc .

The woman said she was sexually assaulted in the bedroom by the officer, who told her he would return later that morning, prosecutors said. DNA evidence connected Nunlee to the sexual assault, Police Chief James Craig said on Friday afternoon. 'This is the type of misconduct that should never happen,' Craig said. 'This does not reflect the work the Detroit Police Department does each and every day.' 'I would go out and say that I think the majority of the public has a great deal of confidence and faith in this police department,' Craig added. 'And people should never lose sight that when we hire police officers we hire from the community, and you all know that there's people in our community that commit crimes. They make bad choices, make bad decisions, and police officers are no different.' Nunlee has been with the police force since 2008. When the woman made her accusations on October 31, he was put on desk duty. Emergency: The alleged victim had called 911 on October 30 to report being assaulted by her boyfriend . 'Bad choices': Police chief James Craig said this type of misconduct should never happen . On February 10, DNA collected in a rape kit was linked to Nunlee, who was then suspended without pay, Fox 2 reported. He remains suspended without pay and faces an April 17 preliminary examination. Nunlee was not the only Detroit officer to appear on the wrong side of a courtroom in recent days. Suspended officer Dana Bond was arraigned on Tuesday on charges of failing stop at an injury accident, failing to stop at an accident that caused property damage and driving with a high blood alcohol content. Authorities said Bond tried to drive away after a crash on Sunday, but struck a snow bank. Another officer, Johnny Ray Bridges, 46, was charged this week with unlawful imprisonment, assault with intent to do great bodily harm, domestic violence and reckless discharge of a firearm. A 31-year-old Detroit woman was punched and kicked in the face and body on Tuesday during an argument. At some point during the argument, a handgun was fired into the air. The woman said she escaped by breaking out a window and fleeing to a nearby restaurant. Bridges was off duty at the time.","Deon Nunlee has been suspended without pay after being charged with criminal sexual conduct .

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 17:57 EST, 22 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:57 EST, 22 June 2013 . The U.S. is stealing Chinese cell phone data, according to whistle-blower Edward Snowden. The 29-year-old former National Security Agency contractor claims he has the evidence to prove that the U.S. government has hacked Chinese phone companies and stolen millions of text messages and other information. Snowden made the claims from Hong Kong where he's in hiding after the U.S. issued an arrest warrant for him, and said the U.S. had snooped on targets in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, including the prestigious Tsinghua University. Espionage: Hong Kong was silent Saturday on whether Edward Snowden would be extradited to the United States now that he has been formally charged . The university, which is home to the mainland's six major backbone networks from where internet data from millions of Chinese citizens can be gathered, was breached as recently as January, Snowden said. 'Thereâ€™s far more than this,' Snowden said in an interview with the South China Morning Post on June 12. 'The NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cell phone companies to steal all of your SMS data,' he told the paper. Mobile nation: China Mobile is China's - and the world's - largest mobile network, with 735 million subscribers . During the interview, Snowden also said the U.S. and UK had technology which gave them unauthorized access to Blackberry phones of delegates at two G20 summits in London in 2009. Chinese government data shows that text message is by far the most popular mode of communication in China, with 900 billion text messages exchanged in 2012, up 2.1 per cent from the year before. China Mobile is the worldâ€™s largest mobile network carrier, with 735 million subscribers, and China Unicom, the second largest, has 258 million users. China Telecom is third in the world with 172 million users. Warning: Fang Binxing, widely thought to be the man behind China's 'great firewall' has been urging the Chinese government to review telecommunications security . The paper says that Chinese telecommunications companies have begun quietly replacing foreign-made equipment for fear of surveillance. For years, cyber-security experts such as Fang Binxing, president at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications have been concerned that telecommunications equipment was vulnerable to hacking by foreign powers, taking advantage of foreign-made components. Now that domestic suppliers are catching up with foreign imports, key components are being replaced with Chinese-made parts. The U.S. government has defended its electronic surveillance programs with claims that up to 50 would-be terrorist attacks were prevented because of intelligence gathered by the NSA. President Obama says the NSA is not listening in on phone calls or reading emails unless legal requirements have been satisfied.","The U.S. government has stolen millions of text messages from Chinese telecommunications companies, Edward Snowden said in an interview .

Breach of trust: Jochen Teizer was revealed by Georgia Tech officials to have forced students to give him at least $20,000 in under the table payments . A graduate professor at Georgia Tech has been suspended after it was revealed he forced students into under the table payments despite earning a six-figure salary. Jochen Teizer, of Atlanta, lined his pockets with at least $20,000 in student money going as far back as 2011, the university disclosed in a statement. The school had first been made aware of the allegations in October but only went public Friday night after WSB called seeking comment, the station said. Teizer, an associate professor of construction engineering, is believed to have accepted $10,000 in payments in 2011 from one student alone, said the statement. He coerced mostly Asian current and former students into handing over the cash despite raking in about $125,000 in salary, the station said. Not all of his victims were fluent in English. Teizer has been placed on leave while the process to have him dismissed has begun, the school said. The students will also be fully refunded the amount of the nefarious payments made to Teizer, said the statement. The disgraced professor insisted off-camera to WSB he never spent the money and intended to use it for his research, the station reported. His biography was removed from the Georgia Tech website by Saturday morning, and messages left for comment were not returned. Teizer appeared to be a relatively-like professor on campus, he received 3.5 out of 5 stars in online ratings. Students said his classes were dry, but he was a reasonable professor â€“ unless, of course, he demanded a kickback.

Eighteen-year-old Karl Pierson, who opened fire on his high school in Colorado earlier this month, entered through a door that should have been locked, authorities have revealed. The gunman, who fatally shot a female student in the head and eventually took his own life, was clearly carrying firearms and ammunition when he walked through an outside door that had been left ajar at Arapahoe High School in Centennial on December 13. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson revealed new details in the tragic shooting at a news conference on Monday morning. Terror: Karl Pierson, 18, opened fire on Arapahoe High School on December 13 after entering the school through a door that should have been locked, but rarely was. He fatally injured Claire Davis before killing himself . He also revealed that Pierson, who is believed to have targeted a teacher at the school after being dropped from the debating team, had spent the morning of the shooting bowling alone. In an eerie parallel, it was initially reported in 1999 that the two Columbine High School shooters also went bowling before opening fire, killing 13 and then themselves. This has since been disputed. When Pierson entered the school through the door - which was rarely locked - he was armed with a shotgun, a machete, 125-rounds of shotgun ammunition and three homemade explosive devices. '[He] made no effort to conceal the fact that he was armed,' Robinson said, the Denver Post reported. He fired three rounds into the hallway and then two near the library before throwing an explosive at a bookshelf. He then used a sixth shot to kill himself. Escape: Law enforcement officers escort students, with their hands raised, out of Arapahoe High School . In the hallway, his second round was fired directly at 17-year-old Claire Davis, who was struck in the head. She died from her injuries on December 21. The school janitor was the first to sound the warning and a prompt lockdown followed due to the efforts of school resource officer James Englert and security guard Rod Mauler, Robinson said. 'James Englert is a hero,' Robinson said, adding that he will be a pall bearer at Davis' memorial service on Saturday. The whole ordeal lasted one minute and 17 seconds. Authorities are still investigating reports that Pierson was targeting his debate coach and the librarian Tracy Murphy after the student was dropped from the debate team. The new information comes little over a week since the death of Claire Davis, eight days after she was shot at blank point range and put on life support. Rest . in peace: Claire Davis, 17, was pronounced dead eight days after . being shot in the head by the gunman . Loss: Students payed their respects to Claire at the fence outside Arapahoe High School hours after she died .

Claire's passing. Our hearts ache for her family as they deal with . unimaginable grief. Our prayers are with Claire's family & the . entire Arapahoe community,’ read the statement. Davis, . who spent just over a week in a coma, was surrounded by her family at . the time of her passing, according to a message posted on the hospital's Facebook page. At the request of her family and friends, The Denver Foundation announced it had created a fund in Claire's name on Dec. 16. The . foundation said the Arapahoe High School Community Fund honoring Claire . Davis will support mental health care, anti-bullying programs and other . community needs chosen by her parents, the fund's advisers.

'The grace, laughter …and light she brought to this world will not be . extinguished by her death; to the contrary, it will only get stronger.' There was no indication that the gunmen knew her or was acquainted with her. Sheriff Robinson said that Claire wouldn't have had any time to run from the shooter, . correcting earlier reports that she may have been trying to stop him. Hundreds of Arapahoe High School students gathered for a candlelight vigil on Saturday December 14, the day after the shooting which left Claire Davis in a coma for eight days . A . friend who was with Claire at the time dragged her to safety in a nearby . yoga class, according to the Denver Post. Sheriff Robinson said that Pierson had legally purchased the shotgun on December 6, a full week before the incident. 'His evil intent was to harm multiple individuals,' Sheriff Robinson said.

A British jihadist fighting with the mujahideen in Syria has confessed that he misses Coco Pops and wants to open a milkshake shop after the war. The 19-year-old, who claims that he walked across the border with Turkey to join a group fighting Bashir Assad's forces last night took part in a live web Q&A with wannabe jihadists. During the online livechat he incited children as young as 16 to 'put their faith in Allah' and join the holy war. It didn't matter if you are weak and scrawny he said, although 'it helps' if you are good at jogging. (File picture) A British teenager - who claimed to be a jihadist - tried to recruit youngsters on the site ask.fm . The teenager responded to questions on the social media website askfm, using the alias Abu Dujana. During the insightful question session, he described wages for jihadists - $40 a month plus $40 for each family member - and detailed some of the hardships of war, the scarcity of food on the frontline and going to the toilet in a hole in the mountain. He said he had flown to Turkey, several months ago, and crossed the border easily before joining his group. If caught by authorities 'just say you are a journalist', he counselled. The young mujahideen said he accepts he cannot return to Britain on pain of jail, but so far he did not miss life back home. He said: 'Saving lives is better than a red passport', adding, 'I only miss my family, nothing else. Ok I miss coco pops, i admit that...' He explained: 'What motivates me is that the muslims of sham are being killed, tortured and raped and as muslims we must believe that they are also family.' The British Muslim admitted that his family had suffered as a result of his decision. The jihadist claimed one of the things he missed while in Syria was Coco Pops . Ask.fm is a site where users can ask each other questions and get answers . In one post describing his mother's anguish he said: 'She found it very hard but in sha Allah, Allah will help her cope. Many parents change their minds after a while as they look into Jihad and begin to understand.' One doubtful young potential recruit asked if he had to be strong and fit to join up. But the 19-year-old soldier said anyone could serve. He said: 'Im weak also. There are skinny brothers, fat brothers, even disabled. Everyone is accepted. 'You dont need physical strength, just be good at jogging. but even if you cant jog much no problem'. Another asked: 'How can i come i am in america and only 16' and was told 'Put your trust in Allah and come to Turkey border'. The social media site ask.fm which shields the identity of the person asking the questions has previously attracted negative publicity for inciting several teenage girls to commit suicide.

The FBI appears to believe that missing Etan Patz, who vanished aged six from a New York City street in 1979, could still be alive. Last month, a 30-year-old married man living and working in Europe, was contacted by a federal investigator on a tip-off that he could be the missing boy. The FBI agent suggested to the man that he might not have been born where he'd been told and his parents were not biologically related to him. The investigator asked the man where he had gone to school and lived in the past. The man, who did not want to be identified, told  ProPublica that he didn't know who Etan Patz was and had to look up the case on the Internet. He told the website: 'I thought you might want to know that the FBI may be working to prove the child is still alive.' He added: 'I thought it was a hoax.' The man, at 30, is 11 years younger than Etan Patz would now be. The FBI provided no answers to the man about why they were still making calls about the missing boy after Pedro Hernandez came forward to admit to killing the boy in 2012 and now faces trial this spring. The FBI would not comment when contacted today by MailOnline. Hernandez, who has a history of mental illness, confessed to strangling Patz in the basement of a SoHo bodega in 1979. He has since recanted his story. Hernandez was arrested in May 2012 - after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance re-opened the Patz case - when family members told authorities that he admitted to killing Patz. Pedro Hernandez, the mentally troubled accused killer of longtime missing child Etan Patz, is due to stand trial later this year . The Etan Patz case was reopened in 2012 with the FBI investigating a Soho basement in New York City . At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez worked in a bodega just blocks from the boy's home. He then told authorities he'd seen Etan Patz at the bus stop, offered the boy a soda to entice him to a corner . store where he worked and choked the boy in the basement. Hernandez said he tossed Etan's book . bag behind a basement freezer, put his limp body in a box and left it . with some trash about a block away. No body or bag has ever been found. Under New York law, a person can be . convicted based only on a confession if there's additional evidence that . a crime was committed. However prosecutors . may be forced to throw out the case against Hernandez - who is both . schizophrenic and suffering from bipolar disorder - due to a lack of . evidence. On the morning of May 25, 1979, six-year-old Etan Patz left his SoHo apartment in New York City for the first time by himself to walk two blocks to catch the school bus. He was never seen again. The anniversary was later named National Missing Children's Day in his memory. He became one of the first vanished children pictured on a milk carton.

Nicolas Anelka has vowed not to repeat his controversial 'quenelle' goal celebration after West Brom demanded he explain his actions at West Ham on Saturday. Anelka celebrated a goal by touching a shoulder with . one hand, keeping the other arm pointed downwards, in a gesture that is said to be an . inverted Nazi salute. The striker said after the match that the action was a tribute to his friend, French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, and insisted that he did not mean to cause any offence. A statement from West Brom on Monday read: 'Nicolas was asked to explain his goal celebration by caretaker head coach Keith Downing within minutes of the game finishing at West Ham. 'Nicolas said that he performed the gesture to dedicate his goal to a friend and vehemently denied having any intention to cause offence. 'Upon reporting for training this morning, Nicolas was asked by sporting and technical director Richard Garlick to give a full explanation about his goal celebration, during which he again strongly denied intending to cause offence. Investigation: The FA is continuing its investigation into the seriousness of Nicolas Anelka's goal celebration . Bittersweet: Anelka performed the salute after scoring the first of two goals in a 3-3 draw with West Ham . Read the match report from Upton Park here . 'The club fully acknowledge that . Nicolas' goal celebration has caused offence in some quarters and has . asked Nicolas not to perform the gesture again. Nicolas immediately . agreed to adhere to this request. 'The . club is aware that the FA is investigating the matter and has offered . its full cooperation. The club will continue to make its own enquiries - . a process which will remain confidential between the club and Nicolas. 'Nicolas . is eligible for matches whilst the FA carries out its investigation. Therefore Nicolas will remain under consideration for first team . selection whilst the FA and the club continue their enquiries.' Downing added: 'Nico has trained normally. He has been out there on Monday and trained like he did last week. 'He has made the comment in terms of the situation. He didn't mean to offend anyone. That's all we can say. 'It would have been nice to have talked about his performance but there is a distraction to it and we will have to find out on Tuesday how it all is.' When asked if the row had taken the shine off his spell in charge, Downing said: 'I would like to have concentrated on the football, it has been a real examination for the football club - including myself and the players. Friends: West Brom acting head coach Keith Downing says that the gesture was a dedication from Anelka (right) to his French comedian friend Dieudonne (left), which Anelka reiterated on Twitter . Doubling up: Anelka (left) is on the spot to score West Brom's second goal of the afternoon . Mamadou Sakho . The Liverpool defender was pictured twice doing the gesture, once with Dieudonne, lastmonth. But he later said he did not know what it meant and had been ‘tricked’. Yannick Sagbo . The Hull forward tweeted a picture of Anelka’s celebration and wrote: ‘Anelka is a legend i love him is a best french striker’ and included a message of support for Dieudonne. 'We have come through a very . difficult period after the shock news of the manager going and the . players have responded positively.' Anelka faces a minimum five-match ban from the FA. He is set to become the first player . sanctioned under rules brought in by English football’s governing body . in May to combat racist behaviour. The . European Jewish Congress have called for police involvement and for . Anelka to receive the same punishment that would be handed down for a . Nazi salute. On Sunday night the Metropolitan Police said . it takes all allegations of hate crime seriously and will consider . whether action is required. The . FA are . consulting anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out and Jewish community . groups. The new . guidelines mean that Anelka, if found guilty, can receive at least five . matches and it could be ‘significantly’ longer. No timescale has been . placed on when a decision will be reached. It is not a fast-track case and could take some time due to the sensitivities and seriousness of the allegations. Anelka, . 34, a practising Muslim, is said to be astonished at the controversy . and tweeted that he was only giving a ‘special dedication’ to his . comedian friend M’bala M’bala, who regularly uses the gesture . on stage. Dieudonne has convictions for spreading race hate, and last week interior minister Manuel Valls announced that ‘all legal means’ to ban Dieudonne from making public appearances were being considered, saying: ‘He attacks the  memory of Holocaust victims in an obvious and unbearable way.’ Controversial: This picture of Samir Nasri (left) apparently performing the 'quenelle' was on social media sites . Dieudonne and his supporters claim it is merely an anti-Zionist, anti-establishment signal and the 47-year-old has threatened to sue those suggesting otherwise. The gesture has gone viral on social media and two soldiers were sanctioned by the French army in September for performing it in uniform in front of a Paris synagogue. A Facebook page in support of the pair published a picture in November of Samir Nasri apparently performing the gesture outside Manchester City's training ground. The picture was republished on Twitter the day after Anelka's celebration at Upton Park but Sportsmail understands Nasri was unaware of the anti-Semitic or political connotations surrounding the gesture. Support: QPR defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto tweeted a message to Anelka after his celebration . He is believed to have performed the act because of its popularity among people in France. He is also believed to know nothing about the controversy surrounding it. And QPR defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto was on Twitter supporting Anelka after the West Ham game. The message is difficult to translate as it is in French text speak but it is close to 'I congratulate you on the beautiful Quenelle.' Anelka was also on Twitter on Sunday night to insist that his gesture had no religious or anti-Semitic connection. He wrote: ‘Meaning of quenelle: anti-system. I do not know what the word religion has to do with this story!’ Fooled: Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho (right) was pictured making the same gesture as Anelka but later claimed he was tricked into doing it . ‘The quenelle is a dedication to Dini. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations they are the ones who create the confusion and controversy without knowing what the gesture really means! I shall therefore ask the people not to be duped by the media. And of course, I am neither anti-Semitic nor racist.’ Dieudonne applauded Anelka in a post on his Facebook page. ‘Excellent live quenelle by Anelka,’ he wrote. ‘Thanks for the support.’ But Anelka’s actions were roundly criticised elsewhere. Valerie Fourneyron, the French sports minister, said: ‘Anelka’s gesture is a shocking, disgusting provocation. There is no place for anti-Semitism and incitement to hatred on the football pitch.’ Controversial: French humorist Dieudonne arriving for a trial at the Paris courthouse on December 13 . Chantal Jouanno, the former sports minister and a senator in Paris, said: ‘The quenelle is a Nazi gesture, clearly anti-Semitic and known as such. It is not worth arguing about interpretation. We must be clear about our values. He must be punished.’ European Jewish Congress president Dr Moshe Kantor wants Anelka dealt with as if he ‘had made the infamous outstretched arm salute’ of the Nazis. ‘It is sickening that such a well-known footballer would make such an abusive and hateful gesture in front of tens of thousands of spectators. We expect that the English Premier League officials as well as the police will give Anelka the appropriate punishment.’ Political protest: A man poses with a drawing showing a Jew character covering the mouth of an other character with a gag reading 'freedom of speech' during a protest in support of Dieudonne . Defiant: A group performs the 'quenelle' salutes in front of the theatre Dieudonne's performing at . A lengthy ban for Anelka may signal the end of his career, with rumours of his retirement already emerging earlier this season. Hull forward Yannick Sagbo tweeted a picture of Anelka’s celebration and called him a ‘legend’ while expressing support for Dieudonne. Other footballers have been pictured making the gesture, including Mamadou Sakho last month. But the Liverpool defender later said he had been tricked. When West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football. But the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland. Here, we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala: .","Anelka sparked controversy with celebration against West Ham .

A new study shows that about one third of American's don't believe in Evolution and believe that humans have existed in their present form since the beginning of time. The Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of Americans believe that 'humans and other things have evolved over time' but that 33 percent think they were the only human form to ever set foot on the Earth. The study was conducted March 21-April 8, 2013, with a representative sample of 1,983 adults, ages 18 and older. The survey was conducted on landlines and cellphones in all 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. The margin of error was only three percentage points. Creationism versus Evolution: Research has found a widening gap between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to how man came to be . One third of Americans still believe in Creationism versus Evolution . Surprisingly enough, of the group of people who believe in evolution, 32 percent believe that evolution was due to natural selection, and roughly 24 per cent believe that, 'a supreme being guided the evolution of living things for the purpose of creating humans and other life in the form it exists today.' 78 per cent of Mainline Protestants believe that humans and other animals evolved over time reported the Huffington Post. According to PEW, the belief in creationism versus evolution is closely linked to religious background and race. two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants don't believe in evolution whereas half of black evangelical Protestants do. When those people polled were divided by their religious affiliation the results showed that majority of white evangelicals believe that a supreme being guided evolution . There was also a disparity between believing in evolution versus creationism when examining political parties. Currently, 43 per cent of Republicans believe in evolution and 67 per cent of Democrats believe in human evolution. In 2009,a greater number of republicans, 54 per cent, believed in evolution, and 64 per cent of democrats believed in evolution. The study also investigated the differences between demographic groups and also  the differences in language. They worded the evolution question in two different ways. One way they phrased it as 'humans and other living things' and the other way they phrased it was as 'animals and other living things.' They found that exchanging animals for humans made very little difference in people's beliefs about evolution. However, the study found that men were more likely than women to believe that humans/ animals and other living things evolved. They also found those who had completed a for of higher education believed in evolution more than people who hadn't.

The storm around President Hollande's private life does not seem to be calming, as his former partner wins a lawsuit against a gossip magazine as his new girlfriend launches one against the same publication. Valerie Trierweiler, 48, won 12,000 euros (£9,800) from magazine Closer after they ran pictures of her on holiday in Mauritius in February. This is despite Ms Trierweiler being a journalist with Closer’s rival, Paris Match, which is well known for publishing beach shots of public figures. Privacy invaded: President Hollande's former partner Valerie Trierweiler, left,  has won damages from Closer magazine as his alleged new girlfriend, actress Julie Gayet, right, brings a lawsuit of her own . Man of the hour: President Francois Hollande appeared blissfully ignorant of his stormy private life, and delighted to see Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, during an EU meeting in Brussels today . The money awarded to Ms Trierweiler by a court in Nanterre, suburban Paris, was less than a quarter of the 50,000 euros she had demanded. 'The hurt caused is all the greater because the article capitalised on the difficult period that (Miss Trierweiler) was going through,' the court ruling said. 'The number of photographs taken, obviously with a telephoto lens, suggest she was subject to intrusive surveillance by a photographer.' At the same time, the woman who is said to be Hollande's new girlfriend - and his mistress while he was with Ms Trierweiler is bringing an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against Closer. It was Closer that reported she was having an affair with President Hollande, and took pictures of the pair's secret rendezvous in Paris last year. French actress Julie Gayet is suing Closer over the article that revealed that she was having an affair with President Hollande . Nasty split: It was the revelation in Closer that Hollande was having an affair that saw Ms Trierweiler hospitalised 'with stress' and ended their relationship . Julie Gayet is seeking 54,000 euros (£44,500) in damages and legal fees from the celebrity gossip glossy, plus front-page publication of a summary of any judicial ruling in the case. The 41-year-old French actress was not present at proceedings on Thursday, held at the same court in Nanterre. Closer's January revelation that Hollande was meeting secretly with Gayet led to his public separation from his long-time companion, Ms Trierweiler, and drew international headlines. Hollande never denied his relationship with Gayet, who has appeared in public only once since the report - at last week's Cesar cinema awards. Laurence Pieau, the editor of Closer, has defended the publication of the photos of Gayet and Persident Hollande saying it was something the public had a right to know.","Valerie Trierweiler has won £9,800 in damages from gossip mag .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:06 EST, 9 November 2011 . The foster brother who sexually assaulted Joshua Komisarjevsky as a child admitted to a doctor 'things happened that shouldn't have happened of a sexual nature', a psychologist testified today. Massachusetts-based psychologist Leslie Lebowitz testified in the sentencing phase of Joshua Komisarjevsky's murder trial, claiming that childhood trauma led him to a life of crime. Komisarjevsky, 31, was convicted of killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters in their Cheshire home in 2007. The girls died of smoke inhalation after the house was doused in gas and set on fire. Taking the stand for a second day, Ms Lebowitz recalled how Komisarjevsky's his devoutly Christian parents told him that homosexual sex is a sin, leading the cold blooded killer to believe he was condemned to hell after he was allegedly raped at age 14 by Scott Reetz - 11 years his senior. Foster brothers: Accused killer Joshua Komisarjevsky (R) has accused Scott Reetz (L) of raping him as a teen . Reetz was taken in by the Komisarjevskys as a teenager in the 1980s. The family had adopted Joshua when he was Komisarjevsky was two-weeks-old. On Tuesday, Ms Lebowitz testified she interviewed Reetz for an evauluation requested by the defence team. She concluded that he was 'very visibly impaired' and 'not verbal' during their sit-down. According to a Courant.com report, Ms Lebowitz said she asked Reetz about specific sexual abuse but he would say only, 'Yes, something like that might have happened'. She said he admitted to 'posing games' and that regretted showing Komisarjevsky his body parts. He told her he was 'curious about sex' at the time. Defence lawyers, who are trying to spare Komisarjevsky from being given the death penalty, have argued the Komisarjevskys, a deeply religious and strict family, opposed psychological counselling or medications that could have helped their son after the incident. Ms Lebowitz testified that when asked about family patriarch Ben Komisarjevsky, Reetz told her he was 'angry a lot'. Family ties: Komisarjevsky's sister (L) said that her brother Joshua Komisarjevsky (R) sexually assaulted her starting when she was ten and he was 12-years-old . Victims: Dr William Petit Jr, with his daughters Michaela (front), Hayley, (centre rear) and his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit . She also said that she interviewed . Joshua Komisarjevsky's mother, Jude, who said she had suspected Reetz . was abusing other children in the family home - a sentiment that was . solidified when Ms Lebowitz interviewed a foster daughter who lived in . the home with Reetz. According to the doctor, the woman recalled how . Reetz 'put a pillow over her head and raped her' when she lived with the . family. Reetz is on Connecticut's sex offender registry, convicted in 1993 of sexual assault in an unrelated case. Family members told Ms Lebowitz . Komisarjevsky took a 'downward turn'after a head injury . when he was about nine, and after a series of deaths of men he was . close to. She said he saw saw 'an embodiment of terror' that appeared as . a shadow in his bedroom, and that he would run into the woods to escape . it. Komisarjevsky told her he . had been raped by 'an important friend' that made him feel 'dead and . completely out of control', and began self-mutilating. In 1996, he was sent to a religious . residential treatment home for boys in Vermont called The Fold; during . his stay he started a fire at a gas station and began running away and . taking drugs, family said. A mother's love: Joshua Komisarjevsky's mother Jude, holds him in her arms as a baby shortly after his 1981 birth. He was adopted at two-weeks-old . Haunting: Komisarjevsky as a young boy (L) molested his younger sister, whom he holds as a baby (R) Prosecutor Gary Nicholson . asked Ms Lebowitz during cross-examination if she thought Scott Reetz had . obvious mental disabilities, which she affirmed. Ms Lebowitz admitted that she wrote . her report only on the first 15 years of Komisarjevsky's life and did . not write about his use of illegal drugs, including hallucinogenic LSD. She said she believed Komisarjevsky's hallucinations preceded his use of the drug. Mr Nicholson questioned her . allegation during Monday's testimony that Komisarjevsky was sexually assaulted 'not every day, but a . lot', and her recollection of Komisarjevsky's statements that he had . been anally raped on numerous occasions, forced to pose in sexual . positions with his sister, and his chest burned with cigarettes by Reetz. Ms Lebowitz confirmed Joshua was the only person who made those allegations. Sexual abuse claims have been heard throughout the evidence and sentencing phases of Komisarjevsky's trial. Turning point: Joshua Komisarjevsky  sorted his life out for a while and completed Army Reserve training . His sister, whose named is being . withheld by MailOnline, appeared in court on her brother's behalf last . month despite her claims he sexually abused her as a child. The sister said her parents worried she or her brother could be removed from the home if they sought counselling. The woman testified her brother had . sexually abused her for up to two years, ending when she was about ten . and he was about 12, when she finally spoke out. Accomplice: Steven Hayes is already on death row for the killings . She told prosecutor Michael Dearington she saw the abuse 'not as violence but an act of control'. His sister said under . cross-examination from prosecutors that she turned out successful while . growing up in the same household and 'in spite of' suffering sexual . abuse. Komisarjevsky's attorneys have said . he was also abused as a teen by someone else other than his foster . brother; prosecutors say those claims came from Komisarjevsky and . emerged years later when he faced prison time for 19 nighttime . residential burglaries. His sister said she knew nothing of . his abuse until after he was arrested in the Cheshire home invasion . killings, but has never spoken to Komisarjevsky about the incident. Komisarjevsky was found guilty of 17 . counts on October 13 for the grisly murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, . and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, and the vicious . beating of their father, Dr. William Petit,. He has blamed his accomplice for most . of the grisly murders. He said Steven Hayes broke into the Petit home . early on July 23, 2007 after Komisarjevsky spotted Michaela Petit in a . grocery store and made her his target. Later that morning, Mrs Hawke-Petit . drove to a bank, where she told a teller her family was being held . hostage and she needed $15,000 to pay off the captors. A bank manager called police but when . authorities arrived at the Petit home, it was engulfed in flames. The . police have been criticised as being slow to respond. The only survivor, Dr William Petit, was badly beaten and bound but managed to escape as the house was set on fire. Charred: The house was set alight with the girls still inside, tied up with pillowcases over their heads . Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . In the burning house were his . daughters, who died of smoke inhalation, and the body of his wife, who . had been raped and strangled. The younger girl had been sexually . assaulted. Hayley Petit's body was found at the top of the staircase. Her sister's body was found still in her bed. And while Superior Court Judge Jon C . Blue is deciding if Komisarjevsky's nine-year-old daughter should . testify in the death penalty phase of the trial, his girlfriend at the . time of the home invasion has told of a very different man than the . brutal killer who committed the triple murders. She told RadarOnline.com about her experiences dating Komisarjevsky, whom she called a 'great dad' and a caring single father. He was granted sole custody of the . girl, then five, two months before the murders after being embroiled in a . bitter custody battle with her mother, Jennifer Norton, who was being . treated at a crisis intervention unit, reports Radar. The girl could play a major role in . the jury's decision and sources have said that defence attorneys have . subpoenaed the girl, who now lives with one of her mother's relatives. It was revealed in March that she would be called to testify either during the evidence portion or the penalty phase. Her grandparents asked that her name . be redacted from the witness list in April after she received a . threatening letter at their Cheshire home. Judge Blue said earlier today that defence attorneys have subpoenaed the judge who sentenced Komisarjevksy . for other crimes in 2002. An attorney from the attorney general's office . is trying to quash the subpoena. A hearing has been set for November 14.","Joshua Komisarjevsky claimed sexual assaults occurred when he was 14 .

"By . Jennifer Smith . PUBLISHED: . 08:06 EST, 28 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:46 EST, 28 December 2013 . X Factor winner Sam Bailey had been secretly mentored by PR guru Max Clifford for years before entering the singing competition, it has emerged. The 36-year-old, who snared a £1million record deal through the show, even performed at the consultant's 70th birthday celebrations after he discovered her in a Cotwolds pub. Clifford, who is due to stand trial for sex offence charges next year, 'opened doors' for the former prisoner officer who had previously been rejected by the X Factor in 2007. 'Mentor': X Factor winner Sam Bailey with Max Clifford at a charity function earlier this year before she was 'discovered' on the show . The former prison officer was a firm favourite to win the competition throughout the live shows . He reportedly told his friend and the show's producer Simon Cowell he 'simply had to hear her sing', and to allow her to audition. The 70-year-old refused to talk of his hand in making Bailey's career a success, but admitted: 'Sam's voice bowled me over. 'All I . did for her was to open a few doors and talk to several influential . people. 'The rest was up to her - and now she's big-time. But her success . is all really down to her and her alone.' But sources close to the publicist suggested he convinced Simon Cowell to hear her out, and allow her one more shot at fame. The 36-year-old singer was allegedly discovered by the PR guru two years before entering this year's competition . The singer not only scooped a £1million recording contract through the show but was named Christmas Number One with her debut single Skyscraper . 'As a result the music guru and his . fellow executives were amazed by her voice and Sam went from . strength-to-strength through the televised rounds of public votes. Max Clifford is due to stand trial for indecent assault charges in March . 'Not only did she win the X-Factor show . by being crowned peoples' favourite, she also notched up the top selling . Christmas No1 with her disc Skyscraper,' added the source. A spokesman for the Syco Entertainment dismissed claims the publicist had influenced music mogul Cowell, and that he never knew the pair had met. 'Sam Bailey was an emphatic winner of the X Factor this year with more than a million votes from the public in the final alone. 'To suggest any inappropriateness would be untrue and, frankly, ridiculous.' However sources close to Max Clifford said: 'Nothing of Max's involvement in the years leading up to Sam's fame could have been publicised beforehand because people would have argued Sam she had an unfair advantage.

The Pope has many titles, such as The Holy See, the Vicar of Jesus Christ, the Pontiff and His Holiness, but now it appears he has one more - style icon. The U.S. edition of men's style and lifestyle magazine Esquire has named Pope Francis as its Best Dressed Man of 2013. The magazine admits the decision is 'unconventional' but claims his simple manner of dressing has 'signaled a new era (and for many, renewed hope) for the Catholic Church'. Stylish simplicity: The Pope has been named Esquire's Best Dressed Man for 2013 . Wrapped up: Pope Francis tries to keep himself warm as he attends his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican in November . Mark-Evan Blackman, assistant professor of menswear design at FIT, told the magazine: 'His mode of dressing really does reflect the mindset behind it.' 'I remember when John Paul II was buried in those opulent bright red shoes. When the current pope was elected and chose not to wear the red shoes I thought that was very reflective of his approach to being a person functioning in a role.' The Pope has been lauded for his humility - on Maundy Thursday, he knelt to wash and kiss the feet of young offenders — two of them girls and one a Muslim - during an Easter visit to a youth detention centre. In July, he invited homeless people to dine with him in St Peter’s Square. Hats and accessories: Fashion experts say the Pope's unadorned style reflects his austere and humble actions . A modern Pope: Pope Francis has his picture taken inside St. Peter's Basilica with youths from the Italian Diocese of Piacenza and Bobbio who came to Rome for a pilgrimage . In August, he posed for a ‘papal selfie’ with a group of teenagers. A few weeks later, he put on a red clown’s nose to pose for comic photos with a newly-wed couple. 'Pope Francis understands that menswear is meant to express the character of the man wearing the clothes,' said Mary Lisa Gavenas, author of The Fairchild Encyclopedia of Menswear. 'No rapper-style popewear for him.' Ann Pellegrini, Associate Professor of Performance Studies & Religious Studies at New York University told the magazine the simplicity of his garments 'offers a way to visibly display his theological and material concerns for the poor'. Menswear expert Mary Lisa Gavenas said: 'Pope Francis understands that menswear is meant to express the character of the man wearing the clothes' Esquire's previous winners of the award have included film stars and musicians like OutKast's Andre 3000 . Known since March 13 as Pope Francis, the spectacle-wearing 77-year-old was 2013’s most discussed human being, according to the Global Language Monitor’s annual survey of the internet. The accolade lays bare his ability  to shape the news agenda and capture hearts and minds with a succession of charismatic speeches and colourful public gestures. Earlier this month, Francis was named Time magazine’s 86th Person of the Year — an honour previously awarded to Churchill, the Queen, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.","The head of the Catholic Church has been lauded for unadorned style .

Patrick Rock, a key advisor to the Prime Minister, has been arrested on suspicion of child porn offences . The Downing Street aide arrested on child porn offences could be the victim of ‘revenge or jealousy’, a relative of Patrick Rock has claimed. Simon Rock de Besombes said he was ‘shocked’ by his cousin’s resignation from Number 10 and subsequent arrest, and insisted his cousin ‘to date he is innocent’. Patrick Rock was arrested almost three weeks ago after Number 10 called in the National Crime Agency to investigate a potential offence linked to child abuse images. Detectives from the National Crime Agency searched No 10 and were given access to government offices and IT systems, but the operation was kept secret until details were leaked to the Mail this week. Mr Cameron has said he was ‘profoundly shocked’ by the allegations against Mr Rock, with whom he worked as Tory advisers in John Major’s government. Mr Rock has not spoken publicly about the allegations since his arrest. He has not been charged. His relative Mr Rock de Besombes said: ‘I am shocked. I know my cousin and nothing I know of him has anything to do with this. To date he is innocent. There are no charges against him [but] nobody is defending him. ‘The fact that he chose to resign is a noble decision and shows that he is innocent. ‘Men of power can have many enemies. It could have been jealousy, it could have been revenge. It could have been many things,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. Mr Rock de Besombes, who lives in Normandy, added: ‘My cousin isn’t here. Perhaps he is in France, perhaps he is in the UK. Between February 13 and today we might have been in contact but since the scandal erupted I have had no news from him.’ As deputy head of the Downing Street policy unit, Mr Rock was one of the most senior figures in Mr Cameron’s inner circle. Mr Rock, 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West London. He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de Besombes. His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he is 'profoundly shocked' by the arrest of his old friend . As a teenager, Mr Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he studied history. After graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing director of the Retail Consortium. It is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote. The government has faced mounting questions about why it took almost three weeks for the arrest to be made public, and only after a leak to the Daily Mail. Number 10 says it first became aware . of allegations against Mr Rock on February 12, when it called in the NCA . and informed the Prime Minister. Mr Rock later resigned and in the early hours of February 13 was arrested by the police. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has defended Number 10's decision not to make the arrest public . Officers then entered Downing Street and were given access to official computer systems. Labour is also demanding to know how much time elapsed between Number 10 being aware of a potential offence, Mr Rock resigning and the police being called in. It comes amid suggestions that informing Mr Rock of the alleged offence amounted to a ‘tip-off’ of his impending arrest. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, called on the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate. He said there were legitimate concerns ‘given that Mr Rock had a senior role at the heart of Government and was privy to the most sensitive information, and that he has had a very close working relationship with the Prime Minister over a number of years’. Mr Ashworth asked: ‘When were Mr Rock's colleagues in No. 10 informed that he had resigned, and why was the fact of his resignation not made public immediately? ‘What were officials in No. 10 and in other departments with which he had contact told about the reasons for Mr Rock's absence from work?’ In response Sir Jeremy said: ‘Downing Street became aware of a potential offence relating to child abuse imagery on the evening of 12 February.  I was immediately informed of the allegation and the Prime Minister was also briefed. ‘Officials then contacted the NCA to seek advice on how to report suspected criminality. Our subsequent actions were driven by the overriding importance of not jeopardising either their investigation or the possibility of a prosecution. ‘Patrick Rock resigned on the evening of 12 February. His resignation was not made public as we judged it was inappropriate to make an announcement while the NCA investigations were continuing. ‘A few hours later he was arrested. We also arranged for officers to come into Number 10 to have access to all IT systems and offices they considered relevant. ‘There has been no contact from officials with Mr Rock since his arrest. ‘ .

The 'Unsinkable Ship' setting sail for her fateful maiden voyage a century ago is an image those who waved her off will never forget. But while the enduring memory of the Titanic is of the famous liner sinking into the North Atlantic, one man captured a rare snapshot of the moment she set off on her one and only journey. Sailing smoothly through the waves just off Southampton, this 100-year-old photograph shows the doomed boat taking to the icy seas on April 10th, 1912. It was captured by then 15-year-old Elliot Brown, who used the picturesque scene of his uncle's sea-facing back garden on the Isle of Wight to photograph the giant vessel as it loomed into view off the south coast. During the seven hours before being rescued from the Titanic (pictured), Miss Rosenbaum and her musical pig comforted children onboard a nearby lifeboat . Mr Brown's uncle's house on the Isle of Wight offered spectacular views of ships sailing from Southampton out towards the English Channel, with the teenager using a brownie box camera to immortalise the moment. The young Mr Brown, a keen amateur photographer, took a picture and stowed the image away into his album along with pictures of his friends and family, unaware of just how significant his quickly-taken photograph would later become. When disaster struck and the 882ft Titanic plunged into the North Atlantic Ocean four days after Mr Brown's picture, the teenager knew he had captured an iconic moment, but nonetheless opted to keep his memento safe in the family album. Respected: Elliot Brown, pictured here as a young man in photographs from the same album as the Titanic picture, maintained an interest in photography but went on to become a GP in Birmingham. The . 'brownie' series of cameras used by Mr Brown for his Titanic picture . were introduced around 1900 and helped popularise photography at the . turn of the century. A precursor to the modern disposable camera, early versions consisted simply of a cardboard box with a meniscus lens inside. Although . other kinds of box cameras existed at the time and continued to be . produced for decades, the most successful model initially was the . 'Brownie' made by Eastman Kodak Co. Named . after 'The Brownies' comic strips, their makers marketed the camera . with the slogan, 'You push the button, we do the rest'. The photograph remained in his possession his entire life as Mr Brown married, had children, and established himself as a respected GP in Birmingham. When his second wife Faith was moved into an old people's home, however, his children began clearing possessions from Elliot and Faith's bungalow in Galmpton, Devon. It was then they came across the album and its rare contents belonging to their father, who died in 1967 aged 70. Had they not saved the rare image in the album, the momentous picture could have been lost forever. Mr Brown's son Bruce found the picture, which had a noticeable fold down the middle and was stuck in the album with a handwritten caption: 'RMS 'Titanic': Maiden Voyage'. Bruce has since had the iconic photograph digitally restored in time for the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking, but still plans to keep the picture in the family. The 77-year-old retired meetings manager, from Henley-on-Thames, said: 'When I was in my mid-20s he happened to tell me in passing that he had taken a picture of the Titanic as she came out of Southampton water. 'I remember it stuck in my mind when he told me at the time, and it has been a subject which has fascinated a lot of people ever since. 'He realised how significant a picture it was some time later, but decided to keep it in his album. 'Like everyone else the Titanic had a big impact on him and he was shocked by what happened. 'My father was quite a religious man . and was quite moved by the fact that the band on the Titanic apparently . played 'Abide With Me' before it went down.' Describing . the moment he found the photo his father had told him about decades . earlier, grandfather Bruce added: 'It was a split second decision . whether to keep the album as it was his and I didn't know anyone else in . the pictures, but I'm not glad I did.' Century-old: The original image taken by Elliot Brown has a fold down the middle next to the caption: 'RMS Titanic - Maiden Voyage' First and only journey: A route map of the route taken by the Titanic on its doomed maiden voyage . Keeping it in the family: Retired meeting manager Bruce Brown, 77, says he intends to keep his father's momentous 100-year-old Titanic photograph . Pete Boswell, from Warwickshire-based Photo Legacy, who restored the photo, said: 'It has been a fantastic experience and a privelege to work on a picture like this one. 'When people find pictures like this one it is often a journey of discovery, and this image is no different.' Bruce Brown revealed that he discovered . the photo album in his late father's home in Devon in around 1985, but . kept hold of it since then and has only recently had it digitally . restored.

Smiling, laughing and looking like they were without a care in the world, these photographs of soldiers guarding one of Nazi Germany's key outposts in 1944 were never meant to see the light of day. But this life through a lens on the idyllic Dutch island of Walcheren was grabbed by a British war hero in a daring raid behind enemy lines and its incredible contents have been published for the first time today. Green Beret Arthur Thompson, 89, was part of a 47 Royal Marine Commando smash and grab sortie on November 1 1944 to the island, in an attempt to punch a hole through the enemy's defences. Incredible: Frolicking in the sunshine, these German soldiers have fun in 1944 while the war rages around them - an image that would never have been seen had a British commando not stolen their camera . Play time: A German officer plays with a dachshund on an idyllic beach on the Dutch island of Walcheren, which was then under Nazi control . Walcheren is an island in the mouth of the river Scheldt, and was a Nazi . stronghold that gave German forces the use and control of the vital . deep sea port of Antwerp in Belgium. Hero: Former Royal Marine Commando Arthur Thompson took a camera from a Nazi bunker and revealed its contents nearly 70 years later . Aged just 21 then, Mr Thompson took the camera from a German bunker and carried it with him around Europe until the war was over - and there was even enough film left for him to take some of his own pictures. As soon as he was back in Britain he took them to be developed - and assuming the film would only contain his snaps - he was amazed at what he found. The pictures show one unknown German relaxing on the beautiful sand-swept Dutch island prior to the allied invasion. In one of the photos a German officer can be playing with his cute dachshund in a scene that could not be further away from the brutal war that was raging around him. In another snap soldiers can be seen sprawled across a grassy dune draped over one another while laughing and joking. Other pictures show officers attending a military briefing and posing up against a wooden post. Grandfather-of-six Arthur, who lives in Greenhill, Kent, said said he had decided to share the images publicly for the first time after a request from local historians. 'I think the pictures are fascinating. They give a glimpse of war that is rarely ever seen,' he said. 'I was amazed when I got them developed. I still remember in detail the moment I found the camera. 'We were sweeping the island of Walcheren in Holland, which was riddled with bunkers. Pinched: The camera taken in the daring raid by Arthur Thompson, in the background, still works to this day . Guarding: The Germans built a series of bunkers on the island, and the one in the background is probably what the commandos raided in 1944 . Relaxing: Two unknown soldiers pose on the banks leading down to the island's beaches . Meeting: German troops lounge on chairs outside in the sunshine in 1944 with several more sitting on grassy banks . 'It had sand dunes higher than houses. As we were advancing along the dunes we had to check the bunkers. 'I went down one bunker to make sure it was clear. In the corner there was camera in a case: I captured it. In that camera was a film. 'I put in my pocket and kept it with me through the way. I took a few photos on that camera myself too.' Brave: Royal Marine Arthur Thompson, pictured 4th from the left, centre row, was part of a team of heroes who carried out raids all over Europe . Brave: Young commando Mr Thompson, aged 20, took the camera and revealed a never before seen view of life as a German soldier at the height of the war . The 47 Royal Marine Commando he belonged to were an elite fighting force of 420 men who fought some of the toughest battles of WWII. Its strategic position at the mouth of . the river leading to Antwerp meant that Walcheren paid a heavy price in . the Second World War. Soon after the Dutch surrender in May . 1940 the Germans took it and scarred its landscape with bunkers and . guns, making it a constant target for British bombers. In fact by the end of the war it became one of the most bombed parts of Europe. After four years of occupation D-Day came on June 6 and the race to take Walcheren was on. To launch the final attack against . Hitler's Third Reich, the Allies badly needed Antwerp to ensure they . could bring in ships with equipment. In early September 1944 the city and . its port were taken easily, but Walcheren was still occupied so they . could not use the Scheldt river. To breach Walcheren's defence, rather . than invade, they decided to bomb a sea dike, causing a 150 metre breach . that flooded the island. The population had been alerted in . advance via a pamphlet drop, but a mistake meant bombs also fell on a . town, killing about 200 civilians. Despite the attack he Germans stayed so on November 1 troops invaded and re-took the island in a fierce battle. Arthur and his unit famously captured the strategic port of Port-en-Bessin, in Normandy France after slipping behind enemy lines on D-DAY and completing a 12-mile march through Nazi territory. The heavily fortified port was the vital Normandy terminal of PLUTO, the Pipe Line Under The Ocean, which pumped millions of gallons of fuel under the Channel to France. And their capture of it from the crack German unit, the 352 Infantry Division, went down in the history books as 'the most spectacular of all commando exploits during the actual invasion'. Arthur joined the war effort in 1944 after carrying out over two years of training with the Commandos. His first taste of action was storming the beaches of Normandy on D-day at the age of just 20. He stayed in Germany until he was demobbed in 1946 and went back to England to marry his wife June in 1947, who sadly died 10 years ago at the age of 74. But Arthur, a father of three, spent the rest of his life living in Kent working as a coal miner until he retired at the age of 60 and has modestly played down his achievements. 'I have had a lucky life. I survived the war - we had some pretty difficult task to complete - it was a tough old job,' he said. 'We were a great unit and people have often referred to us as heroes but unfortunately we also lost a lot of great men through out the war. 'But I was lucky enough to survive, marry my beautiful wife and bring up three great kids - who have given me wonderful grandchildren. 'I have often wondered about the lives of the other German soldiers who are in the pictures but I guess I will never now what happened to them - they probably died.

Trenches 23,000 feet deep, psychedelic spirals of lava and the highest known mountain in the solar system - these are just some of the highlights see by the Mars Express spacecraft over the past decade. Mars Express, launched in 2003, has now orbited the planet nearly 12,500 times, providing scientists with unprecedented images and data collected by its range of scientific instruments. The data have been used to create an almost global digital topographic model of Mars' surface, providing a unique flyby video. Scroll down for video... Mars Express (pictured) was launched in 2003 and has now orbited the planet nearly 12,500 times . The images in this video were taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HSRC) and were put together by the DLR German Aerospace Center as part of the ten years of Mars Express celebrations. ‘For the first time, we can see Mars spatially – in three dimensions,’ said Ralf Jaumann, project manager for the mission at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Mars Express reached its destination on 25 December 2003 – and caused an initial shock. The HRSC took its first close look down towards Mars and sent back an almost plain white image. This was the first of many images of a crater taken from the spacecraft's camera at an altitude of 277 km . As well as images from the Mars' Express, Nasa's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been capturing images from the ground. The above southward uphill view was taken when the rover began to ascend the northwestern slope of 'Solander Point' on the western rim of Mars' Endeavour Crater. The view combines five frames taken by Opportunity's navigation camera on the 3,463rd Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars. Opportunity had begun climbing the hill on Sol 3451 and completed three additional uphill drives before reaching this point. The rover team is using the rover to investigate outcrops on the slope. The northward-facing slope will tilt the rover's solar panels toward the sun in the southern-hemisphere winter sky, providing an important energy advantage for continuing mobile operations through the upcoming winter. ‘Everyone just swallowed,’ recalled Mr Jaumann. Scientists were worried that the camera had failed. But one of the nine different channels of the camera – the infrared channel – was still showing weak contours of the surface of Mars. The solution to the problem was quickly found; the sensitivity of the camera close to Mars was much greater than that expected by the researchers, meaning that the first image was overexposed. Two Mars orbits later, on 10 January 2004, and with the correct exposure time, the first of many successful images was acquired from an altitude of 277 kilometres. Since then an almost complete 3D global view of the Red Planet has been created from the numerous images. The scientists put the camera images together piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle, creating a global map of Mars. Of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of Mars, 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution, where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface. Almost the entire surface of Mars has now been imaged at a resolution of better than 100 metres. The 3D view of the valleys, canyons and lava flows is possible because of the unusual imaging principle used by the camera. Valles Marineris pictured here is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than 4,000 km long and 200 km wide, the Valles Marineris rift system is one of the larger canyons of the solar system . Nine light-sensitive detectors sweep the surface in sequence from nine different observation angles. This data is then processed into three-dimensional images by the DLR planetary researchers. ‘We can see the entire topography almost as well as if we were standing on Mars ourselves,’ said Mrs Jaumann. Although the conditions on Mars are no longer suitable for the existence of liquid water, at some time in its past water must have flowed over its surface, scouring out deep valleys in the highlands and creating huge outflow valleys three to four billion years ago. Using the camera's super resolution channel, images can be acquired that are so rich in detail that geological processes in which water was involved can be seen. It is likely that there were periods of flowing and standing water during the history of this planet, which is so dry and dusty today. Of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of Mars, 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution, where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface . This means that different climatic conditions must have been predominant in the planet’s early history. This is also clearly visible in the three-dimensional camera images showing structures near the equator that have been caused by glaciation. ‘The Mars Express mission was due to end after one Mars year – or about two Earth years,’ said Mr Jaumann. But during the past 10 years the European Space Agency (ESA) has kept extending the mission. The spacecraft is now due to continue orbiting Mars until the end of 2014. Mr Jaumann added: ‘That is actually the bottom line on the past 10 years; everything is still functioning perfectly and we are still acquiring new data that is important for Mars research.’","Video was put together using images taken over ten years by Mars Express .

David Moyes has written to every Manchester United season-ticket holder admitting he is 'desperate to compensate' for the dismal start to his reign. And he has again been forced to deny that Robin van Persie is increasingly disillusioned at Old Trafford. Moyes’s stance follows comments from former Holland star Ronald de Boer that the striker is ‘not enjoying the football United are playing’ and will be off at the end of the season unless major signings are made. The United manager, whose plea for patience in his ‘difficult’ first season has received a mixed reaction on social media, denied Van Persie is unhappy at United and that there are divisions in his squad. The controversy over Van Persie, which began following the shock 2-0 Champions League defeat at Olympiacos when he told a Dutch TV station that team-mates were running into his space, intensified with De Boer’s remarks. But Moyes hit back, saying: ‘Have I a reaction to what Robin said after Olympiacos? Do you know the whole transcript? Read it out in full and I will answer your question. Apology: David Moyes has written a letter (below) to every Manchester United season ticket holder appologising for the team's poor form this season . Unrest: Robin van Persie continues to grow disillusioned with life at Old Trafford . 'Look at the whole transcript, rather than that one bit that has been picked out. I have — and I have no issue with it whatsoever. When you hear it in full, you see what he is getting at and I understand totally where he was  coming from. ‘I travelled back with him from the Holland game the other night. I went to the game against France and then travelled back with him. ‘If anyone is suggesting certain players are not playing for me, I don’t know if that is the right thing. ‘I think they definitely are, so I don’t accept that. I’ve been honest with the players and the media and tried to be as straight as I can. ‘I’ve done it with the supporters as well and admitted we need to play better. Poor: Moyes admitted the Olympiacos debacle was the poorest his team have played . We've been here before: Sir Alex Ferguson sent a letter to United fans in 1989 . ‘I think Olympiacos was the poorest we’ve played. It was disappointing, but we will improve. ‘The idea of the letter was simply that I was asked to put out something to the supporters and it was just to say, here we are — this is how it’s gone about. ‘But I think most United supporters totally understand the situation and they’ve shown that with their support and their backing wherever I’ve been —  not just at Old Trafford but everywhere that I go. ‘I’ve been to a lot of games all  over the world recently and all the  Manchester United followers I have bumped into have been supportive and shown they understand we’re having a difficult season. ‘They’re looking forward to it getting better.’ Chance: Manchester United will have to pick up three points against Pepe Mel's struggling West Brom . Partenrs: The Wayne Rooney-Van Persie partnership is not flourishing this season . In his letter, Moyes said he ‘firmly believed’ United would re-emerge as title contenders, particularly if they can turn Old Trafford into a ‘fortress’ once more, but admitted: ‘The difficult  season we have experienced was not something that I envisaged.’ With United seventh in the Barclays Premier League — 12 points off a  Champions League place — finding a way of rekindling Van Persie’s stuttering partnership with Wayne Rooney might help, starting at struggling West Bromwich Albion. One person who is leaving United this summer is captain Nemanja Vidic. Moving on: Nemanja Vidic will leave Old Trafford in the summer and join Inter Milan . Inter Milan announced on Thursday that Vidic had agreed to move to the Italian club at the end of the season, and Moyes was annoyed at the timing of the announcement. Moyes said: 'I don't think we like it in this country. I don't think it's something that's done here. 'I can think of [Robert] Lewandowski going to Bayern Munich. I can think of [Mario] Gotze, who went last year between two of the biggest clubs in Germany. It's not something we like in this country, it's done more often elsewhere. 'But it's happened and we'll get on with it. Vida has been a brilliant servant for the club and we'll treat him with all the respect he deserves. I knew about January time that this would probably be his choice.'","David Moyes writes letter of apology to season ticket holders .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:32 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:42 EST, 6 March 2014 . Barack Obama ordered the West's first sanctions in response to Russia's military takeover of Crimea on Thursday, declaring his determination not to let the Kremlin carve up Ukraine. The President asserted that a hastily scheduled referendum on Crimea seceding and becoming part of Russia would violate international law. European leaders announced their own measures but split over how forcefully to follow America's lead. Obama threatened further steps if Russia persists. Laying down the law: President Obama said that America is working in conjunction with international partners but also signed an executive order to levy sanctions on Russia and revoked visas for certain Russian nationals . After announcing his sanctions at midday, Obama emphasized his resolve in a personal telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin later Thursday, the White House said. In a one-hour discussion, Obama affirmed his contention that Russia's actions violate Ukraine's sovereignty. The President told Putin there was still a way to resolve the dispute diplomatically, the White House said,with Russian forces moving back to their base in Crimea, the governments of Ukraine and Russia holding direct talks and international monitors arriving. The U.S. is also calling on Russia to recognize the legitimacy of Ukrainian plans for elections in May, not the Crimean referendum a week from Sunday. In all, signs still pointed to a continuing diplomatic battle over Ukraine and what could prove a broader fault line in Europe's post-Cold War order. While East and West no longer threaten nuclear war and have vastly expanded commercial ties, Russia is determined to dominate the future of the former Soviet republics along its borders. Washington, its NATO partners and others across the continent are striving to pull these nations out of Moscow's orbit. Crisis talks: Obama told President Putin in a telephone call that Russia could still end its takeover in Crimea diplomatically . Underscoring his position, Obama issued an executive action slapping new visa restrictions on Russian and other opponents of Ukraine's government in Kiev and authorizing wider financial penalties against those involved in the military intervention or in stealing state assets. None of the measures appeared aimed at the Russian president personally. 'Today the world can see that the United States is united with our allies and partners in upholding international law and pursuing a just outcome that advances global security and the future that the Ukrainian people deserve,' Obama said at the White House. 'That's what we're going to continue to do in the days to come until we have seen a resolution to this crisis.' Obama hailed U.S. cooperation with the European Union, which imposed its own sanctions on Russia on Thursday. In an emergency meeting in Brussels, EU leaders decided to suspend talks with Putin's government on a wide-ranging economic agreement and on granting Russian citizens visa-free travel within the 28-nation bloc - a long-standing Russian objective. At the same time, Europe's presidents and prime ministers were divided on more drastic steps such as freezing assets and issuing travel bans on Russian officials. On guard: The Crimean parliament called a referendum on March 16 to secede and join Russia but international leaders, including President Obama, says taht is illegal . European hesitancy reflected the reality that targeting influential Russian businessmen or major Russian companies would also harm Europe's economic interests. Russian investors hold assets worth billions in European banks, particularly in Britain and Cyprus, and major exporters such as Germany and the Netherlands have far more at stake than the United States in Russia's consumer economy. Many other European countries depend on Russia for oil and gas supplies. Russian troops have seized control of much of Crimea, where ethnic Russians are the majority. Moscow doesn't recognize the Ukrainian government that came to power after protesters ousted the country's pro-Russian president last month. Putin and other officials have cited strategic interests as well as the protection of ethnic Russians in making the case for intervention. Russia leases a major navy base there. The Western debate over how strongly to penalize Russia is important given that neither the U.S. nor Europe is advocating the use of force. The U.S. military has stepped up joint aviation training with Polish forces and American participation in NATO's air-policing mission in its Baltic countries. But the Pentagon, like its NATO partners, has strictly ruled out military options. President Obama declared that the prospect of a portion of the Ukraine seceding in order to join Russia is against international law. 'We are well beyond the days where borders can be redrawn' without Democratic leaders,' he said at a Thursday press conference in the White House. The President warned that if the Russians would continue in their current path, 'the resolve of the United States and our allies and the international community will remain firm.' Press Secretary Jay Carney followed up by saying that the American government is holding Russia accountable for their role in the ongoing political struggle in the Ukraine. The steps that Russia has taken violates Ukrainian sovereignty and is a breach of international law,' Carney said. The President spoke out strongly against a proposed March 16 referendum that Crimean politicians suggested to vote on whether or not they will secede from Ukraine in order to join Russia. He said that the referendum would 'violate the Ukrainian constitution and violate international law'. Any such referendum, he said, must include representatives from the legitimate Ukrainian government- which was not included in the original plan. Obama also signed an executive order that will allow the U.S. to levy financial sanctions. In a statement, the White House said the penalties would target 'those who are most directly involved in destabilizing Ukraine, including the military intervention in Crimea, and does not preclude further steps should the situation deteriorate.' Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Union announced it was suspending talks with Russia on an economic pact and on a visa deal in response to the Russian intervention in Crimea. EU leaders, like Obama, threatened further sanctions if Russia pushes ahead. Officials in Washington said Russian government officials and entities could be among those sanctioned in the U.S. action, though President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be targeted directly. 'We call on Russia to take the opportunity before it to resolve this crisis through direct and immediate dialogue with the government of Ukraine,' the White House statement read. Control: Soldiers seen in front of the Air Base in Belbek in Crimea on Thursday show the force that Russia has exerted into the area . Ukraine's unrest peaked in February, after months of pro-Western protests seeking the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych in anger over economic woes and corruption. Yanukovych, who is pro-Russian, fled for protection to a location just outside of Moscow, and Putin sent troops into Crimea in a show of force against the upstart government in Kiev. Crimea is a peninsula that hosts a major Russian navy base and is historically and culturally a Russian stronghold. The visa bans will be imposed immediately and come in addition to an earlier State Department decision to deny U.S. entry to those involved in human rights abuses related to political oppression in Ukraine. Officials would not say whether Yanukovych was a target of the visa ban or the sanctions. The sanctions plan, outlined in an executive order, lays the legal groundwork for the Treasury Department to impose financial penalties on offenders. The aim is clearly to punish the separatist movement in Crimea as well as Russia for its decision to send military forces there. Calling legal shots: President Obama said Thursday that it is clear that Russia has violated international law in trying to have Crimea succeed from the Ukraine and reconnect with Russia . Specifically, the sanctions would target people who undermine Ukraine's democracy and new government; threaten the country's peace, security, stability and sovereignty; are linked to misappropriations of government assets; and try to assert governmental authority over any part of Ukraine without the consent of Kiev. They would also prohibit U.S. persons from doing business with those who have been sanctioned. Congress has been rushing to impose hard-hitting sanctions on Russia in response to its takeover of Crimea, hoping Europe will follow the lead of the United States in upping the pressure on Putin's government. The U.S. sanctions push represents a rare case of broad agreement among the Obama administration and Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress. That said, they all are also united in their concern that American economic penalties will mean little without the participation of European countries with far deeper commercial relations with Russia.","Proposed referendum 'violates international law' U.S. President says .
