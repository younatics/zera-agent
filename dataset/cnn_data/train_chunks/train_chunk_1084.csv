"Michael Schumacher is making such good progress in a Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer, a Swiss newspaper has claimed. It has been reported the Formula 1 legend has been improving since he was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to a unit near his Swiss home. The news comes at the same time as reports in Croatian media claiming neurosurgeons who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique have been approached to see if they can help. Scroll down for video . Michael Schumacher (pictured with his wife Corinna) is making such good progress in a Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer, a Swiss newspaper has claimed . Schumacher was transferred to the University Hospital Lausanne, in Switzerland, on June 16 to begin rehabilitation . Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick reported: 'There are signs that Michael will leave the clinic soon and be cared for at home.' Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him, complete with state of the art machines and a seperate building for carers to live in. The newspaper reported that a new building with no outside steps has been constructed on the grounds of the mansion. It is thought that this will be used as the long-term care home for Schumacher. Some experts say that such home-care for a coma patient is unwise. But with an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts. Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month after smashing his head on rocks while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps. Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month after smashing his head on rocks while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps . Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him . It is understood that he remains paralysed and communicates with his wife and children Gina-Maria, 17, and son Mick, 15, by fluttering his eyes. Doctors at the Lausanne clinic hope to have Michael sitting upright in an advanced electronic wheelchair that he can control via his mouth within a few weeks. According to the Croatian media meanwhile, Croatian doctors Darko Chudy and Vedran Deletis, who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique, have been approached to see if they can help. It is believed that the microchip may be able to help him to walk and talk again after his extended period in a coma. It has been reported the Formula 1 legend has been improving since he was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, (pictured) to a unit near his Swiss home . It has been claimed the family of Schumacher made the initial contact with the two doctors from the Croatian capital Zagreb after reports in specialist publications indicating that their technique had already helped other patients. The medics reportedly confirmed when questioned that there had been contact but declined to discuss the case in detail. 'We've had a case with Croat schoolboy and he started to walk after two months,' Doctor Darko Chudy confirmed in a short interview with local media. But he added that he cannot talk about the Schumacher case, other than to confirm that there had been contact and it is believed his technique would be able to help.","Swiss media report the Formula 1 legend 'will leave the clinic soon and could be cared for at home'

"Julian Assange has launched an attack on Google - saying the search giant has turned 'big and bad', and characterizing its chairman Eric Schmidt as a Government agent trying to further U.S. 'imperialist' ambitions. The Wikileaks founder, who is under a Justice Department criminal investigation for leaking thousands of classified diplomatic cables, lashed out at the internet giant in an extract from an upcoming book. Assange, who has spent the past two years claiming asylum to avoid facing rape accusations, also detailed connections between Schmidt and the U.S. establishment and implied Google is acting as a front to enact U.S. foreign policy. Scroll down for video . Attack: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (left) launched an attack on Google, and particularly its chairman and former CEO Eric Schmidt (right) 'Big and bad': Assange said that Google is a 'serious concern' to much of the world due to its power . His attack on the search company came in an extract from his upcoming book, When Google Met Wikileaks, which was published in Newsweek magazine. In a lengthy extract Assange hits out at the friendly image of the company - which has the official motto 'Don't be evil'. Despite its cuddly image and free services, he said, Google's mass harvesting of data and dominance of the internet are cause for 'serious concern' worldwide. He said: 'Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad. But it has. Schmidt’s tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation.' He then listed personal visits by Schmidt to politically sensitive countries, and referred to alleged support from the U.S. Government for him to advance their objectives. He wrote: 'Schmidt’s emergence as Google’s “foreign minister” - making pomp and ceremony state visits across geopolitical fault lines - had not come out of nowhere; it had been presaged by years of assimilation within U.S. establishment networks of reputation and influence. Bolthole: Assange has spent the past two years in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, to which he fled to escape extradition to Sweden over rape accusations . 'On a personal level, Schmidt and Cohen [the other Google executive he met] are perfectly likable people. 'But Google’s chairman is a classic “head of industry” player, with all of the ideological baggage that comes with that role. Schmidt fits exactly where he is: the point where the centrist, liberal and imperialist tendencies meet in American political life.' He later warns of Google's ambitions to become an 'empire' with influence reaching across the world. Assange wrote: 'Google is steadily becoming the Internet for many people. 'Its influence on the choices and behavior of the totality of individual human beings translates to real power to influence the course of history... 'If the future of the Internet is to be Google, that should be of serious concern to people all over the world - in Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, the former Soviet Union and even in Europe - for whom the Internet embodies the promise of an alternative to U.S. cultural, economic, and strategic hegemony.' 'A “don’t be evil” empire is still an empire.' MailOnline has contacted Google for a response to Assange's claims. The publication comes as he awaits a decision tomorrow from Swedish prosecutors over whether the international arrest warrant against him will be dropped. Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, England, since 2012 after he claimed asylum to avoid being taken to Sweden, where police want to question him over alleged sexual molestation and rape. He claims the accusations are a trumped-up attempt to get him into a position where he can be extradited to the United States to face trial over leaking Government documents - though he has never been charged.","Wikileaks founder launched attack on search giant and its chairman .

"Julian Assange fears he is being bugged at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Lawyers claim the WikiLeaks founder, who has been holed up in the embassy for the past two years to avoid extradition to Sweden, ‘is most likely under auditory surveillance’. Last year a covert listening device was found behind a plug socket in the ambassador’s office, but security experts described it as rudimentary and unlikely to have been the work of police or the security services. Scroll down for video . Listening device: Julian Assange pictured inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London . Mr Assange’s new eavesdropping claim was included in a court submission last week in which his lawyers argue his confinement is a ‘deprivation of liberty’ under European law. Among other reasons, they cite his cramped living conditions which mean he ‘cannot carry out his professional duties in a normal fashion’. The 43-year-old has lived at the embassy since Ecuador gave him asylum in 2012. The Government wants to extradite him to Sweden under a European Arrest Warrant where he faces questioning over allegations of sexual molestation and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the country in 2010. No charges have been brought because he has not been interrogated by police regarding allegations by the second of the two women. Mr Assange says if he is sent to Sweden he will be extradited to the US, where he could face 35 years in prison for publishing on WikiLeaks classified documents related to US activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy, above, in London since 2012, when the UK decided to extradite him to Sweden where he is wanted on charges of sexual assault . Police officers stationed outside the embassy round the clock – in an operation that has so far cost £7 million – are under orders to arrest him if he tries to leave. In the submission to the Swedish Court of Appeal on Friday, his lawyers ask that text messages – which they believe suggest there was no basis for his arrest – be handed to the defence. They were sent by one of his accusers and Assange claims they show that she was ambiguous about his arrest and even opposed to it. His lawyers also argue that to ‘break the deadlock’, he should be questioned at the embassy in Knightsbridge, rather than in Sweden. They note the Swedish authorities have made no effort to arrange this. ‘Residence in the embassy is, in other words, a result of the deprivation of liberty imposed on Assange by Sweden,’ says the claim . His lawyers also point out that his embassy confinement is already nearly as long as the ‘maximum sentence for the suspected crime’. And they suggest that ‘should he be forced to seek hospital care he will lose his political asylum and will be arrested’. However, they do not mention the serious heart and lung conditions he is said to have developed since his incarceration.","Lawyers claim the 43-year-old ‘is most likely under auditory surveillance’

"A Premier League club has played the unlikely role of matchmaker to help a bashful fan meet the 'unreal looking girl' seated in front of him. The Southampton supporter, known only as Timothy, was too shy to speak to the pretty brunette himself so went to the club for help. Determined to assist the shy supporter, the club placed a red rose on his seat to help break the ice between the pair. Scroll down for video . The Southampton supporter known as Timothy tweeted this picture after the club left flowers on his seat . Timothy, pictured far left, sits behind the 'unreal looking' Saints fan (far right and looking in his direction) Timothy, pictured with his sister, arranges the roses before giving them to the fellow supporter . After he contacted them on Twitter, the club left the flowers complete with a 'good luck' message for Timothy . A supporter took a picture of the pair together inside the St Mary's Stadium, with the girl clutching the flowers . The plucky Southampton fan began the campaign to try and get to know the girl seated in front of him . He described the fellow supporter as an 'unreal looking' girl who keeps 'giving me (the) eyes' Southampton FC stepped in and advised the supporter on how he should proceed to win over the girl . The fan was shocked to have received relationship advice from his football club . He planned to approach the girl during the home match against Chelsea on December 28 but could not make the match when his car broke down . He abandoned the plan until the  match against Arsenal and got support from Saints legend Matt Le Tissier . He gave her the flowers and Bovril and tweeted a selfie of the grinning pair from inside the St Mary's stadium . Supporter Kelly Morse snapped a picture of the pair with the caption 'she got the flowers' The club said they were 'proud' of Tim after he gave the girl the rose and Bovil they put on his seat . Initially Timothy contacted the club's official Twitter account asking if they would him tell him the name of the girl, who sits near him at St Mary's Stadium. But the Premier League outfit replied saying this would not be possible due to data protection laws. Instead, staff at the south coast side - who sit in fourth place in the league table - hatched a  plan. Southampton mascot 'Sammy Saint' did his bit for lovestruck Timothy by leaving a rose and Bovril voucher on his seat and wishing him good luck ahead of yesterday's 2-0 victory over Arsenal. And after the game Timothy tweeted: 'Thank you to Southampton FC. She didn't like the Bovril but loved the flowers!' The romantic tale began when the Southampton fan wrote to the club asking if they could tell him who the girl was who was 'giving him the eyes'. He tweeted: 'Unreal looking girl that sits 4 seats next to me that keeps giving me eyes. Can you tell me who sits in Block 24 seat 626?' Timothy gave the girl the flowers and Bovil during Southampton's match against Arsenal that they won 2-0 . Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic leaps in the air after scoring the second goal in the match against Arsenal . This prompted Southampton fan Gary Brant to step in as he urged Timothy to man up and simply speak to her. Gary wrote: 'Why don't you just speak to her next game?' The club replied the day after Southampton's 3-0 over Everton on December 20: 'We're with Gary. Christmas is the time to tell people how you really feel - maybe you should've done it yesterday?' He appeared to take this advice and intended to speak to her during the Chelsea match on December 28, but his plans were dashed when his car broke down - meaning his missed the game. Timothy wrote: 'My car broke down on the way, didn't make the game. Maybe a New Year's Day halftime shout out?' Spurred on with support from Saints icon Matt Le Tisser, Timothy gave her the flower and the voucher before taking a selfie of the pair at the stadium. After the match, the club tweeted: 'We're proud of you. Our work here is done. #WellDoneTim' Do you know Timothy or his date?

"Osama Bin Laden fathered four children while on the run in Pakistan in the nine years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to his youngest wife while skipping from safe house to safe house among family. 'I can only begin to imagine that that . looked like American reality TV,' Phil Mudd who helped lead the CIA's . hunt for Bin Laden told ABC. 'That he was living in some version of the . Kardashians in Abbottabad.' During that time, the former Al Qaeda . leader moved between five safe houses and at least two of the four children . were born in a government hospital, his former-wife Amal Ahmad Abdul Fateh said. Home: Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden fathered four children while on the run in Pakistan in the nine years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to his youngest wife, with one of his safe houses in Islamabad shown . Replication: A member of the CIA team that helped track down Bin Laden described his compounds as being comparable to a living version of the reality show the Kardashians in Abbottabad . On the run: The graphic shows Amal and Osama bin Laden's whereabouts from 200o to the SEAL raid in 2011 . Speaking to Pakistani investigators, the 30-year-old woman has painted the picture after providing the most detailed account of her husband's life as the world's most wanted man. It is likely to heap further embarrassment on Pakistan, after U.S. Navy SEALs killed Bin Laden in a secret raid on his compound in Abbottabad last May. 'The United States was doing what came easy to it: looking in rural areas while he was in nice homes in big cities,' Richard Clarke, a former White House counter-terrorism adviser told ABC News. 2000 - Osama Bin Laden marries his fifth wife, Amal. She joins the Al Qaeda leader and his extended family at his farm base near Kandahar in Afghanistan. 2001 - Amal gives birth to Safia, the couple's first child, in Kandahar. The attacks on the U.S. on September 11 cause the Bin Laden family to 'scatter'. Amal  is forced to stay in various homes in Karachi, Pakistan, for the nine months after 9/11. 2002 - Amal leaves Karachi for the city of Peshawar, where she reunites with her husband. From there, the Bin Laden family flees into the rural mountain areas of north-west Pakistan. 2003 - The family moves to a rented house in the small town of Haripur, where they stay for two years. Amal gives birth to a girl, Aasia, in  a government hospital. 2004 - Ibrahim, the couple's third child, is born in the same government hospital. 2005 - The Bin Ladens move to a compound in the garrison town of Abbottabad. They will live there for the remainder of the terrorist leader's life. On October 8, an earthquake strikes . north-west Pakistan, killing 73,000 people. American aid is transported . to the region in Chinook helicopters that fly directly . over the terror leader's Abbottabad hideout on their way to the . disaster zone. 2006 - Amal givers birth to another girl, Zainab. 2008 - The couple welcomes a second son, Hussain. 2011 - U.S. Navy SEALs raid the Abbottabad compound on May 2, killing Bin Laden. Amal and two other wives are taken into custody. Amal's account of Bin Laden's post-9/11 life begins in late 2001, when the terrorist mastermind fled Afghanistan and into Pakistan, up until his death aged 54. Amal was arrested by Pakistani security officials following the U.S. raid alongside two of Bin Laden's other wives and her five children. It is thought that she was shot by a Navy SEAL while trying to protect her husband. The three widows hold potentially vital information for Western security forces - as well as shining light on how Bin Laden managed to evade justice for so long. They are currently under house arrest in Islamabad. A transcript of an interrogation of Amal by Pakistani officials in January was published in Pakistani newspaper Dawn yesterday. It reveals that Amal wed Bin Laden in 2000 out of her 'desire of marrying a mujahid', or 'Holy warrior'. In late 2000, she joined the terrorist . and his wives at his farm base near Kandahar in Afghanistan before the . attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001 caused the Bin Laden family to . 'scatter'. Safia, Amal's first child with the Al Qaeda leader, was born in Kandahar that year. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, she stayed in various homes in Karachi, Pakistan, for around nine months. On the run: Osama Bin Laden's youngest widow Amal (right) has provided Pakistani investigators with the most detailed account yet of the terrorist leader's life as the world's most wanted man . In mid-2002, she left Karachi for the large city of Peshawar, where she was reunited with her husband. From . there, the Bin Laden family fled into the rural mountain areas of . north-west Pakistan, first staying in the Shangla district in Swat, just . 80 miles away from Islamabad. In 2003, they moved to a rented house in small town of Haripur, even closer to the capital, where they stayed for two years. During their time there, Amal gave . birth to a girl, Aasia, in 2003 and a boy, Ibrahim, in 2004. Both were . born in a government hospital. It was from there, in 2005, that Bin Laden made the move to Abbottabad where he lived until his death in May 2011. Home: Bin Laden's three wives and two daughters lived with him in the Abbottabad hideout just 200 yards from a military base which was raided last year . Going, going, gone: The compound was destroyed last year to prevent it from becoming a pilgrimage . Zainab, a girl, and Hussain, a boy, were born in the garrison town in 2006 and 2008. Frustratingly for the West, it appears that the U.S. came tantalisingly close to capturing Bin Laden. In late 2005, an earthquake struck north-west Pakistan, killing 73,000 people. American aid was transported to the region in Chinook helicopters that Amal claims flew directly over the terror leader's Abbottabad compound on their way to the disaster zone. The report also recommends that Bin Laden's three widows be deported to Saudia Arabia and Yemen, but the Pakistani government has instead decided to prosecute the women and two of the terrorist's adult children.the country’s elite military academy.","Two of the four children were born in a government hospital .

"Musician-come-author Daryl Davis has revealed how he came to embed himself with members of the Ku Klux Klan. The 54-year-old lecturer became fascinated with racism in the United States as a child living overseas. With parents in the foreign service, he was raised in integrated schools all over the world and was used to multiculturalism. 'Every time I would come back (to the US,) I would see people separated by race,' he explains in a new interview with The Guardian Express. 'When my father was telling me about (the KKK) at the age of 10 it didn’t make any sense to me. 'I had always gotten along with everyone.' Pioneer: Daryl Davis plays the blues at the 17th annual Bluebird Blues Festival. Davis has been lauded for his work in breaking down divides between black people the Ku Klux Klan . In 1983 Davis - who is friends with Jerry Lee Lewis and has performed for Bill Clinton - was playing country western music in an all-white lounge. Following his set, a man approached him praising his music, saying it was the first time he had heard a black man play as well as Lewis. The two sat down to talk and the man told Davis he was in the KKK. 'At first, I thought ‘why the hell am I sitting with him?’ Davis said. 'But we struck up a friendship and it was music that brought us together,' he says. Little did Davis know at the time, this man would be the key to his future endeavors. Eight ears later Davis decided to write a book examining the Ku Klux Klan and managed to track his friend down. 'I went to his apartment unannounced,' Davis says. 'He opens the door and sees me, and he says ''Daryl! What are you doing here?'' 'He stepped out of his apartment and I stepped in. He said ‘what’s going on man? Are you still playing?’ 'I said ‘I need to talk to you about the Klan'.' At first the man refused to cooperate, saying it would put Davis in danger, but eventually he handed over the information of Roger Kelly, who was the leader of the KKK in Maryland. The man warned Davis to meet Kelly in a public place out of safety. Davis had his secretary set up a meeting, instructing her to not tell Kelly he was black. 'I knew enough about the mentality of the Klan that they would never think a white woman would work for a black man,' he said. Daryl Davis has explained how he began befriending members of the KKK, which eventually lead to the dismantlement of some factions and at least 20 members dis-robing and leaving the Hooded Order . The pair met a hotel, with the secretary fetching an ice bucket with sodas. The meeting was 'fraught with tension from the start' after Kelly arrived with a nighthawk - an armed bodyguard dressed in military fatigues. 'I saw the apprehension (when Kelly realized I'm black) so I got up and walked over and said ''Hi Mr. Kelly, come on in''. 'He shook my hand, the bodyguard shook my hand, and they came in. Mr. Kelly sits down and the bodyguard stands at his right. 'He asked for identification and I handed him my drivers’ license. He says ''oh you live on Flack Street in Silver Spring'’. 'Well, I didn’t need him coming to my house and burning a cross or whatever, and here he is calling off my street address. 'I wanted to let him know not to come to my house so I said ‘yes, and you live at…’ and I said his street address. 'I made it clear-’let’s confine our visit to this hotel room.’ 'But I had no reason to be concerned. One of his Klan members lived right down the street from me. It was coincidence.' The interview began and each time Davis reached into his bag to get a new cassette for his voice recorder, the bodyguard would reach for his gun. Davis said the man relaxed 'after a little while'. But that's when the trouble started. 'After about an hour, there was a very loud, strange noise which was ominous, and I was apprehensive. 'In the back of my mind, I heard my friend in my head saying ''Mr. Kelly will kill you''. 'I stood up and slammed my hands on the table, and I felt my life was in danger. 'When my hands hit the table, my eyes locked with his, and he could read them. We stared into each others eyes. 'The bodyguard was looking back and forth at us, but then my secretary Mary realized what had happened. 'The ice bucket had melted and the cans of soda shifted, and that’s what made the noise! 'We all began laughing at how stupid we all had been. 'In retrospect, it was a very important lesson that was taught. 'All because a foreign entity of which we were ignorant, entered into our comfort zone, we became fearful of each other. 'The lesson learned is: ignorance breeds fear. If you don’t keep that fear in check, that fear will breed hatred. 'If you don’t keep hatred in check it will breed destruction.' The situation made way for a friendship with Kelly, which lead Kelly to start relationships with about 20 other KKK members. He has collected about that many robes and hoods that were given to him by members who left the Klan after meeting him. Davis is credited with dismantling the Maryland KKK because the group's structure 'fell apart' after he began making inroads with the men. Davis said he would simply challenge the many misconceptions Klansmen had about black people as a result of brainwashing. In one circumstance, a member told him that 'all black people had a gene that makes them violent'. He countered by saying that 'all white people have a gene that makes them serial killers. 'He said ''that's stupid'' and I said it's just as stupid as what you said to me. He was very quiet after that and I know it was sinking in,' Davis said. Davis also became close with Robert White, a leader in the KKK known as a Grand Dragon. 'I respect someone’s right to air their views whether they are wrong or right,' Davis said. 'Robert White was a Grand Dragon who had gone to prison numerous times. 'I said I wanted to interview him for my book. 'At first, he was very violent and very hateful but we talked for a long time. 'Over time, he began thinking about a lot of things he had done and said that were wrong. 'He quit the Klan. 'Toward the end he said he would follow me to hell and back ... and he gave me his robe and hood.' All these relationships and experiences have been documented in Davis' book, Klan-Destine Relationships, in which he concludes that the best way to break down barriers and improve race relations is for people who disagree to sit down and talk. 'Invite your enemy to talk - give them a platform to talk because then they will reciprocate,' he said. 'Invite your enemies to sit down and join you. 'One small thing you say might give them food for though, and you will learn. 'Establish dialogue. It’s when the talking stops that the ground becomes fertile for fighting. 'When two enemies are talking, they're not fighting.'","Daryl Davis is a respected musician who became fascinated by racism as a child .

Police were called to the Bel Air Nightclub in the grounds of the upmarket Warwickshire resort at 12.50am today after a 21-year-old man was knifed in the chest. Officers arrested a 26-year-old man on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm but further violence then broke out. Six people were stabbed during an incident at a nightclub at the Belfry Golf Club which hosted the Ryder Cup . One man aged 28 remains in a critical condition following the incident on New Year's Eve at The Belfry . Police have arrested three men in connection with the violent incidents who are all from Birmingham . Another five victims suffered stab wounds - with a 28-year-old man remaining in a critical condition while four others aged between 20 and 27 have been released from hospital. The initial 21-year-old victim underwent surgery and is not believe to be in a critical condition. As well as the 26-year-old man, police arrested a 22-year-old on suspicion of assault while a 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. The trio, all from nearby Birmingham, remain in police custody  and are being quizzed by detectives. Superintendent Adrian McGee, of Warwickshire Police, said: 'This is the early stages of the investigation and at this time officers are still in the process of piecing together what has happened. 'This was a very challenging disorder for our officers to control on what was a very busy night for the force, and I am grateful for the work they conducted and bravery they showed last night in bringing order to this incident. 'Enquiries are being completed to identify the individuals who are responsible for the varied assaults. 'The management at the Belfry are assisting in bringing an understanding to the events of last night. 'We would urge anyone who was inside, or in the vicinity of, the nightclub during the time of these incidents who has information to assist the inquiry to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 24 of January 1st, 2015.' The Bel Air Nightclub has undergone a £1.2 million refurbishment and was holding a Masquerade-style ball . Taking to Twitter, one eyewitness said: 'It turned into some mad movie scene at the Belfry last night, what on earth was happening.' Another reveller added: 'Asif there was 6 stabbings up the belfry last night, I seen it all kicking off but didn't think it was that bad.' And @iampennell-app said: 'Felt like I was in the Bronx last night rather than The Belfry.. Nothing like a mob of Police and Ambulances to see in the New Year eh.' Bosses at the five-star Belfry said the golf resort, in Wishaw, Warks., remained open for business as usual on New Year's Day. But customers were unable to access the site through the main gates on Lichfield Road and a car park nearby remained sealed off with police tape yesterday (Thur). David Edwards, general manager at the hotel said: 'It is business as usual at the Belfry, we had a very successful New Year's Eve at the hotel. 'There was an incident, police have been on the site this morning and we are co-operating with their enquiries.' The 'Nude Years Eve' party at the Bel Air Nightclub - which has recently had a £1.2million refurbishment - was advertised on the Belfry website as a ticket-only event. The dress code for the party was 'Masquerade - smart attire' and the club, which is a separate venue in the hotel grounds, only allows entry to over-20s. The event, described as a 'Nude Years Eve Masquerade Ball' was sold out .

"Even on the front line of a perilous conflict, Anderson Cooper remains prolific in his tweets - and no less sharp-tongued. The CNN anchor is constantly updating followers as he remains on the Gaza frontline of the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict today. His reporting has been criticized by some Twitter users. One follower Pamela Weiss told Cooper to 'report a fair story' and write about rockets being fired from Gaza as well as Israeli air strikes. Cooper responded to self-described 'foodie' Mrs Weiss: 'Perhaps spend less time tweeting about coconut flan and more time actually following the news.' Scroll down for video .

Anderson Cooper had this Twitter exchange with Pamela Weiss while he covered developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Sweet revenge: Cooper picked out this tweet to give Pamela Weiss some sass following her criticism of his Middle East reporting . The journalist engaged in another spat with Rabbi Loren Sykes today. Cooper tweeted that six men accused of being 'Israeli spies' were dragged through the streets of Gaza City by men on motorcycles after being executed. He also attached a picture of the horrific scenes. The rabbi tweeted: 'May just stop watching #CNN. Now @andersoncooper almost apologizing for #Hamas dragging a dead ""Spy"" for #Israel & yelling God is great! Oy.' To which Cooper fired back: '@Rabbi_Sykes excuse me, but how am I apologizing for Hamas by reporting them dragging a body through the streets? That is deeply offensive.' Several of the messages have since been deleted. Cooper spoke today from Gaza for a pre-recorded version of his Thanksgiving chat show Anderson Live. War of words: Cooper engaged with another critic via his official Twitter account . He talked to Andy Cohen and Kyle Richards who have been standing in while he remains in the Middle East to cover the developing conflict. When asked about his Twitter trolls, Cooper said: 'You spend hours in the bureau doing live shots and reporting and then there is a lot of down time in between live shots and you're waiting for something to happen. So I spend a lot of time just on Twitter reading people's tweets, responding to people and most of them are really nice. Conflict: Cooper, pictured two days ago, has been on the front line of the escalating crisis . He added: 'If I tweet something about an outgoing rocket firing towards Israel, they will say that I'm Pro Israeli. If I tweet about a bomb blast here that killed people in Gaza city they will say that I am Pro Hamas, it's a very difficult situation. 'On Twitter it's very easy for people to make ridiculous claims so I've started tweeting back. Last night I was up for many hours so I think I maybe got a little mean.' He added that he 'kind of felt bad' after his tweet to Mrs Weiss about her enjoyment of a Paula Deen flan recipe. Cooper has been prolific on Twitter in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - even during a close call when a rocket exploded just a few blocks from where he was reporting live.

"Temba Bavuma has become the first black African batsman to play for South Africa when he came into bat at No 6 in the second Test against the West Indies at St. George's Park on Sunday. With Quinton de Kock ruled out of the remainder of the three-match series with an ankle ligament injury, Bavuma took his place in the Proteas line-up, but did not get a chance to bat until day three due to bad weather. The 24-year-old's debut is a big deal for South Africa, which has fielded only five black African players since readmission in 1991, and has not had any since fast bowler Makhaya Ntini's last Test at the end of 2009. Temba Bavuma plays a defensive shot during his debut, a significant milestone for South African cricket . Bavuma was out for 10, after Shannon Gabriel had him caught behind with a vicious rising delivery . Temba Bavuma made his Test debut for South Africa against the West Indies in the Boxing Day Test Match . However, the occassion proved to be something of an anti-climax as Bavuma lasted just 35 balls, before gloving a sharp, lifting delivery behind to depart for 10. Despite the fact that almost 80 percent of South Africa's population is black, Ntini is the only cricketer to have held down a regular place in the national side, taking 390 wickets in 101 Tests. Fast bowlers Monde Zondeki, Mfuneko Ngam and Lonwabo Tsotsobe, and wicketkeeper Thami Tsolekile, all managed a combined 17 Tests. 'I've come to realise that there are a lot of people out there that I represent - I'm not just playing for myself,' Bavuma said on Wednesday. 'I am aware, but it doesn't really change the ballgame for me.' Born in Langa, Cape Town's oldest township, Bavuma was educated at a leading cricket school in Johannesburg, and played for South Africa Under-19s. Bavuma is the first black African to play for South Africa as a specialist batsman . The 24-year-old, who has a first class average of almost 36, says he is representing more than himself . Makhaya Ntini is the most famous non-white South African cricketer, having played over 100 tests . He has forged a successful first-class career, scoring 3,631 runs at an average of almost 36, and hit a career-best 162 against Australia A during a South Africa A tour in August. South Africa made one other change to the side that thrashed the West Indies by an innings and 220 runs in the first test to take into account the different conditions in Port Elizabeth. The Proteas fielded an all-seam attack at Centurion, but the St. George's Park pitch is traditionally drier and slower, and so legspinner Imran Tahir replaced fast bowler Kyle Abbott. Left-armer Robin Peterson, who was the original spinner in the squad, was ruled out of the series after splitting his left index finger during a training drill on Tuesday. Bavuma is likely to bat at number 7 for South Africa, who lead the West Indies 1-0 in the three-match series .","Temba Bavuma comes in for injured Quinton de Kock .

"India batsmen Ajinkya Rahane and Virat Kohli struck inspired centuries during a record fourth-wicket partnership at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday to help India claw their way back into the third test against Australia on day three. The pair united with India vulnerable at 147-3 in the morning and were finally separated at 409-4 after tea, having creamed 262 runs off Australia's hapless bowlers before spinner Nathan Lyon had Rahane trapped lbw for 147. Kohli, enjoying an outstanding series with three centuries, pushed on to 169 before he was dismissed courtesy of wicketkeeper Brad Haddin's second brilliant catch of the day. Virat Kohli celebrates after reaching his century as India fought back against Australia in Melbourne . Kohli (right) and Ajinkya Rahane put on a fourth-wicket partnership of 262 runs to frustrate Australia . Rahane hits out during his innings of 147 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as Brad Haddin looks on . Rahane bats as a seagull flies past him as India closed to within 68 runs of Australia's mammoth total . His wicket brought stumps, with Mohammed Shami nine not out and India having reached 462-8, trailing Australia's mammoth first innings total of 530 by 68 runs with two wickets in hand. Kohli lost three batting partners in quick succession, with debutant Lokesh Rahul holing out for three, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni lasting 11 runs and spinner Ravichandran Ashwin dismissed for a duck. Though Australia fought back admirably late in the session, they had no answers to the brilliance of Kohli and Rahane for over four hours, the pair lashing 39 boundaries between them on a warm, sunny day. Australia's main strike bowler Mitchell Johnson came in for some special punishment, leaching 27 runs in two overs after tea as his short-pitched assault was dismissed with arrogance. Nathan Lyon eventually claimed the wicket of Rahane, trapping him lbw for 147 . Virat Kohli dives into his crease during his innings of 169 as India chased Australia's big total of 530 . Mitchell Johnson and Virat Kohli exchange words on what was a largely frustrating day for the bowlers . Kohli had been knocked to the ground as Johnson took a shy at the stumps . Kohli pulled Johnson to the fence three times in one of the overs to have the large Indian contingent in the crowd of 42,000 roaring their approval. The ICC Cricketer of the Year ultimately had Kohli caught behind but he ended the day with the ugly figures of 1-133. Australia had earlier taken two wickets in the first hour, but would rue two dropped catches in the middle session that could have ended Kohli and Rahane's stand much earlier. Lyon contrived to spill the simplest of catches off his own bowling to reprieve Rahane on 70, while Watson grounded a sharp chance at first slip to grant Kohli a life before tea. It took umpire Kumar Dharmasena's intervention to split the pair, the Sri Lankan raising his finger for lbw when Rahane missed a sweep-shot, though replays suggested the middle order batsman may have been hard done by.

Rahul lasted a flighty eight balls, dropped on the seventh by substitute fielder Peter Siddle at midwicket after an unsightly slog, only to be caught on the next Lyon delivery at backward square leg by Josh Hazlewood courtesy of another appalling stroke. Dhoni survived for a streaky 11 before feathering an edge off Ryan Harris through to Haddin, and the bulky paceman caught Ashwin off his own bowling soon after. Haddin earlier notched his 250th dismissal with a brilliant, diving catch to remove Pujara for 25 on the second ball of the day, having dropped him on 12 late on day two. Australia lead the four-match series 2-0 after wins in Adelaide and Brisbane and can seal it in Melbourne with a draw.","Virat Kohli hit 169 and Ajinkya Rahane 147 to keep India in contention .

"Apology: Yodel's boss Dick Stead said he was sorry to customers for thousands of parcel delays . The boss of one of the UK's biggest delivery firms has been forced to make an apology over delays that left thousands of consumers fearing their parcels may not arrive in time for Christmas. The unprecedented rise in internet shopping had led to a huge backlog and some couriers are expecting to work until 9pm tonight to deliver as many packages as possible. Yodel - which delivers up to a million parcels a day at Christmas for firms including online retailer Amazon - had to stop collecting packages ten days ago due to high demand. But the backlog was cleared within two days and then deliveries continued as normal. Last week the firm's executive chairman Dick Stead said problems had been sorted. But last night he was forced to apologise. He told the Daily Mirror: 'Unfortunately delays on some parcels are inevitable for a number of reasons, whatever the time of year, regardless of carrier or service they are sent on. 'These can include address queries, poor packaging, mislabelling, traffic incidents and inaccessible properties.' He said parcels were flowing through Yodel's sorting offices and they would continue to deliver this evening and would begin again on Saturday. But when it came to possible compensation, he advised customers to check with retailers because 'we do not have sight of their transaction or agreement'. He added shoppers should check last order delivery dates with retailers to get a better idea of when their package might arrive. 'We apologise to anyone whose parcels have been delayed', he said. A spokesman for the company confirmed today that all parcels due to be delivered before Christmas were now either already delivered or out for delivery today. Scroll down for video . Records: The firm struggled to cope with a record year of online Christmas spending, including Black Friday . In a further statement issued today, Mr Stead said: ‘Following reports in a variety of publications this morning regarding a build-up of parcels in the carrier industry, we would like to reassure both our clients and their customers that Yodel has no backlog. ‘We have been delivering around a million parcels a day in the run up to Christmas. Our sort and service centres are working to plan and all parcels that are due to be delivered before Christmas are out for delivery today. ‘Deliveries will continue, as usual, until 9pm and all parcels can be tracked on myyodel.co.uk. Anyone requiring further assistance can contact our customer services, who are available on webchat and social media until 10pm tonight, as well as via telephone until 6pm.’ Brand strategy agency Mash said Yodel risked alienating customers if it failed to pay out for missing delivery deadlines. Co-founder Jonathan Williams said: 'In times of crisis it could be the making of a brand if they are seen to act appropriately. Reassurance: Yodel said on their Twitter feed today that it had no backlog, although this statement was met with a chorus of disapproval from customers . 'If a company has let people down then this could present an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to their consumers.' The Centre for Retail Research says 2014 has seen a record amount of online spending. Around £810million was spent by online shoppers on Black Friday last month. Cyber Monday three days later saw more than £650million spent. Following the surge in orders, Royal Mail opened ten temporary Christmas parcel sorting centres and hired an extra 19,000 temporary staff. A spokesman said: 'All our postmen and women have been working very hard to help deliver Christmas for our customers. We believe our network has coped well with the significant extra volume at this time.' Rise in internet shopping: Yodel - which delivers up to a million parcels a day at Christmas for firms including online retailer Amazon (pictured) - had to stop collecting packages ten days ago due to high demand . Last month, Yodel also came under fire after dozens of ceramic poppies planted at the Tower of London to commemorate those who died during the First World War arrived at customers' homes broken into pieces. Disappointed customers who bought one of the £25 red blooms - designed to represent an individual British or Colonial death - were faced with missing parts, smashed petals and shattered edges as the ceramic flowers arrived on their doorsteps. In one shocking incident, a courier was caught hurling a poppy package 25ft over a garden fence when he was unable to reach the customer's front door. Yodel, which has been employed by the Historic Royal Palaces to deliver the packages, apologised and said at the time that any workers not treating the parcels with respect would be disciplined. Less than half of the people who ordered a poppy are still to receive it, with about 300,000 delivered in time for Christmas, out of the vast majority of the 888,246 total earmarked for public sale. The new retail ombudsman, who takes up his role on January 2, has urged shoppers ordering online that they should always ask the retailer to confirm in writing when the goods will arrive. Dean Dunham said retailers' contracts with consumers are broken when a promised delivery date is not fulfilled, meaning customers can claim a full refund and ask for compensation in some cases.","Firm delivers up to a million parcels a day including for Amazon .

"England head coach Stuart Lancaster is hoping the comforts of home might help to bring a little normality to his quest for World Cup glory in 2015. Lancaster is well aware of the pressure he and his players will be under as the hosts attempt to lift the Webb Ellis trophy for just the second time. However, he is hoping a break from the intensity of the competition could prove crucial to their chances of success on home soil. England head coach Stuart Lancaster at the unveiling of the 2015 World Cup sign on Newcastle's Tyne Bridge . Lancaster believes England players can benefit by 'switching off' during a world cup on home soil . Lancaster, who was speaking in host city Newcastle as he marked the start of World Cup year, said: 'It's quite hard for all of us to understand the impact. 'The event this evening, just speaking to the guys about the interest in Newcastle on an evening like this probably brings it all home, so when the clock ticks to 2015, for all of us life will be different. 'But the one thing I would also say is I remember reading an article when I was in New Zealand in 2011 that Dan Carter had written about the advantages of being in a home World Cup where actually, whilst the intense scrutiny in massive and the pressure is huge in terms of home expectation, you can get home. Ben Morgan (No 8) celebrates with team-mates after scoring a try for England against Australia in November . 'You can get out of the bubble of the World Cup, on your day off, you can actually physically go home, you can see family and friends and have a bit of normality in your life, so actually being in England in one way raises expectation, but in another way, allows the players to get a little bit of normality as well. 'I know when I arrived in 2011 in New Zealand, it's a long way from home when you are in the middle of that intense period, so that's one thing to our advantage, and obviously just having the home support as well will be a huge thing for us.'

"Dimuth Karunaratne's maiden Test hundred helped Sri Lanka fight back against New Zealand, but their position still looks grim as they followed on in Christchurch. The tourists, bowled out for 138 on Saturday in reply to New Zealand's 441, made a much better go of their second innings as Karunaratne - out for a duck in the first innings - made 152 to help them to 293 for five at the close of day three, still 10 runs behind. New Zealand will remain confident of securing a positive result in this first of two Tests, however, after late wickets from Trent Boult - including that of Karunaratne - swung the momentum back the way of the Black Caps. Dimuth Karunaratne celebrates after reaching his maiden Test century for Sri Lanka against New Zealand . Karunaratne hit 152 to keep the tourists in contention as they followed-on in Christchurch . New Zealand celebrate the wicket of Sri Lanka's Niroshan Dickwella for just two runs . Sri Lanka resumed on 84 without loss, with Karunaratne on 49. However, they lost Kaushal Silva before he could add to his overnight 33. Tim Southee's scrambled seam delivery found an outside edge and the ball flew into the gloves of BJ Watling. Kumar Sangakkara quickly followed, making just one before he too edged behind, this time off Boult. However, Sri Lanka rebuilt thanks to a watchful innings from Lahiru Thirimanne, who helped Karunaratne negotiate a difficult period. Survival was the priority as the game slowed, but Karunaratne continued to creep towards three figures. Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews celebrates his half-century on day three - he finished on 53 not out . Lahiru Thirimanne hits out during day three - his 25 came off a pedestrian 124 balls . He made it with a thick outside edge past gully for two off Boult, and by the time Thirimanne fell victim to an excellent diving catch from the wicketkeeper off James Neesham, Sri Lanka had moved on to 181. Thirimanne's 25 came off 124 balls. AD Mathews came in and showed a more aggressive streak, soon hitting Mark Craig for six, and the scoring rate picked up. Karunaratne brought up 150 with a four off Boult but the New Zealand paceman had his revenge two overs later, his delivery swinging back in to deceive the Sri Lankan who was clean bowled. His 152 was the highest score by a Sri Lankan while following on. Mathews made the close on 53 not out, but after Boult removed Nishan Dickwella, who edged into the slips for four late in the day, New Zealand could feel much better about their day's work, with plenty of time left to secure a result.

"Trainer Willie Mullins says unbeaten Faugheen will arrive at the starting line for the williamhill.com Christmas Hurdle a much fitter horse than the one which extended his unbeaten record to seven races with an easy three and a half length win in the Coral Hurdle at Ascot last month. Ireland’s champion trainer also believes that Ruby Walsh’s mount will also have no problem with the two-mile Kempton test, one of the sharpest examinations of speed a hurdler can face. Jockey Ruby Walsh says Faugheen will have no problem with the two-mile Kempton test . Faugheen, whose opponents include Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Irving, won the two-mile Grade One novices’ hurdle at Punchestown in April but every other time he has raced over hurdles it has been over further. Over Christmas last year at Limerick, he won at three miles. He landed the two mile five furlong Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle at last season’s Cheltenham Festival and the Coral Hurdle is over two miles three furlongs. Mullins said: ‘It is another big step up for him. We are going into Irving’s home ground — a flat right-handed track will suit him but he is in good order. ‘A lot of the time we raced over a longer trip because we were keeping him apart from the other horses (like Supreme Novices’ Hurdle winner Vautour). I knew he would stay but I knew he could come back in trip all right. Faugheen will take on Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Irving in the Christmas Hurdle . ‘This year he has come back a hundred weight heavier. I was really worried with the size of him when he went over to Ascot. Dan Skelton, who stood in for me, passed a remark to Ruby that he had never saddled a horse to win a race like that which was as fat as he was. ‘If he can do that with that sort condition on him, there must be huge improvement for him for the rest of the season.’ Faugheen is 4-9 to win the Christmas Hurdle and 2-1 to win the Champion Hurdle despite the impressive performances of The New One in Britain. Mullins admitted that Faugheen’s swift elevation to being regarded as one of the most exciting horse in jump racing has wrong-footed him. He added: ‘He has surprised me that he is as good as he is. He was very ordinary point-to-pointer. To look at him last season he was so raw and scrawny, you wondered if he’d have the strength to run two mile five furlongs at Cheltenham. ‘He was skin and bone whereas Vautour was the apple of everyone’s eye. He is an oil painting of a horse.’","Trainer Willie Mullins claims unbeaten Faugheen is in peak condition .

"National Football League owners unanimously endorsed what they called a 'revised and strengthened' Personal Conduct Policy in the wake of several domestic violence incidents involving players. 'With considerable assistance from the many people and organizations we consulted, NFL ownership has endorsed an enhanced policy that is significantly more robust, thorough, and formal,' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. The NFL has come under fire over the last six months as it struggled with a personal conduct policy widely seen as too lenient. With big-money NFL sponsors watching closely, Goodell embarked on a mission to strengthen the policy. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has endured a turbulent year off the field with a raft of unsavoury incidents . High-profile players Adrian Peterson, Ray Rice and Greg Hardy have been convicted of domestic abuse over the past few months and the NFL has stumbled in some of its attempts to punish the players. A special counsel for investigations and conduct will 'decide the discipline for violations' of the new policy, said Goodell, who will still hear appeals but may appoint an independent panel to assist him. 'The policy is comprehensive. It is strong. It is tough. And it is better for everyone associated with the NFL,' Goodell said. The players union was not happy it was not part of the process in formulating a new policy. 'Our union has not been offered the professional courtesy of seeing the NFL's new personal conduct policy before it hit the presses,' the NFL Players Union said in a statement. 'Their unilateral decision and conduct today is the only thing that has been consistent over the past few months.' Among the changes are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators, Goodell said. Ray Rice (right) is free to play in the NFL after knocking out his then-fiancee Janay (centre) in a casino lift . The new policy was unveiled at a regularly scheduled owners meeting in Irving, Texas, outside Dallas. Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill will serve as chairman of a nine-owner committee that will oversee the new policy, Goodell said. Two former players with ownership stakes also will serve on the committee, Warrick Dunn of the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers' John Stallworth. After the criticism erupted over the summer, Goodell retained four women, including Lisa Friel, the former head of the Manhattan district attorney's sex-crimes unit, to shape the NFL's policies relating to domestic violence and sexual assault. 'We now have a layered evaluation process to take into account a diversity of expert views,' Goodell said. Adrian Peterson disciplined his four-year-old son with a switch and is currently banned by the NFL .","NFL owners unanimously approved a revised personal conduct policy .

"Manager Arsene Wenger would not have walked out on Arsenal if they had lost the FA Cup final last season, and is determined to do all he can to deliver another open-top bus parade around Islington in the summer. The Gunners host Hull on Sunday in a repeat of what was a dramatic clash at Wembley in the May sunshine, when Wenger's side battled back from trailing 2-0 inside eight minutes to win with a stoppage-time goal from Aaron Ramsey which ended a nine-year quest for silverware. Wenger went on to sign a new deal following his side's Wembley triumph, the euphoria which greeted it having seen the Arsenal players on their knees at the final whistle and then some 250,000 supporters turn the streets around the Emirates Stadium into a sea of red and white as the French coach held aloft the famous old trophy once again. Arsenal were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on New Year's Day as they dropped to sixth place in the league . Wenger looking distressed during his side's 2-0 defeat to Ronaldo Koeman's (right) Southampton . Arsene Wenger lifts the FA Cup in May after beating Hull at Wembley to claim trophy . The Arsenal manager, though, insists quitting was never on his mind, no matter what the outcome had been that afternoon some eight months ago. 'Walk away? No. I have just won my 600th game out of 1,000 - that means I have won 60 per cent of the games and after 18 years, you would not be serious to walk away for losing one game. I do my job as well as I can and I respect my contract,' said Wenger. 'It (sense of relief) was because we didn't win a trophy for years and people want that. 'Also, after being 2-0 down after 10 minutes and they nearly scored the third goal, you know that you have very little chances of winning, so the fact that we were 2-0 down and turned it around was a fantastic relief. Wenger pictured with the FA Cup during Arsenal's open top bus parade in May . Pressure is building on the Arsenal manager after another disappointing result . An angry Arsenal fan ran to the dugout to confront Wenger during the defeat by Southampton . 'It was nice to see our fans happy and it shows you how happy the club is when you win. 'We want another cup run and we want to, if possible, keep the trophy. We have won it five times in my period (in charge) so that means we know the importance that it has.' Wenger continued: 'It is a great memory, but we have a big job to do on Sunday and (after we) come back in the Premier League, then we have the Champions League. 'What is for sure is that we have room for improvement and we have to manage to do that quickly.' The incident comes just weeks after Wenger received verbal abuse from disgruntled fans at the train station after the loss to Stoke last month . Szczesny is beaten by Southampton midfielder Dusan Tadic during Thursday's defeat . With on-going injury problems and the suspension of forward Olivier Giroud, Wenger has few options to rotate his squad. Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina is set to stand in for Wojciech Szczesny, who made errors in both of the goals as Arsenal were beaten at Southampton on New Year's Day, while Theo Walcott is expected to make a long-awaited start in attack. German playmaker Mesut Ozil is close to a return from his knee injury, but will not be rushed. Wenger said: 'Ozil has been out for three months. Walcott has been out for a year. People don't realise how much time it takes to come back after such a long period.' Â .","Arsenal play Hull in the FA Cup on Sunday in a repeat of last year's final .

"Cam Newton has been discharged from hospital in Charlotte after a car crash left him with two fractures in his lower back. His spirits are said to be high and despite feeling stiff and sore, the 25-year-old quarterback will recuperate with his family after his parents, Cecil and Jackie, arrived from Atlanta following the accident. It remains unclear when he will return to the Carolina Panthers. Newton manages to raise a smile on the sidewalk while a policeman kneels nearby . Newton was fortunate to escape from his pick-up truck without serious injury after it flipped several times . A black pick-up truck, believed to be Newton's, sits on the road following the shocking crash . Witnesses say a sedan smashed into Newton's pickup truck on the left side, causing it to flip over three times . The accident sent car parts flying all over the road in the shadow of the Bank of America Stadium . Despite the dramatic accident, Newton escaped with only minor injuries, but will stay in hospital for tests . 'That will be determined really on a day-to-day basis and we'll see how fast the soreness goes away,' Panthers spokesman Charlie Dayton said. 'He'll start the recuperation process today.' Newton has no internal injuries and will not need surgery. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo suffered the same injury description earlier this year against Washington and sat out one game before returning to action the following week. However, Romo's injury came on the field, not in a car accident. Newton is also asked to run more than Romo and takes more hits than any quarterback in the league. Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman was present at the league owner's meeting in Irving, Texas when he received a call from his office about the crash. 'I'm just thankful he was wearing a seatbelt and everyone involved is all right,' Gettleman said before boarding a plane back to Charlotte. He said he was horrified by the photos from the accident scene. 'You spend so much time with these guys and they become part of the family,' he said. The driver of the sedan, pictured on the bed of a tow truck, was hospitalised with non life-threatening injuries . A towing-operator works to move Newton's damaged truck at the scene of the crash .

The horrific-looking accident was the latest unfortunate turn in what has been a frustrating season for Newton. 'You look at the truck and you think, `Man, I'm glad there was nobody in the passenger seat because it could have been bad,' Gettleman added. Charlotte-Mecklenburg police issued no citations for the accident. A police report states that Newton was driving when a car pulled out in front of the fourth-year quarterback, causing his Dodge truck to flip. The report said the other driver didn't see Newton's truck at first and when he did, he tried to avoid a collision. The report does not place blame on either driver. Like Newton, the other driver was taken to the hospital but his injuries are unknown. The Panthers, who despite being on 4-10-1, have an outside chance of winning the NFC South with have three regular season games left. The team began practising in preparation for Sunday's divisional game against Tampa Bay with Derek Anderson working as the first-team quarterback.","The 25-year-old quarterback has been discharged from Carolina's Medical Center after spending the night there .

"Former Newcastle United midfielder Nolberto Solano has agreed to become the new manager of Thai regional side Hua Hin City, local media has reported. The 40-year-old will arrive in Thailand on Thursday to sign a contract to take charge of the team from the beachside town south of Bangkok, who compete in the third tier of domestic football. No financial details or length of contract were disclosed. Former Newcastle United winger Nolberto Solano 'agrees' to become boss of Thai side Hua Hin City . Ex-Peru winger had been looking for a coaching role in England but will fly to Thailand on Thursday . The deal was completed after financial backing was secured with unnamed sponsors, Siam Sport quoted Hua Hin team manager Rujipas Pinkaew as saying. Solano became something of a cult figure at Newcastle after spending almost a decade at the club in two spells. He also played for a number of other Premier League sides, including Aston Vila and West Ham United, and represented Peru on more than 90 occasions. The free-kick specialist quit playing in 2012 to embark on a coaching career at home and in Canada and had been linked with some managerial positions in England's lower leagues before agreeing a deal with Hua Hin this week.

"Ronald Koeman and Manuel Pellegrini have dismissed suggestions by Jose Mourinho that Premier League referees have an anti-Chelsea agenda. Mourinho claimed there is a ‘conspiracy’ against his League leaders after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving when his manager thought he should have been awarded a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton on Sunday. Saints boss Koeman now accepts that referee Anthony Taylor should have awarded a spot-kick for Matt Targett’s challenge on Fabregas, but claimed it was the sort of mistake all clubs have to cope with over the course of a season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini saying he learnt from Barca referee rant . Manuel Pellegrini and Ronald Koeman have rejected Jose Mourinho's claims . The Chelsea boss claimed there was a 'conspiracy' against his side . Mourinho believes there is a deliberate attempt to undermine Chelsea when penalties are not given . And Manchester City manager Pellegrini said he trusted all referees to officiate fairly. Asked for his thoughts on Mourinho’s controversial claims, Koeman said: ‘It’s his feeling, I can’t say anything about that, but I don’t think so. I think referees are human people, everybody makes mistakes. ‘And I think at the end of the season it’s a little bit in balance. I don’t think teams are more punished by the referee than the rest of the teams. It was a bad mistake from the referee, because when I watched the game afterwards it was a 100 per cent penalty. But sometimes you get a penalty and sometimes you don’t, that’s part of the job.’ As Manchester City boss Pellegrini prepared for his side's game against Sunderland, he said: ‘I don’t want to talk about what other managers say because I don’t know what happens in every game. Maybe as a manager we only know what happens against our team. All teams have difficult moments with referees. Mourinho shows his frustration as Cesc Fabregas is fouled against Southampton . 'All teams drop points because of referees making mistakes. The first goal by Burnley against us on Sunday was offside. 'It’s normal and I don’t have any doubt about the way the referees whistle every game. I trust absolutely in the way they do it.’ Pellegrini and Mourinho have never got on since becoming rivals in Spain. The ill-feeling has only intensified since they came to England. The City manager served a Champions League touchline ban for criticising an official last year, but he added: ‘After the game is not the best moment to talk about decisions, particularly if you have not won. It’s a difficult profession, refereeing.’","Jose Mourinho said there was a conspiracy against Chelsea .

"Gus Poyet is relieved that fellow South American Sergio Aguero will not be lining up against Sunderland. The Argentina striker won a standing ovation at the Stadium of Light just four weeks ago when he scored twice in a 4-1 victory. Aguero, though, lasted just seven minutes of the following game at home to Everton and has not been seen since after suffering knee ligament damage. Sergio Aguero will be missing when Manchester City face Sunderland on New Year's Day . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is glad that his fellow South American won't be available . Aguero earned himself a standing ovation after a stunning display at the Black Cats in December . It means City will again be without a recognised frontman for the visit of the Black Cats and Poyet, given the recent memory of Aguero’s devastating display on Wearside, believes that improves his side’s chances of nicking a result. ‘It's easier to play City without Aguero, no doubt. Let's be honest about that,’ said the Uruguayan. ‘Aguero was different class when we played them at home. We couldn't cope with him. ‘We thought we had him under control, and then he went ""boom"" from nowhere. He's quality, and in that game he was on fire.’ But Poyet countered: ‘They have quality everywhere though. If you look at how much David Silva has been delivering in recent weeks he's completely changed the way they've been playing. He’s a top player.’ It was at the Etihad last season that Sunderland’s unlikely 2-2 draw provided the platform for a run of four straight wins which saw them escape the relegation zone in the final weeks of the season. Poyet remains wary of the attacking threat City possess, including the likes of David Silva . Aguero has been out of action since picking up a knee ligament injury against Everton . And Poyet, whose side trailed inside two minutes but then conceded a late equaliser, reflected: ‘The early goal against Manchester City happened and for some reason the feeling on the pitch changed. ‘Somehow it completely relaxed the players and we started attacking and creating chances. All of a sudden my players thought “hey, we've got a chance here”. ‘The 11 on the pitch felt they should have won it. And where did it come from? I think it was a feeling. They cleared their minds, stopped thinking about this and that and just started playing. ‘At half time we were a goal down but the players believed in themselves. They created that feeling amongst themselves, not me the manager. They changed the game. ‘It was the beginning of the miracle. No doubt. But there were mixed emotions after the game because we should have won.’ Sunderland are 14th in the table but Poyet is frustrated by 11 draws, including six goalless stalemates. And the head coach, assessing his team at the halfway stage, said: 'We're okay, we could be a bit better. There are too many draws, we're a long way for what I want but we're getting better. I want my team to control the game better, but we're still adapting to what we want.'","Sergio Aguero is out of Manchester City's game against Sunderland .

Hopefully we will take this into the games ahead.' Few could have predicted the manner of Tottenham's win, especially when Diego Costa put the league leaders ahead after 18 minutes.

"John Carver is set to take charge of Newcastle as caretaker manager for at least the next two matches, alongside Steve Stone, following the departure of Alan Pardew. But who is he? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know... John Carver will lead his hometown club as caretaker for the next two matches at least . So who is John Carver? Raised in Cruddas Park, just over a mile from St James’ Park, Carver attended St Cuthbert’s High School, whose alumni also includes Sting and Declan Donnelly. Always regarded as one of the best junior footballers in the city, he was on the books of Newcastle as a teenager and was pals with a young Paul Gascoigne. Carver (left) served as assistant to Alan Pardew before the Newcastle boss left for Crystal Palace this week . His progress, though, was hindered by a thigh injury and his senior career only amounted to a handful of appearances for Cardiff City. He was forced to retire from professional football at 20. What then? He played for Gateshead for three years but all the while was working his way up the coaching ladder in Newcastle, starting out in schools before landing the role of director at United’s School of Excellence in 1992. Carver will take charge of the team alongside Steve Stone (right) for games against Burnley and Leicester . While at Newcastle’s academy he worked with the likes of Shola Ameobi and Steven Taylor. In 1999 it was Ruud Gullit who promoted him to the role of assistant manager. How did that go? Not too well for Gullit, but Carver was kept on by Sir Bobby Robson and he became one of his most trusted lieutenants as the club enjoyed Champions League football for a second time. Carver worked under club legend Sir Bobby Robson until 2004, when he first served as caretaker manager . When Robson was sacked in 2004, Carver took charge of the 3-0 home win over Blackburn and still talks of his ‘100-per-cent record' as Newcastle boss. How did it end at Newcastle? Graeme Souness came in and brought with him his own backroom team. Carver moved to Leeds, where he also had a spell as caretaker boss, before taking over the management reins at Toronto FC in the MLS. The Newcastle caretaker has been full-time manager elsewhere, taking charge of FC Toronto in the MLS . Although successful on the pitch, he had one or two disagreements with the league’s authorities and decided to return to the UK. He then took up assistant roles to Paul Mariner at Plymouth and the late Gary Speed at Sheffield United before returning to Newcastle under Alan Pardew. And how he’s got his big chance? He certainly hopes so and would love nothing more than to take charge of his hometown club on a permanent basis.","John Carver was at Newcastle as a teenager, alongside pal Paul Gascoigne .

"West Bromwich Albion turned to Tony Pulis for his remarkable record of never being relegated – but seven years ago the matchday programme was rather less complimentary. As manager of Stoke, a piece from the 2007-08 season savaged his methods. 'Stoke train with cannons rescued from local medieval ruins,' read the article. 'Footballs are loaded into them and fired into the distance for [Mamady] Sidibe to head and [Ricardo] Fuller to run after. It’s a game plan that squeezes the life out of what used to be known as football.’ Tony Pulis was unveiled as West Bromwich Albion manager at The Hawthorns on Friday .

Pulis, pictured as Stoke boss, has not been relegated as a manager and will try to ensure safety at West Brom . That was the campaign West Brom, under Tony Mowbray, and Stoke were rivals for promotion out of the the Championship. As it happened they finished first and second respectively and both went up. Stoke beat West Brom 3-1 at the Britannia, with Fuller scoring a hat-trick and earning a place in the Championship team of the year. It was 1-1 at The Hawthorns in the reverse fixture. Clearly attitudes change and it is Pulis’ improbable run of staying afloat wherever he has been in 22 years of management that appeals most to chairman Jeremy Peace. At Crystal Palace, Pulis got his side playing some good stuff too, a punchy, counter-attacking style full of vim and potency. He could well do the same at West Brom.

"Wimbledon moved swiftly on Tuesday morning to play down suggestions that some early-round matches are soon to be restricted to pay-per-view television channels. According to The Times, senior BBC executives have discussed the possibility of sharing matches with BT as a way of splitting the costs of broadcasting The Championships. However, sources at the All England Club quickly pointed out that any decisions about how the matches are broadcast, and on which platforms, are down to how the tournament chooses to sell its rights. Novak Djokovic claimed the Wimbledon title in 2014 on terrestrial TV and SW19 officials have insisted that the BBC are not in discussions with BT Sport to split some early-round matches with pay-per-view channels . Early-round matches involving Andy Murray and the like are not at risk of moving to pay-per-view TV . They were quick to dispel fears that a tasty match in the first week featuring Andy Murray, or one of the major international names like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, would be denied to anyone not prepared to pay extra for it. 'Wimbledon has always had a good relationship with the BBC and has a contract with them until 2017,' a Wimbledon spokesman told Sportsmail. 'There has definitely not been any contact with BT.' The BBC has covered Wimbledon for nearly 80 years and there is a strong emotional bond between the two institutions. There is also, in line with the modern Wimbledon's more hardheaded outlook, recognition of the value of being on terrestrial television. Murray, who claimed the Wimbledon title in 2013, is a crowd favourite at the All England Club . Roger Federer is another household name at Wimbledon who fans will still be able to watch on the BBC . The power of getting showcased on mainstream TV was shown only this weekend, with a factor in Lewis Hamilton's crushing Sports Personality of the Year win over Rory McIlroy being that he is seen more often on television available to every household. However, the world is changing quickly and one of the secrets of Wimbledon's ongoing success is that, while maintaining its veneer of tradition, it has never been afraid to change with it. Nobody knows exactly how the media landscape will be in five years' time, let alone 10, so nothing should be ruled out in the medium to long term. And even the smallest move away from the BBC monopoly of broadcasting the big fortnight in the UK would be an act of major symbolism. Maria Sharapova is another who draws the crowds at Wimbledon and who can still be viewed on BBC . Rafael Nadal's early-round matches will also continue to remain on BBC for the foreseeable future . The fact is that only the finals weekend is protected as being free-to-air under the 'crown jewels' designation, but talk of Britain's armchair fans going without coverage if they do not take out a subscription is alarmist. On the Beeb's side, they are concerned about their budgets in light of licence-fee settlements, and have had arrangements of shared coverage to cut costs with Formula One and the FA Cup. Yet Wimbledon, a one-off event spanning two weeks, is a very different animal. France's Grand Slam, the French Open at Roland Garros, has also been an event keen to be on free-to-air television, which is one reason it can be seen on ITV in the UK. As far as Wimbledon is concerned, nothing could be done without the say-so of the hierarchy at SW19, who have shown no sign either in public or private that they are wishing to dramatically alter the status quo. While they will not be afraid to react to changing circumstances, the British tennis-watching public should not be alarmed at this point.

"Jessica Ennis-Hill has admitted she was shocked by the abuse she received on social media after saying she did not want Sheffield United to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. The Olympic heptathlon champion received threatening messages via Twitter last month, with one user writing he hoped Evans raped Ennis-Hill, after saying she would want her name removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evans returned. Ennis-Hill spoke out after United accepted a request from the Professional Footballers' Association to allow Evans to train with his former club following the striker's release from prison, midway through a five-year sentence. United later withdrew the offer. Athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill urged Sheffield United not to re-sign convicted rapist Ched Evans . In an interview with BBC Sport, Ennis-Hill said of the abuse: 'It was definitely a shock. It was not very nice to read them but unfortunately that's the world we live in. 'You kind of have to keep focused on who you are and what you believe in, and try not to read too much into it. 'You can't spend hours going through your Twitter feed and reading everything every single person says to you. You need to get on with your life.' Ennis-Hill was one of several high-profile figures to enter the debate over Evans after United initially said he would be allowed to train. TV presenter Charlie Webster, 1960s pop star Dave Berry and health adviser Lindsay Graham all stood down as club ambassadors during the row. 'I knew I was in a position where I was going to upset someone whether I said something or didn't,' Ennis-Hill said. 'With my stand at Sheffield United and the association I have with the club, I really just wanted to voice my opinion. Ennis-Hill, pictured at the Shard on Wednesday night, received plenty of Twitter abuse from supporters . 'It wasn't about putting pressure on the club or anything like that - it was just simply about how I felt. I think people can be rehabilitated and if they have served time in jail can go back into society, but I just feel that when you are in a really privileged position it's quite different.' Ennis-Hill, 28, is now focused on getting back into competitive shape after giving birth to her son Reggie in July, and she is hoping to defend her Olympic title in Rio in 2016. 'It's hard getting up when you have not had much sleep but I really want to have this last push in my career,' she said of her return to training. 'I'm looking forward to the Olympics, I really want to be there and want to be a contender and that's what keeps me motivated. 'I have two years to get the work done and get where I was, I'm still the competitive person I was and I really hope I can contend for a gold medal. 'London 2012 was fantastic and it will be very hard to top, but if I am able to get work done and get to Rio and win a gold medal having had a child, that would be unbelievable.'","Ched Evans had looked as if he'd re-sign for Sheffield United .

"Newcastle skipper Fabricio Coloccini has insisted he has no designs on the manager's job with Alan Pardew's exit imminent. The 33-year-old Argentina international was an early favourite with the bookmakers when news of Crystal Palace's approach for Pardew emerged, although sources on Tyneside were swift to dismiss the speculation. Now Coloccini has re-affirmed his intention to concentrate on his playing career having first been linked with the post last year when Pardew found himself under intense pressure. Fabricio Coloccini rises above Danny Ings during the 3-3 draw at St James' Park on New Year's Day . Coloccini has been heavily linked with the vacant manger's job at Newcastle, but insists he is happy playing . Speaking after his side's roller-coaster 3-3 Barclays Premier League draw with Burnley on Thursday afternoon, he said: 'I am a football player now and want to play for a few years more. I want to enjoy being on the pitch. 'It's not for now.' Assistant manager John Carver took charge of the team with Pardew in the stands for Palace's trip to Aston Villa, and Coloccini admitted it had been a tough few days for the players. He said: 'It is a difficult situation, but John Carver is with us. He has the experience to take the job. 'Of course it is difficult, but it has not affected the team. When you go on the field, you have to leave all the problems behind you.' The Newcastle captain ruled out the chance of moving into management 'for now' after the Burnley draw . Coloccini also backed current caretaker manager John Carver, who is more experienced in management . Carver's audition - he has ambitions to return to management in his own right - looked to be going swimmingly after a good start. Newcastle dominated the first half as Burnley lost three men - skipper Jason Shackell, Dean Marney and substitute Kevin Long - to a combination of injury and illness, and led 2-1 at the break courtesy of strikes from Steven Taylor and Jack Colback either side of Paul Dummett's own goal. However, comeback kings Burnley, who fought back from 2-0 down at Manchester City on Sunday to claim a point, responded spectacularly after the break and got their reward when Danny Ings headed them level. But having also hit the woodwork on four occasions, they looked to be heading for defeat when Moussa Sissoko restored the Magpies' lead 12 minutes from time, only for George Boyd to dash the home side's hopes with four minutes remaining. John carver (right) and Steve Stone (left) are in temporary charge of Newcastle after Alan Pardew's departure . Moussa Sissoko puts Newcastle ahead for the third time but they could not hang on for a win . For Burnley boss Sean Dyche, it was another remarkable afternoon just five days after his side came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Manchester City. Dyche said: 'There is a mentality here that is very, very strong, and it's been there all season. People have said to me, 'You must be pleased with the belief now' - I was pleased with it at the beginning of the season. 'The performances over this Christmas period have been absolutely outstanding. How we didn't get anything against Liverpool is a head-scratcher in itself; we were excellent at Manchester City and I thought we were excellent today. 'We have just played five out of the top 10 and taken five points over that Christmas period with a lot of games - very good signs about what we think we can do this season.' Despite losing three players to injury in the first half, Sean Dyche refused to make any excuses . Dyche sent out the same starting XI for the sixth successive game, but the premature exits of Shackell, Marney and Long - he fears the latter may have suffered a serious ankle injury - tore his plans apart, although the manager was not about the feel sorry for himself. He said: 'I don't do excuses, I haven't got time for excuses at any level of football, and certainly not at this level of football.' George Boyd celebrates Burnley's third equaliser during a match that swung back and forth . Carver was left to reflect upon what might have been after a classic game of two halves. He said: 'I am actually sitting here so disappointed because we were so good in the first half and so poor in the second half that we actually have got away with a point. We didn't deserve that. 'I said to Sean at the end of the game, 'We didn't deserve that', and I think he must have thought I was saying we should have won the game, but no, by no means. Burnley should have won the game.'","Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini had been tipped for manager's job .

"Spain forward Fernando Torres has agreed to return to Atletico Madrid on loan from AC Milan until the end of the 2015-16 season, seven-and-a-half years after leaving his boyhood club. Torres, 30, has been struggling for goals since leaving Liverpool for Chelsea in a then-British record £50million in 2011 and moved to Milan on loan in August. However, the striker insisted that while it was 'time to go back home' he did not regret his career path since leaving Anfield. VIDEO Scroll down to watch A trip down memory lane: The career of Fernando Torres . Fernando Torres tweeted his excitement to be back at the club where he made his name as a teenager . Torres (right) made an appearance alongside Atletico president Miguel Angel Gil, just hours after signing . Torres has scored just once since joining Milan on loan this year, following two and a half seasons at Chelsea . Fernando Torres claims he does not regret his time at Chelsea and he won: . FA Cup 2012 . Champions League 2012 . Europa League 2013 . But his goalscoring record does not look good: . Premier League: 20 goals in 110 games . Domestic cups: 7 goals in 19 games . European competitions: 19 goals in 43 games . Total: 46 goals in 172 games . ‘Chelsea gave me what I was looking for when I left Liverpool... trophies,' said Torres in Dubai after Atletico confirmed the deal. 'I'll always see it as a success.’ Chelsea and Milan agreed on Saturday to make the switch permanent, paving the way for Torres to be loaned to Atletico, where he will hope to resurrect his stuttering career under inspirational coach Diego Simeone. Simeone and Torres played together at the Spanish club between 2003 and 2005, when the young Torres captained the Argentine who will now be his manager. 'At last back home. Thanks to all that have made this dream come true,' Torres wrote on his Twitter feed shortly after Atletico confirmed the deal under a giant 'Torres is back' banner on their website. Diego Simeone (right) and Fernando Torres (left) played together at Atletico between 2003 and 2005 . Torres was Simeone's captain, and Fabio Capello believes the Atleti manager can reinvigorate the striker . The deal is subject to Torres passing a medical and will be finalised on January 5 when the Italian transfer window opens, Atletico said. 'In this way, the forward from Fuenlabrada returns to his home where he was trained as a footballer and became one of their big stars,' the club added. A World Cup and double European Championship winner with Spain, Torres joined Atletico at the age of 11. Known as 'El Nino' (The Kid), he made his first-team debut as a 17-year-old in 2001, when Madrid's second club were in the second division, and was appointed captain two years later, becoming a huge favourite with the fans. The Spanish striker came through at Atletico as a teenager, becoming captain at the age of just 19 . At Liverpool Torres was one of the best strikers in the world, scoring 65 Premier League goals in 91 starts . Since the move to Chelsea in January 2011 Torres has struggled for form and confidence in front of goal . Although he left the club in 2007, Fernando Torres is still Atletico Madrid's leading league scorer in the 21st century, ahead of four other Premier League stars: . 1. Fernando Torres    75 goals in 174 games . 2. Sergio Aguero        74 goals in 175 games . 3. Diego Forlan           74 goals in 134 games . 4. Falcao                      52 goals in 68 games . 5. Diego Costa            43 goals in 94 games . When he left for Liverpool in July 2007, having scored 91 goals in 244 appearances, he pledged to return and could make his debut against holders Real Madrid in the first leg of a Copa del Rey last-16 tie on January 7. As well as a decorated career with Spain, Torres helped Chelsea win the Champions League in 2012 and the Europa League a year later. For one week in May 2013, Torres and compatriot and Chelsea team-mate Juan Mata were holders of the World Cup, European Championship, Champions League and Europa League titles. However, his impact throughout his  career at Stamford Bridge was not as had been expected when he moved in January 2011. His 46 goals in blue meant that each strike effectively cost Chelsea more than £1m. He has also struggled at Milan, scoring just once in 10 matches. Torres says he has no regrets over his move to Chelsea, where he won the Champions League in 2012 . Torres lifts the World Cup with Spain in 2010, but has since fallen out of favour with the national team .

"Chelsea were stunned on New Year's Day as Tottenham put five goals past Jose Mourinho's defence. Sportsmail's ROB DRAPER rates the performances of every player at White Hart Lane. TOTTENHAM . Hugo Lloris 7 . Solid and dependable, as ever, he had an unusually quiet night but was strong in that nervous period after Chelsea’s second and until Tottenham’s fifth when all at White Hart lane suspected capitulation was coming. Hugo Lloris can only watch as Eden Hazard scores Chelsea's second goal . Kyle Walker 6.5 . A good performance all round – helpful in attack and decent in defence. Jan Vertonghen 7 . The stronghold of the Tottenham defence and the protagonist in most of the physical battles – confronting Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas at different times when necessary. Federico Fazio 5.5 . What was he thinking when he lost the ball on the hour to allow Hazard to score? Tottenham were totally in control up to that point and then had to endure a nervous period as famous capitulations, notably to Manchester United in 2001, came to mind. Danny Rose 6.5 . Got out-run by Hazard for the first goal – but was first to react to Chadli’s shot off the post to score to make in 2-1. |Left back Danny Rose slides in to put Tottenham 2-1 up in the first half .

Cooly-taken penalty and his pace was a worry all night for Chelsea until he came off for Paulinho on the hour. Christian Eriksen 7.5 . Set up Chadli for the shot that led to goal No. 2 and was a nuisance to Chelsea all night. A key man. Nacer Chadli 8 .

Cesar Azpilicueta 5 . The Premier League best left back looked tired – despite being rested at Southampton. Uncharacteristic errors were already creeping into his game before he gave the ball away for the second goal. Nemanja Matic 5.5 . Started well but when he was brushed aside by Harry Kane for the fourth goal it looked as though the tiredness of a first Christmas in England had got the better of him. Cesc Fabregas 5.5 .

His alertness won Chelsea their first goal – but he paid the price at half time for defensive lapse when Mourinho took him off . Eden Hazard 8 . Superb in that opening thirty minutes and his run to set up Costa’s goal was a triumph of determination and skill – as was his ability to win the ball off Fazio and exchange passes with Fabregas for the second. Set up the third as well with his cross. Diego Costa 7 . A first Christmas period but he didn’t stop running, nor harrying and got his goal. When Chelsea fell apart, his influence diminished but that was hardly his responsibility . Diego Costa (right) celebrates with his Chelsea team-mates after opening the scoring . Subs . Ramires 5.5 .

"A multi-billion-dollar high-speed train network linking America with Mexico moved a step closer as officials from both sides of the border thrashed out details. The proposed 300 mile route would link San Antonio, Texas, to Monterrey, Mexico - slashing the current journey time from five hours by car to under two hours. Advocates say the project, which would be the first high-speed train line in North America and is set to be completed by 2018, will provide huge economic boost to regions in both nations. Swift: A new high-speed train link would cut the 300 mile journey time between San Antonio, Mexico, and Monterrey, Mexico, to under two hours . Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar and Texas Department of Transportation Commissioner Jeff . Austin, as well as Mexican officials, presented the plan to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx on Thursday in Washington D.C. Mr Cuellar told Fox News . Latino: 'Secretary Foxx and his team are interested. A high-speed rail . between San Antonio and Monterrey through Laredo would revolutionize . trade and travel between the United States and Mexico.' Monterrey is Mexico’s third-largest city . and is considered a financial and business captial of the region. According to Rolando Zubiran, the . state’s deputy minister for foreign investment, 80 percent of U.S. Mexican economic activity passes through Monterrey, Fox News Latino reported. But it has also been mired in violent clashes between two of Mexico's most feared drug gangs. Getting up to speed: The ambitious project to create a high-speed rail network linking America with Mexico would embrace technology widely used in other parts of the world, such as Japan, pictured, . Playing catch up: America is someway behind China which has already built hundreds of miles of high-speed rail network on which bullet trains can reach 250kph . Authorities behind the plans have . tried to allay fears that the train connection could be exploited by the . violent drug gangs which control many parts of Mexico. Officials insist the train will be non-stopping between America and Mexico. Passengers . would be able to go through strict immigration controls before the . train departed, cutting the time spent at road border crossings dealing . with paperwork. Construction set to begin first half . of 2015 and completed within four years, under the ambitious proposals outlined . the U.S Transport Secretary. Mexico estimates its share of the cost for the project will be around $1.5billion. Lowering costs: The rising price of petrol has put pressure on authorities to find a cheaper means of mass transport, such as high-speed rail, similar to that used in Japan, pictured . But . the final go-ahead is dependent on a U.S. study into the feasibility of . a regional high-speed network linking Oklahoma City and South Texas to . southern neighbors. America . is currently flirting with the idea of constructing a nation-wide . high-speed rail network, joining major cities on both the west and east . coast. The U.S. finds itself playing catch up to other nations around the world which have far more established high-speed networks. Japan . has had bullet trains running well over 150mph since the 1950s. It is . currently fine-tuning a maglev system where trains can reach speeds of . 350mph. China has the world's longest high-speed rail network with more than 6,200miles of routes in service. Now pressure is mounting on America to introduce a similar, low cost passenger transport network. According to a 2005 study by the Texas Transportation Institute, traffic congestion is costing Americans $63.1 billion a year. Those in favour of more rail travel claim an expansion of train routes will help the nation save billions. Surging oil costs has caused car-loving America to look to the train for a cheaper means of getting around the country. High-speed rail projects linking mayor cities on both coasts have now been pushed to the top of the political agenda. Multi-million-dollar feasablility studies have been launched across the country in a bid to get a network build within the next decade. A route from Chicago to Philadelphia via the Keystone Corridor HSR system is being contemplated. The California High-Speed Rail Authority was created in 1996 by the state to implement an extensive 800-mile rail system that is estimated to cost about $40 billion. Once built, the system will not require operating subsidies, and it is expected to generate $1 billion in annual profits. The system would provide high-speed service between and among major cities, like Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and would allow travel between Los Angeles' Union Station and San Francisco's Transbay Terminal in two and a half hours. Plans have been drawn up for 125 to 150mph electric trains running between Southern California and Las Vegas, Nevada. In September 2010 Amtrak unveiled proposals for 355 km/h trains to run between Washington DC and Boston, stopping at various cities along the way including Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. The end to end journey time would be three hours. The proposals would cost $117bn and would take 25 years to complete. Amtrak estimates that the capacity would be needed, as even after current investment programmes, the Acela trains will be full by 2030. The proposal envisages completion by 2040.

'If we can come out of these games the right side with the right result, we'll be in a good position. 'We're happy to win the game. It's a busy period for us over Christmas and we were able to start that out with a win. 'We were disappointed at the end to concede the goal but overall we've got to be pleased with the three points.' Rooney received glowing praise from former team-mate and Old Trafford midfield legend Paul Scholes who said on TV last night he could have a future in central midfield. 'He is definitely capable of playing there,' said Scholes. The Manchester United captain said his team are capable of making up ground if they keep performing well . Meanwhile United manager Louis van Gaal said: 'He has the lung capacity to play there and he scores goals. 'In the last game he was too defensive. I told him to be more attacking. 'He can be a centre forward too but at the moment it's best for the team he plays in midfield. 'I was extremely pleased with the team today. We are making progress every game. 'We dominated the game for 90 minutes. Newcastle were defensive but we scored fantastic goals and created chances.' Van Gaal criticised the Premier League programming that sees United play again, against Tottenham, on Sunday. 'In UEFA and FIFA it is forbidden to play within 48 hours but in England it seems to be okay,' he said. Chelsea remained three points clear atop the Premier League after their 2-0 win over West Ham . Manchester City kept up the pressure on the leaders with a 3-1 win at West Brom . United will be without Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj at Tottenham as both are unwell. It also seems unlikely that winger Angel di Maria will be fit after suffering a pelvis injury in training on Christmas Eve. 'He was injured in a warming up, ' said Van Gaa. 'It is not a heavy injury, but you don't take risks I think. 'It is to do with the way his pelvis attaches to his leg.' Newcastle could have had an early penalty yesterday but were eventually sunk by two Rooney goals in the first half and a header from Robin van Persie early in the second half. Substitute Papa Cisse grabbed an 85th consolation from the penalty spot.","Wayne Rooney says Manchester United can chase down top two .

"Newcastle boss Alan Pardew handed a first Premier League start to 17-year old Adam Armstrong on Boxing Day, a daunting debut against Manchester United. But who is the young gun chosen to try and help the Geordies secure victory at Old Trafford? Adam Armstrong takes on Manchester United's Paddy McNair during his full Premier League debut . SO WHO IS ADAM ARMSTRONG? The latest Newcastle youngster to be blooded by Alan Pardew. At 17 years and 319 days, Armstrong is the first player under 18 to start for Newcastle in the Premier League. AND WHERE DOES HE PLAY? The youngster prefers to operate as a creative No 10, setting up and scoring goals, but he was used by Pardew at Old Trafford on the right of midfield. WHAT’S HIS STYLE? Despite being a lifelong Newcastle fan, Armstrong grew up idolising Wayne Rooney and models his game on the United man. Armstrong gets a shot away under pressure from Wes Brown during last week's Tyne-Wear derby . At 5ft 8in, he might be on the small side but he makes up for it with a strong physique. WHAT ELSE SHOULD WE KNOW? After joining the club aged nine, Armstrong moved up through the ranks and made his professional debut last season at Fulham. Armstrong is a small but strong No 10, who has modeled his game on idol Wayne Rooney . He scored in every round as Newcastle reached last season’s FA Youth Cup quarter-finals and won the club’s ‘Wor Jackie’ award - named after Jackie Milburn - for best young player. He also helped England’s Under-17s win the European Championships in May.","Pardew hands youngster his full league debut against Manchester United .

"Fernando Torres can return to his brilliant best under the guidance of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone, according to former England boss Fabio Capello. Torres has not been in form in front of goal since joining Chelsea for £50million four years ago, but Capello believes he can rediscover his deadly touch under Simeone. The Spain striker captained his home-town club Atletico as a teenager, when Simeone was one of his team-mates, and is hoping returning to the place where he made his name will help bring back the knack of goalscoring. Diego Simeone (right) and Fernando Torres (left) played together at Atletico between 2003 and 2005 . Torres was Simeone's captain, and Fabio Capello believes the Atleti manager can reinvigorate the striker . Torres tweeted his excitement to be back at the club where he made his name as a teenager . And Capello believes Simeone can provide the boost to Torres' confidence, as well as tactical coaching, that will lift the 30-year-old out of his slump. 'Torres has got it all, but has lost his way a bit and is struggling to score goals,' Capello told Spanish paper Marca at the Globe Soccer Conference in Dubai. 'He has lost the confidence he had at Liverpool and during his first stint at Atletico. 'Simeone is going to make Torres come good. It is not only to do with systems: it is a confidence thing. 'Torres has become a bit subdued but is going to rediscover what he has lost thanks to Cholo (Simeone's nickname), who is going to reinvigorate him.'

"Manchester United comfortably saw off the challenge of Newcastle on Boxing Day, winning 3-1 as Wayne Rooney impressed. The club captain operated in a deeper midfield role and netted twice, while Robin van Persie also got on the scoresheet before Papiss Cisse's late consolation. Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein rated the players at Old Trafford. Manchester United beat Newcastle 3-0 on Boxing Day with Wayne Rooney netting twice at Old Trafford . David de Gea:  – Has enjoyed an inspired season and smartly dived to his left to tip away a powerful drive from Janmaat when the score was 0-0. Only beaten by Cisse's late penalty - 6.5 . Phil Jones: – Showed why Van Gaal put him straight back in the team after injury. Commanding in the air, does the job Kompany and Terry do for Man City and Chelsea even though he was foolish to concede a late penalty - 7 . Paddy McNair: – Part of his rehabilitation after being substituted early at Southampton. Had relatively little to do but fortunate to escape booking with rash challenge - 6 . Jonny Evans: – Scored for both sides in the corresponding fixture on Boxing Day two years ago. Much quieter this time as part of a three-man defence - 6 . Phil Jones showed Louis van Gaal exactly why he put him straight back into the starting line-up . Antonio Valencia: – Didn't maraud forward as much as usual, possibly to protect McNair and Jones, but did his job and was taken off early to get rest ahead of Sunday's trip to Spurs - 6 . Michael Carrick: - Appreciated by van Gaal. Might not quite be United's best player as claimed by Sir Alex Ferguson, but very, very good - 6.5 . Wayne Rooney: – The modern-day Martin Peters. Able to time his breaks from midfield into the penalty area perfectly, as underlined perfectly with his two first half goals. Always seems to score against Newcastle, and also set up No3 for van Persie with a pinpoint diagonal cross - 8 . Rooney strokes home the opener after Radamel Falcao's fine work for the assist . Ashley Young:  – Playing his best football for United under van Gaal. Great delivery led to a glorious chance for Falcao, and stayed away from any diving controversy - 6.5 . Juan Mata:  – Nearly gave away an early penalty when he clipped Gouffran but made amends with two glorious passes for Rooney's first half goals, one with his left, one with his right-foot. A natural No 10 - 7.5 . Robin van Persie: – Unselfish performance from the Dutchman. Although the designated centre-forward, he peeled wide at times to give Rooney space to run in from deep. But he was in the No9 position to head his deserved goal. Booked for lunge at Janmaat - 7 . Radamel Falcao: – Not quite 100 per cent sharp but beginning to show why he's considered world-class. Should have scored early on but stretched brillinatly to set up Rooney for his opening goal - 7 . Robin van Persie heads home United's third of the afternoon past Jack Alnwick . Substitutions: Darren Fletcher (for Carrick 62 5.5) - The game was already won when he came on and he looked a bit rusty . James Wilson (for Falcao 65 6) – Popular figure at OT having come through the ranks . Rafael (for Valencia 80) Louis van Gaal:  – This was the day van Gaal's attacking philosophy came into play. Still has work to do at the back though - 7.5 . NEWCASTLE UNITED (5-3-2) Jak Alnwick:  – Impossible to miss in bright orange but his defenders would have preferred him to try and catch set-pieces rather than opting to punch even the easier ones. No clangers with the goals though - 5.5 . Daryl Janmaat:  – Like Gouffran, he was a positive wing-back and tested de Gea with a thumping right-foot shot after 19 minutes - 6.5 . Paul Dummett: – Difficult job in a rejigged Newcastle defence as manager Alan Pardew isn't normally a 3-5-2 man - 6 . Fabricio Coloccini:  – Newcastle's captain but didn't really organise the back-five as a leader should, although in mitigation Manchester United's movement was very good - 5.5 . Steven Taylor:  – His career hasn't really lived up to its early promise. A booking for a late and clumsy foul on Mata summed up his afternoon - 5.5 . Steven Taylor struggled at Old Trafford - his career hasn't lived up to its early promise . Yoan Gouffran: – Got forward well from left wing-back and one foray led to a strong penalty appeal when he ran across Mata and there was clear contact between the pair - 7 . Vernon Anita: – One of only two survivors in the Newcastle team from the side that lost 4-3 at Old Trafford on Boxing Day two years ago. Didn't make an impact here - 6 . Moussa Sissoko: – Is the target for clubs in January but his agent won't be sending out any video footage of his performance here - 6 . Jack Colback: – Thankless task trying to get the ball off Manchester United. Credit that he kept going and won a late consolation penalty - 6 . Adam Armstrong:  – Tough for a 17-year-old striker to appear at Old Trafford on his Premier League debut and to be honest it was a little bit early for him, but that's not a surprise - 5.5 . Ayoze Perez: – He is a decent goalscorer but when he's not scoring, contributes little to the cause. One dribble in the first half was his most impressive turn - 5.5 . Ayoze Perez offers little going forward when he's not scoring for Newcastle . Substitutions: Remy Cabella (for Dummett 63) – Newcastle looked slightly more solid when he came on - 6 . Papiss Cisse (for Armstrong 63) – A mystery why he didn't start ahead of Armstrong. Cooly scored a penalty and will surely start against Everton on Sunday - 6 . Haris Vuckic (for Perez 82) Alan Pardew Opted for an unfamiliar 5-3-2. The wing-backs actually did well but there was a gap in class in most other areas of the pitch - 6.5 .","Manchester United beat Newcastle 3-1 at Old Trafford on Boxing Day .

"One the most famous Fernando Torres videos comes long before his goal against Germany handed Spain their first major trophy in the modern era and long before those YouTube compilations of him turning Nemanja Vidic inside out as Liverpool got the better of Manchester United on a regular basis. One of the most famous Torres clips is of him jumping up and down as a teenage ball boy singing the ‘ole ole ole cholo Simeone’ terrace song with his pals at the Vicente Calderon. Torres idolised Diego Simeone, the captain of the best Atletico Madrid side until last year’s team that won the league. He has always been reluctant to go home but with the Argentine in charge that has changed. If anyone can put his career back on track it is 'Cholo'. Diego Simeone (right) and Fernando Torres (left) played together at Atletico between 2003 and 2005 . Torres (top row, second left) was Simeone's captain (top row, far left) during his first spell at Atletico . Torres tweeted his excitement to be back at the club where he made his name as a teenager . Fernando Torres claims he does not regret his time at Chelsea, but his goalscoring record since joining for £50million in January 2011 does not look good: . Premier League: 20 goals in 110 games . Domestic Cups: 7 goals in 19 games . European competitions: 19 goals in 43 games . Total:  46 goals in 172 games . Torres earned a move to the Premier League after impressing for Atletico Madrid. The Spaniard scored 84 league goals in 214 games for his boyhood side before sealing a £20million switch to Liverpool. Atletico will get Torres as fit as he has been for years with famed fitness coach ‘Professor Ortega’ working on giving him back that burst of acceleration that he has lacked in recent seasons. He will not feel too much pressure because Atletico have Mario Mandzukic scoring goals and comfortably filling the gap left by Diego Costa. Torres does not go to his old club as the saviour. The expectations will not be as high as they were at Liverpool, Chelsea and AC Milan. He is expected to fill the role vacated by his old Spain strike partner David Villa last season. But the secondary role will not mean he is moving out of the limelight. Atletico are very much in the title race and they have two massive cup games coming up in January against Real Madrid - local derbies in which Torres may well start because the competition is Atletico’s third priority this season. The Spanish striker came through at Atletico as a teenager, becoming captain at the age of just 19 . Atletico Madrid: Segunda Division . Chelsea: FA Cup 2012, Champions League 2012, Europa League 2013 . Spain: Euro 2008, Euro 2012, 2010 World Cup . Torres has opened two gymnasiums in Spain recently. Both are being overseen by a close friend and business partner but now back in Spain he can be far more hands on with a venture he is hoping to expand after retirement. And before retirement he can bring his career full circle, playing in front of fans who have always adored him and never held it against him that he left for Liverpool he will be happy again. The Vicente Calderon hasn’t changed much since he left the club; Atleti are still waiting to move into a new and as yet unfinished out-of-town stadium; the team still plays in the famous red-and-white shirt; and Simeone is still the leader - albeit having changed the captain’s armband for the manager’s dugout. No wonder Torres has been texting about how happy he is to be home. Torres will be hoping the move back to his first club will help him return to his deadliest form . Torres lifts the World Cup with Spain in 2010, but has since fallen out of favour with the national team .","Fernando Torres has joined Atletico Madrid on loan from AC Milan .

"Dave Beasant is best remembered for saving a penalty during Wimbledon's famous 1988 FA Cup final victory over Liverpool - yet he was named on the bench for Stevenage a whole 26 years later. The 55-year-old, capped twice by England, was promoted to the substitutes' bench for Stevenage's trip to Brunton Park to take on Carlisle United in League Two. And if he had made an appearance, Beasant - who is Stevenage's goalkeeping coach but was rushed on to the bench as Chris Day's back-up after his 26-year-old son Sam Beasant was injured - would have become the oldest professional footballer in English history. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dave Beasant gives his favourite ever England moment . Dave Beasant was named on the Stevenage bench at the age of 55 for their trip to Carlisle United on Saturday .

Football League debut: January 12, 1980 (Wimbledon vs Blackpool) International: England (two caps, 1989), England B (seven caps, 1989-91) Goalkeeping coach: Fulham (2004-07), Northern Ireland (2004-07), Bristol Rovers (2012), Stevenage (2014-) ‘People are going to think, “Blimey, 55!” but they haven’t seen how I train,’ said Beasant. ‘In training I’ve been giving the boys a ribbing because I’ve been in the winning team. ‘I play for Chelsea old boys and England teams. When you get out there it becomes instinctive. I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t think I could l give a good account of myself.’ The current record is held by Neil McBain who played in goal for New Brighton against Hartlepool in 1947. McBain was the club's manager but he was called into action due to an injury crisis. There are just 14 managers in the Football League who are older than Beasant, highlighting how unprecedented his appearance on the bench was. Beasant, meanwhile, made his Wimbledon debut in 1980 as a 20-year-old and has not featured in the Football League since he played for Brighton in 2003. He did, however, play for North Greenford United in 2013 but that was at the lowly level of the Southern Football League. The Londoner is best remembered for his heroics in the 1988 FA Cup final when he saved John Aldridge's penalty to help Wimbledon to a famous 1-0 victory. During that match, Beasant became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final and also the first to captain his side.

On Monday, he was charged with second-degree murder and police revealed he told them he fired more shots than necessary after his gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him. Scroll down for video . Killed: The bodies of cousins Haile Kifer, 18, (left) and Nicholas Brady, 17, (right) were found stashed in the basement of a man who claimed the teenagers had broken into his home on Thanksgiving . While Minnesota law stipulates people are allowed to use deadly force when defending their . homes, relatives, friends, police and prosecutors claimed Smith reacted too drastically by killing them. 'A . person has every right to defend themselves and their homes, even . employing deadly force if necessary,' Morrison County Sheriff Michel . Wetzel said. 'Circumstances of this case however, led deputies to . believe that Smith went beyond that point.' And as he was charged on Monday, his intentions to shoot the teens dead became clear. In custody: Byron Smith was arrested after admitting to police he had killed the teens a day earlier . In a criminal complaint, Smith said . he was in the basement of his home when he heard a window breaking and . footsteps. Fearful of other recent break-ins, he shot Schaeffel when he came into view. When the teenager tumbled down the stars, Smith shot him in the face as he lay on the floor, looking up. 'I want him dead,' the complaint quoted Smith as telling an investigator. He dragged the body into his workshop . and then sat in the chair, the complaint said. When Kifer began walking . down the stairs, he shot her and she fell down the stairs. He tried to shoot her again with his rifle, but the gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him, the complaint noted. 'If you're trying to shoot somebody and . they laugh at you, you go again,' Smith, 64, told investigators, according to a criminal complaint filed . Monday. He then shot her several times in the chest with a . .22-caliber revolver, dragged her next to her cousin, and with as she . gasped for air, fired a shot under her chin 'up into the cranium'. 'Smith described it as ""a good clean finishing shot"",' according to the . compliant, and acknowledged he had fired 'more shots than . (he) needed to'. Smith said he left the bodies in his home overnight before calling a neighbor to ask if he knew a good lawyer. He later asked the neighbour to contact police. Missed: Friends and teacher expressed their shock at deaths and described Haile as a popular role model . Joker: Friends remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile . A prosecutor at Morrison County District Court . on Monday morning called Smith's reaction 'appalling'. 'Mr. Smith intentionally killed two teenagers in his home in a matter . that goes well beyond self-defense,' Morrison County Attorney Brian . Middendorf said at the hearing. Friends have taken to a memorial Facebook page for Kifer and Schaeffel to vent their anger about the deaths. Others spoke out at a vigil for the youngsters on Sunday night. 'They were just really great people,' friend Rachel Stauffer, 15, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'They . could make anyone laugh.' Carlee Davich, who coached Kifer in swimming at school, added: 'She was . always happy. She had a way that just made everyone happy. A lot of the . swimmers and divers looked up to her.' Scene: Smith has always claimed self-defense, saying he feared the teens were armed and he was on edge after earlier repeated break-ins at his home . Pain: Crystal Shaeffel, 27, cries after walking up the driveway of the home of Byron David Smith in Little Falls, Minnesota where her brother Nick Brady was shot and killed on Thursday . Emma Schmidt, a fellow classmate at Little Falls High School, said Kifer was talented and well-liked . and 'everyone's wondering' what she was doing in Smith's basement. Further . insight into the lives of the cousins was given by Brady's sister, . Crystal Shaeffel, as she visited Smith's home and spoke with his . brother. 'They were 17 and 18 years old, and didn't need to die,' she told Bruce Smith. 'That . all depends on your perspective,' he responded, referring to a series . of break-ins his brother had endured. In one in October, thieves stole . $10,000 worth of guns and electronics, he said. But Shaeffel insisted that her brother had no . need to turn to burglary, as he made good money working for their . father's tree-trimming business. She added that her cousin, who had undergone treatment for substance abuse, could have been after pills from the home. Remembered: At a candle-lit vigil on Sunday, Rachel Brady speaks about her brother Nick to the crowd . 'Yes, she had an addiction problem and stuff, but that doesn't mean she . deserves to get murdered at 18 years old,' Shaeffel said. 'I understand . they came there to rob them, or whatever, but shoot them in the shoulder . and call the cops.' On the Facebook page, friends agreed that the shootings were too severe. 'It doesn't matter what they . were or weren't doing there,' Mike Boulley wrote. 'They were KIDS that didn't deserve to die. Defending your property against armed burglars is one thing, gunning . down two unarmed teenagers is just inexcusable.' Logan Ayres added: 'It's hard to see . such nice people lose their lives to something that could of been so . easily taken care of instead of murder. R.I.P. nick and halie you will . be dearly missed.' Smith, 64, a former government employee . who reportedly worked in security for the U.S. State Department, was arrested on Friday and is being held on $2 million bail. Support: Friends on a memorial Facebook page have asked whether the appropriate force was used . According to his friends, Smith said . that he had didn’t go to police immediately after the shooting because . he panicked about the deaths. 'He . was very traumatized by what had occurred and didn’t know who to call . or what to do and that is very sad that the whole thing even happened,' Kathy Lange told KSTP-TV. His brother, Bruce Smith, said that this was the latest of eight burglaries in recent years. Byron Smith said that he suspected that the two had been responsible for at least some of those past robberies. Neighbours told the Star Tribune he kept . to himself, but they complained that he regularly shot guns on his . property and said they were concerned children playing nearby could be . hurt.

"Manager Andy Awford admits Portsmouth's away record is relegation form. Two goals from Reuben Reid, the first a penalty, and one from Lewis Alessandra means Portsmouth have not won away since August. Awford said: 'At home it's promotion form, but the away form is relegation form.' Barry Fuller's first goal in eight years earned Wimbledon a first win in seven games. The defender's long-awaited goal came when George Francomb's corner was met by Adam Barrett, who knocked down for Fuller  to tap in from six yards. Wimbledon boss Neal Ardley said: 'I thought Barry was outstanding. I'll take a bit of credit for that goal. He asked me if he could go up for it and then he turns up with a goal.' Chris Beardsley and Lee Barnard both scored twice as a rampant Stevenage hammered Cheltenham 5-1. Charlie Lee was also on target, while Byron Harrison replied for Cheltenham. Lewis Alessandra (right) celebrates scoring in Plymouth's 3-0 over Portsmouth in League Two . Stevenage manager Graham Westley sang the praises of strikers Beardsley and Barnard. He said: 'That's what they're paid to do, and it's what you always want from your strikers. It shows what work ethic can do for you.' Teenage striker James Roberts' third goal in two professional starts earned Oxford victory at fellow . strugglers York. Roberts, making his full Football League debut, grabbed the only goal in the first half after scoring twice in the FA Cup brace at Grimsby last week. Oxford manager Michael Appleton was delighted with Roberts, and said: 'He took his goal well. He continues to get in and get goalscoring chances.' Accrington manager John Coleman was a frustrated man after seeing his side's four-game unbeaten run come to an end. He said: 'I'm disappointed, but Carlisle deserved to win. No-one can argue with that. They were the better side in every department. 'Carlisle were up for the game and we weren't. They outfought us, and I've no complaints about the result.' Derek Asamoah's first-half goal proved enough for Carlisle. Lee Barnard slides in a goal for Stevenage in their 5-1 victory against Cheltenham . Southend manager Phil Brown was delighted to see his side bounce back from last weekend's FA Cup humiliation against Conference club Chester. David Worrall's third goal in five games was enough to send Hartlepool back to the bottom of the Football League and a delighted Brown said: 'It was a massive win for us after the disappointment of the FA Cup, which I believe we've put behind us now.' Kevin Ellison was Morecambe's goal hero as they shocked high-flying Bury. The veteran front-man scored 20 minutes from time to earn his struggling side a first win since September. Assistant manager Ken McKenna said: 'We changed our system, which was a brave decision, and it worked really well.' Bobby Grant and James Collins scored as Shrewsbury saw off Mansfield, who had Jamie McGuire sent off in the first half. But Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon, whose side went second, warned: 'We've done nothing except pick up another three points to add to the tally that we have, so we won't get carried away.' Substitute Ricky Miller scored within three minutes of coming off the bench to put Luton back on top of the table with victory over Tranmere. The summer signing from Boston United cut in on to his left foot and put away a fine curling shot from 20 yards. Luton coach Hakan Hayrettin praised Miller, saying: 'I don't think they expected him to turn and shoot from where he did, but we know he's capable of that.'","Portsmouth lose 3-0 at Plymouth as woeful away form continues .

"Frank Lampard is set to remain at Manchester City until the end of the season after the club thrashed out a deal with New York City and had it ratified by the Premier League. City had been locked in high-level with talks with the Premier League on Wednesday afternoon as they looked to secure Lampard's availability for the New Years Day match against Sunderland. It is understood that the Premier League board have now granted their approval to the amendment of Lampard's deal and he is eligible to face Sunderland tomorrow afternoon. Frank Lampard pictured in training on Wednesday. He will stay at Manchester City until the end of the season . Lampard in action for Manchester City at West Brom on Boxing Day. City won the match 3-1 . A club statement read: 'Manchester City can confirm that it has extended Frank Lampard's contract up to the end of Manchester City's season, enabling his participation in both domestic and European campaigns.' Lampard has spent the first half of the season on a short-term deal at City after signing a pre-contract agreement with sister outfit New York City FC that was due to commence on January 1. The two clubs have now reached an agreement that allows the midfielder to remain in Manchester. He remains a contracted Manchester City player and is not at this moment associated with the New York side. Lampard celebrates after scoring for City in their win at Leicester City in mid-December . It may be viewed as a blow to the credibility of the American enterprise as the needs of Manchester appear to have been placed above the growth of New York City, after Lampard was unveiled as one of their signature signings last summer. His exact starting date in New York remains to be decided. On Wednesday evening, City sources were not ruling out the possibility that Lampard could yet return to New York for the beginning of the MLS season in March or later on in Manchester City's season. For that to happen, the two clubs would have to agree a loan deal from Manchester City or a permanent transfer. It appears to be a possibility that remains open for discussion, although it seems most likely that Lampard will remain in Manchester as long as Manuel Pellegrini believes he has a role to play at the club. A New York City statement said: 'His exact starting date with New York City FC will be confirmed as the EPL and MLS seasons unfold. All parties remain in continuing dialogue to create the best outcome for all.' The Third Rail, who claim to be the first independent supporters group for New York City FC, reacted furiously to the news on Friday. On behalf of the Third Rail, we would like to publicly denounce City Football Group’s and Frank Lampard’s decision to extend his loan to Manchester City until the end of the Premier League season. Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets, and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City. Many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision, and we support any course of action they take to voice their discontent over this decision. Our support for our ownership group has been unwavering until now, but this we cannot support. We reject out of hand any suggestion that NYCFC is in any way secondary to Manchester City FC, regardless of the source, and are disappointed that City Football Group would give such an appearance. The Third Rail will forever act as a voice for the fans of New York City Football Club.","Deal agreed to keep Frank Lampard at Manchester City until end of season .

"Dutch champions Ajax have signed teenage goalkeeper Andre Onana from Barcelona on a three-year contract, Ajax said on Saturday. The 18-year-old, originally from Cameroon, has been the subject of interest from several European clubs but has done a deal until mid-2018 with Ajax. His contract with the Spanish club runs out in June. Onana has been in Barcelona's youth system since 2010 and this season was promoted to their Under-19 side. Barcelona youth goalkeeper Andre Onana has signed a three year deal with Dutch champions Ajax . Onana played for Barcelona against Ajax in November in the UEFA Youth League, the continental youth competition for clubs competing in the Champions League, but he has not played a senior game. Barcelona have another Cameroonian teenaged goalkeeper on their books. Fabrice Ondoa, 19, is expected to be first choice for his country at this month's African Nations Cup finals even though he has never played for his club's first team.","Ajax sign 18-year-old Andre Onana from Barcelona in a three-year deal .

"John Carver will use Sir Bobby Robson as inspiration as he bids to win the Newcastle United’s manager job on a permanent basis. The caretaker boss has revealed that Robson – who he served under as assistant for five years - told him to seize any chance he ever had to take charge of the Magpies. And Carver admits he has picked up Robson’s autobiography in the days since he was asked to take care of first-team matters in the wake of Alan Pardew’s decision to quit Tyneside. John Carver (right) believes Sir Bobby Robson will be looking down on him in the Newcastle dugout . The pair worked together at St James' Park as Robson led the Magpies into the Champions League . Carver says Robson is never far from his thoughts . ‘For some reason, I started reading Sir Bobby’s autobiography,’ said the 49-year-old ahead of the visit of Burnley. ‘I read about me and Craig Bellamy (fighting) at the airport and all that. It was quite funny. ‘There was a message at the front of the book – “thanks for a fantastic, successful five years, it should have been a lot longer, cheers, Sir Bobby.” ‘When he gave me that book, he said to me, “you do realise how big this football club is and if ever you get an opportunity, don’t be scared of it, enjoy it and take it with both hands”. ‘So I am sitting here now and I’m going to take it with both hands.’ Carver enjoyed his only caretaker game in charge of his hometown club following Robson’s sacking in 2004. The Magpies won 3-0 and Robson telephoned Carver the night before to wish him luck. And he believes his old mentor will again be looking down on him this afternoon. ‘I’m a catholic and I believe he will be looking down on me, I really do,’ said Carver, who will also take charge of Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie at Leicester City. ‘That was why I had the inspiration to get the book and started reading it. He talked about the time he went to Canada, similar to myself because I went there. ‘Lots of things started coming back into my head. He will be there with us. He will be in the technical area with us, let me tell you that, because I never stop thinking about him. ‘Apart from my mum and dad who I lost recently, there are two people I never stop thinking about - he is one of them and Gary Speed is the other. Alan Pardew left Newcastle earlier this week and will take over at Crystal Palace . ‘They are always with us, and I think about them every game. They were good football people. And both of those figures understood what it meant to play and manage at this football club.’ Carver could well be handed the role on a full-time basis until the end of the season at least should he impress over the coming week. And the former academy head concedes it would be impossible to refuse such an offer. ‘Of course it is (my dream job),’ he said. ‘I’m a local lad and it’s a dream job for anybody. ‘When I first had the conversation with Alan before I came here, he said to me, “do you have aspirations to be a manager again?”. Carver says landing the Newcastle job would be a 'dream' for any local North East lad . ‘I explained that I had done it in Canada with Toronto and I enjoyed it, I loved it, but the fact that you’re bringing me back to my football club means I'm quite happy to be an assistant. ‘In your head, though, you always want to do it. If you asked 100 assistant managers, I think 99.9 per cent would say they would want to do and they would be lying if they didn’t. ‘But that’s not something for now, for me. Now is preparing the team for Burnley and trying to get the right result for the club. ‘Let’s get two wins and then we’ll address it after that.’","John Carver is bidding to become Newcastle's next permanent manager .

"Liverpool are confident Steven Gerrard will sign a new deal at Anfield even though their captain is free to talk to other clubs from New Year's Day. Gerrard entered the final six months of his contract at midnight, and the 34-year-old can now negotiate with foreign teams over a move in the summer. Toronto FC and New York Red Bulls have both expressed a strong interest in taking Gerrard to the MLS. He has also been linked with Inter Milan. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers defending Raheem Sterling's slap . Steven Gerrard (right, running alongside Mario Balotelli) has entered the final six months of his contract . Gerrard is now free to talk to foreign clubs with a view to a summer move away from Anfield . Gerrard, who returns to the starting line-up at home to Leicester City today after he was an unused substitute in Monday’s win over Swansea, is expected to weigh up his options between now and the end of the season, when he will also be able to talk to Premier League clubs. Asked if he was comfortable with the new situation, manager Brendan Rodgers said: ‘I think he’s earned that respect if he does (talk to other clubs). ‘I’ve got a great relationship and communication with Steven. He’s a wonderful player, a wonderful servant to this football club, and in my time here he’s been brilliant for me. ‘When I came in here two-and-a-half years ago, everyone asked if he could play my type of football or if his legs had gone. You’ve seen him over the last couple of years. He could have been player of the year last season. ‘I’m managing his game time. He understands my situation of picking the best team and making it fresh as often as we can.’ Brendan Rodgers is confident that Gerrard will sign a new contract and extend his stay at Liverpool . Gerrard (pictured warming up as a substitute against Swansea) hasn't played as many games this season . Meanwhile, Rodgers has backed Raheem Sterling to keep his cool in future after the England forward escaped punishment for slapping Swansea defender Federico Fernandez in retaliation on Monday night. Referee Andre Marriner took no action at the time and the FA were unable to follow up the incident because it had been seen by the match officials. Rodgers believes the 20-year-old’s ability to ‘make defenders look silly’ will mark him out as a potential target. ‘I’ve been so impressed with Raheem’s ability to deal with pressure,’ added the Liverpool boss. ‘He was 17 years of age when he broke into the team. Of course, there will be moments in the game when the red mist can come across you. I’ve got no qualms about how he can deal with those moments. ‘Teams and players may want to do that but it’s important that you maintain self-control and concentrate on your performance. Liverpool's Raheem Sterling (right) swung an arm towards the face of Federico Fernandez (left) on Monday . Rodgers backed Sterling despite his spat with the Swansea defender on Monday night . ‘It was just an unfortunate incident. They’d been niggling at each other all game. Fernandez is a good defender and when there’s a boy of 20 years of age running away from you all the time, it’s never going to be easy. Raheem can make defenders look really silly, not just with his pace but with his strength.’ Rodgers revealed Liverpool are unlikely to spend in the transfer window although it is believed a loan signing is a possibility. In an end-of-year message to supporters, chairman Tom Werner said the club’s owners understand their team’s disappointing start to the season following the departure of Luis Suarez and influx of new signings in the summer. ‘As you would expect losing a footballer as capable as Luis Suarez and making a number of new signings, our season has gotten off to a slower start than we would have wanted,’ wrote Lerner. ‘However, in the past few weeks we are pleased to see positive signs as new players start to settle into life at Anfield.’","Steven Gerrard can talk to clubs abroad as of New Year's Day .

"Six months into his time at Manchester United and Louis van Gaal already believes he has reason to be grateful. Heading in to the second half of the Barclays Premier League season, the Dutchman sees his team on the shoulder of title favourites Chelsea and Manchester City. If United don’t quite look like title contenders, they do resemble a team heading in the right direction. It wasn’t always like this for Van Gaal and his team, though. Having taken only 13 points from their first 10 league games, United were struggling at the start of November and their manager thanked the club’s supporters for showing patience he feels he wouldn’t have received at his previous clubs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal telling a journalist to Google his Bayern record . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has thanks the fans for their unwavering support . The supporters have always backed their new manager despite a rocky start to the season . Asked if anything had surprised him about his time at United, Van Gaal said: ‘The fans. I have never had the experience that when you lose or draw at home that the fans are still applauding for you, showing their belief in you. Never. ‘In Barcelona, the white handkerchiefs would have come out. In Bayern Munich, they would have been whistling. In Amsterdam, Ajax, they would have been shouting for my “friend” Cruyff (to replace me). ‘Here, they are applauding — they stand up and applaud. Unbelievable. That’s why I’m thanking the fans because they were very important in my first six months. ‘Early on, it was more weak than good. In spite of that, the fans have supported us always and in the right way. They always had belief in the players and their manager, and I think the main reason they have supported us is because of the fighting spirit of my team. ‘We were not always ahead in matches, but they have fought to the end and a lot of times with good success, so I think we can be satisfied about the points now — 36 points.’ Van Gaal takes his United side to the Britannia Stadium and Stoke City on New Year's Day . Wayne Rooney has flourished in a number of roles under the Dutchman since his arrival . As he looked ahead to a New Year that will see injured players returning, Van Gaal has not ruled out a dip at the title. For that to happen, Chelsea and City would have to show uncharacteristic weakness but Van Gaal is perhaps too experienced to rule anything out. In fact, he pointed out ahead of today’s game at Stoke City that his first title in the German Bundesliga with Bayern came from a similar position. ‘Maybe you can see the Bayern results of my first year,’ he said. ‘I think that I have more points now with Manchester United than with Bayern Munich at the same time that year. But at the end of the season, we were champions. ‘But you cannot compare the German league with the English league. It’s apples with pears — that’s a Dutch expression. ‘It all depends on Chelsea and Manchester City. They are the only teams who are above and you have seen Manchester City — in spite of a 2-0 result at half-time on Sunday, it was 2-2 at the end. You have to compare always with this kind of club. Robin van Persie (battling with Hugo Lloris) has found himself in among the goals again . United are also beginning to see the best of Colombian striker Radamel Falcao . ‘But in our last three games — Aston Villa, Newcastle, Tottenham — that should be nine points in my opinion. Then, we have four points more and then only six points behind. ‘It’s not always that the best team is winning and that’s also nice in football I think. You never can predict. ‘I could not predict that Manchester City, at home, allows Burnley — last, or one of the last on the table — to come back. I could not imagine. But when I read it, it was true.’ United are unbeaten now in nine matches, a run that has moved them up the table. A 2-1 home win against Stoke formed part of that run, with United hanging on at the end of that game under pressure from Mark Hughes’ team. Van Gaal moved to praise referee Michael Oliver, who will take charge of the game at Stoke . Stoke are in somewhat less consistent form at the moment, but Van Gaal knows they will be highly motivated for a game that is likely to test United’s physical durability in more ways than one. ‘I hope that my players are recovered,’ Van Gaal said. ‘We have now one and a half days more than between the matches against Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur, so I don’t think that plays a role. ‘But I think the referee is the most important man on the pitch always in relation to tackles. He has to allow it or not. ‘We have Michael Oliver, I believe, and I think he is a very good referee.’","Manchester United currently sit third in the Premier League .

The extent of Valencia's thigh injury and the length of time he will be absent is not yet known . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has lost faith in Brazilian right back Rafael . Young pulled up in the 74th minute at the Britannia Stadium and was replaced by Rafael - the same player who came on for Valencia when he was taken off during the half-time interval against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Valencia has emerged as United's first-choice right back under Van Gaal and had started the previous 10 Premier League games. The extent of the injury and the length of time Valencia will be missing is not yet known, but Van Gaal will hoping it is not serious as the Dutchman has lost faith in Brazilian right back Rafael, who was left on the bench for the clash at the Britannia before replacing Young. It is a position that United are prioritising in the January transfer window. The Dutchman admitted his side 'had difficulties defending long balls' in an awkward swirling wind in the 1-1 draw at Stoke. Jonny Evans was particularly thankful to see former team-mate Mame Biram Diouf miss a clear chance after the Northern Ireland international misjudged a long ball. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal speaks during a press conference on Tuesday . 'It was scrappy, hard to judge the ball with the wind, but that's the challenge for us,' said Evans. '(Diouf) made a bit of a mess of it and I'm thankful for that.' Stoke boss Mark Hughes was frustrated by not just the handball appeal, but another penalty shout after Crouch's header against the woodwork. 'We've had two penalties not given,' he said. 'The obvious one was when Crouch headed towards goal and Smalling basically batted the ball down. 'Then when Crouch hits the post, you see Geoff Cameron waiting to put the ball in and he gets taken out.' A frustrated Van Gaal makes a point to the fourth official during the match at White Hart Lane on Sunday . He said of his side's overall performance: 'Tactically we were spot-on, they found it very difficult to get their key players on the ball. 'I'm disappointed but pleased we've got more points on the board and a good performance once again. Hughes also insisted there is 'nothing' in reports linking Crouch with West Brom and former coach Tony Pulis, adding: 'Peter's a big part of what we do here.' And he revealed playmaker Bojan will be out for another '10 days to a couple of weeks' with a hamstring problem.","Ashley Young hobbled off after 73 minutes against Stoke City .

"Manchester City remain locked in discussions with the Premier League as the clock ticks down on their attempts to secure Frank Lampard's availability for the New Years Day match at home to Sunderland. Sportsmail understands that the situation remains 'live and complex' and despite Manchester City's optimism that an agreement can be struck, issues remain that must be resolved with the Premier League. Lampard's short-term deal at Manchester City expires on December 31 and in order to ensure that he is not ineligible to play against Sunderland, the club must reach an agreement with New York City FC and ratify the movement with the Premier League.

It is understood that if a Premier League club wishes to amend an existing contract of a player - as City wish to do with Lampard - then they require the permission of the Barclays Premier League board. This is the process that is continuing late into the afternoon. It is believed that City have written to the Premier League to attempt to find a solution. City are understood to have agreed a deal with their sister outfit in New York that will allow them to renew Lampard's loan but the length of that deal remains unknown. One suggestion is that he will sign a deal until the end of the season but it will include a break clause that would allow him to return to New York for the beginning of the MLS season in March, should all parties agree to it. Although the transfer window does not open until January 3, Lampard's registration is not in doubt as the timespan for registering players goes from transfer window to transfer window, rather than being defined by the length of a player's contract. However, in order to play against Sunderland on New Years Day, he must have his contract at Manchester City amended and that necessitates approval from the Premier League board. This is still to be granted by the governing body but talks are ongoing. Manchester City are locked in conversations with football authorities in their attempts to keep Lampard .

"Manchester United earned a hard-fought point at the Britannia Stadium after coming from behind to draw 1-1 against Stoke City. Ryan Shawcross put the home side ahead before Radamel Falcao showed his poacher's instinct to level the score. Here, Sportsmail runs through how the players performed. VIDEO Scroll down to see Van Gaal on which side he thought should have won the game . STOKE CITY (4-2-3-1) ASMIR BEGOVIC - 6 . Bred confidence with his handling at set pieces but angered Robin van Persie by claiming a Wayne Rooney through ball with his studs raised dangerously. RVP had a right to be annoyed. GEOFF CAMERON - 5.5 . Needed the help of Jonathan Walters to stop the persistent United raids down their left-hand side. Stuck to the task though. RYAN SHAWCROSS - 7 . Former Manchester United trainee reacted like a instinctive striker to volley in Peter Crouch's header inside two minutes but was later taken in by Michael Carrick's flick-on for the equaliser. Ryan Shawcross (left) turns away in celebration after putting Stoke City ahead at the Britannia Stadium . MARC MUNIESA - 6 . Used all the experience gained in the Spanish game by breaking up play with 'professional' fouls when the occasion dictated it. Nowhere near Radamel Falcao for the equaliser and nearly gifted Van Persie an injury-time winner but recovered to stop the ball reaching him. ERIK PIETERS - 6 . Excellent delivery when he got forward but defensively was pulled around too much by United's quicksilver forwards. STEVEN NZONZI - 6 . Overshadowed for once by Glenn Whelan in the central midfield area. Found Rooney's clever movement a problem and gave away free-kicks. Steven Nzonzi (left) of Stoke challenges Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney for the ball . GLENN WHELAN - 6.5 . Did the ugly defensive work in midfield with real aplomb, always prepared to put his foot in to get a tackle on the likes of Rooney. MARKO ARNAUTOVIC - 7 . Erratic and unpredictable but pure quality at other times. His range of passing meant the injured Bojan Krkic wasn't missed as much as feared. Fantastic free-kick led to Crouch hitting the post and his set pieces were always a threat. JONATHAN WALTERS - 6 . Work-rate never in doubt but lucky not to gift United a penalty when he blocked Luke Shaw's cross with his hand. His battle with Shaw was one of the game's highlights. Stoke's Jonathan Walters (left) and Luke Shaw of Man United compete for the ball at the Britannia . MAME BIRAM DIOUF - 6.5 . No wonder Mark Hughes says he will miss the forward when he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations this month with Senegal. Harried the United defence and dispossessed Jonny Evans before shooting wide. Had a cracking shot deflected wide by Chris Smalling. PETER CROUCH - 8 . A real handful who gave United's defence problems throughout. Showed why Stoke won't want to lose him in January by cleverly peeling away to the edge of the box to set up the early goal for Shawcross with a great header. Appealed strongly for a penalty when another header hit Smalling on the arm and also hit the post. Peter Crouch (left) of Stoke is brought down by Phil Jones of Man United on New Year's Day . SUBS: . Oussama Assaidi (for Arnautovic 81) Subs not used: Butland, Huth, Bardsley, Wilson, Adam, Shenton . MANAGER: MARK HUGHES - 7 . The Stoke boss felt there was a weakness in United's defence and tried to exploit it with the size of Crouch and pace of Diouf. Stoke's set-piece delivery was excellent. MANCHESTER UNITED (3-5-2) DAVID DE GEA - 6 . Doesn't relish coming to the Potteries and though he wasn't overworked he allowed Shawcross to score inside the six yard box and was helpless when Crouch beat Smalling in the air and headed against the upright. PHIL JONES - 6 . Needed all his physical attributes in a heavyweight battle with Crouch and gave as good as he got after a disastrous start when he let the 6ft 7in centre forward set up the first goal. CHRIS SMALLING - 6.5 . As the main central defender, it wasn't great that Crouch and then Shawcross had time in the box when Stoke scored from their early corner. Improved as the match wore on and got a vital block to deflect Diouf's goalbound shot wide. Stoke felt they should have had a penalty though when Crouch's header hit him on the arm. Jonny Evans (right) slipped in the first half and Mame Biram Diouf should have doubled Stoke's lead . JONNY EVANS - 5 . One player who just hasn't looked comfortable for some reason with Louis van Gaal's three at the back. Hesitated when put under pressure by Diouf and fortunate the Stoke forward missed and nervy throughout. ASHLEY YOUNG - 6 . Has been the most improved United player under Van Gaal. Having played on the left in recent weeks, he switched to the right to accommodate Shaw and mucked in for his team, even winning defensive headers. LUKE SHAW - 7.5 . Impressive energy given that it was the youngster's first start for six weeks after injury. Got forward from wingback and could have won a penalty when Walters handled his cross. Michael Carrick (right) jumps to compete for the ball with Stoke's Glenn Whelan . MICHAEL CARRICK - 7 . Showed there is more to his game than clever passing when he got in ahead of team-mate Jones to expertly flick on Rooney's corner for Falcao to score. A Rolls Royce in midfield. JUAN MATA - 5.5 . One of those afternoons. A windy, cloudy wet day in Stoke when the Spaniard couldn't get on the ball consistently to influence things. His recent form has been good but his place remains vulnerable once Daley Blind is fit again allowing Rooney to push further up. WAYNE ROONEY - 6.5 . His early frustrations included a slip and vainly appealing for a penalty but those were eradicated when his excellent right-foot corner led to a United equaliser. He is becoming a genuine leader in the team. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (right) runs with the ball as Geoff Cameron looks on . ROBIN VAN PERSIE - 5.5 . Largely anonymous in the first half but became embroiled in some handbags with Begovic after the keeper aimed his studs at him as he collected an attempted Rooney through-ball. Had one sight of goal late on and his volley was just wide. RADAMEL FALCAO - 6.5 . Has to be right up there among the Premier League's best penalty-area finishers. Reacted quicker than anyone else to convert Carrick's flick and make it 1-1. Can't be left alone for a moment. Radamel Falcao (second right) showed his poacher's instinct to scored Manchester United's equaliser . SUBS: . Ander Herrera (for Falcao 64) 5.5, Adnan Januzaj (for Shaw 64) 5.5, Rafael (for Young 75) Subs not used: Lindegaard, Blackett, Fletcher, Wilson . MANAGER: LOUIS VAN GAAL - 6.5 . Credit for picking such an attacking line-up at Stoke with Falcao, Van Persie, Rooney and Mata all starting. They did create chances but were left vulnerable at the back. REFEREE . MICHAEL OLIVER - 6.5 . Stoke will feel he should have awarded them a penalty at 1-1 when the ball hit Smalling on the arm after an effort from Crouch, but Oliver will feel the United defender was so close he wouldn't have been able to get out the way. United arguably had an even better case after Walters blocked Shaw's cross with his hand. Kept the game flowing though and didn't have to book anyone in a rumbustious contest. Stoke City players surround referee Michael Oliver after he failed to award a penalty at the Britannia .","Stoke City drew 1-1 with Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium .

"Stoke City talisman Bojan Krkic is out of his side's New Years' Day clash against Manchester United. The in-form forward went off with a suspected hamstring injury in the victory against West Brom on Sunday. Sportsmail understands that Bojan underwent medical tests on Tuesday afternoon and they have revealed minimal damage to an interior muscle between the hamstring and groin. Bojan will miss Stoke's Premier League clash against Manchester United on New Year's Day . The 24-year-old is also expected to miss Stoke's third round FA Cup clash against Wrexham . However, the lunchtime visit of United to the Britannia Stadium comes too soon and the former Barcelona star is expected to be out for around a week. He will also sit out the FA Cup match against Wrexham on Sunday. Bojan has scored three Premier League goals since joining Stoke in the summer. Stoke manager Mark Hughes will be unable to call on the services of Bojan for his side's next two matches .","Stoke forward Bojan underwent medical tests on Tuesday afternoon .

"Frank Lampard underlined his value to Manchester City - and reminded two clubs of what they are missing - with a dramatic winner for the champions against Sunderland. The former England midfielder came off the bench at the Etihad Stadium to head the decisive goal in a remarkable 3-2 victory for City in the Barclays Premier League. The result put City joint top of the table with Lampard's former club Chelsea, who were beaten by Tottenham later in the day. Frank Lampard has extended his loan deal at Manchester City until the end of the season . Lampard came off the bench  to head the decisive goal in their 3-2 victory for City in the Premier League . Lampard was eligible to face Sunderland on New Year's Day after the extension was officially agreed . It also emphasised the qualities New York City will have to wait longer to benefit from, coming less than a day after it was confirmed the 36-year-old's expected move to Major League Soccer would be delayed. Lampard is now set to stay with City until the end of the season after a controversial agreement was reached with the club's sister outfit in the United States on New Year's Eve. Supporters of NYC have been enraged as the player has been used extensively in the American club's marketing for their debut MLS season, which begins in March. City manager Manuel Pellegrini claims he can understand the feelings of the fans Stateside but he himself is clearly happy with the situation. Pellegrini said: 'Maybe all the New York fans, and I understand perfectly, they want to see Frank playing, because for the fans in New York to see Frank play is an amazing thing. 'I hope that he will be there next year but I think that in this moment the best decision for him, for the club, for New York is to stay here with us.' Manuel Pellegrini (left) feels it is the 'best decision' that Lampard (right) stays at the Etihad . Pellegrini: 'I hope that he will be there next year but I think that in this moment the best decision for him, for the club, for New York is to stay here with us' The nature of Lampard's contract with City is still not clear. It was assumed that he had been on loan in Manchester from NYC but now it appears he was on a short-term, full-time contract with City with a view to moving to the American club after it expired on December 31. That agreement has now been extended until the end of City's season. The suggestion is he will then move to New York but the possibility could exist that he might stay even longer in Manchester. Pellegrini would not be drawn on that scenario at his post-match press conference. 'You cannot have all different questions about Frank Lampard,' he said. 'He will stay now with us until the end of the season.' The suggestion is he will  move to New York but the possibility could exist that he might stay even longer . The reason City wanted to keep Lampard was apparent as he settled nerves after a brilliant Sunderland fightback on New Year's Day. He might not have been playing had his contract extension not been ratified, but Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was not concerned about his status. He said: 'It looked to me last week that it was not possible (for Lampard to play) but apparently it was. How I don't know, I'm not an expert on the rules and regulations - but he made a difference, he scored the winning goal. 'For me it's clever, it's smart. It's legal, so I've got no problem with that.' Pellegrini's men came out on top in a 3-2 win over Sunderland at the Etihad on New Year's Day .","Frank Lampard scored the winner against Sunderland on New Year's Day .

"From a potential heavyweight Champions League final clash to Rory McIlroy hoping to make history at the Masters in April. And from the possibility of arguably the biggest boxing bout in history between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, to the prospect of a Rugby World Cup on home soil - it's fair to say that 2015 is set to be another massive year in the world of sport. Here, Sportsmail's reporters pick the golden ticket moments that they are hoping to see in the next 12 months. MATT BARLOW . Imagine... the first Merszczeyside derby, with a Liverpool vs Everton shoot-out in the Europa League final in Warsaw and a place in the Champions League 2015/16 at stake, in the magnificent stadium where they forgot to close the roof when England played Poland in 2012 and had to delay the game for 24 hours. Brendan Rodger's Liverpool side dropped into the Europa League after exiting the Champions League group . They could face rivals Everton at some stage in the competition after they finished top of their group . ROB DRAPER . Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich, hopefully in the Champions League final in Berlin. Of course, if Chelsea can kick on and build on their domestic dominance, then it would be intriguing to see an English side take on Europe’s best. But the top two sides in the world right now look to be Real and Bayern – and they probably have the  two finest coaches as well. Last year Carlo Ancelotti completely outwitted an uncharacteristically indecisive Pep Guardiola. This year Pep will be ready. One team boasts the core of the world champions while the other has Ronaldo, James and Bale. Toni Kroos and Xabi Alonso have swapped sides. When football clubs playing this well meet, the result ought to be something special. Cristiano Ronaldo finishes past Manuel Neuer during Real Madrid's Champions League semi-final victory over Bayern Munich in April this year. Real won the second leg 4-0 and 5-0 in the tie on aggregate . Franck Ribery, Neuer and Toni Kroos console each other after being beaten by Real Madrid . DEREK LAWRENSON . It’s always a privilege to cover the Masters but it will be even more so next April with Rory McIlroy trying to win his third major in a row and become just the sixth golfer to complete the career Grand Slam at the age of just 25. Rory McIlroy will be hoping to build on his major successes at the Masters in April. MIKE DICKSON . There is much to look forward to in 2015, which could see Rafael Nadal win the French Open for a staggering tenth  time. Or, given the uncertainties surrounding his health, it could be the year when Novak Djokovic defeats him there to complete his own collection of Grand Slams. If these two meet in Paris in the Springtime it will be one of the all-time heavyweight clashes in tennis. Rafael Nadal could be set to win an unprecedent 10th French Open title in 2015 . JEFF POWELL . Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao in May, followed by the winner vs Amir Khan in September In boxing great things go in pairs. The world has waited seemingly an eternity to see the Money man and the PacMan in the richest fight in ring history. King Khan has been kept waiting ages to fight one of them. May they get it on, then on again in 2015. RIATH AL-SAMARRAI . Mayweather-Pacquiao, even if it has taken far too long to make. The build-up would be immense but I suspect I'd struggle to get away from the thought that it should have happened four or five years ago. Neither man is the force he was, particularly Pacquiao, so whatever follows would come with a little regret. Would I want to miss it? No chance. Floyd Mayweather could finally be set to face Manny Pacquiao in 2015 . The fight would be the richest and one of the biggest in the history of boxing . MARCUS TOWNEND . Treve’s attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe three times on the first Sunday of October at Paris racecourse Longchamp. Trainer Criquette Head-Maarek never lost faith in her wonder filly despite three defeats in the run-up to her emphatic second success under veteran jockey Thierry Jarnet, who had controversially replaced Frankie Dettori, No 1 jockey to Treve’s owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani. After the second Arc, Treve’s retirement was announced but the decision was reversed as Head-Maarek convinced the Sheik that Treve could make history.Plenty will be cheering her on and Longchamp, on the one day of the year the track comes alive, should be throbbing. Thierry Jarnet, riding Treve (centre), celebrates after crossing the line to win 2013 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe . CHRIS CUTMORE . Without meaning to go all Eddie Butler and prattle on pretentiously, rugby is a game that thrives on ancient and long-fought rivalries and Twickenham will be a seething pit of fire and song on September 29. Wales have recently made a habit of humiliating England in the Six Nations and it’s about time Chris Robshaw and Co wreaked their revenge on the grandest stage of all. Oh, and it’s time to teach them a lesson for trying to get the game staged in Wales too! England and Wales are set to face each other in the World Cup group stage in September . SIMEON GHOLAM . Yes, he may have won it seven times before. And yes, he may have won 17 Grand Slams in total. But for Roger Federer to come so close to another Wimbledon title last July and fall to Novak Djokovic at the final hurdle was agonising to watch. To see old master lift the famous trophy just one more time in 2015 would be a fantastic moment that he deserves following his impressive resurgence in form. If not then I guess Andy Murray would do instead!. Roger Federer lifted his most recent Wimbledon title and Grand Slam trophy in 2012 . JOE STRANGE . Rory McIlroy dominated golf in 2014 but nobody was as consistent at the majors as Rickie Fowler. The colourful American finished in the top five at the Masters, the Open, the US Open and the US PGA Championship but failed to lift a single trophy. Fowler took his game to a new level this year and has the potential to get even better next season. A major victory on home soil, ideally at Chambers Bay in June, would be ideal. Rickie Fowler will be targeting his first major win next year after a breakthrough season in 2014 .","Real Madrid v Bayern Munich is a potential dream Champions League final .

"Manchester City face a race against time to secure Frank Lampard's availability for the home match against Sunderland on New Year's Day. It is situation that remains as clear as mud as City attempt to break through the red tape and ensure he can play. Here is everything you need to know: . What is Lampard's contractual situation? Lampard is in fact on a short-deal at Manchester City that began in the summer and expires at midnight on New Year's Day. Frank Lampard trains with his team-mates but may not join them in the side on New Year's Day . Lampard has been a hit for Manchester City since joining on loan from New York City FC . So he is not on loan from New York City as things stand? No. Lampard agreed a pre-contract agreement in the summer with the American side and he was then unveiled as their player. However, his deal in New York does not commence until January 1. How can City secure his services for the second half of the season? For Lampard to remain a Manchester City player, the club must agree a loan deal with their sister outfit in New York. Pellegrini would like that deal to last until the end of the season. There was initial opposition from the States but it is understood that that tension has now subsided and an agreement has been reached with the sides. It is most likely that an indefinite loan deal will be agreed that allows Lampard to stay with Manchester City until the end of the season. However, it would also include a break clause that could allow Lampard to return to New York for the start of the MLS season in March or later if Manchester City's quest for trophies was to fall apart. How have they managed to reach a compromise? We imagine it all went a little bit like this: Ferran Soriano, chief executive officer of Manchester City calls up Ferran Soriano, chief executive officer of New York City FC and the two chaps found an agreement. Ferran Soriano is the chief executive officer of Manchester City and New York City FC . So what is the sticking point? Lampard's Manchester City deal expires at midnight on New Year's Day. It is understood that if a Premier League club wishes to amend an existing contract of a player - as City wish to do with Lampard - then they require the permission of the Barclays Premier League board. This is the process that is continuing. So is he ineligible to play on New Year's Day? If this cannot be resolved, he cannot play. The situation remained 'live and complex' as of Wednesday afternoon, according to our sources, but City are still hopeful. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is keen on keeping hold of Lampard . Is there an issue with renewing his registration as the transfer window does not open until January 3? Although the transfer window does not open until January 3, Lampard's registration is not in doubt as the timespan for registering players goes from transfer window to transfer window, rather than being defined by the length of a player's contract. So what remains to be done? However, the Premier League board must sanction the amendment to the contract for this to happen. This, it is hoped, can be done outside of the transfer window. There remains a significant amount of paperwork to resolve that must pass through the Premier League. It must be squared off by the Premier League to allow Lampard to play. Senior sources at City maintained on Wednesday that they remained hopeful of securing his registration. He is very much in Pellegrini's thinking for the matchday squad.","Manchester City are keen on keeping hold of Frank Lampard .

"Tony Pulis will only accept the vacant manager’s position at West Bromwich Albion if he is given sole charge of first-team affairs at the club. An agent and a lawyer representing the former Stoke and Crystal Palace boss have been in talks with the West Brom hierarchy after the dismissal on Monday night of first team coach Alan Irvine. But Sportsmail understands Pulis sent in his representatives with strict instructions not to agree to a position that fits into the current management structure of the struggling Premier League club. Tony Pulis's representatives are in talks with West Brom over the vacant manager's position . Alan Irvine (above) was sacked as first team coach by West Bromwich Albion on Monday evening . At nearly 57 Pulis has no interest in allowing a technical director to recruit his players when he prefers to trust his own judgement. It was over recruitment that he parted company with Palace in the summer and it is an area in which he will not compromise. Indeed Sportsmail understands Pulis has already rejected the advances of Newcastle, who are also understood to have approached him through intermediaries but stated immediately that he would have to fit into their own management structure with owner Mike Ashley and head scout Graham Carr. It means West Brom owner and chairman Jeremy Peace would have to rethink the structure of a club that currently has Terry Burton as technical director – and head of recruitment – and Richard Garlick as sporting director. Tony Pulis working for BT Sport ahead of the Manchester City v Crystal Palace match earlier this month . Pulis in charge at Crystal Palace last season before he left the club during the summer . But the fact Peace has contacted Pulis through intermediaries would suggest he might be ready to accept the terms of a more traditional manager given the difficulties West Brom have endured since losing Roy Hodgson and Dan Ashworth to the FA. If that is the case, Pulis will then agree to meeting Peace to discuss the finer details of becoming the next manager of West Brom. The club have also made contact with former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood, who came close to landing the job last summer before talks broke down over wages and his desire to bring in assistants Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey. Sherwood has been out of work for nearly eight months since leaving Spurs. Former Tottenham Hotspur boss Tim Sherwood is also in contention for the job at West Brom .","Tony Pulis's agent and lawyer are in talks with the West Brom hierarchy .

"Alan Pardew becomes new Crystal Palace boss as Newcastle United thrash out £2million compensation deal with Eagles . Hull City boss Steve Bruce is interested in replacing Alan Pardew as manager of Newcastle United and would be willing to work with owner Mike Ashley. The Geordie boss is under increasing pressure at Hull after Sunday’s defeat at home to Leicester left them one place above the relegation zone on goal difference only. And Bruce – who was sacked by Sunderland three years ago - would jump at the chance of a return to his native North East and the club he supported as a boy. Steve Bruce is interested in replacing Alan Pardew as Newcastle United manager . Bruce celebrates with son Alex after Nikica Jelavic makes sure of Hull's Boxing Day win at Sunderland . Steve Bruce - Boyhood Newcastle fan and under pressure at Hull. Would work under Mike Ashley and gets on well with chief scout Graham Carr. 4/1 . Tony Pulis – Out of work and an attractive proposition for Ashley in that respect. Thought to be interested. 7/2 . Tim Sherwood – Would jump at the chance and possibility of bringing Newcastle favourite Les Ferdinand with him would be popular with supporters. 10/1 . Steve McClaren – Doing a fine job at Derby and is respected within St James’ Park. He would find lure of return to Premier League hard to resist. 16/1 . Glenn Hoddle – Has emerged as a popular choice among Toon Army and current QPR coach might fancy shot at top job. 20/1 . Fabricio Coloccini - The 32-year-old Argentine has been at the club since 2008 and could be given job on interim basis. 15/8 . Crucially, he has a good relationship with Newcastle chief scout Graham Carr and it is thought he would accept the transfer model which sees Carr identify the majority of targets. Bruce, though, faces competition for the position from two out-of-work managers whose unemployment – and thus no compensation fee – would appeal to Ashley. Tony Pulis has not worked since quitting Crystal Palace at the start of the season and is keen on a return to the dugout. Newcastle would represent the biggest club on his managerial CV and it is thought he is interested in succeeding close friend Pardew. Likewise, Tim Sherwood. He was sacked by Spurs at the end of last season and was in the running for the Palace job before Pardew’s shock move to Selhurst Park. Ashley has connections to Spurs and Sherwood will certainly be applying for the position on Tyneside. Were he to persuade former Newcastle favourite Les Ferdinand to join him as assistant then it could prove a shrewd move in appeasing supporters who are sceptical about Ashley’s motives in identifying a replacement. One name which is proving popular with the Toon Army is that of former England boss Glenn Hoddle. The current QPR coach missed out on the job at Spurs when Sherwood was appointed last season and he has long since fancied another No.1 role. Alan Pardew is set to be appointed as the new Crystal Palace manager . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, will have the final say . John Carver, however, is set to be placed in temporary charge of first-team affairs. The Newcastle-born coach boasts a 100-per-cent record as caretaker boss having guided the Magpies to a 3-0 win over Blackburn in the wake of Sir Bobby Robson’s sacking in 2004. Should he impress during a busy January period then a deal until the end of the season at least could be in the offing. Steve McClaren, meanwhile, is rebuilding his reputation at Derby County but would be tempted by the offer from a Premier League club. He is respected within St James’ Park and is another used to working within the European model of transfers controlled at a level above the manager. Bruce led his Hull side to the 2014 FA Cup final where they were beaten by Arsenal .

"Alan Pardew becomes new Crystal Palace boss as Newcastle United thrash out £2million compensation deal with Eagles . Why? Why would any manager swap Newcastle United for a relegation scrap at Crystal Palace? More still, why would Alan Pardew choose to do so? Here is a man who harbours ambition of managing England and prickles at suggestion he will not. He is the same man who once belittled the romantic notion of a return to Selhurst Park. He was looking up, not down. That dismissal, however, was delivered back in August. It was pre-protest, pre-poison. Alan Pardew is set to be appointed as the new Crystal Palace manager . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, will have the final say on Pardew's future . The Newcastle fans wanted Pardew out after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign . Four months on and, on the eve of 2015, Pardew’s new year had promised the same old problems; supporter unrest, a denial of transfer funds and the threat of star players being sold. For those who deal with him on an almost daily basis, last week’s decision to voice concern over the strength of his striking options was not in keeping with the usual soundings of Pardew the politician. It hinted at frustration, for never did he use a public platform to send a message to the boardroom. Pardew’s remit at Newcastle was two-fold: keep the club in the Premier League and do not speak out against owner Mike Ashley. To that end, he had been the perfect employee, evidenced by Ashley’s faith during the terrace uprising which followed a seven-game winless start to the campaign. Pardew, though, had lost faith in his existence as black-and-white diplomat, caught in the middle of a disconnect between club and fanbase with the regime resented by supporters.

Fabricio Coloccini - The 32-year-old Argentine has been at the club since 2008 and could be given job on interim basis. 15/8 . The level of vitriol to which he was exposed earlier in the season may have been forgotten amid the winning run which followed, but clearly it was not forgiven. It hurt Pardew, and he’s as resilient as they come. When the abuse spilled over into his family life, his demeanour changed. He made a point of stating that a line had been crossed. On reflection, perhaps he crossed a line of his own that day. This, of course, came at a time when protest website SackPardew.com was dominating the news agenda and fans were being mobilised to chase the manager from Tyneside. But Pardew would not quit – not, at least, with his reputation having taken such a battering and his team bottom of the division. Rather, he kept his counsel, praised the players who were underperforming and praised, too, those supporters who had chosen to stick with his team. He was dignified and won admirers because of it. The upshot was six wins on the spin and a Manager of the Month prize for November. Reputation restored. Stock strengthened.

Mar, 2014: Headbutts Hull’s David Meyler and is fined £100,000 by the club and given seven-game touchline ban and £60,000 fine by FA. May, 2014: Newcastle lose seven of final eight matches to finish in 10th and supporters call for Pardew to be sacked. Dec, 2014: Becomes the first manager in Newcastle’s history to lose four consecutive Tyne-Wear derbies. Dec, 2014: Quits United after four years in charge and returns to former club Crystal Palace. Pardew might make a lot of mistakes – he’s shoved a linesman, headbutted an opposition player and called another manager an ‘old c**t’ – but he’s not daft when it comes to his public perception. He did, after all, survive the fallout from the above crime sheet thanks to swift apology and self-imposed penalties. He knows, too, how quickly things can change. And, with the trials of autumn having ranked as ‘the worst of his career’, he did not want to experience such ridicule again. Before Sunday’s 3-2 victory over Everton, it was threatening to venture down that unsavoury avenue once more. Pardew became the first Magpies boss to lose four successive Tyne-Wear derbies . Gus Poyet (centre) and his Sunderland staff celebrate Sunderland's late win against Newcastle last weekend . There had been four straight defeats, including a fourth consecutive loss in Tyne-Wear derbies and the sorry surrender of their stay in the League Cup, thrashed 4-0 at Spurs. In the wake of the 1-0 defeat to Sunderland on December 21 Pardew had cut a weary figure and privately expressed fear of another revolt. To the backdrop of this there was a board meeting to determine the club’s transfer strategy for January. With the team residing in the relative comfort of mid-table, investment in the playing squad was not deemed a priority. So what was? Keep things ticking over - stay in the Premier League and do not speak out against the hierarchy, of course. It was a sad cycle which showed no signs of breaking under Ashley and the new manager will have to sign up to this Magpie mandate. Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback (left) scores against Everton during what looks set to be Pardew's last game in charge at St James' Park . Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . In short, there is no ambition. No ambition to be better than tenth and duck out of the cup competitions when they threaten to kill the cash cow which is top-flight football. Pardew knew as much. He had operated within those confines for four years, all the while acting as a lightning rod should a storm brew on the terraces. He’d had enough. But why Palace? Crucially, there is a vision which extends beyond a balance sheet. There is the promise of a dream, growth as opposed to endurance. There is control of transfers. There is love, admiration, respect. There is safety, for him and his family. There is home. But forget the pull of Palace, the push of Newcastle was the key to Pardew’s shock decision to quit the comfort of his eight-year contract. It should sound as a warning for any candidate readying a CV for delivery to St James' Park.","Alan Pardew will soon be announced as the new Crystal Palace manager .

"Alan Pardew will attempt to bring goals to Newcastle as he prepares for an intensely difficult start to the Christmas campaign. The Magpies travel to in-form Manchester United on Boxing Day on the back of three successive defeats, the last of them a 1-0 reverse at the hands of neighbours Sunderland, an unprecedented fourth consecutive derby loss. Just a few weeks ago, it would have been a fixture Pardew's men might have approached with some relish having already dispensed with Tottenham, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. Newcastle United players joked around in training giving each other piggy backs on Wednesday morning . Jack Colback (top) is given a lift by Steven Taylor during training exercises on Wednesday morning . Newcastle players joke around ahead of their visit to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Boxing Day . Newcastle showed no signs of a hangover following their 1-0 defeat against Sunderland . Asked if his team had saved its best performances for the Barclays Premier League's big boys, the 53-year-old replied: 'Yes and no. 'Some of the top clubs, we have not played so well - Arsenal, we didn't play well, but Spurs we beat, Liverpool we beat as well. 'We can raise our game, but we don't score a lot of goals, and that's something that is a concern, really, going into the second half of the season, how many goals we have scored. 'That's an area we are going to have to improve on against any team. 'But when you play the top teams, you can keep it tight and one goal, two goals can sometimes be enough. But not always, and we need to score more goals.' Newcastle have fared reasonably well on their most recent league visits to Old Trafford, drawing 1-1 there in November 2011, losing by the odd goal in seven on Boxing Day the following year and finally ending a 41-year wait for a victory in December last year. Jak Alnwick trains with Newcastle on Wednesday morning ahead of their trip to Old Trafford on Boxing Day . Alan Pardew (Centre) holds training and dishes out instructions during the session on Wednesday . Pardew said: 'We have had decent performances at Old Trafford, I think, in the last three. We drew, we lost in the last minute - which was a cracking game - 4-3, and then we won last year, so we have done reasonably well there. 'One of the reasons we have one well there is we have retained possession well, and that's something we are going to have to do because you can't turn possession over to Manchester United with the quality they have got up front. 'They are going well at the minute. They are on a great run, and it's a game that every time you play them, you have to look forward to it. I certainly do and I am sure our senior players and young players will too.' The players go through sprinting exercises on a chilly Wednesday morning in the North East . Papiss Cisse was wrapped up during the training session as Newcastle prepared for Manchester United . One of those young players is 21-year-old keeper Jak Alnwick, who has been thrust into the limelight by injuries to senior men Tim Krul and Rob Elliot. His opposite number on Friday, Spaniard David de Gea, has emerged as the bedrock of United's improving form, and Pardew knows how difficult it will be to find a way past him. He said: 'There's a contrast in goal at the moment: Jak is on his second or third Premier League start, and De Gea pushing (Manuel) Neuer for the title of being the best goalkeeper in the world. 'He's a fantastic shot-stopper. He still has parts of his game that he still wishes to develop, but in one on one situations, he excels and covers a lot of the areas where goalscorers want to score in, with his feet, his hands and how he wants to approach things. 'He makes it very difficult to score, so you have to go with power and go for the corners.'","Newcastle United lost 1-0 against Sunderland at St James' Park .

Ashley Giles (right), with his family at The Ashes victory parade in 2005, said his daughter is his sporting hero . The former cricketer said he loves the spectacle of Formula One and admires Lewis Hamilton in the sport . What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman? I’d loved to have been a pilot because I have always been into planes and my dad was an apprentice when he was young. But I don’t think I would ever have got the qualifications. Which other sportsman would you like to be? Lewis Hamilton or Rory McIlroy. I love cars and the spectacle of Formula One, and I love playing golf.

I was the oldest member of the team and we hadn’t won the Ashes since I was a boy. It’s amazing to think it was 10 years ago now. There will always be a special bond between us all. World Number One golfer Rory McIlroy is another sportsman Giles would have liked to have been . Giles (left) said the best moment of his career was winning The Ashes against Australia in 2005 . ... AND THE Worst moment? Losing the Champions Trophy final in 2013. When Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara were together against India at Edgbaston I said, ‘We’re going to win this’, then it all went wrong. Who knows what might have been different now if we had won. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? Photos of our children and Charlie the cat. Best advice you’ve ever been given? Keep getting up, never give up. Favourite karaoke song? Fly me to the Moon. I sang it once in my early days as Warwickshire coach in front of all the lads. It wasn’t very good but I love that kind of music. Three most-listened-to songs on your iPod? Drops of Jupiter by Train, Mr Blue Sky by ELO and Elton John’s Your Song which was our wedding song.

"Jamie Carragher believes there must be underlying reasons for Alan Pardew to leave Newcastle United for south London as 'Crystal Palace will never be as big as' the Magpies. Pardew is close to completing a return to Palace, where he spent the best years of his playing career as a midfielder, after Newcastle accepted a £2million compensation package for their manager. But he is leaving a club safely in mid-table mediocrity - with his former charges sitting ninth in the table - for a side battling for Premier League survival and struggling in the relegation zone. Alan Pardew will leave Newcastle United to be appointed as the new Crystal Palace manager . Pardew applauds the home crowd after Newcastle's 3-2 win against Everton at St James' Park . The curiosity of such a move leads Carragher to believe Pardew is simply fed up with the way he has been treated at St James' Park by owner Mike Ashley and the supporters. Former Liverpool defender Carragher said on Sky Sports: 'I'm less surprised than Gary (Neville that Pardew would move to Selhurst Park). 'Crystal Palace will never be as big as Newcastle, so why would he move? 'The fans don't particularly like him. Does he get enough support from above? They sold (Yohan) Cabaye, could they lose (Moussa) Sissoko, (Papiss) Cisse? Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, had the final say on Pardew's future . The Newcastle fans wanted Pardew out after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign . 'He's been there for a long time, how long can you stay? They're a much bigger club, of course they are, but how long can you stay? 'His family still live down there (in London) and he may see this as a big opportunity to make a stamp on a club whereas he can't at Newcastle because of the constraints on him.' Palace sit 18th in the table and Pardew will find himself thrust straight into a relegation scrap at Selhurst Park. Newcastle supporters hold up a 'Pardew is a muppet' banner ahead of their team's Premier League clash against Stoke in April . Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville thinks that Pardew's decision is due to the 'survival game' that is being a manager of a Premier League club. Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'Management is all about risk, they're taking risks and gambling all the time. 'I said I would be surprised (when I heard the news) yesterday but I don't know the inside track. Maybe I'm thinking too purely and the long contract isn't there for him to see out. Management is a survival game. Moussa Sissoko could leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest . 'Newcastle fans will find out now how good Pardew was, or not. 'I know Newcastle fans have massive aspirations and they're a good club but I think the money that has been spent (during his reign), Pardew has delivered par seasons and above-par seasons except the year they were in the Europa League. 'He can see that Palace are a club he knows well and maybe can see an opportunity there.'

"Had enough: Film star Gerard Depardieu was among a clutch of high-profile French millionaires who have quit France over the tax on the super rich. He is pictured here holding his new Russian passport in January . France's repressive tax regime has sent entrepreneurs fleeing abroad and lost the country up to a million jobs, a damning new report has revealed. Tax hikes and employment regulations imposed by left and right wing governments over 20 years meant there were now 60,000 French businessmen abroad employing around 16 people each. The figures were released amid a flood of wealthy French quitting France this year to avoid a looming socialist tax of 75 per cent on all earnings over one million euros - about £850,000.

And their report published in French daily Le Figaro describes even that figure as a 'conservative estimate'. It . added that the number of French going into tax exile had accelerated . dramatically in the past year, and sales of properties worth more than . one million pounds had also shot up. France's economy minister Pierre Moscovici has reacted angrily to claims rich French are leaving the country, telling a conference of business leaders in Paris: 'I am troubled to read in the papers that the exile has begun, and that companies are fleeing. 'I also lament attacks on the government's economic policies that are in vogue in France and abroad. Le French-bashing is terrible.' His comments also came after Laurence . Parisot - head of MEDEF, the French equivalent of the UK's Confederation . of British Industry - warned that left-wing economic policies risked . turning France into 'the poor man of Europe'. She said: 'Large foreign investors are shunning France altogether. It's becoming really dramatic.

The comments left one French politician so offended he suggested Mr Cameron must have been 'drunk' when he made them. Gallic MP Claude Bartolone, a staunch ally of President Hollande, said: 'I hope that it was an after-dinner remark and that he didn't have all his wits about him when he said these things.' France's European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve insisted there was no 'exodus', adding: 'What I can answer to this statement from the British prime minister is that French bosses are patriots.'

"Abu Anas al-Liby, who was snatched by U.S. special forces, is believed to have been involved in the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . One of the world’s most wanted terrorists captured in Libya by elite US troops was given political asylum in Britain but fled two years later when it was discovered he was planning Jihad from his Manchester flat, it emerged today. Al Qaeda commander Abu Anas al-Liby was . wanted for plotting the 1998 US embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania . that killed more than 220, yet within a year he was living as a student in Moss Side. The extremist, who had a . £3million US bounty on his head, was seized at his home in Tripoli after . dawn prayers by the US Army’s Delta Force, 13 years after British police let him slip through their fingers. It was revealed today that he had been arrested as a terror suspect in the UK in 1999. But the . computer expert was released because he had cleared his hard drive and . Scotland Yard detectives could find no evidence to hold him. Then . in May 2000, anti-terror police raided his flat and found a 180-page . handwritten terror instruction book for Al Qaeda followers which was . called the ‘Manchester Manual’. It . explained how to booby-trap cars and TVs and showed how to kill using a . knife. But by the time police entered the property Liby had fled the . country. Today his capture was described as ‘a kidnapping’ by Libya, which has demanded an explanation from Washington. Liby, whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, has been on the FBI’s most-wanted list since it was introduced soon after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the operation to snatch him on Saturday showed that terrorists could ‘run but they cannot hide’. Liby’s brother Nabih said the terror chief was parking outside his house when three vehicles surrounded him, his car’s window was smashed and his gun seized before he was taken away. Plot: A U.S. Marine stands guard outside the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, after a huge explosion damaged buildings and the American Embassy, killing dozens of people in 1998 . Carnage: A U.S. soldier stands guard in front of the embassy in Dar es Salaam, the site of the August 7 bomb blast. A total of 220 people died in the two attacks, and thousands were injured . The US Defense Department said Liby was ‘lawfully detained under the law of war in a secure location outside of Libya’. Liby was indicted by the US for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings. A court heard Osama bin Laden had ordered him to Kenya and Tanzania to photograph the embassy compounds and decide how best to carry out the attacks. His family denied he had any involvement. They said he was in the Armed Islamic Fighting Group, a militant organisation that battled Colonel Gadaffi’s regime. Home Secretary Theresa May is to be questioned by MPs over why Liby was given asylum in Britain. Anas al-Liby was given political asylum in Britain in 1995 after a failed Al Qaeda plot to assassinate Hosni Mubarak, then president of Egypt. An Egyptian extradition request was turned down on the grounds that he could not receive a fair trial. A year later MI6 is said to have paid a Libyan Al Qaeda cell to kill Colonel Gaddafi. It is thought that Liby, 49, pictured, was allowed to stay in return for aiding the alleged plot, which was unsuccessful. He was arrested as a terror suspect by Scotland Yard in 1999, but released due to a lack of evidence. In May 2000, his flat in Manchester, where he was a student, was raided and officers found a 180-page handwritten manual for Al Qaeda followers, translated from Arabic to English. But by this time, Liby had already fled abroad. Keith . Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the case would . be raised with the Home Secretary when she appears before MPs. Mr Vaz said: 'This case raises serious questions about the motives behind asylum and national security decisions in the UK. 'It . is not the first time that someone, who has been brought to the . attention of the authorities and released, has gone on to be linked to . further terrorist activity. 'I will be raising these concerns with the Home Secretary when she appears before the committee on the 15th October.' The US said the capture had taken place with authorisation from Libya. But a statement from prime minister Ali Zeidan’s office said: ‘The Libyan government is keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya, no matter what the charges are... the accused are innocent until proven guilty.’ Liby, who studied electronic and nuclear engineering in Tripoli, is thought to have been with bin Laden in Sudan in the early Nineties. He then turned up in the UK in 1995 where he was granted political asylum as an enemy of Gaddafi. Since fleeing Britain, he has cropped up in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and is said to have been jailed in Iran for seven years. The news of his capture comes as it emerged that US Navy Seal commandos had to abort a mission to seize a leader of al-Shabaab, the group behind the Westgate shopping centre massacre in Nairobi. After their dawn attack at the house of al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane near Barawe in southern Somalia met fierce resistance, they abandoned the raid. Seven militants are said to have been killed, with no US casualties. Meanwhile, Mrs May warned last night that British extremists were training as terrorists in the Syrian civil war and could return to commit atrocities at home. The Home Secretary also revealed that security had been tightened in the UK after the attack at the Westgate mall in Kenya, adding: ‘We have increased... the number of armed response vehicles, the number of specially-trained firearm officers.’ Twin raids: American special operations troops launched raids just hours apart in Somalia and Libya.

"Frustrated police still have no firm leads in their investigation into the disappearance of toddler William Tyrell, six weeks after the three-year-old disappeared from his grandmother's front yard. Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall on the mid-north coast of NSW on September 12, when William, dressed in his favourite Spiderman costume, was last seen. The investigation into William's disappearance passed the six-week mark on Friday, as followers of a Facebook page set up to help find the little boy who loved fire engines topped 17,000. Scroll down for video . William Tyrell was last seen wearing his favourite Spiderman costume when he disappeared on September 12 . Missing toddler William Tyrell did not have a tendency to wander off . Strike Force Rosann detectives are now collating information including hundreds of calls from the public, a police spokeswoman said. 'There is nothing new, unfortunately,' the spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is very frustrating for police.' Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and are concentrating their investigation on the theory William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'. William disappeared from his grandmother's yard in Benaroon Drive, Kendall, about 10.30am on September 12, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister. A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared. State Emergency Service volunteers were among hundreds of searches who spent nine days looking for missing toddler William Tyrell . Searches combed bushland surrounding the home of missing toddler William Tyrell's grandmother .

Earlier this month, Strike Force Rosann commander Acting Superintendent Tony Joice said police wanted to interview every person who was in Kendall on September 12 to determine what they were doing and why they were there. He described the case as 'astonishing'. 'If you were in the Kendall area, we need to know what you were doing, who you were visiting, what car you were driving, what you were doing there,' Acting Superintendent Joice told The Telegraph. 'It’s about putting the pieces together.' That task is now complete, a police spokeswoman said. The search for William included police from the dog squad, officers on horseback and on trail bikes, divers, Forensic Services Group members and a helicopter. Some ground was covered more than 10 times in the search for missing boy William Tyrell . Police are baffled by the disappearance of little William Tyrell from his grandmother's home . Volunteers from the State Emergency Service, Rural Fire Service, Surf Life Saving, and local citizens scoured the main search area for nine days without finding any trace of the boy. After five days police conceded the boy could not have survived in bushland alone. Some ground was searched more than 10 times. Police interviewed William's sister but she was unable to provide any information about his disappearance. William's family have remained out of public view but a friend, Nicole, has made several appeals for help. She said while William enjoyed being outdoors he had no tendency to wander off. 'He is a happy, cheeky, adventurous little boy who doesn’t wander off,' Nicole said. 'William is pretty much always happy. He was happy to play in the garden and be with his family.' 'Someone, somewhere' knows something about the disappearance of William Tyler, says Superintendent Paul Fehon . Family friend Nicole has appealed for help from the public to find William Tyrell . Mid-North Coast local area commander Superintendent Paul Fehon has said 'someone, somewhere' must know something about William's disappearance. William's family thanked searchers for their hard work.

"The investigation into the disappearance of three-year-old William Tyrell has taken a desperate turn. Police will now be interviewing every person who was in Kendall on the day the boy, dressed in his favourite Spiderman costume, vanished without a trace from his grandmother's property. After a fruitless nine-day search was conducted after William was reported missing on September 12, individuals who were in the village when the boy went disappeared need step forward and explain why they were in Kendall and what they were doing. Acting Superintendent Commander Tony Joice, who is leading the investigation into the toddler's disappearance from the NSW mid north coast, said this is part of 'putting the pieces together' for the 'astonishing' case. Scroll down for video . Police said William's family are doing it very tough in light of the fact there has been no trace of him . 'If you were in the Kendall area, we need to know what you were doing, who you were visiting, what car you were driving, what you were doing there,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Although he said that police no longer believe William is in the area, they are now examining whether he was abducted. William's four-year-old sister, who was with him when he went missing, had not been able provide further insight into the incident. In other efforts to help find the toddler, a Facebook page called Bring Little Spiderman William Tyrell Home - has been established and now has more than 12,000 followers. This comes after police scaled back their search for the three-year-old to instead focus their efforts on how he might have disappeared. After nine days of scouring bushland in Kendall, NSW, emergency services and hundreds of volunteers from the town have failed to find any sign of the toddler, who vanished from his grandmother's property while wearing his favourite Spiderman costume. The focus will move to examine the many pieces of information received concerning William's unexplained disappearance - all but giving up hope of finding his body. The news came a day after William's distraught parents broker their silence over the disappearance and penned a heartfelt plea to help bring the toddler home, thanking everyone who has participated in the major search operation. Hundreds of gruelling man hours have spent scouring hectares of state forests, roads, residential and commercial properties - but still no clues have been found to suggest the whereabouts of 'Spiderman William.' And while the search must go on - his family say they are forever grateful for the way the tight-knit community and those from afar have banded together to help locate  try locate the boy who one day dreams of becoming a firefighter. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family reads. 'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.' 'It's emotionally distressing for them': Police say the search for William has taken a huge toll on his family . On day nine of the search, about 70 people concentrated on a section of bushland at Middle Brother area, 45km south of Port Macquarie. Equally as clueless about William's disappearance as is family, police Superintendent Paul Fehon said 'someone, somewhere' must know something about where William is. 'There must be someone out there who knows something about William’s unexplained disappearance,' he said. Mr Fehon also paid tribute to the dedication and commitment shown by all those involved in the search as well as those individuals and businesses who provided food and support for the searches. Immediate members of William's family have not been heard from publicly since the toddler disappeared from his grandmother's garden last Friday. A close friend, known only as Nicole, has spoken about the struggle and the toll the search has had on everyone- most notably the family. Police also moved their inquiries onto the region's roads to stop and quiz motorists whether they'd seen any suspicious vehicles the time that William went missing. But like those that went before it, the questioning uncovered no trace of William or any leads into his mysterious disappearance. Now all the family ask is that their son be 'desperately' brought home. Friends of the Tyrell family have said how hard the week has been on everyone taking part in the search . 'William is a much-loved and cherished little boy,' said the friend of the family who wanted to be known only by her first name Nicole . It is now eight days since the Kendall boy missing as police confirm they are broadening their inquiries . The search has taken a huge toll on the SES and the family of William Tyrell said there work has not gon unnoticed . 'We have seen you day and night searching for William' a statement from the Tyrell family reads . Police  stopped passers-by as they investigated the disappearance of missing toddler William Tyrell last seen at his grandmother's home in Kendall . The eight-day search has  uncovered no trace of the toddler, who was last seen in the garden of his grandmother's property on Beneroon Drive . Police hope questioning  motorists will help locate any suspicious vehicles seen in the Kendall area . The massive search shifted from bushland near his grandmother's home to a state forest nearby on Thursday . Police are trying to trace  the movements of motor vehicles which were seen in the area last Friday . 'William is only three years and three-months-old and really still a baby, he has so many more years to live and we desperately want him home.' 'Up until a month ago (he) was obsessed with all things Fire Engine and would tell us his name was “Firefighter William”… a future he deserves to fulfil.' Mr Fehon earlier earlier said that William's family were struggling with the fact that there were still no leads in relation to his whereabouts - and this plea confirms their frustration. 'They are doing it very tough,' he said. State Emergency Service crews and police searched roadsides in the nearby Middle Brother State Forest last week for evidence as they focused on the possibility William was picked up by a car. More than 200 volunteers and residents have scoured kilometres of bush surrounding the property in the eight days since he disappeared. A number of tips, including reports that a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man stopped at a local shop on Friday morning to ask directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive where William was last seen, have uncovered nothing. Forensic tests performed on a patch of blood found near a creek just over 2km from William's grandmother's house were also negative. Test results showed it was not human blood. Bush trackers have found clues such as a knife sheath and a set of small footprints, but tip-offs from bush searches, investigations of CCTV and interviews with neighbours and local businesses have not uncovered a solid lead. But despite the lengthy search efforts Supt Fehon said police were aiming to broaden their investigation. 'We are following every possible avenue of inquiry that is being provided to us, be it CCTV, be it information regarding persons that may have been in the area, and we're asking the public if they know of anything to provide that information to Crime Stoppers,' he said. Investigators repeat their appeal for anyone with information on William’s unexplained disappearance to contact them via Crime Stoppers.

"Two women have been attacked by a dingoes on the west coast of Fraser Island, about 300km north of Brisbane. The two tourists were jogging on the beach at Yidney Rocks when they were bitten 'quite heavily' on the legs just before 7am on Sunday morning. The manager of the Yidney Rocks Beachfront Unit, Maijam Goulding, said the two Australian tourists were in their 20's or 30's. Scroll down for video . A 34-year-old woman was bitten by a dingo on Sunday morning and taken to Hervey Bay Hospital . Dingoes are protected in Queensland national parks as a native species, though the animal is a declared pest outside of these areas . They asked me to make a phone call (to triple zero) because I'm the only one with a phone here,' she said. The women were staying in accommodation in Yidney Rocks, which Ms Goulding said had a small dingo population. 'It's pretty silent here but you don't go running on the beach. That's a big no-no,' she said. 'Everybody needs to stay vigilant. That's the way it is, it's been like that for many years.' 'You don't take silly risks.' A spokesperson from the media department of Hervey Bay Hospital said at least one of the women were being taken to the hospital via the island's barge, and had presented with wounds consistent with dingo bites, though they could not verify the story at present. He further noted that as she was not flown out from the site of the incident, her condition could not have been too serious. A spokeswoman for the RACQ CareFlight rescue helicopter said a crew had been placed on standby over the incident but had been stood down. Dingoes are protected in Queensland national parks as a native species, though the animal is a declared pest outside of these areas. On Fraser Island, dingoes are considered part of the native ecology and are therefore protected by state law. A safety manual released by the Queensland government advises parents to stay close to children as dingoes have been known to bite, and stresses that dingoes should never be fed by humans. The manual advises campers to secure all food and rubbish, walk in groups and keep distance from the animals.

"It's been uninhabited by anyone but squatters for 25 years and the walls of each and every room are scrawled with graffiti. Yet the long-abandoned home on Thornley Street Leichhardt in Sydney's inner west, is expected to be sold for about $1.2 million dollars when auctioned off to home-buyers. Despite being structurally sound, with half-decent floor boards and ceilings still intact, the price of a full-scale renovation would cost the future-buyers another $300,000 to $500,000 just to make it liveable. A decrepit house on Thornley Street in Leichhardt, is expected to sell for $1.2 million dollars despite being abandoned for 25 years and being covered in graffiti . Despite the decrepit condition of the Leichhardt home in Sydney's inner west, agent Jonathan Hammond said interest shown by potential buyers has been 'unprecedented' despite the property only being on the market for eight days. 'Since the campaign went live, the level of interest has been unprecedented in terms of people doing virtual tours online, the amount of emails and the number of contracts issued,' he said. 'In terms of the number of groups through, we've had 54 groups of two to four people come to the open inspections as well as two private inspections. 'In terms of email inquiries we've had about 4,000 people that have viewed the property online, which is very strong.' Despite only being on the market for eight days, the property has received an 'unprecedented' amount of attention including 54 inspection groups and 4,000 email inquiries . Potential buyers have mostly included younger couples trying to up-size in the immediate area, builders or investors hoping to renovate and then sell and investors looking to subdivide the property . The house is the second run-down property in the area to attract price-tags set around the million mark, after a property in Stanmore sold for $923,000 in early June despite containing rotting floors, crumbling ceilings and being packed full of garbage. But despite the median price for a property in Sydney reaching $679,000 in June after growing almost 17 per cent in the three months to May, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens warned investors hoping to make big gains to 'take care'. 'People should not assume that prices always rise. They don't; sometimes they fall,' Mr Stevens said at a Australasian Meeting of the International Econometric Society in Hobart. 'Some segments of the housing market do appear to have been calming down lately. Prices have flattened out in several cities and even in Sydney the pace of increase has lessened. 'It remains to be seen whether this slower pace of growth in dwelling prices is temporary or more persistent.' Not a pretty sight from the back either: The house, which was originally built in the 1800s, has a sandstone foundation and a double fronted late Victorian facade on a 360 squared metre property . A two-bedroom house in Durham St, Stanmore sold for $923,000 in early June despite the fact that it was uninhabitable in its present state . The house was littered with garbage, despite the fact that realtors had already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property . The house, which was originally built in the 1800s, has a sandstone foundation and a double-fronted late Victorian facade on a 360 square metre property. It has no bathrooms or kitchen after they were ripped out by the current owner who was indecisive about his renovation plans, but rather only the shell of four rooms which still contain their original fireplaces. Mr Hammond said a combination of the home's unique design and large size has made it desirable to buyers. 'There are mostly smaller homes around the 200 square metre mark, like modest cottages, in the area,' he said. 'For people who like the area but need more space, this is the potential for them to build their dream home.' This Waterloo home on Phillip Street on a 133 square metre block was snapped up in four weeks . Despite being structurally sound, with decent floor boards and ceilings still intact, the price of a full-scale renovation would cost somewhere between $300,000 and $500,000. But it's the decrepit state of the home that is drawing in potential future owners rather than deterring them, according to Mr Hammond, who claims the imperfections present them with a 'potential to paint the picture the way they would like it'. 'If the place was in an average habitable condition you'd be looking at the $1.5 or $1.6 million mark, so I think as a buyer coming through, this state of it has generated more inquiry,' he said. 'They can come and make it their own. Its new owners have decided to knock it down and built a new home from scratch . The original bathroom was still intact and there was another external bathroom, but the kitchen was non-existent . 'There has so far been younger couples trying to up-size in the immediate area, builders or investors hoping to renovate and then sell and investors looking to subdivide the property.' It seems run-down properties are proving to be quite popular. Recently another 'dilapidated' home in Waterloo was auctioned off for $807,000. The Phillip St home sits on a 133 square metre piece of land and is positioned a corner block. Its new owners are planning to knock it down and build a new home on the block. The conveniently located property was auctioned off for $807,000 . If they kept the original structure, it was estimated it would have cost at least $150,000 to $200,000 to renovate. The home was a two-storey terrace house and was on the market for four weeks. It had retained its original bathroom and had another external bathroom, but the kitchen was non-existent. According to real estate agents, the Waterloo property proved to be popular because of its convenient location - on the city's fringe - directly across the road from Redfern Oval. The Paddington home is expected to sell for more than $1.25 million and will go under the hammer on July 19 . Located on iconic Paddington Street, the home is ideal for renovation and modernisation . Another desirable spot is Paddington - also in Sydney's inner city. A four-bedroom traditional terrace home is expected to sell for more than $1.25 million and is located on the suburb's signature street, Paddington St. It is the first time in more than 50 years since its been on the market and has potential for modernisation and renovation across two storeys and attached on one side. It is being sold by Ray White Paddington and is going under the hammer on July 19 at 11.30am. This is the first time in has been on the market for 50 years and is a two-storey terrace home . It is a four-bedroom property on a 180-square-metre piece of land .","The property is considered to be in a prime location in Leichhardt, Sydney's inner west .

"Outspoken former Apprentice contestant Kate Hopkins - who once said she would never employ an overweight person - has been slammed on Twitter for a 'vile' and 'ignorant' outburst on live TV against overweight people. Appearing on ITV's This Morning opposite 18-stone plus-size model Rachel Cooper Wherry, Hopkins said overweight people are 'deluding themselves' if they think 'big is beautiful', and are using the line as 'an excuse for not wanting to do exercise and for eating as much as you want'. The pair appeared on the talk show to debate the topic of whether big can ever truly be beautiful, following comments from singer Alison Moyet, who shrunk from a size 22 to a size 10 only to confess she preferred being larger. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rachel Cooper Wherry, an 18-stone plus-size model, left, and businesswoman Kate Hopkins, right . Plus-size model Rachel Cooper Wherry, left, appeared on This Morning with former Apprentice contestant Kate Hopkins to debate the issue of whether big can ever be beautiful . In answer to the debate question, . Hopkins said that all people want to lose weight and be thin. She said: . 'Overweight people are deluding themselves. It's an excuse for not wanting to do exercise and for eating as much as you want.' She continued: 'It's harder to be thin - you need discipline. 'Plus-size' is just a euphemism for fat - and who wants to be fat?' 'Big is not beautiful, because big cannot . find clothes they would like to wear,' she added. 'And I don't think we should teach . our kids that big is beautiful when it's not.' When she was asked whether it was a . generalisation to say that everyone would like to be thin, Hopkins . stated that 'life is easier when you're thinner'. Cooper Wherry - who, at 5ft 9in and 18 stone says she is 'extremely happy' with how she looks - said we should teach children about 'balance', and not to be 'obsessive'. Admitting that she probably would like to lose a bit of weight, she said: 'At the end of the day it's more about me feeling less intimidated about being a bigger person and enjoying my life. And not constantly trying to make myself smaller.' When the plus-size model said she was intimidated by gyms because 'people intrinsically judge you and think you're lazy', but that she did do a lot of yoga, Hopkins replied: 'I don't believe you do enough yoga.'

'I'm bored of supporting people. This country is all about support - it's time for discipline.'

One user, Brownhair&blueeyes, wrote: 'Kate Hopkins is taking this too far about fat people Well guess what love Marilyn Monroe was a size 14 and was the worlds prettiest women!' Another, Vicki Megan, tweeted: 'Thanks #ThisMorning kate hopkins I'm not beautiful as I'm a biggish girl. Thanks for the confidence boost #idiot.' Charlotte82 added: 'Haha.

"It may not provide that great village shop tradition of a catch up with the latest gossip or a chat about the weather. But despite the lack of a human touch, this automated shop is a lifeline for residents. The giant vending machine opened  this week in Clifton, Derbyshire, which has been without a village shop for 14 years. Scroll down for video . Residents queue to use the vending machine in the village of Clifton, which has had no shop for 14 years . Browsing: Marion Higgins takes a look at the variety of items on sale at the establishment . The machine, which contains chiller . compartments, stocks essentials such as bread, milk, eggs, toiletries, . pet food – and umbrellas. Residents select their items, pay by cash or credit card and take the goods from the dispenser. Electrical engineer Peter Fox invented it after the village shop closed down. Unable to interest a firm in developing the machine, he spent three years building one himself. The machine, complete with chiller . compartments, has a faux red brick front and a traditional awning to . give the modern shop a traditional feel. Mr . Fox says the machines will be introduced to other villages in the area . in the next few months - claiming they could become a lifeline for small . communities hit by the rise of internet shopping. The . 50-year-old father-of-two, from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, said: 'I had . this idea a few years ago but I couldn’t find a manufacturer who could . deliver what I wanted, so I rolled up my sleeves and did it myself. Dispensing with tradition: Engineer Peter Fox, 50, has installed a giant vending machine in Clifton, Derbyshire . Out with the old: Lorraine Garside buys a loaf of bread from first automated village store at Clifton . 'The result is what essentially amounts to a huge outdoor vending machine - but the term ""automatic shop"" is actually far more appropriate. 'The problem with vending machines is that they can’t handle the range, weight, or delicacy of a wide range of products such as milk, eggs, bread, washing powder and so on. Our shop can handle all of these and many more besides.' The shop is fitted with an array of security features including cameras and alarms and will be run by Mr Fox from an industrial unit. Gravy train: Mr Fox hopes his unusual way of dispensing Bisto and milk will become a far-reaching business - and save declining villages which have been hit by the rise of internet shopping . He has also applied for a number of patents for his design. It works by lifting a small basket up to each shelf before a mechanism pushes out the desired product. That way it only has a small distance to travel, preventing milk bottles from bursting or eggs from smashing. Tin of chopped tomatoes £0.65 . Six large free-range eggs £1.75 . Bottle of fairy liquid £1.29 . Tin of Heinz Beans £0.69 . Pint of semi-skimmed milk £0.59 . Medium sliced loaf of bread £1.45 . Small umbrella £2.50 . He added: 'I know everything that’s . happening minute-by-minute and, uniquely, customers can also view all . our stock, and its availability, live on our website.' His new company intends to stock each . machine with local produce where possible, and Peter is already in talks . with other publicans who are invited to host the machines without . having to pay a fee. He said: 'I hope I can put something into the community while developing a truly 21st Century piece of technology. 'It’s hard to compete with the supermarkets on everything, but we can get pretty close, and when you take the travel time and costs into account, we think we can compete, and bring the village shop back to the village.' Clifton resident Simon Catley, 56, said: 'It’s a magnificent thing. 'The last village store in Clifton closed about 14 years ago, so this is a great addition. Before it was installed you would have to get in your car and drive almost two miles to a Sainsbury’s in Ashbourne even if you just fancied a cup of tea and needed a pint of milk. 'It is also nice to be putting money into a local business rather than a superstore. It stocks everyday essentials, and a little more. You can basically buy everything to make a full English breakfast.'

The history books claim . that they were sliing up and frying potatoes as early as the 17th century . as an alternative to fish when the rivers became icy and impenetrable . in the winter. Nowadays, French fries remain a national delight in . Belgum, where there are an abundance of friteries, where chips are the . main delicacy on offer. Moules-frites (mussels and chips) is the . country’s favourite dish, offering a variation on the America's . hamburger and French fries or the British fish and chips. WINNER: Belgium . Beer Belgium is renowned for its beers, with American author Joe Stange even writing a book called ‘Around Brussels in 80 beers.’ Our favourite is Duvel, founded in 1871 and described as ‘well-hopped, fruity and exceptionally aromatic’. Jan-Leonard Moortgat opened a brewery with his wife and a process of trial-and-error created a beer that has become one of the most popular in Belgium. Duvel (translated into English as ‘devil’) takes ninety days to brew and has also made inroads into the USA market. Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort also come highly recommended. Over the Atlantic, Bud Light is the market leader, bringing in sales just under $6million in 2013, according to a survey by bizjournals.com. Coors light, Budweiser and Miller Lite all trail in its wake. Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo is certainly confident, tweeted his US counterpart: ‘Hey @BarackObama, I am betting some great Belgian beers that our @BelRedDevils will make it to the quarter final! :-) #ComeOnBelgium #BEL' WINNER: Belgium . Politics The Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo handed in his resignation to the King at the end of May but he has enjoyed reasonable levels of popularity during his period in power. He is seen as a symbol of Belgium’s progressive state, as the first Prime Minister of non-Belgium descent (he is the son of Italian immigrants) while he has become the first openly gay Prime Minister in Europe. The USA, of course, have their own history-making President, after Barack Obama was voted in as the country’s first African American leader in 2008. He was re-elected in 2012, defeating his Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Flying high: Barack Obama watched the Germany game from his airplane as USA progressed . WINNER: Draw . The USA is home to some of the world’s most iconic structures, from the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, to the Hollywood sign, the Jefferson Memorial and Mount Rushmore. Belgium, however, adopt a rather more tongue-in-cheek approach. In Brussels, there is an almost 400-year-old water feature called Manneken Pis, where a bronze statue of a little boy is seen urinating into a basin. They do have a rather serous heritage, though, with Brussels considered as the de facto capital of the European Union. ‘The Commuist Manifesto’ by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was also written in Brussels, becoming one of the planet’s defining political manuscripts. Fountain: The famous Manneken Pis water feature in Belgium's capital (left) and dressed up in honor of the 10th anniversary of the end of apartheid and former South African president Nelson Mandela (right) WINNER: USA . Amerian’s have Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny, the Belgians have Tintin, with cartoonist Georges Remi’s comic strips becoming among the most iconic in Europe in the 20th century, translated into seventy languages from the original French. Signed off with his pen-name Herge, Remi recounted the tale of a young reporter Tintin, who was nobly aided by his white wire fox terrier Snowy. For all Tintin’s exploits, though, the Belgians may need a little more to compete with the global domination of Walt Disney and his instantly recognisable productions. WINNER: USA . FINAL SCORE: USA 3 BELGIUM 2... ...BUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE REAL MATCH?The Belgium squad is jam-packed with familiar faces, with twelve Premier League stars on show, including Chelsea’s Eden Hazard, Manchester City’s Vincent Kompany and Manchester United pair Adnan Januzaj and Marouane Fellaini. It is hailed as a golden . generation littered with attacking flair, as a host of young stars . emerge onto the global stage. The USA squad may be less familiar to the Eurpean audience, with only four Premier League players: .

The Belgian team head into the game with a 100 per cent record in Brazil, after defeating Algeria, Russia and South Korea in their three group games, keeping two clean sheets in the process. They will, however, be hoping that their attacking players now join the party, with Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard still to score, with Belgium scoring just four goals in three games. The USA, meanwhile, captured the hearts of the global audience with a spirited showing to draw 2-2 with Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal and a victory over Ghana was enough to ensure America’s progress into the knockout stages of the competition. Kyle Beckerman has emerged as a serious force in the central midfield, while Tim Howard and Jermaine Jones have attracted the headlines with show-stopping moments.

"Arsenal are primed for another summer transfer battle with Liverpool, this time over Barcelona  forward Alexis Sanchez. Following the club record £42.5million capture of Mesut Ozil last summer, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants to make another marquee signing with Sanchez his No 1 target. Barcelona are prepared to let the Chile international leave as new manager Luis Enrique stamps his authority on the club. VIDEO: Scroll down to see stunner Jhendelyn Nunez flash her bra after Sanchez scores . In demand: Arsenal and Liverpool both want to sign Chile star Alexis Sanchez . And the Gunners have opened talks with Barcelona with a view to making a £22m offer for Sanchez. However, Arsenal will probably have to raise their offer as Liverpool have already discussed a £30m bid. Barca officials, who arrived in London on Wednesday to start formal talks with Liverpool over Luis Suarez, are prepared to use Sanchez as a makeweight in their attempts to land the Uruguayan. However, the Suarez deal is not subject to Liverpool signing Sanchez, 25. Wednesday’s . talks, which were led by Barca trio Raul Sanllehi, Toni Rossich and . Jordi Mestre, are said to have been productive. World Cup star: Sanchez scored two and provided the same amount of assists . However, it is understood Sanchez’s representatives, if he is to leave the Nou Camp, want him to move to Arsenal though the decision ultimately rests with Sanchez. If Sanchez turns down an Anfield move it would mean only a straight Barca cash offer of around £80m would persuade Liverpool to sell Suarez. The fight to land Sanchez, who is also . interesting Manchester United, is the second time in 12 months Liverpool . and Arsenal have gone head to head in the transfer market. Last summer, Arsenal’s attempts to sign Suarez and their subsequent £40,000,001 offer for the Uruguayan infuriated Anfield chiefs. Barca bound: Luis Suarez is in talks over a move to the Nou Camp . Ironically, if Sanchez does move to the Premier League he would love to go to Old Trafford because he has been a fan of United since boyhood. Wenger has . a £100m transfer kitty to strengthen his side ahead of next season and . wants a striker, a central midfielder, a right-back and a back-up . goalkeeper. The . Gunners have an interest in Sanchez’s international team-mate Arturo . Vidal, but the midfielder’s £40m asking price is likely to prove . prohibitive despite Arsenal’s healthy financial position. Attracting interest: Sanchez's form in Spain hasn't gone unnoticed by the Premier League big guns . Their bid to persuade Bayer Leverkusen to part with Lars Bender is proving difficult, so the Gunners are now ready to turn to Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin in their search for a defensive midfielder. Arsenal, however, are confident of signing Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy. Liverpool did complete one deal on Wednesday, taking Kevin Stewart, 20, on a two-year deal after the defender left Tottenham.

"She is known for her unflappable and mild-mannered on-screen persona. Until, that is, presenter Holly Willoughby came face-to-face with former Apprentice star Katie Hopkins. The two blondes became embroiled in a heated debate after Hopkins, 38, claimed it was acceptable to judge children based on their names. Scroll down for video . Hopkins criticised names like Tyler, Charmaine and Chardonnay, Holly replied: 'That's terrible, listen to what you're saying' Katie: There's a whole set of things that go with those sorts of children and that's why I don't like them . Asked about popular baby names on ITV’s . This Morning show on Wednesday, Miss Hopkins began to criticise ‘lower . class’ children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and . Tyler. ‘I think you can tell a great deal . from a name,’ said mother-of-three Miss Hopkins, 38. ‘For me, there’s . certain names that I hear and I think “urgh”. ‘For me, a name is a shortcut of . finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask: “Do I want . my children to play with them?” ‘When I hear screeched across the . playground: “Tyler! Come back ‘ere.” It’s the Tylers, the Charmains the . Chantelles, the Chardonnays.’ Cult feminist and funnywoman Caitlin Moran slammed Katie's judgemental views . Marie Claire and Michael Vine were unimpressed - as were the vast majority of Twitter users on the subject . She added: ‘There’s a whole set of . things that go with children like that, who are quite a disruptive . influence in school and that’s why I don’t like those kind of children. ‘I tend to think that children who . have intelligent names tend to have fairly intelligent parents and they . make much better playdates for my children. ‘We are really time short in this world and we need shortcuts to make decisions. It’s very effective.’ Miss Willoughby, 32, was . flabbergasted, responding: ‘Listen to what you are saying. You judge . children on names. That’s extraordinary.’ Co-host Phillip Schofield was then . forced to intervene, asking the women to speak one at a time as the . argument threatened to boil over. 'I can't believe that you're such an insufferable snob' said Anna May Mangan, who was judged as a child . Phillip Schofield threw his head back in bewilderment as Holly said 'Oh stop, stop right there' The audience seemed to agree with Anna May (and Holly) saying people shouldn't be judged by their name . But the exchange of words only ended after an increasingly irate Miss Willoughby snapped: ‘Oh stop. Stop right there.’ Viewers took to Twitter in the . aftermath of the interview to criticise Miss Hopkins, with one writing: . ‘I wouldn’t want my children associating with a woman like her. Call me . stuck up!’ Another added: ‘Katie Hopkins is an appalling woman, how can she be so judgmental?’ And the nine-minute debate has now . become an internet sensation, with 3.5million people viewing the clip on .

"Adam Lallana's £23million move to Liverpool has seen his former club Bournemouth scoop up £5.75million thanks to a shrewd sell-on clause in his Southampton contract. Sportsmail looks at those clubs who have cashed in from sell-on clauses and those who have missed out. VIDEO Scroll down for Adam Lallana joins Liverpool from Southampton . Bonus: Adam Lallana's move to Liverpool has earned Championship side Bournemouth £5.75million . Watford received £2.5million from Ashley Young’s £17million transfer from Aston Villa to Manchester United in 2011. The Hornets wisely insisted on a 15 per cent sell-on clause when they let their academy product leave for Aston Villa four years earlier. Wise move: Watford pocketed £2.5million after Ashley Young left Aston Villa for Manchester United in 2011 . Dagenham and Redbridge negotiated a 20 per cent sell-on clause when they sold Dwight Gayle to Peterborough in January 2013. When he was sold to Crystal Palace last summer the Daggers bagged £1million of the initial fee. Rapid rise: Dagenham and Redbridge were given £1million after Dwight Gayle (right) joined Crystal Palace .

Cashing in: David Bentley's move to Tottenham earned Arsenal £7million due to a 50 per cent sell-on clause . Les Ferdinand’s £6million move from QPR to Newcastle back in 1995 earned non-league club Hayes a handy £600,000, a healthy profit for the club - now known as Hayes and Yeading - considering he cost them just £5,000. The club used the money to build a function suite named 'The Ferdinand Suite', in honour of their most famous son. Prolific: Les Ferdinand's goals earned him a move to Newcastle and £600,000 for his former club Hayes . Southampton waived their 25 per cent sell-on clause on Gareth Bale when they experienced financial difficulties in 2008. The Saints accepted £3million plus young goalkeeper Tommy Forecast in exchange for their stake in the Welshman, although keeping the deal in place would've earned them around £20million from the winger's move to Real Madrid last summer. Forecast was released in 2013 without ever appearing for the first team. Big mistake: Southampton could have earned around £20million from their sell-on clause for Gareth Bale .

"Alan Pardew becomes new Crystal Palace boss as Newcastle United thrash out £2million compensation deal with Eagles . In a bid to outwit the camera crews and photographers jostling at the main entrance to Newcastle United’s first-team base, a man in a purple LA Dodgers cap and black leather jacket slipped across half a mile of training pitches and left via the club’s academy for one final time. That walk, with only the North Tyneside greenery for company, would have been his most peaceful 10 minutes of an otherwise frenzied and exhausting 48 hours. For Alan Pardew — successfully dodging the press in his Dodgers disguise — has been on the back page of every newspaper and the lead item of every sports bulletin since the shock news broke of his decision to quit Newcastle for Crystal Palace on Sunday night. He has since been in meetings negotiating his release and the separation, it is thought, is amicable. Alan Pardew has said his goodbyes to the players and staff at Newcastle ahead of his Crystal Palace move . Cheick Tiote (left) and Papiss Cisse leave Newcastle's training ground after Pardew returned to say goodbye . On Tuesday, he said his goodbyes. After four years, it is the end. He will leave his Ponteland home for the last time on Wednesday in the direction of south east London, where a £2million salary and a £1m bonus for Premier League survival awaits. But for Newcastle, it is another beginning. On Tuesday, caretaker boss John Carver addressed United’s senior players. The mood is good, they are saddened but accepting of Pardew’s choice. One point of relief and levity were the reports — strongly denied by the club — that skipper Fabricio Coloccini was set to be appointed manager. His team-mates are already calling him ‘gaffer’. Such is the nature of a footballer’s existence, they move on. Pardew is gone. Talk on Tyneside and in the dressing-room has turned to his replacement. Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini arrives at training, while Peter Beardsley (right) gives a thumbs up . There have been reports, strongly denied by the club, that Coloccini was set to be appointed manager . Carver and coach Steve Stone — unaware of Pardew’s defection until Monday — will get the chance to impress over the next two matches, a home game with Burnley and the FA Cup tie at Leicester. Carver, a Geordie and disciple of Sir Bobby Robson, would love to manage his hometown club. As would two other natives of the North-East, Steve Bruce and Lee Clark. Contact, meanwhile, has been made with Tony Pulis. He, however, was unhappy with some of the terms being floated. And that, says former Newcastle favourite Steve Howey, is why Pardew’s successor must enter the role having already ceded some control to a hierarchy who identify signings. ‘It’s no good going into the job if you think you’re going to get the opportunity to do your own thing,’ he told Sportsmail. John Carver and Steve Stone will get the chance to impress over the next two matches, a home game with Burnley and the FA Cup tie at Leicester . All was quiet at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training on Tuesday, with no Pardew announcement imminent . ‘That’s why I think Alan did a very good job. He made it work. Some fans think he was just a puppet for Mike Ashley. But how many of us would go storming into our boss’s office shouting the odds if we weren’t happy about something? ‘He was good at playing that role and was a politician at times. He was there for four years but I think he’d had enough – enough of some of the conditions he worked under and enough of some of the abuse from fans. I thought it was a disgrace when it affected his family. ‘So part of me thinks, “You know what, Alan, good on you”. Some people think things are going to suddenly change at the club because he’s gone and I understand some of the reasons why a lot of fans didn’t like him. But, for me, he did a good job and that might be realised in time.’ Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood is currently in the frame for the St James' Park job . And Howey is right. Pardew leaving does not herald a brilliant new dawn at St James’ Park. Yes, there is the chance for a new man to inject new ideas, but he will still be Ashley’s man, a point which some supporters always held against Pardew. The owner, says Howey, will reveal a lot about his aspirations for the club with this appointment. ‘It will be interesting to see who he gets,’ said the former England defender. ‘It will either show great ambition to go out and pay money for a high-profile name, or it could be an appointment which doesn’t excite the fans or capture the imagination. ‘Looking at the list of names linked so far there is no-one really who stands out who’d you’d say, “Yes, get him”.’ Perhaps that is why Newcastle will take their time. Any unveiling is not expected until next week at the earliest but work is underway to draw up a shortlist, hence the early contact with Pulis’s people. Newcastle legend Steve Howey would like to see Les Ferdinand (left) given a chance . Howey, though, is championing two of his former team-mates, Peter Beardsley and Les Ferdinand. ‘I don’t think it’s a bad idea at all to promote Peter from the Under-21s and give him until the end of the season,’ he said. ‘If it was from the outside then I’d say Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand as his assistant would appeal to fans. Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . ‘Sherwood was pretty outspoken at Spurs but he might have learnt his lesson – he’d have to if he was going to work here. But he’s got an ace card in Les and that could work.’ Making things work is what it’s all about as manager of Newcastle. Pardew did. But, after four years, he’d had enough. Now it’s the turn of someone else to play Magpie mediator – they best bring a cap and leather jacket just in case it doesn’t work out.","Alan Pardew sneaks into Newcastle training ground in disguise .

"Branded: BBC's Neil Oliver in a Berghaus jacket . The BBC has been accused of allowing its presenters to advertise Berghaus clothing by ‘the back door’ – after negotiating a deal to buy jackets at a 45 per cent discount. The Corporation has spent thousands kitting out staff on its most popular programmes in a range of the brand’s latest jackets and fleeces. Presenters such as BBC news anchor George Alagiah and diplomatic correspondent Peter Hunt have been seen in the jackets bearing the brand’s red and blue logo alongside the name Berghaus. Regional reporters Jon Kay, Alex Bushill and Fiona Trott, science host Professor Brian Cox and Coast presenter Neil Oliver have also worn them on screen. BBC editorial guidelines state that staff should adhere to a set of strict rules banning them from the on-screen promotion of products or brands. The reason for Berghaus’s on-screen popularity is the BBC’s massive discount on the brand. But MPs accused the Corporation of ‘advertising by the back door’ and many licence fee payers have aired their concerns on internet message boards. One wrote: ‘The advertising of products or the deliberate, prominent display of commercial brand logos whilst on-screen by BBC personnel is forbidden by the Corporation.’ Another wrote: ‘Why do I keep seeing . TV presenters wearing Berghaus coats? Just seen one with the Berghaus . logo on one side and BBC on the other. What’s this shameless advertising . on the Beeb?’ The Mail on . Sunday can reveal through the Freedom of Information Act that the BBC . bought 169 jackets from Berghaus during the last financial year. When bought in shops, the waterproof jackets cost between £85 and £320. Logos: Jon Kay (left) and George Alagiah are seen with the distinctive motifs . But the BBC has negotiated a deal to . purchase the items for a corporate discount worth a minimum of 45 per . cent, although bigger discounts may apply. The jackets were given out free of . charge to staff on location, but the Corporation refused to say how much . it has spent on them and who received them. Estimates based on an average-priced . jacket costing £200 would put the figure at more than £18,500 in the . past year, including the discount. The . special deal has been in existence since 2005 – prompting speculation . the BBC has actually spent much more on clothing since it came into . place. As part of a separate deal, BBC staff are already entitled to purchase Berghaus items personally at a discount of 45 per cent. 'Clearly the licence fee payers don't benefit from this arrangement' Last night the Corporation insisted it had no arrangement to advertise any brand of clothing via on-screen presenters. But Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons media select committee, said: ‘It is inappropriate for any relationship to exist between the BBC and any commercial organisation wanting to advertise through the back door, and this appears to be a case of just that. 'Clearly the licence fee payers don’t benefit from this arrangement in any way.’ Liberal Democrat culture spokesman . Don Foster said: ‘The BBC should be squeaky clean about any commercial . arrangements it enters into, particularly if the products might be seen . on screen.’ In March, Berghaus made clear on its website that it has no advertising deal with the BBC. The brand was founded in 1966 by Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison, two climbers and mountaineers from the North East. Berghaus Brigade: Peter Hunt, Alex Bushill and Fiona Trott spotted on screen . Frustrated by what they saw as a lack of decent outdoor gear, they decided to import and sell their own. In 1972 they began designing and manufacturing their own products in a shop in Newcastle under the brand name ‘Berghaus’ – meaning ‘mountain house’ in German. The firm still has its headquarters in Sunderland. Last night the BBC said: ‘Berghaus is one of a number of suppliers of clothing used by the BBC. It would be wrong to suggest the BBC ever agrees to clothing discounts in exchange for on-air promotion.’ The BBC Trust said it had received no complaints on the issue. Berghaus said: ‘No advertising or sponsorship deal exists between the BBC and Berghaus as this would break the BBC’s editorial guidelines. ‘It is common practice for us to agree favourable trade terms for broadcasters such as the BBC, and for individual staff.’ The North Face: BBC newsreader Evan Davis . This is not the first time questions have been asked about the BBC’s use of branded clothing on screen. There was a similar ‘product . placement’ controversy in 2008 when several high-profile presenters made . regular appearances in outdoor clothing showing The North Face’s logo. Economics editor Evan Davis, business . presenter Declan Curry, Newsnight’s David Grossman, Paris correspondent . Clive Myrie and transport correspondent Tom Symonds were all criticised . for wearing the distinctive American brand on camera. There was yet another controversy over BBC attire worn by staff at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. Presenters including Clare Balding . were seen by millions wearing jackets bearing the letter K – the logo of .

"For as long as people have been drinking too much, they have been searching for a cure for that dreaded morning after hangover. Raw eggs with or without Worcestershire sauce is apparently one cure; others eat chocolate or a bacon sandwich - but the answer could be as simple as to carry on doing what you were doing that caused the hangover – have a drink. Adam Rogers, the author of Proof: the Science of Booze, is of the opinion that the 'hair of the dog' makes you feel better, but the question is why it does this, and importantly whether it's really a good idea. Carry on drinking: Apparently the best way to treat a hangover is to have another drink (file photos) Every alcoholic drink contains, as well as ethanol, small traces of the poisonous methanol. In high doses methanol can make people go blind or even die because the body converts it to formaldehyde, a poison used as a preservative in some laboratories. Doctors treat methanol poisoning by giving patients ethanol to prevent its change into formaldehyde. 'If methanol poisoning is at least in part responsible for a hangover, having a drink the next morning may alleviate symptoms,' said Mr Rogers although he was at pains to point out that the theory was 'hypothetical' at best. Drinking water if you have a hangover will have little or no effect on the way you feel (file photo) Lauren Owen, a psychopharmacologist at Keele University and a member of the Alcohol Hangover Research Group, agreed that there was some scientific support for the idea. 'Alcohol acts on a number of chemicals in the brain to increase feelings of pleasure,' she said. 'Reduction of hangover symptoms by ""hair of the dog"" may also be due to the activity of alcohol on neurotransmitter systems.' One thing that appears to have no scientific basis is rehydration. Mr Rogers said: 'You can get rid of the dehydration and you are still hungover.'","Most hangover cures don't work and best idea may be to have another drink .

"Margaret Thatcher was marked out by American diplomats as a ‘quintessential suburban matron, and frightfully English to boot,’ previously censored documents reveal today. The observations, made in 1975 when the future Prime Minister became leader of the Conservative Opposition, have coincidentally been made public on the day of her death. The words were written by US diplomatic staff based in London and passed on to Washington DC. They illustrate how the Americans viewed the then plain Mrs Thatcher as a kind of novelty figure. Scroll down for video . Report: The documents published by WikiLeaks show American diplomats viewed Margaret Thatcher as 'quintessentially English' Friends: The papers described Mrs Thatcher (seen here following her election as prime minister with US president Ronald Reagan) as having a 'plummy' English accent . It is contained in a cable stored in . US archives which reads: ‘Her conventional and somewhat forced charm, . and above all her plummy voice stamp her as the quintessential suburban . matron, and frightfully English to boot. 'None of this goes down well with the working class of England (one-third of which used to vote Conservative), to say nothing of all classes in the Celtic Fringes of this island.’ Four years later she was swept to power in the 1979 General Election, and went on to become one of American president Ronald Reagan’s greatest allies. The Thatcher cable is one of some 240,000 records from 1973 to 1976 which were sent from or to London and cover a range of diplomatic developments. Released by WikiLeaks , they are mostly sensitive documents amassed in the US national archives which have recently been declassified. Revealing: The declassified documents showed diplomats felt Mrs Thatcher's 'plummy' English accent did not go down well with working class voters . WikiLeaks described the Public Library of US Diplomacy (PlusD) as the world's largest searchable collection of U.S. confidential, or formerly confidential, diplomatic communications. Much of the work was carried out by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, 41, during his time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been staying since last summer. The Australian sought refuge at the embassy last June over fears that he would be sent to the U.S. if he was extradited to Sweden to face sexual offence claims by two women - charges he denies. Early Days: The Queen talks with Prime Minister Thatcher in Zambia in 1979. As prime minister she would go on to radically change Britain during her time in office . Leader: Mrs Thatcher's reputation in America was very different by the end of her time in office - after she had transformed Britain's economic fortunes and led the nation to victory in the Falklands War . Baroness Thatcher suffered acute short-term memory loss and had a series of strokes over a decade. She spent 11 years in Downing Street, the longest run by any 20th century prime minister. Margaret Thatcher came to power in May 1979, at the end of the infamous Winter of Discontent, where Britain was crippled by a wave of national strikes. She spent the next decade curbing the power of trade unions, signalling the end of an era when trade union leaders trooped in and out of 10 Downing Street, haggling and bargaining with her Labour predecessors. WikiLeaks: Much of the work on the WikiLeaks release was done by founder Julian Assange . Instead she stripped the unions of . many of their powers with the aim of transferring them to managements . and individual consumers. Mrs . Thatcher successfully defied Arthur Scargill's nationwide and year-long . miners' strike, which threatened to cripple Britain's entire economic . base. And as she transformed the nation - attempting to release the grip of the state on massive industries and public services alike - she became one of the most influential, talked-about, listened-to and dominant statesmen of the Western world. Britain’s first and only female prime minister, who won three consecutive general elections, had been in fragile health.

"A venomous snake escaped from its enclosure at London Zoo, reports today suggest. The Sri Lankan pit viper made its bid for freedom by slipping out of a vivarium - which is similar to a tank - kept in London Zoo's reptile building. Thankfully, the young creature - whose venom can cause renal and cardiac failure - was recaptured by a keeper who spotted it slithering away. Great escape: A Sri Lankan pit viper made a bid for freedom from its enclosure at London Zoo - but was captured by a zookeeper. The tourist attraction failed to notify the local council of its escape, reports suggest . The zoo did not report the escape - which took place in August 2012 - to Camden Council, the Evening Standard has reported. A 2013 inspection report reveals that the council claim this failure was a 'serious breach' of the organisation's responsibilities to the local area. Other concerns regarding safety at the zoo were highlighted in the report. The safety of electrical wiring surrounding the site - including a broken wire on the spider monkey area was one of the issues. The tanks where carpet pythons are kept were found to be too small for the size of the creature, inspectors found. The report added that the zoo's emergency escape plan was 'confusing and overcomplicated'. The zoo - which was granted its new licence just yesterday - said all of the concerns raised in the report have since been dealt with. Overall, inspectors from the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs, said they were 'impressed' by their findings. It added the health of the animals was  of top standard - and the knowledge of the zookeepers was 'excellent'. Zoological Director David Field said: 'ZSL London Zoo is subjected to regular inspections as part of its zoo license, the most recent of which observed that the animals all appeared to be in excellent health and that ZSL ""well exceeds the industry standards"" for its conservation efforts. A 2013 DEFRA inspection report also revealed other concerns regarding the Zoos electrical safety measures and escape routes. The Zoo, pictured, said it has dealt with all the issues raise . 'ZSL London Zoo’s staff work closely with the inspection team to address any queries and responds to all recommendations from the inspection, making changes immediately or as soon as is possible. 'ZSL London Zoo’s new zoo license was issued on Thursday 19 June 2014 with all of the conditions that were highlighted in the October 2013 inspection addressed.' The Sri Lankan pit viper - or trimeresurus trigonocephalus - is endemic to Sri Lanka. The creature is typically green and black in colour and is a 'category one' animal - i.e. the most dangerous type of snake. They measure 20–25 cm at birth with males growing to a maximum of 60–75 cm. The viper is both arboreal - i.e. lives mainly in trees - and nocturnal. When it does venture on to the ground, it does so to catch prey such as lizards, frogs, birds and other small mammals. Its venom causes severe pain and swelling of the bitten area as well as blistering around the bite for several days. In some victims it can cause renal and cardiac failure - but no fatalities have been reported.","Venomous Sri Lankan pit viper escaped from London Zoo's reptile building .

"Blyth Spartans captain Robbie Dale will head straight back to his bar job after coming so close to serving up another FA Cup fairytale for the non-league side against Championship Birmingham at Croft Park. Dale scored twice in the first half to give his side a dream advantage before three goals in 12 minutes after the break helped Gary Rowett's men narrowly avoid embarrassment. Dale works at the Blacksmith's pub in nearby Gosforth and revealed: 'I am due to open up at half past eleven on Sunday morning. Robbie Dale celebrates after putting his team 1-0 up before going on to double the lead later in the half . Dale scores his side's first goal after the 35th minute to take a surprise lead against Birmingham City . 'I asked the gaffer if I could do a shorter shift because I don't know what mood I will be in today and after a couple of goals I am planning to have a good night.' Spartans recent cup run suggested they would fancy their chances against their illustrious opponents and after surviving two early chances for Blues' striker Nikola Zigic they seized control of the game. Dale swept home a 35th minute opener after a cross by second round hero Jarrett Rivers, then belted the second from the edge of the box to send the majority in the 4,400-capacity crowd wild with delight. Spartans boss Tom Wade said: 'It's a proud day for Blyth as a club and a town and days like today just underline to me how much of a pleasure it is being manager of such a great club. 'Obviously we're disappointed but if someone had said before the game we were going to lose 3-2 and have a chance in the final minute we might have taken it.

Blues boss Gary Rowett paid tribute to Blyth, saying: 'I thought they were absolutely brilliant and this is what the FA Cup is about - a team from down the non-league pyramid having a day like this. 'We had a goal chalked off and Zigic missed a simple chance so you could argue we might have been two goals ahead but their goals were good goals from their point of view. 'I hoped our experience would tell and I didn't need to give them a rocket at half time. I didn't throw anything and I was quite placid. To be honest, the players gave themselves a rocket and you saw the result.' Thomas celebrates as Birmingham City came back from two goals down to win 3-2 .

"The morning mist had yielded to soothing autumn sunshine when Lee Westwood came trampling off the 18th green at Celtic Manor. He was in high good humour, having concluded an excellent round of 68 with an eagle at the last. He shook a flock of hands, posed for a stream of ‘selfies’ and signed his name on a frantic flutter of books and caps. And he remembered to smile his thanks every time somebody said: ‘Good luck next week.’ Next week: it was at the forefront of every mind, especially in the valley where Europe reclaimed Sam Ryder’s pot by a single point just four years ago. Lee Westwood has the drive and motivation to succeed next week in his ninth Ryder Cup with Europe . Westwood played his full part in that victory; indeed, his glassy-eyed grin as he lurched from the clubhouse balcony is a vivid memory of that happy Monday. But those antics are in the past: the future begins at Gleneagles, on Friday. For the past few days, Celtic Manor has been staging the Wales Open. It is an admirable tournament in its own right, but this week it has been reduced to a prelude, an appetiser for the main event. Inevitably, mutterings of ‘next week’ have rippled around the galleries whenever the four European representatives were in action. Of that quartet, Stephen Gallacher endured a calamitous opening day and made a premature departure. But Thomas Bjorn has been stolidly consistent, Jamie Donaldson has been impressively productive, and Westwood has been unfailingly interesting. Westwood is -3 after three rounds of the Wales Open at Celtic Manor, 11 shots off leader Joost Luiten . Having played in eight Ryder Cups, and having helped to win six of them, he understands just what the event represents. ‘I always say that only golfers used to watch the Ryder Cup,’ he says. ‘Now people who are interested in sport watch it. It’s not just golfers. I have people coming up to me saying they’ve never picked a club up in their life, but they thought the last day of the past Ryder Cup was the most enthralling day of sport. They couldn’t get off the couch. They had things to do but they were just captivated by the whole thing. ‘I’m not a Liverpool fan, but I was captivated by the second half in Istanbul when they came back from 3-0 down (in 2005). The Ryder Cup has been the same for non-golfers. It’s changed dramatically.’ Since his 1997 debut, Westwood has earned 21 points and been a key man in six victorious Ryder Cup teams. He has been on the losing side twice. P     W      L       H . Singles                 8      3       5       0 . Foursomes          15     7       4       4 . Fourballs             14     8       4       2 . Total                    37    18     13      6 . He is acutely aware of how the contest brought him a kind of redemption as a golfer. Having led the European merit list in 2000, he took time off to reshape his swing and drifted out to 75th in 2002. But in the 2002 match at The Belfry, he joined with Sergio Garcia in a stunningly successful partnership which brought them three wins out of four. From there on, he moved back to the heights he had once commanded, all the way to world No 1. He remembers it warmly: ‘Sergio helped me a lot. He was the perfect partner for me. It gave my career a kickstart. ‘This could be the same. Any time you play well under pressure, and next week will be the most intense pressure you will ever experience, it makes a difference. ‘It was nice to play well and not let anybody down, because I hadn’t been playing particularly well going into that Ryder Cup. But it also triggered something in my head that made me realise I was still a good player and I could still do it under pressure. I guess I owe the Ryder Cup something for helping to restore my belief.’ The Celtic Manor crowd instinctively embraces Westwood, as if recognising a man who suffers and celebrates just like them. For all his experience and wealth, accumulated through two decades as a tour player, he retains a touch of Everyman. When he announced that he had shed 23lbs in three weeks, he seemed rather proud of his achievement. Nobody was cruel enough to enquire how a top sportsman can carry so much excess baggage. It was Westwood. This is his way. He moves around the course with an aldermanic waddle, his face a mirror of his mood. The good shots bring a flashing beam, the indifferent efforts the darkest scowl. You sense that the game remains important to him, that the drive for perfection is intact, no matter that he had to rely on a wild card for Ryder Cup selection. You also sense that his influence on the young players may well prove crucial next week. He understands what is expected: ‘Any time it’s your first Ryder Cup, you will need a helping hand, an arm around the shoulder, no matter how old you are. It’s a shock. The intensity and atmosphere is the difference. The discipline is just the same.’ Westwood celebrates in 2012 with Jose Maria Olazabal as the European Team triumph in the last Ryder Cup . He adds: ‘You put a tee in the ground with a bit of grass on it. It’s the same little white ball you play all year, the same driver behind it. Nothing’s changed, except the 25,000 people that feel like they are on top of you, all screaming’. He also appreciates the team dynamic. ‘Even when games are being lost on the course, if someone wins a couple of holes and goes from three down to one down, that can spur people on to come back in their game,’ he says. ‘I think it was Peter Hanson in front of me against Jason Dufner, and Peter was five down or something and he got it back to two down and you think “Oh, Pete’s on a comeback now”, and it lifts you, even though he was losing his match. ‘That’s what you try and impress on everybody. If you’re losing, keep sticking in and strange things can happen.’ The European team celebrate their against all odds victory in 2012 in the so-called Miracle of Medinah . An air of contentment sits well on Westwood, especially on this softly successful day in South Wales. Next week will be quite different. It will be a genuine sporting ordeal. In such circumstances, can he actually enjoy the game he clearly loves? He considers. ‘There are moments when you can laugh and enjoy it. Just looking at the crowd and appreciating that there are 20,000 people lined up on the bank beside the 16th cheering for you. It frames the hole. There’s no experience in golf that’s anywhere close to the atmosphere of a Ryder Cup.’ Saturday evening found him at the driving range; working, concentrating, seeking that critical edge. Sunday he will enjoy another joust with Celtic Manor. Then the circus pitches tent in Gleneagles. Next week, as the crowds kept repeating. Next week, with the great game to be played, and history waiting to be made.","Europe meet USA in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles on September 26-28 .

"'Everyone who has been married knows it is work and we have that times three.' These are the words of Michael Crawley, a Mormon living in Centennial Park, Arizona, with his three wives. He and some of the other 1,500 Mormons living in the commune have given Channel 4 an unprecedented insight into their lives for a new documentary starting this evening, Three Wives, One Husband: Married to the Mormons. Michael reveals that he 'truly' loves each of his three wives - Rose, Connie and Teresa - but it hasn't always been easy adapting each time their family has expanded, both emotionally and financially. Big family: Michael Cawley has three wives and 18 children who he is struggling to support financially . Michael's eldest daughter takes some of her siblings to the playground at Centennial Park, Arizona, were 1,500 Mormons live and believe in polygamy . He had been married to Rose for seven years before he then married Connie. Rose admits there was some 'conflict' when Connie first moved in but they persevered because they all believe they are following God's plan that they should be a family. Rose said: 'Another person comes into the . picture and you have to step aside and allow that relationship to . develop. It's hard to allow that to happen.' Connie added that fitting into an already established family wasn't easy for her either. 'The first couple of weeks after I . got married were a little bit awkward,' she admitted. 'But we really believe that this is . where God wants us and he expects us to find a way to work it out.' Another seven years later, Teresa also married Michael. She said being part of a polygamous family 'is one of the . most difficult things I have ever chosen to do but I would not choose . another way to live.' Had to step aside: Michael's first wife, Rose, pictured feeding some of their children, said it hasn't been easy adapting to her husband taking two more wives . The three women have 18 children between them with Michael but all insist they are happy and wouldn't want to live any other way. But Michael reveals that as much as he loves his three spouses, caring for them and their offspring puts him under immense financial strain. He and Rose work full time to feed the family who get through 12 gallons of milk a week and 15 dozen eggs, with a weekly shopping bill of around $900. He said: 'I can't keep up with the needs of the family, it's not possible.' His solution is for Connie to go back to work leaving just Teresa holding the babies and ensuring the smooth running of a home with 18 children. The documentary reveals how Mormon marriages take place after the woman is given divine inspiration from God on who her husband should be. A young woman could be married to another young man ready to start a family or could just as likely become the third wife of a man three times her age who already has wives and children. Becca Thompson, 22, who married Isaiah Thompson, 30, when he already had a wife and four children, said she had no qualms about becoming second wife when she received her calling from God. Following God's plan: Two of Michael's wives, Rose and Connie, both left, seen praying with their children. They believe God intends them to be one big family . She said: 'One day I was sitting in church and . Isaiah walked in. A feeling came across me that he was who I was . supposed to marry. I knew he had a wife. It's awesome that women here . can get married to a man who is already married. 'I grew up in a big . family and I loved it, my dad has six wives and I have 46 siblings.' Isaiah's first wife, Marleen, admitted the arrival of Becca in her family home wasn't easy. She said: 'I was nervous about the change that was about to happen, she's a lot younger than I am.' Isaiah explains how their union works on a nightly basis: 'l sleep with Marleen two nights in a row then Becca two nights in a row.' Marleen elaborates: 'We each have our own rooms. If . I'm sleeping alone I'll sleep in mine and if I'm sleeping with Isaiah . I'll sleep in his.' Marleen hints that the nights she spends away from her husband - knowing he is sleeping with another woman - evokes varies feelings. She said: 'Jealousy is normal human emotion. Different fears . like ""would he ever toss me aside?"" go through every woman's brain.' Arthur Hammon with two of his three wives: He's teaching the next generation of Mormons that polygamy  and 'placement' marriages lead to happiness . Isaiah had a baby with Becca, bringing his total number of children to five, but he reveals on this evening's documentary that he would like another. 'Pick her!' quips mother-of-four Marleen when he broaches the subject of motherhood with them. Meanwhile, the first episode of the series explains how young men keen to start a family have to become missionaries first. They are taught how to be good husbands and are banned from dating or even growing a beard. They will remain missionaries until the Mormon leaders, 'the brethren' inform them they can marry. One young man, who has been a missionary for three-and-a-half-years, finds out he has been given a bride on this evening's show. 'Her name is Kelly and that's all I know about her,' he says. One of the Mormon leaders, Arthur Hammon, a fourth generation polyamgist with three wives, explains these 'placement' marriages are the best way to ensure a lasting union. He is adamant that their way of life should continue, even though polygamy is against the law. 'A law officer could turn up with a . warrant for my address. But we believe in minding our own business and . think other people should do that same,' he said. Explaining their system of 'placing' women with husbands, he said:  'We don't encourage young people to date... You think you can live on love? That's an . impossibility at best. We encourage our children to reserve their . feeling until they can be placed with confidence.'

Rodgers told Sky Sports News: 'Don't put pressure on Rickie Lambert to get goals, Rickie Lambert has been brought in here to be a very valuable member of our squad. 'He has proven it all his career. He has got goals at whatever level he has played at. 'He came on for internationals and he gets goals, with Southampton for the past couple of seasons he gets goals. 'So there is no need for him to be under any pressure, he needs to come in at 32 years of age and contribute to the history of this club.

"One in 20 Britons have admitted to cheating on their partner whilst on holiday. And three per cent of unfaithful people claim that 'it doesn't count as cheating if you're on another continent', according to a new poll. Ibiza has been named the most top location for infidelity abroad, with 39 per cent of respondents citing it the location they'd be more tempted to cheat on their partner. Three per cent of those unfaithful people claim 'it doesn't count if you're on another continent' The Spanish island has also been named the most likely location for people to break-up with a partner (48 per cent). The 'journey of love' study hopes to explores Britons' favourite locations for the different stages of love. These include picking up a holiday fling, the most likely location to tempt you into cheating, the ideal destination to flee when nursing a broken heart and the best spot to tie the knot. It also uncovers some of the motivations behind these choices. The study shows that just over half . (51 per cent) of Brits would choose a holiday fling location based on . how romantic it is and whether it would make a nice story when they got . home. But romance . appears to be forgotten when it comes to weddings abroad, as more than . one in 20 (6 per cent) Britons confess they would choose a marriage . destination that's most likely to make their friends jealous. Four per cent of Britons have broken up with their partner whilst away on holiday with them . Men seem to be the sex most concerned with boasting, as this figure . rising to almost one in 10 (9 per cent) amongst British males. When it comes to break-ups, four per cent of Britons have broken up with their partner whilst away on holiday with them. To deal with a break-up, almost a quarter . (23 per cent) of Britons would choose to flee to a destination in which . they could 'find themselves' and reflect on what went wrong in the . relationship. Venice is the top location for a holiday fling (18 per cent) Paris is the ideal destination for a proposal (24 per cent) Barbados is the preferred spot for eloping (24 per cent) The Maldives is Brits' favourite wedding destination (18 per cent) Ibiza is the location where people are most likely to break-up with a partner (48 per cent) New York is where Britons would flee to in order to get over broken heart (21 per cent) A spokesperson for travel comparison website KAYAK.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'We wanted to understand where, given the choice, Brits would head around the world for the different elements of the ""journey of love"" and the findings were certainly enlightening. 'With January being a peak time for holiday bookings, Brits should take heed of the study, particularly if a partner suggests heading to Ibiza or Paris, as it could mean a break-up or proposal is on the cards.'",39% cite Ibiza as location they'd be more tempted to cheat on their partner .
"A teacher who told parents and colleagues he was changing sex and coming back to school as a woman has been found dead at home. Lucy Meadows, 32, a Year Six teacher at St Mary Magdalen's Church of England Primary School, in Accrington, Lancashire, had changed her name from Nathan Upton after deciding to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Last December, a newsletter was sent out by the school saying Mr Upton should be addressed as Miss Meadows when classes returned following the Christmas holidays. Each class at the 169-pupil school - whose motto is 'Reaching our potential together in Christ' - was spoken to about the the schoolmaster's sex change. Lucy Meadows, a teacher at St Mary Magdalen's Church of England Primary School (above), in Accrington, Lancs, has been found dead at home. Born Nathan Upton, he became Lucy Meadows . This week, police went to the teacher's home in Accrington and found her body inside. The cause of death is not known but officers confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances. The matter has been referred to the coroner. News of the tragedy was broken today by the school's headteacher Karen Hardman, who posted a message on the school's website saying: 'It is with great sadness that I have to inform you of the death of Miss Lucy Meadows. 'Our staff will be working closely with bereavement teams and are here to offer the children and yourselves any support in any way we can.' Lancashire Police said: 'At 4.45pm on Tuesday, March 19, police were called by the ambulance service to a report of a sudden death at an address in Accrington. 'On arrival, they found the body of a 32-year-old woman. There are no suspicious circumstances and a file will be prepared and passed to the coroner.' The newsletter which was hand-delivered to parents, said: 'Mr Upton has made a significant change in his life and will be transitioning to live as a woman after the Christmas break. She will return to work as Miss Meadows.' It said the school was fully supporting him throughout his 'transition' and added: 'We are proud of our commitment to equality and diversity among our staff and children.'

"More than 200 servicewomen have been sent home from war zones after discovering they were pregnant. An astonishing 99 were evacuated from Afghanistan and 102 from Iraq under rules that ban mothers-to-be from serving on the front line. Commanders ordered them to return to Britain – sometimes on flights reserved for injured troops – as soon as their condition became known. Six-month-old Emmanuel, who was born to Lynette Pearce at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, pictured with his grandmother Sugar at the grandparents home in Fiji . Mother: Lance Bombardier Lynette Pearce, 28, was the first British Army soldier to give birth on the front line . Incredibly, female soldiers are not forced to take a pregnancy test before deploying because top brass believe it would be an invasion of privacy. But the Ministry of Defence has faced calls to introduce compulsory tests because it is ‘unacceptable’ that other service personnel are placed at risk of attack while evacuating pregnant women from the front line. Pregnancy tests can be bought from High Street chemists for less than £10 and can give a result as soon as seven days after conception. Official MoD figures showed 201 pregnant servicewomen have been evacuated from the conflict in Afghanistan since 2006 and from the war in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. The MoD said it was fewer than one per cent of female soldiers deployed on operations. Most of the babies would have been . conceived before the mother left the UK but a small number of women may . have become pregnant on a tour of duty. The Armed Forces do not have a . set-in-stone ‘no-touching’ rule for troops in the war zone. Rules: 99 female soldiers were evacuated from Afghanistan and 102 from Iraq after commanders discovered they were pregnant (file picture) But all who serve there are warned that the MoD disapproves of sexual relations between troops and that any inappropriate behaviour would breach guidelines. Those caught having sex usually face a rebuke from their commanding officer or more serious disciplinary action, depending on their rank and position. A defence source said: ‘It wouldn’t be the hugest surprise that people get together at base to alleviate boredom and fear. But the vast majority of troops know it is utterly unprofessional and the consequences serious. ‘It’s more likely people know they are going to be deployed for a long time so they have sex with their partner before they go and don’t realise they’re pregnant until they get there.’ In 2011, Private Kayla Donnelly, then 21, from Penrith in Cumbria, served in Helmand unaware she was seven months pregnant. She conceived before going to Afghanistan as a machine-gunner and thought her weight gain was due to high-calorie Army rations. It was only when she collapsed in Tenerife after her tour  that she realised she was pregnant. Pre-deployment guidelines issued to every soldier make clear female troops should not deploy if they are pregnant but at no time are women given a pregnancy test by the MoD. Female soldiers are asked whether they are – or suspect they are – pregnant. This is routine so medical staff can ensure the inoculation does not damage an unborn baby. At the height of the fighting in Afghanistan, between 500 and 600 women were posted at any one time. About 10,000 have served in Helmand.Servicewomen are barred from infantry battalions, tank regiments, the Royal Marine Commandos and Special Forces. But they go on patrol with combat units and risk firefights while in supporting roles such as medics. Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former commander of British troops in Bosnia, said he was against compulsory pregnancy tests. He said: ‘I think you have to be very careful about suddenly ordering people to take intrusive tests. Some get pregnant when they are actually out on operations in theatre so pre-deployment tests would not work with them.’ But Major General Julian Thompson, the ex-commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, said: ‘It would need to be put across sensitively, but this would ensure that they are 100 per cent fit for operations when they deploy.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Pregnant servicewomen are returned home to protect the health and safety of the mother and unborn child, not as a punishment.’","Mothers-to-be are banned from serving on the front line .

"A 'Jurassic Park' in China was once home to dinosaurs that lived among early mammals, amphibians and other strange creatures 160 million years ago. The extraordinary fossil bed contains the bones of pterosaurs - early mammals – including the first known swimming mammal with a beaver-like tail, the earliest gliding mammal and feathered dinosaurs. Their remarkably preserved remains were discovered in rocks beneath the Jehol Biota in north eastern China - a famous collection of 130 million-year-old fossils from the Cretaceous Period. The extraordinary fossil bed contains the bones of pterosaurs - early mammals ¿ including the first known swimming mammal with a beaver-like tail, the earliest gliding mammal and feathered dinosaurs. This is a reconstruction of the Daohugou site's fauna . The Daohugou Biota is the name for a group of 160million-year-old fossils. They were discovered in rocks beneath the Jehol Biota in north eastern China - a famous collection of 130 million-year-old fossils from the Cretaceous Period. The fossils shed light on life in the Middle-Upper Jurassic 30million years earlier when birds are believed to have evolved from feathered dinosaurs. Fossils include complete or nearly-complete skeletons associated with preserved soft tissues such as feathers, fur, skin or even, in some of the salamanders, external gills. The soft tissues of feathered dinosaur Epidexipteryx have been revealed by the use of ultraviolet light scanners. A fossil of a salamander Chunerpeton shows not only the preserved skeleton but also its skin and external gills. The latest discovery sheds light on life in the Middle-Upper Jurassic 30million years earlier when birds are believed to have evolved from feathered dinosaurs. The newly discovered Middle Jurassic fossils have been named the Daohugou fossils or Daohugou Biota after a village near one of the six sites dug up and have been catalogued and described in detail. A new study has classified these fossils as belonging to a distinct ecological group, or biota from the famous 130-million-year-old specimens, which include the world's most exquisitely preserved feathered dinosaurs. The Middle Jurassic fossils date from a time when many important vertebrates including mammals were undergoing evolutionary diversification. Dr Corwin Sullivan, of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology in Beijing, said: ‘The Daohugou Biota gives us a look at a rarely glimpsed side of the Middle to Late Jurassic. ‘This is not a parade of galumphing giants but an assemblage of quirky little creatures like feathered dinosaurs, pterosaurs with “advanced” heads on “primitive” bodies and the Mesozoic equivalent of a flying squirrel.’ A feathered dinosaur, Epidexipteryx, was found at the site. The inset shows feathers and soft tissues revealed by the use of ultraviolet light . Almost more impressive than the diversity of the biota is the preservation of many of the vertebrate specimens, according to the study published in the Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology. Fossils include complete or nearly-complete skeletons associated with preserved soft tissues such as feathers, fur, skin or even, in some of the salamanders, external gills. One is the feathered dinosaur Epidexipteryx whose soft tissues have been revealed by the use of ultraviolet light scanners. A fossil of the salamander Chunerpeton shows not only the preserved skeleton but also its skin and external gills. Dr Yuan Wang, co-author of the study, said: ‘The Daohugou amphibians are crucially important in the study of the phylogeny and early radiation of modern amphibian groups.’ A fossil of the salamander Chunerpeton shows not only the preserved skeleton but also its skin and external gills (pictured) The site in China sheds new light on the array of fauna living 160million years ago . Dr Paul Barrett, dinosaur researcher at the Natural History Museum in London who reviewed the study for the journal, said: ‘Daohugou is proving to be one of the key sites for understanding the evolution of feathered dinosaurs, early mammals, and flying reptiles due largely to the fantastic levels of preservation. ‘Many of the fossils are stunning and offer vast amounts of information. There are only a handful of similar sites elsewhere in the world. ‘Because the Daohugou Biota and the much better studied Jehol Biota are similar in preservational mode and geographic location - but separated by tens of millions of years - they give palaeontologists an outstanding, even unique, opportunity to study changes in the fauna of this region over a significant span of geological time and an important period in vertebrate evolution.’ Dr Sullivan said: ‘The Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs of north eastern China have been astonishing palaeontologists and the public for almost two decades now and the Daohugou Biota preserves their Jurassic counterparts in the same region.  As prequels go it's pretty exciting.’","Fossils of curious creatures living 160million years ago were discovered in rocks beneath the famous Jehol Biota in north eastern China .

"These daredevil highliners are the ultimate chillseekers - setting up hammocks hundreds of feet in the air. As they inch their way carefully along the thin wire, some are even happy to pull out a guitar and play some tunes. The extreme event, called the International Highline Meeting, is in its third year, and takes place at Monte Piana in Italy. It is a large gathering for fearless folks to hone their skills without any form of competitive edge. The idea of adding hammocks was put forward by hammock manufacturer Ticket To The Moon. Highliners attach the materials to a strengthened 'highline' as they walk out to their designated relaxation spots - 150ft high. Snapper Sebastian Wahlhuetter captured the breath-taking shots as 22 people hopped into 16 hammocks. The meeting ran from 6 to 14 September, with 500 people attending. Sebastian, who also helped to organise the event, revealed it was difficult to capture his shots due to the remote location and steep, rocky surroundings. He said: 'The action lasted around an hour and it was amazing to see all those people hanging out in their hammocks - it was exciting to watch. 'A special highline set up was rigged so that it could carry the weight of the many people on one line at the same time. 'Monte Piana Highline Festival was definitely the best highline event I have ever photographed.' Let's all hang out and do this again: The International Highline Meeting is now a regular event, and will take place again next September .

Time for another tune: Spirits - as well as locations - are high among the highliners as the afternoon progresses . A smile for the camera: The dramatic images were captured by photographer Sebastian Wahlhuetter .

"This is the shocking moment a motorcyclist was thrown head over heels by a hit-and-run motorist - but miraculously walked away virtually unharmed. Andrius Cesna, 33, had stopped at a roundabout on his Yahama bike when careless Richard Themistocleou, 35, slammed straight into the back of him. He was catapulted into the air and bounced off the bonnet of Themistocleou's company Vauxhall Astra before hitting the road and skidding across the tarmac. Scroll down for video .

Mr Cesna flips backwards as he is struck - although he was not hurt, his Yamaha motorbike was written off . After he is struck, Mr Cesna is sent skidding along the tarmac while Themistocleou hastily drives away . Mr Cesna quickly got to his feet clutching his back, with the whole accident filmed on a motorist's dashcam . But instead of stopping to help the stricken motorcyclist, the callous motorist took a quick glance out of his window and sped off. Miraculously, married Andrius walked away virtually unhurt although his £5,000 bike was written off. The horrific crash on the B6265 at Riddlesden, West Yorkshire was captured on the dashboard camera of another motorist. When arrested, Themistocleou, a service engineer for ADT Security, claimed he had no memory of the smash and then reported his car as stolen. After the accident, Mr Cesna, 33, promised his wife he would never get on a motorbike again . Mr Cesna, an HGV driver from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: 'He just hit me and drove off. 'I think I hit the car first then I hit the motorbike and then the road. 'I remember everything about it, it was a very scary moment. I thought he was going to kill me. I was just thinking ""I'm going to die"". It was very quick. 'I got up as quick as I could because I didn't feel anything at that moment and wanted to get out of the road. 'I sat down and I was panicking and I was in shock. It was terrifying.' Themistocleous, of Riddlesden, Keighley, West Yorkshire, was charged with driving without due care and attention, failing to stop and failing to report an accident. District Judge Susan Bouch, sitting at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates court, sentenced him to ten weeks imprisonment suspended for 12 months, with 150 hours unpaid community work, and gave him ten penalty points. After the accident Mr Cesna promised his wife Simona, 32, he would never get on a bike again. 'She never wanted me to drive a motorbike in the first place,' he said.

"Do you have some Bitcoins burning a hole in your proverbial pocket? If so, you can now buy a sports car from Lamborghini, who has become the latest retailer to accept the digital currency. The luxury car group's Newport Beach dealership in Orange County, California, sold a Tesla Model S Performance yesterday to an unnamed customer. The current list price for a Tesla Model S start from £49,900 in the UK ($110,000 in the U.S.), which is around 81 Bitcoins. Lamborghini Newport Beach yesterday sold this Tesla Model S electric car to an customer who paid in Bitcoins . Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer . digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as . the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. A . Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than . half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four . years ago. The sale marks an ongoing acceptance of Bitcoin among retailers as its value continues to rise. Last month the currency passed the $1,000 (£613) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009. The price of Bitcoins have since risen in the past several weeks with the price currently at $1007 (£616). Many retailers already accept Bitcoins, but up until now, they have largely been smaller companies. Analysts claim the demand for Bitcoin follows increased awareness about benefits of the currency and a drive to move it into the mainstream. The digital currency is increasingly being treated like gold, with some investors using it to hedge against currency fluctuations. Unlike traditional banking, Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. However, the Bank of France warned today about risks related to the digital currency, adding its voice to growing concerns about the unregulated, online money. Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government, or by physical assets. Their value depends on people's confidence in the currency. It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but have yet to become an accepted form of payment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com. The Bank of France said the price of Bitcoin in legal currencies was inherently volatile and users may find it difficult to convert to real money. The Chinese central bank has also warned financial institutions on today against trading Bitcoin, which has proven particularly popular in China. 'I think bitcoin is definitely going mainstream,' said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. 'I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell' Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Its release is tightly controlled in a process of 'mining', mimicking a central banking system's control over the minting of money. A Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, made a huge profit, after forgetting he bought £17 of currency four years ago. He recently found out he was sitting on a small fortune now worth more than half a million pounds. Silk Road, which allowed users to trade in illegal drugs, required transactions to be made using the virtual currency Bitcoin . Bitcoins are stored in encrypted . wallets secured with a private key. Mr Koch had forgotten his password . but when he eventually remembered it he was stunned by how much they had . jumped in value. Despite concerns, the virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses such as Lamborghini, a key step to a bigger role. ‘I think it's definitely going mainstream,’ said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. ‘I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it.’","A Lamborghini dealership sold a Tesla Model S for an unknown sum .

"Could this be your next wallet? Analysts say the ribbons spotted at the top of this iPhone prototype point to an 'NFC' chip inside . The iPhone has already replaced digital cameras, MP3 players and portable games consoles for most owners. Now it could be about to replace your wallet. The next iPhone, which is believed to launch in just two weeks time, is expected to come with a built-in chip which can serve as your credit or debit card for small payments. Eagle-eyed fans looking at leaked images of the internals of the device have spotted what they believe is an NFC chip within the phone. NFC is seen as the successor to the chip-and-pin, serving as a small contactless card which can be waved against scanners at tills to automate a payment. Some debit cards already have this feature installed, and certain retailers such as Pret a Manger already use the technology. Other . phones have come with in-built NFC, with Google making a big play for . the market with its 'Wallet' accounts in the United States. But . recent history shows that Apple needs to embrace a technology before it . sees widespread adoption among the public, and it could take an . 'iWallet' feature to spark a new payment system into life. 9to5Mac, . which has credible sources within the notoriously-secret Apple, has . found references to NFC code within iPhone prototypes, and they have . spotted 'NFC connectors' within purported images of the phone's . hardware. 9to5 speculates that 'Apple could tie . in with a payment processor like Citibank’s PayPass system for credit . card transactions - or it could become a payment processor of sorts with . its hundreds of millions of credit cards already on file at iTunes.' NFC has other useful benefits to users, . such as instantly transferring documents or images between phones simply . by tapping them together, as demonstrated by rival Samsung's 'Beam' feature on the recent Galaxy 3. With the launch expected within the . next few weeks, other news includes flat-screen maker LG Display . announcing production of screens expected to be for the new phone and . images showing the notorious new 'dock connector', which is a . slimmed-down version of the power and data port seen on previous . generations of iPhones and iPads.

Leaked: This picture purports to show the the flex cable components for Apple's iPad Mini and iPhone 5 incorporating the new smaller dock connector, headphone jack and home button connector . Is this the new iPhone cable? This image purporting to show the new gadget's lead was leaked on Twitter by Veister, a charger making company . The company is rumoured to be equipping the next iPhone with a larger screen after Samsung Electronics unveiled its latest Galaxy smartphone with a 4.8-inch touch-screen. Sources have said that the panels for the new iPhone will be 4in corner to corner - 30 per cent bigger than current iPhones. The iPhone screens will also be . thinner than previous versions with the use of so-called in-cell panels . which embed touch sensors into the liquid crystal display, eliminating . the touch-screen layer found in current iPhones. It is believed the iPhone 5 will be . announced on September 12, with pre-orders opening immediately. The . phone itself is expected to launch just over a week later on September . 21. However, Apple fans in the UK may have to wait another two weeks until October 5 before getting their hands on a phone. Apple are notoriously secretive and . have not even revealed what they will call their next iPhone. It could . be 'iPhone 5', or it may follow this year's spring iPad launch and . simply be called 'the new iPhone'. Leaks from the website iMore, which . has strong sources 'close to Apple', earlier this month suggested the . entire next generation of iDevices, including the iPod Nano, iPod Touch, . iPad Mini and future versions of the iPad, will use the new port.

"A Texas anarchist group has successfully produced the first-ever gun produced on a 3-D printer and made entirely of plastic parts. An era of unlicensed plastic guns, made on 3-D printers costing as little as $1,000, has long been forecast, but no one has previously designed a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition. On Sunday, the group Defense Distributed posted a video of founder Cody Wilson firing the 'Liberator' plastic pistol. Mr Wilson says he plans to make the schematics for the weapon available for free online this week - meaning everyone with a high-end 3-D printer can create their own version of the gun. Bang: This is the moment Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a 3-D printer . Crude: The Liberator plastic gun is a simple single-shot weapon that fires a small .380-caliber bullet . On the same day, New York Senator Chuck Schumer announced that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban the weapons because they can pass through metal detectors at airports and court houses without being picked up. 'We’re facing a situation where anyone -- . a felon, a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage and the . weapons they make will be undetectable. It’s stomach-churning,' he said. Sixteen of the 17 parts in the Liberator pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the Stratasys Dimension SST 3D printer. The final piece of the weapons - the firing pin - is a common nail. Mr Wilson told Forbes.com that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them. It is a bid, he says, to keep governments accountable to the people. 'You can print a lethal device. It’s kind of scary, but that’s what we’re aiming to show,' he said. 'Anywhere there’s a computer and an Internet connection, there would be the promise of a gun.' Plastic: Sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the Liberator are plastic, constructed by a 3-D printer. A small nail is used for a firing pin . The name of the gun - Liberator - comes from a simple World War II pistol that was designed by the US military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied Europe and concentration camps. Like its World War II predecessor, the Defense Distributed pistol is a crude weapon. It holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore. Shocking: New York Senator Chuck Schumer plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from 3-D printers . 3-D printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine, to construction to aerospace. The process, also called additive manufacturing, creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. The feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape. The machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing. The process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s. However, since 2010, an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3-D printers, which are increasingly small, increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable. Defense Distributed used a higher-end $8,000 model to build its 3-D gun. However entry-level desktop models can cost $500 to $1,000. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Engineers hope 3-D printing will begin an era of 'instant prototyping' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively. The group has successfully fired it . with a .380-caliber pistol round. However, an attempt to shoot a . slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces. Currently, the Liberator can only be . made through highly specialized processes on an $8,000 3-D printer. Mr . Wilson says he hopes to adapt the model . The technology behind 3-D printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades. It . is only since about 2010, though, that 3-D printers have become cheap . enough, simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to . purchase. Schumer says the accessibility of 3-D printers makes plastic guns a security threat. 'Guns are made out of plastic, so . they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or . sporting event,' Schumer said, according WCBS 880. 'Only . metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to . be detected by metal detectors, for instance, when you go through an . airport. 'A terrorist, someone who’s mentally ill, a spousal abuser, a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage.' Schumer . wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new . bill would add a ban on plastic high-capacity magazines. 'People . have made silencers, stocks, triggers and lots of other gun parts. They . can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone . with one of these printers – and the printers cost about $1,000 – can . make one,' Schumer said. Current law bans . all-plastic weaponry. Defense Distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle, to get around the law. Schumer says the metal can be swapped out and replaced with plastic. The future of weapons? The 3D printed gun being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home . Process: Video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each pat had been 3D printed and cleaned .","Defense Distributed posted video on Sunday of founder shooting all-plastic gun made on an $8,000 3-D printer .

"An historic bill was passed by the Norwegian parliament on Tuesday extending mandatory military service to women as part of a plan to promote gender equality. Proposition 122 L is looking to amend the Military Service and Home Guard Acts to enable women to fight in the military. The bill was passed in Oslo with a strong majority of 96 votes in favour of the proposition while just six votes were against. Women currently make up about 13 per cent of the Norwegian Armed Forces but that ratio could be set to rise . The proposition will be put to a second reading later in the term before being written into law. According to the Norwegian government women women currently make up about 13 per cent of the Norwegian Armed Forces. If the bill is enacted, the same military service conditions will apply to women as their male counterparts. United front: Men and women in the military in Norway will be expected to work and fight together . All medically fit women aged between 19 and 44 years will be obliged to complete at least 19 months of military service. During wartime women will also be subject to conscription. Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said in a statement, 'The most suitable and most motivated will join the service, regardless of gender.' Equal rights: A man and a woman in the Norwegian military change their clothes in the same communal area . Norway is one of the most proactive countries in the world for championing women in the work force. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Finance Minister Siv Jensen are both women.

"Around 40 people are still missing 48 hours after a runaway freight train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in a Quebec town - leading to fears they may have been vaporized in the blast with no remains to be found. Five people were killed after the train sparked a massive inferno in Lac-Megantic, which is about 250km from Montreal, in the early hours on Saturday morning. But it is believed the death toll will with experts suggesting that some remains may never be found because of the intensity and duration of the oil fires which locals claim erupted like an 'atom bomb'. Scroll down for video . Explosive: Balls of fire and thick smoke fill the sky above Lac Megantic after a train carrying crude oil derailed . Inferno: Five tankers are pictured burning; they were only put out on Sunday morning when firefighters could finally get close enough . Still burning: Flames and smoke pour from one of the wagons hours after the derailment on Saturday morning . Reduced to rubble: Firefighters continue to water smoldering rubble in Lac Megantic, Quebec, yesterday, after a train derailed and ignited tanker cars carrying crude oil . Genevieve Guilbault, a spokesperson for . the provincial coroner's office, said: 'It is not impossible when we . look at the intensity of the explosion. 'We can deduce that many of the bodies are severely burned. That complicates identification, but all necessary means at our disposal will be used to identify them.' Parts . of the town were evacuated in the early hours as . fireballs shot several meters in the air, flames spread to nearby homes . and thick acrid smoke filled the air. Around 30 buildings were destroyed . by the massive blaze, including the Musi-Cafe which was packed with revellers when the tankers erupted just ten yards away. 'On a beautiful evening like this with the bar, there were a lot of people there,' said Bernard Demers, who owns a restaurant near the blast site. 'It was a big explosion. It's a catastrophe. It's terrible for the population.' Demers, who fled his home, said the explosion was like an atomic bomb. It was very hot. Everybody was afraid.' Police said a higher death toll was inevitable, and authorities feared . the number might soar once they're able to reach the hardest-hit areas. Worries remained over the status of two oil-filled train cars. Pulling together: Two woman hug each other at the Polyvalente Montignac, the school sheltering the people who were forced to leave their houses after the explosion in Lac Megantic . Doused: Water is sprayed on to a burning rail car close to the railway track . Pollution: Environmental workers are monitoring the plumes of smoke, as well as contamination of a river . Quebec provincial police Sgt. Benoît Richard said only a small part of the devastated area had been . searched Sunday, more than a day since the accident, because . firefighters were making sure all fires were out. The train's 72 . oil-filled tanker cars somehow came loose early Saturday morning, sped . downhill at nearly seven miles (11 kilometers) into the town, derailed and . began exploding one by one. At least five exploded. The eruptions . sent residents of Lac-Megantic scrambling through the streets under the . intense heat of towering fireballs and a red glow that illuminated the . night sky. The district is a popular area packed with bars that often . bustles on summer weekend nights. Police said the first explosion tore . through the town shortly after 1am local time. Fire then spread to . several homes. Fears: Federique Mailloux hugs a friend as they wait outside an emergency center for news of friends following the train derailment . Distraught: A concerned resident waits near an aid station on Sunday. At least 40 are feared missing . Waiting: More than 160 people stayed in an emergency shelter that was set up by the Red Cross on Saturday night . Two tanker cars were burning on Sunday morning, and . authorities were still worried about them Sunday evening. Local Fire . Chief Denis Lauzon said firefighters were staying 500 feet (150 meters) from the tankers, which were being doused with water and foam to keep . them from overheating. The growing number of trains carrying crude oil in Canada and the United States had raised concerns of a major derailment. One death was confirmed Saturday. Police confirmed two people were found dead overnight and confirmed two more deaths Sunday afternoon. The charred remains were sent to Montreal for identification. Locals were convinced the death toll was far higher than five. Anne-Julie Huot, 27, said at least five friends and about 20 acquaintances remained unaccounted for. She said she was lucky to be working that night, otherwise she likely would have been at a popular bar that was leveled in the blast. Destruction: About 30 buildings in the center of the town, near the border with Maine, have burnt down . Wiped out: Piles of brick are all that remain of several buildings close to where the rail cars exploded . Rubble: The remains of a building flattened in the blast can be seen through the smoke . 'I have a friend who was smoking outside the bar when it happened, and she barely got away, so we can guess what happened to the people inside,' Huot said. 'It's like a nightmare. It's the worst thing I can imagine.' About a third of the community of 6,000 was forced out of their homes. The town is about 155 miles (250 kilometers) east of Montreal and just west of the Maine border. Transportation Safety Board investigator Donald Ross said the black box of the locomotive has been recovered, but officials haven't been able to access much of the site. Edward Burkhardt, the president and CEO of Rail World Inc., the parent company of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, said the train had been parked uphill of Lac-Megantic because the engineer had finished his run. The tanker cars somehow came loose. 'We've had a very good safety record for these 10 years,' Burkhardt said. 'Well, I think we've blown it here.' Wiped out: The downtown was flattened by the blast, which occurred at around 1am on Saturday after the runaway train carrying oil tankers crashed . Ruins: More than 30 properties were wiped out by the massive explosion in the town at 1am on Saturday and many people are still unaccounted for . Smouldering: Burnt out oil tank cars can be seen after the flames were finally put out on Sunday. Scores of people are still missing following the explosion . Joe McGonigle, Montreal, Maine & Atlantic's vice president of marketing, said the company believes the brakes were the cause. 'Somehow those brakes were released, and that's what is going to be investigated,' McGonigle said. 'We're pretty comfortable saying it is the brakes. The train was parked, it was tied up. The brakes were secured. Somehow it got loose.' McGonigle said there was no reason to suspect any criminal or terror-related activity. The train's oil was being transported from North Dakota's Bakken oil region to a refinery in New Brunswick. Because of limited pipeline capacity in the Bakken region and in Canada, oil producers are increasingly using railroads to transport much of the oil to refineries. The Canadian Railway Association recently estimated that as many as 140,000 carloads of crude oil will be shipped on Canada's tracks this year - up from just 500 carloads in 2009. The Quebec disaster is the fourth freight train accident in Canada under investigation involving crude oil shipments since the beginning of the year. Greenpeace Canada said Sunday that federal safety regulations haven't kept up with the enormous growth in the shipment of oil by rail. 'We think it is safe. We think we have a safe operation,' McGonigle said of carrying oil by rail. 'No matter what mode of transportation you are going to have incidents. That's been proven. This is an unfortunate incident.' Locator: The Montreal Maine & Atlantic train derailed about 250km from Montreal .","Five dead after train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded on Saturday .

"68-year-old Pierre-Paul Thomas was born blind and would have continued to live without vision if he hadn't fallen down his stairs two years ago. The fall sent him to the hospital for fractures around his eye sockets and when treating his injuries a surgeon for the first time realized his blindness was curable. Thomas was born with congenital nystagmus, a condition that made his eyes move side to side involuntary and had damaged optic nerves and cataracts on top of that. He had resigned himself to the fact that he would never be able to see. 'It's bad luck but that's how it is,' he told the Montreal Gazette. Late-life sight: Pierre-Paul Thomas of Montreal, Canada was born blind but surgery this year gave him vision for the first time . But then he fell down a set of stairs in his Montreal apartment two years ago, and it may have been the best thing to ever happen to him. The fall required surgery on Thomas's face, where the thin bones around his eye sockets fractured. While consulting with a plastic surgeon, she asked nonchalantly: 'Oh, while we're at it, do you want us to fix your eyes, too?' Thomas was shocked. he didn't think it was possible. Surgery: Thomas was born with congenital nystagmus, but it was the cataracts behind his pupils that rendered him legally blind . But he grew up in the 1940s before free health care and the advancement of eye surgery. According to Dr Dev Cheema, head of the ophthalmology clinic at Montreal General Hospital, it was the cataracts that caused Thomas to be legally blind - and not the disease. All they had to do was remove the cataracts. 'It feels great to do something like this. There's always a positive story to tell when it comes to ophthalmology,' he said. With the repair of his vision, Thomas said he feels like a child all over again. While visiting his sister Giselle in Ahuntsic, Canada, he witnessed flowers and trees blooming for the first time. Colorful world: Thomas saw flowers and trees in bloom this year for the first time . 'I find everything beautiful,' he said. 'Faces, skin - I find it all beautiful.' Thomas' new found vision has caused a few problems though, as he has to learn everything over again as if he were a child. When he went to the corner store with his sister, he handed the cashier a $10 bill when he really should have handed a $5 bill. Colors still confuse him, and the first time he stepped out onto his sixth-floor balcony, the drop down gave him vertigo. The idea of remembering things visually is hard as well, and he still resorts to touching and feeling the world around him to store those memories. But overall, Thomas is happy now that he has the ability to see. 'Before this everything way grey,' he said.

"A 20-year-old Russian footballer has been shot dead while driving home in a region that has become the focus of Islamic militant activity. Anzhi Makhachkala midfielder Gasan Magomedov was driving home last night when his car was pelted with machine-gun fire. He died while being taken to hospital. No arrests have been made and the motive is unclear, the club said in a statement. Gasan Magomedov, who played for Anzhi, was shot while driving in to his village in Dagestan last night . Anzhi sent 'deepest condolences' to the family of Magomedov, a player in the club's youth and reserve teams. The club added: 'One thing can be said with confidence -  Magomedov could not have provoked anything like this in any way.' There were no reports of any other casualties. Anzhi chief executive Sergey Korablev said: 'We grieve together with everyone who was dear to Gasan. 'I hope the police quickly find the killers and they suffer just punishment.' Makhachkala (pictured) is the main city in the Dagestan Republic in Russia - the region has become the focus of Islamist miltant activity with as many as 300 people from the area fighting reportedly fighting for ISIS . The footballer was shot in the region of Dagestan - where the club are based - and which has become the focus of Islamist militant activity in the North Caucasus. As many as 300 people from Dagestan are fighting for ISIS and about ten returnees have been killed in Russian anti-terror operations, it has been reported. The North Caucasus region is the part of Russia that slopes up towards the main ridge of the Caucasus mountains, often considered the border between Europe and Asia. It is home to dozens of nationalities and languages and gun battles between rebels and Russian security forces are not uncommon. Anzhi challenged for the Russian Premier League title in recent years financed by billionaire owner Suleyman Kerimov. With his funding, the club spent eye-watering sums on star players such as former Brazilian player Roberto Carlos, Chelsea winger Willian and striker Samuel Eto'o who was reportedly paid around £350,000 a week. Under his ownership, the club twice reached Europe and played the likes of Liverpool. But when Mr Kerimov withdrew his backing, Anzhi were relegated to the second tier with the worst record in the whole of European football. In the past the club encouraged big-money stars like Willian (left) and Samuel Eto'o (right) to sign for the club .","Anzhi Makhachkala player Gasan Magomedov shot dead driving home .

"A white monocled cobra that briefly became a national celebrity after it roamed a Southern California neighborhood for several days in September now has a new name. The San Diego Zoo tells the Los Angeles Times that the cobra will be called Adhira, which in Hindi means lightning. The Times says Adhira came in first in an online poll to find a name for the venomous cobra that was captured in Thousand Oaks and, after a period of quarantine, joined the zoo's Reptile House. New name: A white monocled cobra that briefly became a national celebrity after it roamed a California neighborhood for several days in September has been named Adhira, which in Hindi means lightning . Adhira received 4,612 votes, besting Sapheda (white), Krima (cream), Cini (Sugar), Moti (pearl) and Sundara (beautiful). Selected by the cobra's keepers, the names were meant to reflect the Southeast Asia region where cobras are native. The Times says the snake went on exhibit December 23. The cobra, a female, is 4 feet long and is around two years old. How it came to roam Thousand Oaks for those few days in September is still a mystery. According to BBC  Monocled cobras are timid and yet very dangerous snakes, with a strong toxin that can kill someone if they are not treated . What makes the monocled cobra especially dangerous is the way they repeatedly strike, like lighting, when excited and thereby inject more venom. Monocled cobras typically prey on the rodents, amphibians and reptiles of Southeast Asia. Mystery: Adhira mysteriously roamed a Southern California neighborhood for days in September before being captured and given her name .

"Warning: Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that Israel was losing support from the international community and said that 'there is a clock ticking with potentially disastrous consequences for the peace process' William Hague said yesterday that prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are almost dead as voters in Israel looked likely to return a hardline rightist government. The Foreign Secretary warned Israel that it was losing international support because it was expanding Jewish settlements in occupied territory. An independent Palestinian state alongside Israel has been the basis of the US-backed Middle East peace process for almost 20 years. But Mr Hague told MPs: ‘I hope that whatever Israeli government emerges will recognise that we are approaching the last chance to bring about such a solution. 'I condemn recent Israeli decisions to expand settlements. 'I speak regularly to Israeli leaders stressing our profound concern that Israel’s settlement policy is losing it the support of the international community and will make a two-state solution impossible.’ Asked whether the EU should tie trade with Israel to progress on peace talks, Mr Hague said Europe still had work to do, in conjunction with the US, to establish ‘incentives and disincentives’ regarding further negotiations. ‘There is a clock ticking with potentially disastrous consequences for the peace process,’ he added. Israeli Prime . Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to return to power for a third term as the head of a . coalition dominated by pro-settler parties that give short shrift to US-backed peace negotiations. The hardline government will be keener to thicken settlement on land where Palestinians want to establish statehood than seek peace. Asked about whether the EU will link progress on peace talks with trade sanctions, Hague said that Europe still had work to do, alongside the US, to establish 'incentives and disincentives' for further negotiations. Talks have been frozen since 2010 over Palestinian objections to continued settlement construction. But Netanyahu has demanded the Palestinians return to talks without preconditions. Polls: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pictured earlier this month, who is expected to continue as Prime minister for a third term after elections today . Talks: Benjamin Netanyahu pictured with Barack Obama. US-backed peace talks between Palestine and Israel have stalled since 2010 . Hague said 2013 was a crucial year for the peace process given the coinciding Israeli elections and the start of President Barack Obama's second term. 'If we do not make progress in the coming year, people will increasingly conclude that a two-state solution has become impossible,' said Hague. Hague said he would make peace talks and efforts towards a two-state solution - the basis of a US-backed peace process for almost 20 years - 'top of the agenda' during a planned visit to Washington next week. Netanyahu's Likud party, running alongside the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu group, looks set to win fewer seats than in the previous parliament, with opinion polls showing a surge in support for the far-right Jewish Home party. Six hours before polls closed, the Israeli election committee said turnout was 46.6 percent, up from 41.9 percent at the same time in 2009 and the highest level since 1999. Ahead of Tuesday's ballot, analysts . had speculated that high turnout would benefit centre-left parties that . have sometimes struggled to motivate their voter base. Crucial: Mr Hague said 2013 was a crucial year for the peace process given the coinciding Israeli elections and the start of President Barack Obama's second term . In a sign of concern over a possible centrist surge, Netanyahu urged his supporters to go to the polls. Political sources said Netanyahu, worried by his apparent fall in popularity, might approach centre-left parties after the ballot in an effort to broaden his coalition and present a more moderate face to Washington and other concerned allies. Full results are due by Wednesday morning, opening the way for coalition talks that could take several weeks. Tuesday's vote is the first in Israel since Arab uprisings swept the region two years ago, reshaping the Middle East. Netanyahu has said the turbulence - which has brought Islamist governments to power in several countries  - shows the importance of strengthening national security. If he wins on Tuesday, he will seek to put Iran back to the top of the global agenda. Netanyahu has said he will not let Tehran enrich enough uranium to make a single nuclear bomb - a threshold Israeli experts say could arrive as early as mid-2013. Iran denies it is planning to build the bomb, and says Israel, widely believed to have the only nuclear arsenal in the Middle East, is the biggest threat to the region.","Foreign Secretary issues peace warning as Israelis take to the polls .

"Portraits of famous Confederate generals Robert Lee and Thomas ‘Stonewall’ Jackson could soon be removed from the walls of the U.S. Army War College in Pennsylvania, where senior military leaders go to study. An inventory of the paintings and photographs at the college has prompted a debate about how appropriate it is for the college to honor men who fought against the United States and in favor of slavery. ‘I do know at least one person has questioned why we would honor individuals who were enemies of the United States Army,’ college spokeswoman Carol Kerr said. Portraits of famous Confederate generals Robert Lee, left, and Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson, right, could soon be removed from the walls of the U.S. Army War College in Pennsylvania, where senior military leaders go to study . She confirmed to the Washington Post that one faculty member had taken down the portraits of Lee and Jackson as part of the inventory process and placed them on the ground. This had given rise to rumors that the paintings were being removed, although they have in fact been rehung in a third-floor hallway. ‘[Lee] was certainly not good for the nation. This is the guy we faced on the battlefield whose entire purpose in life was to destroy the nation as it was then conceived. … This is all part of an informed discussion,’ she said. The outcome of that debate could spark change for portraits in other military installations and government buildings. The Army War College is a United States Army institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 500 acre (2 km²) campus of the historic Carlisle Barracks . A painting commemorating the last meeting between General Robert Lee and Stonewall Jackson, the two confederate leaders of the U.S. Civil War . Opened in 1901, the United States Army War College is a United States Army institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 500 acre (2 km²) campus of the historic Carlisle Barracks. It provides graduate level instruction to senior military officers and civilians to prepare them for senior leadership assignments and responsibilities. Each year, a number of Army colonels and lieutenant colonels are considered by a board for admission. Approximately 800 students attend at any one time, half in a two-year-long distance learning program, and the other half in an on-campus full-time resident program lasting ten months. Upon completion, the college grants its graduates a master's degree in Strategic Studies. General Jackson's death in 1863 was seen as a major blow for . the Confederacy, affecting not only its military prospects, but also the . morale of its army and of the general public. In death he became . an icon of Southern heroism and commitment, joining Lee in the pantheon . of the 'Lost Cause'. Illustration showing Stonewall Jackson with his troops at Bull Run, July 21, 1861 . Still . regarded as one of U.S. history's greatest tacticians, historians still . debate whether the outcome of the whole Civil War might have been . altered if he had survived. His Valley Campaign and his . envelopment of the Union Army right wing at Chancellorsville are studied . worldwide even today as examples of innovative and bold leadership. He excelled as well in other battles; . the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) where he received his . famous nickname 'Stonewall', Second Bull Run (Second Manassas), . Antietam, and Fredericksburg. Jackson was not universally successful . as a commander, however, as displayed by his weak and confused efforts . during the Seven Days Battles around Richmond in 1862.

"West Bromwich Albion have appointed Alan Irvine as their shock new boss and successor to Pepe Mel. After failing to agree a deal with former Spurs boss Tim Sherwood, the Baggies have moved for the former Preston and Sheffield Wednesday manager. Irvine leaves his post at Everton where he has been academy chief since 2011. VIDEO Scroll down to watch memorable moments from Sherwood's spell as Spurs boss . Big time: Alan Irvine has been named as West Brom's new manager, moving up from Everton's youth programme . Limited experience: Irvine was boss at Preston North End between 2007 and 2009 . Preston North End (Nov 2007-Dec 2009) Matches 111 Won 45 Drawn 26 Lost 40 . Sheffield Wednesday (Jan 2010- Feb 2011) Matches 59 Won 24 Drawn 13 Lost 22 . The 55-year-old Scot has signed a rolling 12-month contract at the Hawthorns. Irvine will bring Rob Kelly to work as his assistant manager alongside Keith Downing, while Dean Kiely will remain as goalkeeper coach. He was considered a strong contender for the role five years ago when it was handed to Roberto Di Matteo but now gets the nod from chairman Jeremy Peace after a second round of interviews. The appointment ends a month-long hunt for the replacement of Mel, who was sacked after the Baggies finished just one place and three points from the relegation places. Fan reactions have been less than favourable on social media, ranging from indifference to outrage,  with some fans already demanding refunds for season tickets. Other suggest the West Brom board has gone for the cheap option after failing to come to terms with Sherwood. The Baggies confirmed the decision on Twitter: 'Albion delighted to announce Alan Irvine will be appointed as their new Head Coach. He has agreed a 12-month rolling contract. 'Irvine will complete his move to The Hawthorns once he has officially signed off from his current role as Everton’s academy manager.' West Brom technical director Terry Burton said: 'I'm delighted we have been able to secure the services of Alan and Rob.' 'With the support of Keith and Dean, we firmly believe we have put in place the right coaching team to move the club forward.' Stepping up: Irvine will take over at West Brom once the paperwork is finalised for his Everton departure . While never holding a top-flight managerial role, Irvine has Premier League coaching experience after being David Moyes' assistant at Everton, during which time they managed to finish three out of five seasons in the top seven. 'From the outset, we decided to pursue candidates who are renowned for their coaching ability and Alan was very much at the forefront of our thoughts because of his achievements in the Premier League and the high regard he is held within the game,' Burton continued on West Brom's official website. 'In the end it came down to two outstanding candidates for the role. But, following a detailed recruitment process, we decided Alan and the team around him are best suited to tackle the challenges we face in the Barclays Premier League. 'He has a vast knowledge from grassroots up thanks to the roles he has performed during his decades in the game and knows what it takes through good and testing times.'","Alan Irvine was Everton's academy chief for the past three years .

"Gay men in relationships could be able to give blood for the first time since the Aids epidemic of the eighties under a shake-up of medical laws being proposed by ministers. The move to allow homosexual men will mark a significant change to current rules which prevent gay men from giving blood unless they have been celibate for a year. This rule was put in place because gay men are more statistically likely to have hepatitis B and HIV. Gay men in relationships could be able to give blood for the first time since the AIDS epidemic of the eighties under a shake-up of medical laws . However, campaigners suggest that this is illogical as many gay men who lead promiscuous lifestyles are still able to donate without being tested. Michael Fabricant, MP for Lichfield is now pushing for a reform of the law, especially in light of the growing acceptance of same-sex marriages. Ministers from the Department of Health plan to look into the possibility of changing the law to allow gay men more leniency when giving blood. Jane Ellison, minister for public health has also asked for a review into whether it is possible for gay men who have been tested for sexually transmitted diseases to donate blood. In 2011, a blanket ban on gay men donating blood was scrapped. Mr Fabricant said: 'I, of course recognise the absolute requirement for gay men giving blood to be safe and free from infection. 'But there is a growing shortage of blood donors and a fundamental unfairness needs to be addressed.'

"Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan believes Cristiano Ronaldo would be keen on sealing a move back to Old Trafford in the future. Ronaldo has been linked with a return to Manchester United during his time at Real Madrid, however a move has never come to fruition. The 29-year-old, who worked under Phelan during his six-year career at Manchester United, is happy with life in Madrid but Phelan believes he could be tempted back to the Premier League. Mike Phelan believes Cristiano Ronaldo could return to Manchester United before he hangs up his boots . Ronaldo left Manchester United to join Real Madrid for £80million in June 2009 . Portuguese superstar Ronaldo spent six years at Manchester United before sealing a move to Spain . Phelan, speaking to IBTimes UK, said: 'Ronaldo loved his time at Manchester United and, if Manchester United were interested in him again, then he would listen to that because part of his career has come through Man United. 'But listen, he is where he is because of him being Ronaldo and, at the moment, Madrid are successful so I can't see why he would think about coming back to Manchester United now.' Phelan has labelled Louis van Gaal's current crop of players 'formidable' and insists United do not need to bring in many reinforcements during the January transfer window. 'Do they need to sign anyone? I'm not there anymore but what I've seen is that a full Manchester United squad going into January will be formidable,' added Phelan. 'They have quality. 'There haven't been many times when they've purchased in January apart from rare examples – [Nemanja] Vidic, [Patrice] Evra, et cetera. 'It's been the case of seeing what is out there, what you can bring in and the amount you are willing to spend. It is an inflated market.' Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic are rare January transfer window success stories, according to Phelan .","Mike Phelan believes Cristiano Ronaldo would consider Man United return .

"Caretaker Newcastle manager John Carver conceded that he was deeply embarrassed by Newcastle fans booing their own team after their FA Cup defeat at Leicester – but insisted that he still wanted the job of head coach at the club after Alan Pardew’s move to Crystal Palace was confirmed. Carver made seven changes and saw his Newcastle side go down 1-0 in a lacklustre performance and led his players over to a packed out contingent of travelling supporters – only to be greeted by boos and chants of: ‘We’re s*** and we’re sick of it.’ Newcastle fans gestured for the players to go away and also directed abuse at owner Mike Ashley but Carver said the fans the right to criticise the team in the light of the defeat. VIDEO Scroll down to see Carver publicly throw his 'hat in the ring' for vacant Toon job . John Carver took charge of Newcastle as they were beaten 1-0 by Leicester in the FA Cup on Saturday . Newcastle supporters were unhappy with the performance of their team at the King Power Stadium . ‘It’s hugely embarrassing but they’re entitled to do that,’ said stand-in coach Carver. ‘The one thing I wasn’t going to allow was that the players didn’t go over to them. I was in front of everybody because we deserved it. I that’s how they feel, they pay their money their entitled to do that. 'And I’m not going to shirk my responsibilities and it’s important the players didn’t either. It was important we went across and show appreciation for our support.’ Carver still wants the job, despite the reaction from fans and said: ‘I’d be a fool if I didn’t want to be head coach of this football club. Obviously results dictates that happens but I don’t feel any different. I still want to be head coach.’ He admitted that he had had no conversations with owner Mike Ashley since taking over the reins from Pardew on Monday – and that his sole contact with the board has been with managing director Lee Charnley. But Carver says that even with the transfer window open, there is no need to speak to the owner as the new head coach – whether Carver or a new appointment – won’t have any say in transfer dealings. Carver said: ‘I’ve not spoken to Mike and my only communication has been with Lee Charnley on Monday night and a short conversation last night just about the game today. Carver (right) watches on alongside Leicester manager Nigel Pearson as his side were beaten . Leonardo Ulloa (left) scored the only goal of the game as Leicester beat Newcastle . ‘It will be confusing (to fans) but the only thing I will say is that the position is not now as a manager - it’s now a head coach’s job. So the head coach’s job is to get the team ready and prepared for the next game and that’s all I’ve been thinking about. ‘There’s no need for me to be in touch with owner because that’s the line the club is going down now – head coach. When I was with Toronto in the MLS, I was head coach so I never got involved in any transfer dealings. My sole responsibility was to look after the team and get them prepared and ready for the game.’ Carver admits that he will be judged on Premier League form but said that didn’t excuse the FA Cup exit. ‘It hurts me because I grew up watching the FA Cup and I’ve been to a final and lost and I’ve been to a semi-final with Sir Bobby and lost. And that wasn’t a nice feeling. 'I went and watched a final when Kenny Dalglish was manager against Arsenal and I was in with the fans and I was so disgruntled and I was in with them.

"Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher has questioned whether Liverpool did enough to keep Steven Gerrard at Anfield. Brendan Rodgers took time out ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup third round tie at Wimbledon, to watch Fleetwood Town entertain Swindon on Saturday. The Reds boss was spotted in the stands for the League One clash which saw the hosts held to a 2-2 draw - thanks to a late strike from the Robins' Louis Thompson. The match at Highbury Stadium, would have proved a welcome distraction for the 41-year-old who is having to come to terms with losing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard at the end of this season. Brendan Rodgers (left) watched Fleetwood Town host Swindon in League One on Saturday . The Liverpool boss (left) took time out ahead of their FA Cup third round tie at Wimbledon on Monday night . Earlier on Saturday, Gerrard confirmed he will ply his trade in the MLS after deciding to call time on his glittering 17-year Anfield career when his contract expires. The loss of the iconic midfielder, has been questioned by some who believe Liverpool could have done more to entice the 34-year-old to finish his playing days at his boyhood club. Rodgers though insists the Merseysiders did everthing they could to keep Gerrard. 'I think if you look at Steven's statement then that makes it clear. He certainly knew my feelings on me wanting him to be here,' Rodgers said. 'He has been a brilliant captain for me in my time here. I naturally wanted him to stay here. His role is slightly different now, he still sees himself wanting to go on and play for a couple of years. Naturally at this level it was going to taper over the next couple years. 'He wasn't ready to go into coaching or anything like that yet. He sees himself very much as a player. When he finishes as a player then we can look at coaching then as he is someone who would be brilliant to come back as part of the staff. But his concentration at the moment is on his football. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre) will leave the club at the end of the season to play in America . 'He said it himself he left here on great terms, both with myself and the owners. Anything else that is said beyond that would be wide of the mark. 'I've been in conversation for quite a while with Steven and had an idea of his feelings towards moving forward. He had always been really respectful in terms of once he made final decision that he wanted me to know first. 'In fairness to him we had a chat a few days before the announcement was made. I have been fully aware of things all the way along. He is someone who deserves fully that respect. 'What the guy has done in the game he deserves that time to make the decision. The decision is purely at this time for him and family. He is an iconic figure at this club and always will be. 'In time there will be an opportunity for him to come back here. At this moment in time in his life it was a chance to experience something different in his life.'

"These beautiful images may look like something from an alien world - but they were actually created using a special type of infrared film, which one photographer has started stockpiling due to its increased rarity. Sean Lynch, from New York, began experimenting with infrared photography when he was in South Asia, five years ago. Having originally shot infrared images through digital camera, Sean decided to try and take similar shots with infrared film rolls, which he said was a far more difficult task. Blue York, Blue York: Rowers paddle around the lake in Central Park, oblivious to the stunning shades of blue and red only visible in infrared . Exposure: The dark metal statue of Scottish poet Robert Burns is overpowered by the brilliant red of the leaves as seen in the infrared spectrum . Contrast: The verdant foliage of a Nepalese valley becomes a vibrant crimson while the . Monumental: The breathtaking landscape to Nepal's mountains as it has never been seen before . With most people now using digital cameras, the likes of Kodak discontinued their infrared film range around six years ago. Infrared film is extremely tricky to . work with, as there is very little latitude between highlights and . shadows before images become over exposed. Humans see what's known as 'visible light' - a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be seen by the eye. Beyond . this range there are other waves that are not visible to humans - . infrared film is engineered to be responsive not only to what humans can . see, but also what cannot be seen, capturing infrared rays from certain . materials, such as foliage. Intensity: The use of rare infrared Kodak film enables the photographer to produce images, such of this in Central Park, New York, which appear more like paintings . Colourful: Few visitors, of the human kind, will have seen these shades of colours during a walk through Central Park in New York . In bloom: Spring time in New York gives photographer Sean Lynch the chance of capturing the city in all its peculiar colour . Mr Lynch said: 'The thing I find most . fascinating about infrared photography is its ability to transform . something real to something surreal, without looking altered. 'I can't tell you how many people have asked me, 'Was it really that red?' 'Getting . the perfect shot with infrared film requires a bit of trial and error - . taking a series of shots at various exposure settings in the hope that . one of them gets it right, as, since it's film, you can't immediately . see if you were on the spot with your settings. New insight: Photographer Sean Lynch uses special infrared detecting rolls of film which picks up light not visible to the human eye here in Central Park, New York . Tickled pink: Grass in Central Park, New York, appears a vivid shade of red in these bizarre photographs using the infrared light range .

'I have . seen prices range up to $150 for a roll on the web. The issue is not so . much the price - although steep - but the availability, as infrared . films were gobbled up and stockpiled upon word of discontinuation.

"Sture Bergwall relished his reputation as 'Sweden's answer to Hannibal Lecter' and would happily regale anyone in ear shot with stories of murder, mutilation, rape and cannibalism. His tales of how he strangled, stabbed, defiled and mutilated more than 30 victims over three decades, captivated and horrified his homeland in equal measure, cementing his standing as the country's most prolific and deranged serial killer. But then, 23 years after he was locked up in a remote psychiatric hospital, he made his most staggering confession of all: that he had made it all up. And yesterday all charges against the . 63-year-old were dropped, in a legal first that has cast a dark shadow over . Sweden's judicial system. How was he convicted? Yesterday, 23 years after he was locked up in Sweden's most secure psychiatric hospital, all charges against the 63-year-old were dropped, in a legal first that has cast a shadow over Sweden's judicial process . Unexplained: Bergwall claimed he killed 17-year-old Norwegian Trine Jensen, left, in 1981, and strangled female prostitute Gry Storvik, right, in 1985 . 'I've killed': It was during a series of therapy sessions in the psychiatric hospital that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take an interest in him . Psychiatric officials will now . evaluate whether Bergwall can be released from the secure mental health . unit where he's been held since 1991. Of . the 30 murders Bergwall confessed to, he was convicted of eight. But he . later said he had lied to investigators because he craved attention and . was heavily medicated. His claimed victims were all of different ages, different sexes and from different backgrounds. His methods varied too. Some he . claimed he stabbed, others he strangled and one he beat to death with a . rock. Some he said he raped, others he chopped up and one he even . claimed to have eaten. But what was constant throughout all . his gruesome confessions was the detail with which he described the . murders: how he killed them, where he killed them, even their last . words. Faces of a serial killer? Sture Bergwall relished telling the world how he strangled, stabbed, defiled and mutilated more than 30 victims over three decades, thus cementing his reputation as the country's most prolific and deranged serial killer . 1976, Charles Zelmanovits, 15 . He claimed to have picked the teenager up in his car by the side of a road. After persuading him to engage in a sexual act he said he strangled him, abused the body and cut it up with a saw in nearby woods. He said he took a leg as a souvenir. 1980, Johan Asplund, 11 . He spotted Aspland by the side of a . road and asked to check if he had run over a cat. When the boy bent over . he smashed his head against the door and dragged him into his car.

The Norwegian girl was waiting at a bus shelter for a downpour to end when he pulled her down a slope and bashed her head against a rock. he later told how disappointed he was that she was not a boy. He said her last words were: Mummy, mummy.' he then dismembered and buried her, returning a year later to burn the remains. Police later found a bone fragment that matched that of a young girl that appeared to have been cut by a sharp instrument in the spot he identified. He managed to hoodwink judges, psychiatrists, journalists and the Swedish public. Until in 1998 he decided enough was enough. 'I had burned so many bridges [in my life], and I was plunged into this profound loneliness,' he told GQ magazine. 'I wanted to be this interesting person. I didn’t want to be this gray bad person. I wanted to be something else.' His near forensic knowledge of many . of the murders convinced detectives and prosecutors that he must . have committed the crimes. Nobody bothered to find out that he had studied the killings during regular trips to a local library on day trips from the asylum. Bergwall, a convicted sex offender and . bank robber who at the time had changed his name to Thomas Quick, had already been locked up in the Sater hospital for a botched bank robbery. It was there, during a series of therapy sessions which he says were so uninteresting that he felt a failure even at that, that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take notice of him. He told GQ how his heavily-pregnant mother had walked in on his father sexually abusing him at the age of ten, the therapist's interest seemed to spark up. Such was the shock at what his mother had seen, he claimed, that she miscarried the baby onto the bedroom floor. He told how the next day his father took him to bury the dead foetus in nearby woodland. As the therapist listened intently to his tale, for the first time he felt important. And within weeks he was telling staff he was behind one of Sweden's most famous unsolved murders - that of 11-year-old Johan Asplund whose torso alone was found in 1980. As the months drew on he confessed to a host of other murders including that of a 15-year-old boy in 1976; a 17-year-old girl in 1981; Dutch husband and wife in 1984; a 23-year-old female prostitute in 1985; and an Israeli student and a 9-year-old Norwegian girl in 1988. Of those eight murders he was convicted, despite claims of a lack of real evidence. Retrials were ordered in each case, but prosecutors said that without the confessions they didn't have enough evidence to go back to court. On Wednesday they dropped the final case, which involved the death of 15-year-old boy who disappeared in northern Sweden in 1976. Bergwall was convicted in 1994 of murdering the boy, even though there was no technical evidence linking him to the crime and the cause of death could not be established. The lack of evidence to support the . confessions led to some doubts over Bergwall's guilt, but a 2006 review . by Sweden's chancellor of justice found no problems with the . convictions. Two years later Bergwall recanted in a . Swedish TV documentary, saying he had fabricated the story of Thomas . Quick the serial killer. He now claims it was a cry for attention, . fueled by heavy medication. In hospital: Bergwall, a convicted sex offender and bank robber who at the time had changed his name to Thomas Quick, had already been locked up in the Sater hospital for a botched bank robbery . 'If I hadn't accepted therapy and . benzodiazepines, no Thomas Quick would have been created,' Bergwall told . AP. 'In that lies the guilt that I must carry to my grave with respect . to the relatives of the victims, their suffering during the Thomas Quick . years.' 'That a person has been convicted of . eight murders and later been declared innocent, that is unique in . Swedish legal history,' attorney general Anders Perklev told reporters . in Stockholm. 'It has to be considered as a big failure for the justice . system.' By telephone from the Sater psychiatric unit, Bergwall called the decision to drop the final charges 'overwhelming and emotional,' and called for an investigation into how the justice system has handled his case. 'The next step is that I, with my lawyers, take actions for my release,' he told The Associated Press. Sven-Erik Alhem, a Swedish legal expert who was not involved with the case, called it Sweden's 'greatest miscarriage of justice in modern times.' He said it was particularly painful for the families of the victims, who are unlikely to ever find out the truth of what happened to their loved ones. With Bergwall's confessions withdrawn, there are no longer any strong links between the eight deaths, and it's not even clear that all were homicides. In two cases no bodies were found.

"New deal for Martinez worth £3million-a-year . Spaniard now contracted to Goodison Park until 2019 . Everton chairman Bill Kenwright hails Martinez as 'best young manager in Europe' Everton have rewarded Roberto Martinez's outstanding first season in charge at Goodison Park with a new five-year contract. Martinez, who guided Everton back into Europe with fifth place finish, had three years remaining on his current terms but Chairman Bill Kenwright has given him improved terms, that could be worth in the region of £3million per year, until the end of the 2018/19 campaign. Kenwright believes there is a 'fundamental importance' of the role Martinez performs for Everton and he has moved swiftly to retain the Spaniard, who was considered by Tottenham Hotspur to replace Tim Sherwood and clubs on the continent. All smiles: Roberto Martinez, who is currently out in Rio watching the World Cup in Brazil, has signed a new five-year deal at Everton . He was not faced with an easy task in succeeding David Moyes 12 months ago when arriving from Wigan Athletic but Martinez has made a deep impression, transforming Everton's playing style, and Kenwright is adamant he is the man to keep driving the club forward. Kenwright said: 'In many commentators’ eyes, Roberto Martinez is the best young manager in Europe. We agree. He took on an unfamiliar challenge for most Managers, to take something really good and make it even better. He has succeeded. 'In his debut season he broke our Premier League record points haul, got us back into Europe and developed some of the most exciting young footballers in the game. He conducts himself off the pitch in the same way. He undertakes his business with great style, confidence, positivity and class. He is an Everton man. High five: Martinez, helped by the goals of on-loan striker Romelu Lukaku, guided Everton to fifth place in the Premier League in his first season in charge . Looking ahead: Martinez, pictured exclusively by Sportsmail in his office at the club's training ground, is relishing the prospect of leading Everton into Europe in the new season . 'There is no magical ingredient to what we do at Everton. We’re a football club and we recognise the fundamental importance of our manager. And, when we find our man, we empower him. We support and provide him with everything at our disposal. 'We commit to our managers, and we’re immensely pleased that Roberto has committed to us. We want the best because only the best will do.' Martinez, who is currently in Brazil working as an analyst for ESPN but using his time to scout for new players, is relishing the opportunity to lead Everton into Europe next season and insists he did not think twice about reaffirming his commitment to the club . Double act: Everton chairman Bill Kenwright believes Martinez is the 'best young manager in Europe' He said: 'I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to make a further commitment to Everton. I loved my first season at the club. I could not be more proud of the way Everton performed throughout the entire season and the memories we were able to make together. 'I am really excited about next season. I knew from the moment I arrived at Everton that this was a special place and I’d like to thank everyone associated with the club, the board, all the staff, the players and our brilliant supporters for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to build on the traditions and success of this great club.'

"The romance of the FA Cup was in pitifully short supply at Craven Cottage as Fulham and Wolves played out an instantly forgettable goalless draw. Chances were at a premium as neither side could take a firm grip on proceedings and the result is a Molineux replay that only adds to an already-hectic Championship schedule. It was Fulham’s lowest crowd of the season and those who bothered to turn up on a dreary afternoon by the Thames will feel no inclination to tune in for the highlights.

Booked: Evans 69 . Attendance: 11,879 . Referee: Lee Probert . Man of the match: Bakary Sako . Ratings by Adam Shergold at Craven Cottage . The game’s best chance fell to Leon Clarke of Wolves, who somehow missed an open goal from eight yards out after the impressive Bakary Sako had seen a low angled drive touched onto the post by goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli. Sako, the strong and powerful Mali international, was the game’s stand-out performer and Wolves will miss him as he flies off to the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea. The tournament also serves as a shop window and manager Kenny Jackett is braced for interest from Premier League suitors. He said: ‘We’d love to keep him, but every transfer window there’s constant speculation on him. He’s been very consistent for me in League One and the Championship. ‘Wherever you are, your best players can be vulnerable. If we can keep him, that would be absolutely fantastic. ‘We’ve always been honest with the player about Premier League possibilities. His ambition is the Premier League but so is ours.’ Kit Symons clearly feels Fulham can go on a bit of a Cup run and fielded a strong side, while Kenny Jackett made four changes from the team that beat Brentford before the New Year. Cauley Woodrow reacts with disappointment after missing a chance during the match . Fulham striker Hugo Rodallega attempts an acrobatic effort during Saturday's third round FA Cup tie . It was a soporific start, with the sole moment of cheer in the opening 20 minutes coming when Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme booted a clearance clean over the stand and into the river. Slowly, both sides started to carve out chances and the quiet crowd responded. Karl Henry picked out Clarke with a right-wing cross but the striker’s header, though firm, was directed straight at Marcus Bettinelli. After Cauley Woodrow had dispatched a shot half-way up the Putney End, Wolves broke swiftly before Bakary Sako’s daisy-cutter dribbled tamely through to Bettinelli. The best chance of the half fell to Sako just on the half-hour. The Malian strode imperiously down the left and struck a low angled shot that cracked the base of the post with the goalkeeper getting a touch. It rebounded perfectly for Clarke but he somehow missed the unguarded net from eight yards. Christensen's afternoon ended after half-an-hour when he was replaced by Sean Kavanagh . Fulham's Kostas Stafylidis (near) protects the ball under pressure from James Henry (far) Five minutes shy of half-time, the ever-willing Jack Grimmer crossed from the right and Hugo Rodallega, largely ineffective, attempted a spectacular overhead kick that narrowly cleared the bar. Sako had been Wolves’ greatest threat and, in stoppage time, he curled a set-piece over the target at the other end. The visitors started the second-half with purpose and Clarke tore to the byline to cut the ball back to Lee Evans. His powerful shot was blocked by Bettinelli at the near post. The home faithful raised their voices to try and rouse Fulham and it had the desired effect, with first Cauley Woodrow and then Seko Fofana sending shots over. Fulham striker Hugo Rodallega (right) vies for possession with Wolves' Dominic Iorfa . Iorfa climbs above Fulham striker Ross McCormack as the tie ends goalless . Midway through the second-half Henry’s header from a Matt Doherty cross was tipped over the bar by Bettinelli and the midfielder was played through shortly afterwards after Shaun Hutchinson slipped up. The defender was rescued by Bettinelli, who pushed Henry’s effort round the post. Sako looked the most likely to score by far and, after cutting inside from the left, he curled a shot that flashed past the far post with Bettinelli rooted to the turf. In the last five minutes, Fulham broke following a Wolves corner and Scott Parker flicked the ball forward to Fofana sprinting clear. He hurried his shot and Ikeme palmed it away on the edge of his box. Fulham manager Kit Symons offers encouragement to his players from the touchline . Fulham boss Kit Symons said: ‘It was a probably a typical Cup tie, lot of blood and guts, lot of endeavour but it lacked that little bit of quality, that little bit of craft and guile. ‘You can see by the team we put out today, we took it very seriously. It’s the FA Cup, it deserves to be treated with the utmost respect. ‘We knew it would be tough and hard-fought as Wolves are a big, powerful, well-organised side. I hoped we’d match that and have the quality to break them down, but some of our decision making in the final third wasn’t there today.’","Fulham and Wolves draw at Craven Cottage in the FA Cup third round .

"Barman Robbie Dale served a first-half double for non-league Blyth Spartans but their FA Cup of cheer ran dry as Birmingham’s Wesley Thomas called time on their remarkable run. The 30-year-old Spartans skipper will be opening up The Blacksmiths Arms in Newcastle on Sunday morning as he returns to the day job he chose over a career as a professional footballer. On this evidence, Dale would not be out of place in the Championship. There were certainly no half measures during a pulsating opening period in which Blyth – of the seventh-tier Northern Premier League and playing their seventh match in this season’s competition – took a deserved two-goal lead thanks to the devastating Dale in front of a sold out Croft Park.

The hosts emerged for the second half under instruction to ‘keep it tight for 15 minutes’. By the hour mark, however, they were trailing, such was the madness of this enthralling tie played on a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses at. It was, despite the narrow nature of the defeat for the underdogs, a magical afternoon. Blyth boss Tom Wade was certainly proud of his side’s mammoth effort. ‘If you’d said before the game we’d get beaten 3-2 you might have taken that,’ he said. ‘I think we deserved to win it but they had 10 minutes of total dominance which killed it. ‘So I’m very proud of what they have done. This team has got a lot to give and the future is very bright.’ Dale, too, refused to bemoan the turnaround. ‘You get to 2-0 at half-time and you think the shock is on,’ he said. ‘The instruction at half-time was “keep it tight for 10 or 15 minutes” but that didn’ t work out did it?! ‘It was uphill after that really but in the last 20 minutes we came again. I had a half chance which went just wide and Danny (Parker) had a header which went into the side-netting. We might have nicked a replay.’ Blyth took the lead on 35 minutes when Jarret Rivers, scorer of the stoppage-time winner at Hartlepool in the second round, drove into the area. He outwitted himself and two defenders with a clumsy step-over attempt and took advantage to draw back for Dale who steamed in to smash home. It was soon two. Dale, receiving a short free-kick from Stephen Turnbull, drifted, as he does, languidly into the area. But beneath his lethargy resides a lethal streak and the winger duly dropped a shoulder before locating the bottom corner. And Dale, reflecting on his brace, said: ‘For the first one Jarrett did brilliantly to battle his way out of the corner and pull it back and the defender got his studs caught in the turf and I just ran on to it.

It wasn’t to be and they had a brilliant 10 minutes, but we can be proud of what we have done as a team. It’s been a brilliant run and we’ve been close to going out a few times. ‘It’s back to reality now, Frickley away on Tuesday night. First I’m opening up the pub in the morning but I’ll be out with my mates for a few beers tonight.’ The turning point in the contest perhaps arrived in first-half injurytime when Blyth’s livewire forward Daniel Maguire escaped in the area and took aim for the top corner only for Colin Doyle to extend an arm and flip over. Without that stop City’s confidence would have been irreversibly sapped. As it was, they emerged for the second half determined to make amends for the embarrassment of the first. What followed was three goals in six minutes. Thomas scores as Birmingham bounce back from being two goals down against Blyth on Saturday .

And Thomas capped the quick-fire turnaround when Mark Duffy swept over from the left and he rose to head in from six yards. And Birmingham boss Gary Rowett, who made 10 changes for the game, said: ‘We learnt a bit more than we wanted to learn about some of the players at half-time. ‘I felt it was very important we scored early in the second half and we knew that would unsettle them a little bit. I’m very pleased with the response, we showed a lot of character. ‘I just thought it was a brilliant afternoon. I might not stay up and watch it on Match of the Day later - I don’t think I can put myself through it again! But that’s what the cup is about. I played in the Leicester side that lost to Wycombe, and a guy, Roy Essandoh, signed from Telextext, scored the winner. And that was a League Two side knocking a Premier League side out. ‘So we have seen how it works and we wouldn’t have complained if we had got beat, but I am very, very pleased we are in the next round.’ As for Dale, they’ll still be toasting a drink to the Blyth hero for years to come.

"A first-half penalty from one of Rochdale’s more senior players, Peter Vincenti, piled the pressure on Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce as the home team notched a third-round upset for the second successive season. But this victory at Spotland is likely to be remembered as a coming-of-age match for a young side awash with home-grown talent. Six of the players involved came through the League One club’s youth system, most of them teenagers and playing in the youth edition of this tournament not long ago. ‘It’s almost a lower league Class of 92,’ said Rochdale assistant manager Chris Beech in a reference to Manchester United’s fabled group that included Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers. ‘This is a great day for the football club,’ he added. Peter Vincenti converts from the penalty spot to put Rochdale 1-0 up against Nottingham Forest early in the first-half at Spotland . The Rochdale players celebrate with Vincenti after his penalty set the ball rolling for League One Rochdale in their FA Cup scalp .

Subs not used: Darlow, Lascelles, Lang, McLaughlin, O Burke, Osborn . Booked: Burke, Assombalonga . Referee: Gary Sutton . Attendance: 6,791 . Rochdale chairman Chris Dunphy hailed the win as ‘fantastic’. He added: ‘It’s what we’re trying to do here, bring players through … because of illness and injuries we were down to the bare bones, but they all delivered.’ With Forest’s form falling off a cliff over the past few months, they have dropped to 11th place in the Championship and are now nine points off the play-offs. But Pearce said: ‘I’m not a panicker. We’ve been beaten today in a game where we had countless opportunities. We need to learn from that. And we need to be judged on where we are at the end of the season.’ While the result is not perhaps the most massive shock imaginable, given Forest’s terrible form of late, Beech stressed there remains ‘a massive gap in finance and quality’ between the clubs, and thus rightly claimed that glory is due. Manager Keith Hill was too busy celebrating with his young squad to speak. A year ago Rochdale’s third-round victims were the former champions of England, Leeds. This time is was the former champions of Europe. The glory days of both seem long ago and Forest are enduring a woeful spell, with no win their last seven games and just two in 18 matches. ‘We gifted the opposition a soft goal,’ added Pearce when he spoke of the decisive penalty, awarded when referee Gary Sutton ruled that Forest’s Michail Antonio had knocked over Joe Rafferty. ‘We dominated possession and had chances but our players did not take any clear cut opportunity. But credit to Rochdale.’ This was Rochdale’s fifth FA Cup match of 2014-15, having needed replays to beat Northampton and Aldershot. They are also in the thick of a promotion race in the third tier, lying just two points off the play-off places. Dorus de Vries looks disappointed after Rochdale's right midfielder Vincenti slots his penalty past the Forest keeper in the first half . At the other end of the field, Rochdale keeper Josh Lillis required medical attention after sustaining an injury in the first half of the match . This run will increase their confidence and the coffers. They will pocket £67,000 in prize cash and could bank a further six figures with a major opponent and/or a TV game in the fourth round. They really should have earned more from the gate but Forest sold only 2,500 of their 3,500 ticket allocation. Forest had the first decent chance in the ninth minute when Chris Burke was bought down to earn a free-kick. David Vaughan curled the ball goalwards and it needed a smart punch from Josh Lillis to clear. But Rochdale were ahead three minutes later when 28-year-old Vincenti converted the match-winning penalty. And had he shown more composure, Rochdale might have been two ahead, but he missed a sitter laid on by 19-year-old Callum Camps, one of Rochdale’s home-grown players. Forest ended the first half with two errors. One sloppy back-pass was pounced on by Jamie Allen who ran past Dorus de Vries and was only stopped by a last-gasp block from Danny Fox.

Sometimes you do win with kids. The Rochdale programme pre-match shows the trophy everyone wants to lift... but Keith Hill's side will have to win plenty more to get there .

"Liverpool supporters will not appreciate the comparison but one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s great skills at Manchester United was to ensure that, on the whole, his stellar players left the club on his terms rather than their own. Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Roy Keane and even Cristiano Ronaldo, to an extent, all walked out of Old Trafford when Ferguson, and his club, were ready. Whether Liverpool can adequately absorb the inevitable sense of loss that will accompany Steven Gerrard’s departure remains to be seen. Certainly his is a decision that, at this juncture, looks set to benefit him more than it does Liverpool. Steven Gerrard looks relaxed during training after announcing he will leave Liverpool in the summer . To suggest that Liverpool, their chief executive Ian Ayre and manager Brendan Rodgers, have mismanaged the Gerrard situation over the last 12 months would be a little unfair. Managing contractual issues with a club’s biggest player is not always easy. United themselves discovered this with Wayne Rooney. Nevertheless, it is clear that Gerrard was upset he had been allowed to reach the onset of winter without receiving a firm offer to remain at Anfield. He pretty much said so in newspaper interviews in November. Roy Keane and Jaap Stam are two players who left Manchester United on Sir Alex Ferguson's terms . Whether this has contributed to his decision to leave only he will know, but what is more clear is that the decision speaks volumes for the Anfield captain’s feelings about his club’s chances of significant success on the field over the next 18 months. Had Gerrard genuinely felt Rodgers was likely to lead Liverpool back in to contention in the Barclays Premier League next season then it is hard to imagine he would have left. His close friend Jamie Carragher has already made that mistake, after all. That he has decided to pursue options abroad while his legs can still carry him forward says a lot for his views on the immediate prospects of Rodgers’ squad. Gerrard leaves Melwood on Friday and will be driving away for good at the end of the season . Plenty of words have been spoken this season about Gerrard’s longevity. Questions have been asked about his capabilities at the highest level and it was interesting to see Liverpool produce one of their better Premier League performances — beating Swansea 4-1 — last Monday without him in the team. Do not be fooled, though. Gerrard remains fundamental to Liverpool, on and off the field. In his absence, there is no natural successor as captain and — with respect to the likes of Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling — there is no marquee player left behind. Liverpool beat Swansea 4-1 on Monday and captain Gerrard was left on the bench . Gerrard celebrates scoring against Leicester - one of his seven goals for the Reds this season . It is the first time in a long time we have said this. Even during the lean years there was Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen or Fernando Torres. Without Gerrard, the current Liverpool squad lacks world-class stardust and, given what they threatened to achieve in the Premier League only eight months ago, that is quite remarkable. Brendan Rodgers will have to plan for the future at Liverpool without Gerrard . This is not the end for Rodgers’ Anfield project. Liverpool have a talented manager and some very good footballers. However, the fact this great club has reached this inevitable crossroads a year earlier than anybody ever really expected is something they may yet have cause to regret.","Steven Gerrard is leaving Liverpool on his terms - not the club's .
Gerrard leaves behind a squad without a leader or marquee player .

Sagna, 31, spent seven years with Arsenal before moving to the Etihad Stadium on a free transfer. For him the Wembley victory was the ideal way to bow out, even though his move to the Barclays Premier League champions has not brought regular action. He said: 'It was my first trophy with Arsenal in my last game, so it will always be special. An emotional Sagna celebrates winning the FA Cup with Arsenal against Hull in his final game for the Gunners . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger embraces an emotional Sagna after winning their first trophy in nine years . 'It was very emotional, because I spent great years with Arsenal, because we went to Wembley previously and lost in the Carling Cup final, and because it was my last game.' Sagna's opportunities at City have been limited because of the form of established right-back Pablo Zabaleta. He could feature however as 2011 winners City begin their latest FA Cup quest at home to Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the third round on Sunday. City thrashed the Owls 7-0 in the Capital One Cup in September but Sagna says nothing should be taken for granted, remembering how Hull were inspired in last year's final. The Tigers scored twice in the opening eight minutes at Wembley and Arsenal needed to fight back and force extra time before winning 3-2. Sagna said: 'I remember conceding two goals quickly - after 10 minutes we were 2-0 down. In my head I was very focused and determined to come back. 'If I can remember that kind of game it means it can happen again. To stop it happening we have to dictate the game and stay focused, and keep looking forward. It might be a difficult game to play.'

"Steven Gerrard has described it as the 'toughest decision of my life' after announcing he will leave Liverpool. As the tributes for Steven Gerrard poured in from his team-mates on Friday morning, it was left to Mario Balotelli to offer some words of warning to the Liverpool hierarchy. 'Stevie can do anything, he's an amazing player,' said the Italian striker. 'It's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future.' Gerrard's level of performance may have dipped quite dramatically at times this season but Balotelli has a point. How does Brendan Rodgers go about replacing arguably the club's most iconic figure when he departs Anfield - most likely for Major League Soccer - this summer? Steven Gerrard and his potential successor as Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, at Melwood on Friday . Steven Gerrard has announced that he will leave Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the season . Gerrard opens the scoring for Liverpool from the penalty spot during their 2-2 draw with Leicester at Anfield . Former England midfielder Gerrard stretches to knock the ball away from Leicester's Matty James (left) Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals . FA Cup: 39 appearances, 13 goals . League Cup: 28 appearances, 9 goals . Champions League: 87 appearances, 30 goals . UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42 appearances, 11 goals . Other: 5 appearances, 1 goal . TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals . Well, he might not have to. Jordan Henderson, like many of Rodgers' squad, has struggled for form since last season's blistering campaign saw Liverpool come agonisingly close to their first Premier League title. But the 24-year-old hasn't become a bad player overnight. In fact, with the energy levels of a young Gerrard, an eye for a pass and a tenacity to his game, Henderson's potential could well prevent Liverpool splashing the cash on a new central midfielder. Rodgers clearly believes the former Sunderland midfielder has the leadership qualities required to inspire his team-mates in similar fashion, having named him as the club's vice captain back in September. Henderson is known to have a good rapport with the rest of the squad - particularly Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling - and is not afraid to offer guidance and advice to young players despite his own tender years. Midfielder Jordan Henderson (right) looks set to replace Gerrard (left) as Liverpool captain next season . Henderson hugs his captain after Gerrard's second successful penalty against Leicester on New Year's Day . He gets on well with his manager and Rodgers will often call him over during games to explain instructions, trusting him to pass them on to the rest of the team. Having already captained the Merseysiders in the absence of Gerrard this season, it will be a natural progression for Henderson to take over the role full-time at the start of next season. He is accustomed to the responsibility, having worn the armband for England's Under 21 side before making the step up to the Three Lions' senior squad. After being excused from a friendly against Israel in 2011, Henderson decided to stay behind and help organise a night of team bonding instead of travelling home. He understands the importance of togetherness, just like Gerrard. And just like the Reds' departing skipper, Henderson is also a model professional. He turns up early for training, works hard and ensures he is in the best possible condition come matchday. Henderson, who is Liverpool's vice captain, is expected to step up and take over from Gerrard next season . Henderson has an effort at goal against Leicester but his shot is saved by goalkeeper Ben Hamer . But it's not just off the pitch that Henderson shares similarities with his former England team-mate. After a difficult start to life at Anfield, the Sunderland-born midfielder has blossomed into one of Rodgers' star performers and an influential figure for both club and country. Although shunted out wide too much this season, Henderson showed last term that he has all the qualities needed to be an effective box-to-box player, just like Gerrard was at his best. He may not be as prolific in front of goal as his more senior colleague but, with more assists (five), tackles made (47) and a greater crossing and corner accuracy than Gerrard this season, Henderson is capable of cementing his place in Liverpool's midfield for the next decade. Gerrard (right) consoles Henderson after Liverpool's 1-1 Champions League draw with Basle in December . Henderson runs towards Gerrard to celebrate scoring against Ludogorets in late November . Gerrard himself saw Henderson's raw talent when Liverpool spent £20million to bring him to Anfield three-and-a-half years ago. Speaking to the Daily Express in June 2011, Gerrard said: 'It's a really positive signing. Let's hope he is the next Steven Gerrard. 'Liverpool needs a new Steven Gerrard and it will need a new Jamie Carragher. That's what good football clubs do - they replace their best players.' After 695 games, 180 goals and 10 trophies so far, Gerrard will leave behind a pair of huge boots to fill when he calls time on Liverpool career at the end of this season. Luckily for Rodgers and the Anfield faithful, the man to step into them may already be in their ranks.","Steven Gerrard will leave Liverpool at the end of this season .

"Sheffield Wednesday boss Stuart Gray insists there is no fear in the camp as the Owls prepare to return to the scene of their worst defeat of the season in the FA Cup third round. Manchester City were Wednesday's opponents at the same stage of the Capital One Cup in September and romped to a 7-0 win despite failing to break the deadlock in a tight first half. 'It was an even game for 45 minutes and I thought we performed very well,' Gray told the club's website, www.swfc.co.uk. Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray (left) does not fear an FA Cup clash with Manchester City . The Owls have won four of their last six games to give them confidence ahead of the trip to Manchester . 'But Manchester City showed their qualities as one of the best teams in the world after the break and we all know what happened.' Gray's men were sixth in the Sky Bet Championship at the time having lost only one of their first eight games, but saw their season come off the rails in the wake of the humbling loss. Wednesday have recovered from a run of 10 league games without victory to win four of their last six to kick-start their season ahead of another trip to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Gray added: 'We know what they are capable of; we know what they can do to teams. What we have to do is go there with no fear and remember how we did well in the first half. 'There is no fear of the unknown this time; we know the stadium, the pitch, and we want to give our supporters something to cheer. Edin Dzeko (centre) scores during City's 7-0 thrashing of Wednesday in the Capital One Cup . Gray can only watch as Manuel Pellegrini's side run riot in the second half at the Etihad Stadium . 'I am excited about this game and so are the players. If you can't get excited about a game like this, you can't get excited about anything.' Wednesday can take confidence from the way Championship rivals Watford and Wigan performed against City at the Etihad last season. Unlike Wigan, Watford were unable to hang on to their lead and exited the competition. Few Hornets fans will be expecting a cup run this term after the draw handed the club a trip to Premier League leaders Chelsea, but defender Tommie Hoban is confident of causing an upset. 'Look at the game against Man City, I think we were the first team to score at the Etihad in a good while,' he told Hornets Player. Watford's Tommie Hoban (right) believes the Hornets can upset Chelsea in the FA Cup . 'Some of the players we've got going forward, particularly the likes of (Fernando) Forestieri, (Matej) Vydra and (Odion) Ighalo, with their tricks and skills, on their day they can score against anyone or create something out of nothing. 'We've got to go there and believe, and with that belief anything can happen.' In three other ties which pit Football League clubs against sides from the top flight on Sunday, last year's semi-finalists Sheffield United go to QPR, Ipswich visit Southampton and Blackpool travel to Aston Villa.","Sheffield Wednesday face Manchester City in the FA Cup third round .

"Manuel Pellegrini revealed he has set his sights on FA Cup glory this season in order to complete his full set of domestic honours in just his second season in charge at Manchester City. Victory in the competition would allow the Chilean to join an exclusive club with his great rival Jose Mourinho as the only two managers from outside these shores to have won the famous old trophy, the Premier League and the Capital One Cup. But Pellegrini played down talk of following in the footsteps of the Chelsea boss, insisting instead he has a burning desire to take home the missing FA Cup winners medal to make up for their disappointing exit at the hands of Wigan last season in a re-run of the previous year's final. Manuel Pellegrini issues instructions to his players during the recent Premier League win against Sunderland . Pellegrini led Manchester City to the Premier League title in his first season at the club . 'It is an important motivation,' he said. 'Last year I was not concerned because it is very difficult to win all the competitions. 'If you remember we had three games postponed and if we had continued in the FA Cup last year then we would have had four of five games postponed and it would have been very difficult to play all the games in the last month if you want to win the title. 'This year we do not have the Capital One so I hope we continue as far as we can in the FA Cup and continue to fight for the title in the Premier League.' His side face the same Sheffield Wednesday side they thrashed 7-0 earlier on in the season, but Pellegrini warned his side of complacency when they meet at the Etihad on Sunday. Pellegrini poses with the Premier League trophy after the match on the final day of last season . Pellegrini also won the Capital One Cup during his first season in England . He added: 'The 7-0 result was a lie because the first half was a very close game. I cannot remember exactly but I think we did not score the first goal until the fifth or sixth minute of the second half. 'We will be making a great mistake if we were to think it would be easy because of the last game we played against them.' Injuries to Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero mean Stevan Jovetic is likely to get an extended run in the team over the next few weeks. The 25-year-old has been struggling with injuries since his £22m move from Italy in the summer of 2013, but the Montenegro striker insists he is winning his fitness battle and now the Manchester City fans will finally get to see the best of him. Steven Jovetic scored Manchester City's second goal during their 3-2 victory against Sunderland . Jovetic is congratulated by team-mates Yaya Toure and David Silva . 'We have some injuries and I have got a chance to play from the start,' he said. 'It has been hard for me in the last 18 months because unfortunately I have had some problems with injuries and my fitness. 'I don't think I have a big problem. I would say that I have just been unlucky. 'I feel better now, much better than last year, and I think I will get better. The City fans have not seen the best of me. Nowhere near. 'I just want to stay healthy now. It I can do that then I can promise them that I am a much better player than they have seen so far.'","Manchester City play Sheffield Wednesday in the third round on Sunday .

"To Italians, Francesco Totti is a mixture of Steven Gerrard, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham. In Rome, he is considered a God – something even the Vatican has to accept. At the age of 38, the greatest Italian player of his generation – better than Andrea Pirlo or Alessandro del Piero – will make a rare appearance in England on Tuesday night in his quest to try and win the one major trophy, the Champions League, missing from his collection. And judging by his performances this season, the oldest swinger in town isn't ready to go home yet and tuck in with a nice cup of cocoa. Francesco Totti has been a pivotal player for Roma since his professional debut for his boyhood club in 1992. Here is a compilation of images from each of his 23 seasons at the Serie A club. Top left is from his first season in 1992-93 to the bottom right image from the current 2014/15 campaign. The forward will be a major threat to Manchester City's hopes of progressing past the group stages of Europe's elite competition . Totti, like Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs, has managed to play in a top European league while in his late-30s . Italian football was littered with a number of world class players during Francesco Totti's first season in the club's senior side. Roma's rivals AC Milan went onto win the title in 1993 with 50 points from 34 games. Teams were awarded just two points for a win in 1993, as compared to the three points you now collect after a victory. Lazio's Giuseppe Signori finished as the league's top scorer with 26 goals, while the likes of Gabriel Batistuta, Roberto Mancini and Marco van Basten were also plying their trade in Italy. To call Totti the archetypal No 10 with balance, vision, quick feet and set-piece goals doesn't begin to his incredible career justice. Like Gerrard, he is a revered local hero, always staying faithful for his hometown club Roma when Europe's biggest clubs would have taken him in an instant. Like Giggs, he refuses to play by the normal rules of ageing and goes on and on, scoring until now a club record 235 goals in 564 games. And like Beckham, his style and private life are great sources of fascination. His wife isn't called Victoria but Ilary Blasi is a former showgirl and model, and the pair are Italy's premier celebrity couple. Their wedding was screened live on Italian television in 2005. Current Roma manager Rudi Garcia quickly realised to succeed in Italy's partisan capital, you have to pay homage to Totti. 'For me he is one of the very best players in the history of the sport, and someone with great qualities as a man,' he pointed out shrewdly. Totti's trophy cabinet includes Serie A, Italian Cup, Italian SuperCup and World Cup winners' medals despite competing against Juventus and the two Milan clubs. The Champions League is the one he really wants now before retirement and he has a particular axe to grind with Manchester ahead of Tuesday night's game against City. In 2007, he was part of a Roma side humiliated 7-1 at Old Trafford when his ego was dealt a huge blow by being completely overshadowed by Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. To tap into the Totti psyche, you have to understand his relationship with the club. Roma manager Rudi Garcia, pictured with Ashley Cole ahead of his side's clash with City, has labelled his captain one of the best players in the history of sport . Totti is expected to start against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night - along with former Premier League star Cole . One of the 38-year-old's biggest career lowlights came in April 2007 when Roma were thrashed 7-1 by Manchester United at Old Trafford . As a teen, he used to ride a scooter from his home in 'authentic Rome', the San Giovanni district, to watch The Giallorossi play in the Olympic Stadium. He made his Roma debut way back in 1993 when Serie A boasted great names like Ruud Gullit, Roberto Mancini and Paul Gascoigne. Tottenham 3-1 Manchester City (March 24 1993) Starting line-up: Tony Coton, David Brightwell, Keith Curle, Terry Phelan, David White, Fitzroy Simpson, Niall Quinn, Mike Sheron, Stephen McMahon, Rick Holden, Andy Hill. Subs: Peter Reid, Garry Flitcroft, Martyn Margetson. It was his creativity that set him apart from other players. He played for Italy in the final of Euro 2000 and the following season inspired Roma to only the third Serie A title win in their history, under the leadership of Fabio Capello. Roma had some great players in that team - Cafu, Gabriel Batistuta and Walter Samuel among them – but Totti was the captain and undisputed No1. It was fitting he scored the opening goal in the 3-1 victory against Parma that clinched the league. Totti was just 24 at the time and the world was at his feet. Juventus owner Gianni Agnelli would have sold Fiat to get him to Turin but the player wanted to stay at home. AC Milan and Real Madrid have also come knocking at different times. He might not have won as many trophies but he received an adulation among his own fans never replicated before or since. When he scored a key last-minute penalty for Italy against Australia on the way The Azurri becoming world champions, Totti said although the experience was memorable, it couldn't compare to winning The Scudetto with the team he supported as a boy. From that moment, he was as untouchable to Romans as one of their Emperors. Marco van Basten (left) and Paul Gascoigne (right) played in Serie A for AC Milan and Lazio respectively during Totti's first season at Roma . Totti was part of the Italian side which won the 2006 World Cup against France at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, Germany . He and Ilary were granted the ultimate honour, a speaking part in The Simpsons, later in 2006. The following year, he appeared in the movie L'allenatore nel Pallone 2 as a defence attorney. In recent years he has been in regular demand on television, both chatshows, reality shows and dramas. A collection of figurines entitled 'Francesco Totti, the captain' were made in his honour. Now Il Bimbo D'Oro (The Golden Boy) is very much the senior man, playing under his 14th manager in 20 seasons in Rome. Though Roma boast names like Miralem Pjanic, Ashley Cole and the rejuvenated Gervinho, Totti's name will be the one that will grab most attention at The Etihad on Tuesday night. He is the Rome's ultimate Gladiator, and always good for a news story; whether it's by celebrating a goal by shoving a ball up his jumper and simlulating childbirth, or claiming that only Lionel Messi is better among modern players. As he approaches 40, even Totti must realise he won't have many more chances to fulfil his Champions League ambition. City must be wary - this guy writes his own scripts.

"Court action: Mr Price and his wife Catherine told Reading Magistrates' Court the noise of excited children screaming was disturbing them . As a former chief pilot of Concorde, Roger Price knows a thing or two about deafening people. His supersonic airliner happily hit an ear-splitting 110 decibels on take-off and would often bring conversation to a standstill as it thundered overhead. But the 67-year-old’s tolerance levels are clearly set a little lower when he’s in his own back yard. With rich irony, he is trying to close down a local playground because the noise from excited children is too loud. Their shrieks have been measured from Mr Price’s garden at up to 77 decibels. The . former pilot claims the play area – built around 20 yards from his . detached house in Ascot, Berkshire – is ‘severely disrupting’ his life. He and his wife, Dr Catherine . Bentley-Thomas, 51, are fighting a private prosecution to try to force . Winkfield Parish Council to shut it. The . local council spent £150,000 adding play equipment to the village . recreation field in May last year, but Mr Price said the park was . attracting children from outside the area who are too loud. Yesterday . at Reading Magistrates’ Court he said: ‘The type of noise we have . experienced is that of small children screaming and shrieking with . excitement.’ He told the court the ‘unpredictable . high frequency shrieks’ and the sound of parents calling their children . were distracting. Popular: The playground at the centre of the row, which has had £150,000 spent on it by Winkfield Parish Council, with Mr Price's house visible behind the slide . ‘My normal life and my ability to enjoy my home and . surroundings have been severely disrupted,’ he said. The action is in the name of his wife, . a GP. She told the court that the park attracts hundreds of children . and parents in the summer but the sound of just one grandfather pushing a . child on the swings had been enough to disturb her. She provided the court with readings . taken by a sound consultant that showed the average noise in her garden . over a 45-minute period on one afternoon was 57.1 decibels, with peaks . of up to 77 decibels from children’s shouts. Mr Price, who worked as a British . Airways pilot for 32 years, and his wife have been backed by Sky News . sports presenter Chris Skudder, whose house also borders the field. Support: The action against the park has been backed by Sky News sports presenter Chris Skudder, pictured . Mr Skudder, who lives with his wife and two children, said the playground had created a ‘living hell’. The residents were accused by . barrister for the council Katie Helmore of not wanting ‘children from . less affluent areas infiltrating their community’. She pointed to complaints from the . residents which included that the park was ‘full of really fat women . from Bracknell’ who could not control their children. Other . residents, whose homes back on to the park, told the court they . supported the playground, which includes water fountains, a sandpit, . zipwire and swings. Father . of two Alan Weyman said it was a good place to socialise with other . parents and it was ‘nice to hear children enjoying themselves’. The . council is being prosecuted for noise nuisance under the Environmental . Protection Act 1990. Mr Price and Dr Bentley-Thomas want all the . playground equipment removed from the recreation field. Mr Price worked . for BA until 1999, rising to be chief pilot of Concorde. He now trains . pilots to fly Boeing 747s. He denied he is a hypocrite for complaining about the noise of children after flying the supersonic jet. Outside . court he said: ‘The airplanes around Heathrow are very quiet  now. We . don’t hear them where we are. 'If people want to find something to talk . about they can, but there’s  no correlation. By that argument anyone who . has ever climbed on an airplane is guilty of making noise.’ The case continues.","Screams of children measured in Roger Price's back garden 20 yards away measured at up to 77 decibels .

"Click here to read Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher pen on Gerrard's Liverpool exit. Steven Gerrard admitted leaving Liverpool was the toughest decision of his life as he confirmed that his days at Anfield will end this summer. And the 34-year-old insisted he is going purely because he wants to sample a different way of life before he hangs his boots up — not through any fall-out with the club’s manager or owners. Gerrard looks certain to end up playing in America after insisting he won’t go anywhere that could result in him having to line up against his boyhood club.

Gerrard arriving earlier at Liverpool's Melwood training ground on Friday morning with Ian Dunbavin . Gerrard arriving at training on the morning he announced his decision he was to leave Liverpool . Gerrard had been offered a new deal by his club but has decided to leave Anfield after 26 years . Gerrard scored 13 times for Liverpool last season, coming agonisingly close to his first Premier League title . 695 games, 180 goals . 1 Champions League . 2 FA Cups . 3 League Cups . 1 UEFA Cup . 2 UEFA Super Cups . 1 Charity Shield . Gerrard said: ‘This has been the toughest decision of my life and one which both me and my family have agonised over for a good deal of time. ‘I am making the announcement now so that the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future.’ Gerrard, who was only offered a contract extension in November, could even return to play for Liverpool, with the club keeping the door open for a loan deal if he does move to the USA. In a statement on the club’s website, Gerrard added: ‘Liverpool Football Club has been such a huge part of all our lives for so long and saying goodbye is going to be difficult, but I feel it’s something that’s in the best interests of all involved, including my family and the club. ‘I’m going to carry on playing and although I can’t confirm at this stage where that will be, I can say it will be somewhere that means I won’t be playing for a competing club and will not therefore be lining up against Liverpool — that is something I could never contemplate. ‘My decision is completely based on my wish to experience something different and I want to make sure that I have no regrets when my playing career is over. David Moyes would welcome Gerrard at Real Sociedad after announcing he was leaving Liverpool . ‘I can’t thank Brendan (Rodgers), the owners and everyone at the club enough for how they’ve handled this and I am leaving on great terms. Also, I would like to thank my team-mates and all the staff for their help and continued support. ‘It is a very special place to be part of. It is my sincere hope and wish that one day I can return to serve Liverpool again, in whatever capacity best helps the club.’ Gerrard’s new challenge will almost certainly mean a move to the MLS. New York Red Bulls, for whom former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier is head of global football, and LA Galaxy are the clubs leading the race. He would then have the potential to return on a short-term loan, similar to Thierry Henry’s move to Arsenal when he was playing for New York Red Bulls, or the two spells that LA Galaxy striker Landon Donovan had with Everton in 2010 and 2012. However, Real Sociedad manager David Moyes said: ‘If he ever wanted to come to play in Spain, he knows he can phone me.’ Liverpool manager Rodgers will face the media this morning ahead of Monday’s trip to AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup. Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003 . The Liverpool skipper has often been the man to bail his team out on the big occasion with an important goal . Gerrard was instrumental in his sides run to the Champions League final to win their fifth European title . Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals . FA Cup: 39, 13 . League Cup: 28, 9 . Champions League: 87, 30 . UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42, 11 . Other: 5, 1 . TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals . On the back of Jamie Carragher’s retirement and the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, this is a third huge departure he must tackle in the space of 18 months. Rodgers had recommended that Gerrard be given a contract extension. Liverpool’s manager admitted he had an ‘impossible task’ to try to explain how Gerrard had helped him since he arrived at Anfield in 2012 and added: ‘As a leader and as a man, he is probably incomparable to anyone I have ever worked with. ‘He takes professionalism to a new level and the dedication he has to his work is an example to everyone in the game. He has always put the club and team ahead of himself and I think that will ultimately be his legacy.’ Fenway Sports Group — Liverpool’s owners — outlined their hope that Gerrard would return to Anfield. Tom Werner and John W Henry said in a joint statement: ‘Steven will always have a part to play for this club, as and when the time comes that he wishes to return.’ Gerrard was man of the match in the 2006 FA Cup final, scoring twice to help Liverpool lift the trophy .

With the aura that he has got, he could be a different person but he is very humble.’ Mario Balotelli: ‘Wow. I think of him as being at the same level as (Andrea) Pirlo. Vision, technique, but he is powerful as well. Stevie can do anything. An amazing player.’ Rafa Benitez: ‘He changed games against Olympiacos (in 2004), AC Milan (the 2005 Champions League final) and West Ham (2006 FA Cup final). I think he was one of the best, if not the best, for sure.’ Peter Crouch: ‘I’ve been fortunate to have played with some top players in my time but Stevie G is easily the best I have played with.’ Ronald Koeman: ‘If he likes to continue, he can come (here). I am serious. For Steven Gerrard, you have always a position for him. He is a fantastic football player, really at the top level.’ John Aldridge: ‘I always knew he was going to be a star. I’ve been watching Liverpool for 50 years and he is the best player I have ever seen.’ Graeme Souness: ‘He would get in any team that Liverpool have had that I know of.

"Astronomers have found a planet just 13 light years from Earth that is ripe for life, with just the right mild temperatures to allow liquid water on its surface. And the ‘super-Earth’ is all the more interesting because it originated from another galaxy, meaning it could play host to extragalactic life. The star it orbits - Kapteyn’s star - was flung into the Milky Way when its previous galaxy was torn apart by our own. Scroll down for video . Two planets have been found in orbit around a star just 13 light years from Earth, known as Kapteyn's star, and one of them named Kapteyn b (the innermost planet in this illustration) may play host to life. The red-hue colour tries to reproduce the colour of the ambient light a human might perceive on planets around such red stars . The planet is one of two discovered around Kapteyn’s star. Scientists believe it was born in a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed and destroyed by our own Milky Way galaxy. At only 13 light years away from Earth Kapteyn's star is the 25th nearest star to the sun. Based on the data collected, the planet Kapetyn b is at least five times as massive as the Earth and it orbits the star every 48 days. This means the planet is warm enough for liquid water to be present on its surface. The second planet, Kapteyn c is a more massive super-Earth and quite different: its year lasts for 121 days and astronomers think it's too cold to support liquid water. At the moment, only a few properties of the planets are known: approximate masses, orbital periods, and distances to the star. By measuring the atmosphere of these planets with next-generation instruments, scientists will try to find out whether they can bear water. The surviving core of the dwarf remains in the form of Omega Centauri, a globular cluster of very ancient stars some 16,000 light years from the sun. Details of the research are published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters. 'Finding a stable planetary system with a potentially habitable planet . orbiting one of the very nearest stars in the sky is mind blowing,' says US . co-author Dr Pamela Arriagada, from the Carnegie Institution. 'This . is one more piece of evidence that nearly all stars have planets, and . that potentially habitable planets in our galaxy are as common as grains . of sand on a beach.' Astronomers . have calculated that Kapteyn’s star’s planets could be 11.5 billion . years old - more than twice the age of Earth and only about 2 billion . years younger than the universe itself. One . of the worlds, Kapteyn b, is five times heavier than Earth, making it a . super-Earth, and orbits in the star’s habitable zone where conditions . are mild enough to permit watery oceans. Whether . life has evolved there remains open to speculation - but given the . planet’s age it could be far more advanced than on Earth. 'It does make you wonder what kind of life could have evolved on those planets over such a long time,' says Dr Guillem Anglada-Escude, one of the scientists from Queen Mary University of London involved in the discovery. The astronomers used new data from the HARPS spectrometer at the ESO's La Silla observatory in Chile to measure tiny periodic changes in the star to find and measure the planets. The study also used data from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii (pictured) and the Magellan/Las Campanas Observatory in Chile . Kapteyn's star and its planets likely come from a dwarf galaxy now merged with the Milky Way (illustrated here after the event). The star is now in the vicinity of the sun but is currently moving in the opposite direction to the rotation of the other stars in our galaxy . The second planet, Kapteyn c, is more massive than its sibling and thought to be too cold to support liquid water. Kapteyn’s star, a red dwarf cooler than the Sun, was named after Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn who discovered it at the end of the 19th century. It can be seen in the southern constellation of Pictor with an amateur telescope and sits in the galactic halo, an extended cloud of stars orbiting the Milky Way. Astronomers found the planets by using specialised instruments on telescopes in Chile and Hawaii to measure tiny 'wobbles' of the star caused by their gravity. Shifts in the 'colour' of star light due to the wobbles allowed them to work out properties of the planets such as their masses and orbital periods. 'We were surprised to find planets orbiting Kapteyn’s star,' says Dr Anglada-Escude. 'Previous data showed some moderate excess of variability, so we were looking for very short period planets when the new signals showed up loud and clear.'","A planet that may harbour life has been found in our sun's neighbourhood .
Kapteyn b is one of two planets around a star 13 light years from Earth .
It is the first potentially habitable planet from another galaxy ever found .
Its star originally came from a dwarf galaxy that was destroyed by ours .
And the planets might be just 2 billion years younger than the universe .

"There should be no problem with Frank Lampard's move to New York City being delayed until July, according to MLS commissioner Don Garber. The England international was supposed to move to America to begin training with his new side early in 2015 but his form with parent club Manchester City saw the Premier League champions extend his stay under Manuel Pellegrini. Many New York fans were outraged that they had been 'lied to' over Lampard's situation in a ploy to sell season tickets, but Garber insists that most Designated Players coming from Europe don't join up with their new team until the summer. The delay in Frank Lampard's move to New York City until July is normal, according to the MLS commissioner . Don Garber (left, at a conference alongside David Beckham) says most Designated Players arrive in July . 'They [Man City] were faced with a difficult decision,' Garber told Grant Wahl of Sports Interactive. 'I'm going to be supportive of all our ownership groups, making them aware of my point of view. But we need to work hard now to move forward and recognize that Frank will be joining this team in July along with other Designated Players, who throughout the history of the Designated Player program have almost always joined in July. 'If there was an error in judgment on this, it was not just announcing that he would come in July and figuring out how to manage the start of the season, no different than what happened with Robbie Keane or Thierry Henry or David Beckham.

Steven Gerrard has announced his intention to join a side in America in the summer after leaving Liverpool . Garber also spoke about the possibility of Steven Gerrard arriving stateside, admitting their had been discussions with the Liverpool captain's representatives but that nothing had been signed. When questioned about supporters in the Big Apple voicing their discontent over Lampard, he referenced an 'unusual set of circumstances' which will have swayed Man City's decision. He added: 'Frank has become one of the most important players in Man City's season, and he's scored critical goals to have them tied for first place in the Premier League.'","Manchester City extend Frank Lampard's stay until end of the season .

"Pope Francis has been warned in a new book against relaxing the Catholic Church's ban on remarried divorcees receiving Communion. The book is written by a powerful group of cardinals and is due to be published on October 1, just days before the Vatican has a meeting of bishops, where the issue of the Sacrament for divorcees who remarry, will be discussed. The five cardinals maintain that divorce is not permitted and that anyone who then marries again in a civil ceremony is an adulterer. A group of powerful cardinals have warned Pope Francis - seen here meeting with a delegation of 40 world Jewish leaders in Rome, today - against relaxing the Catholic Church's position on allowing remarried divorcees receiving the Holy Communion . In the book, Remaining in the Truth of Christ - Marriage and Communion in the Catholic Church - the group write: 'The authors of this volume are united in their firm belief that the New Testament shows us that Christ prohibited, without any ambiguity, divorce and any successive marriage on the basis of God's original plan.' The cardinals, which include Gerhard Ludwig Muller, argue that on this basis they should not be allowed to receive the Sacrament. The book goes against remarks made by Walter Kasper, a reformist cardinal close to Pope Francis, who in February, said the Church might relax its rules on remarried divorcees taking Communion. Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller is one of five cardinals behind the book . Cardinal Kasper said the Vatican needed to help Catholics who divorce and remarry to continue to be involved in church life. He said the issue was a 'complex and thorny problem'. The cardinals, however, have taken a hardline on the issue and want to follow the words of the Bible. Robert Dodaro, one of four theologians who collaborated on the book, told The Telegraph: 'This is one of those situations where we don't believe we have the authority to make any change because that would go against Christ's word in the Gospels.He added: 'The cardinals are not looking to be punitive towards divorcees. But they say that if the Church starts tolerating second marriages, what happened to the principle of the indissolubility of the first marriage?'Catholics who obtain an annulment or civil divorce are not barred from taking Communion, but those who remarry in a civil ceremony are. In April the Pope reportedly told a woman who had remarried a man who had previously been divorced, that she could take the Holy Communion.","A book discussing communion to be published days before a meeting of bishops .

Brentford had the better of the first half and were unlucky not to take the lead, but after the break it was Brighton who took control and eventually got the win they deserved thanks to Dunk’s header and Chris O’Grady’s cool finish. As early as the third minute Brentford had a great chance to take the lead after Moses Odubajo shot was well saved by David Stockdale and the rebound fell into the path of Andre Gray - but the striker somehow managed guide his shot along the goal line and not over it. Stockdale was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers and he was again called into action when Spanish midfielder Jota’s tricky run set up Jon Toral but his shot was well saved by the Brighton keeper. Brentford handed a rare start to Jack Bonham in goal and the 21-year-old did a good job in intercepting Joao Carlos Teixeira’s cross as Craig Mackail-Smith was lurking dangerously at the far post. Bonham had to be alert to keep out Solly March early in the second half after Mackail-Smith made a good break as Brighton looked to up the tempo after the break.

Another mix up at the back for Brentford allowed substitute Chris O’Grady to go through on goal, but he also managed to hit the post when it seemed easier to score. But finally the goal they deserved did come when Dunk rose highest to head home March’s free kick from inside a crowded penalty area.

The team is credited with inspiring a new wave of skateboarders with their tricks, some of which had been taken from surfing, the Star Advertiser explained. The group featured in the 2001 film 'Dogtown and Z-Boys', a documentary made by Stacy Peralta, who was in the original skateboarding team. Peralta won a best director nod at the Sundance Film Festival with the movie. The documentary was later made into a 2005 Hollywood move, 'Lords of Dogtown,' which starred the late Heath Ledger. Kubo's character was played by skateboarder Don Nguyen. Jim Muir, the founder of Dogtown Skateboard, told TMZ Sports: 'He was a friend and a brother and he passed away doing what he loved.' As well as Muir, the other original members included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Paul Constantineau, Peggy Oki, Stacy Peralta, Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV and Allen Sarlo.

One of Z-Boys co-founder, Skip Engblom, said when he saw Kubo skate, he knew he wanted him on the team. 'The guys just saw him around and said, ""This guy's unreal,"" and he was in,' Engblom said. ""He had a really clean and efficient style, and I think he was really underrated. 'Tony and Jay and Stacy got all the attention, because Shogo wasn't one of those ""look at me"" guys. He just quietly went about his business of destroying every pool that he found.'

"By . Leon Watson . Updated: . 09:44 EST, 14 November 2011 . Accused: Peter Roebuck arriving at court for his trial in 2001. The former Somerset captain plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match . Cricketer turned commentator Peter Roebuck had been accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old male Zimbabwean student before he died, it was reported today. The alleged victim laid a charge of indecent assault against the former Somerset captain on Saturday after the pair apparently met through Facebook, a South African newspaper claimed. The New Age quoted a police officer, who reportedly confirmed a case had been opened at the Claremont police station in Cape Town. The article stated: 'When The New Age queried an indecent assault charge laid at Claremont police station and spoke to Capt Malusi Mgxwathi on Sunday, Mgxwathi said: ""This is the same man who committed suicide at the hotel"".' The paper said that Mr Roebuck had met his Zimbabwean accuser last week after arriving in Cape Town to cover South Africa's test match against Australia. The newspaper said it was believed the former cricketer arranged to meet the young man to discuss the possibility of helping him attend university. It said: 'The pair later met at the hotel, where they were allegedly meant to discuss a possible university sponsorship for the male Zimbabwean. 'The New Age source said Roebuck allegedly tried to seduce the Facebook friend and have sex with him against his will. 'The man reportedly went to Claremont police station and laid charges of indecent assault against Roebuck.' The New Age report also offered further alleged details of the moments before Mr Roebuck's death. The newspaper claimed the broadcaster was due to be arrested but asked to change his clothes before leaving the hotel. The report stated that he then moved towards the window and leaped out. The Southern Sun Hotel in Cape Town, where Peter Roebuck fell to his death . Further investigation: Police are set to question 16 young men who lived with Mr Roebuck at his South African home . It continued: 'When police confronted Roebuck in his hotel at about 9pm on Saturday, with the intention of effecting an arrest, the British man allegedly asked to be allowed to change his clothes. 'In the process he managed to move close to a window and jumped out.' South African police declined to comment on the report. A spokesman said: 'An investigation is underway and the matter will be subject to an inquest. 'At this stage we cannot give any further information on the matter.' Mr Roebuck, 55, plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match. According to sources, he became agitated when a detective and a uniformed officer from the South African police sexual crimes unit arrived to interview him at the Southern Sun hotel in the suburb of Claremont. Mr Roebuck phoned fellow cricket journalist Jim Maxwell to help find him a lawyer and contact a group of underprivileged boys he had been supporting near his South African home. Old enemies: Ian Botham, left, and Roebuck, right, in 1987. When Roebuck backed a Somerset club committee decision not to renew the contracts of  West Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for Roebuck . ‘Can you come down to my room quickly, I’ve got a problem,’ he said in the desperate phone call just after 9pm on Saturday. Minutes later, with the uniformed officer still in the room, Mr Roebuck plunged 70ft to his death, hitting an awning as he fell. Paramedics were called to the hotel, a short walk from the Newlands cricket ground, and Mr Roebuck was pronounced dead at the scene. Police seized items from his hotel room, including a laptop computer. Mr Roebuck had spent part of his last day alive with members of the Australian cricket team, who had lost their first Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday. He regularly toured with the team as a distinguished writer and broadcaster for the Australian media, following a career in county cricket during which he played 335 first-class matches. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1988. A distraught Mr Maxwell, one of the last people to see Mr Roebuck alive on Saturday night, gave a statement to police yesterday. After retiring from cricket in 1991, Mr Roebuck turned his hand to writing and broadcasting, and become one of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket . The Australian Broadcasting . Corporation cricket commentator, well known to British audiences for his . work on Test Match Special, said he had seen nothing to suggest Mr . Roebuck was contemplating suicide. ‘Things happen. As far as I could see . at the Test, there wasn’t a problem,’ said Mr Maxwell. ‘He was a person . who had a great sense of humanity and caring. That was Peter. ‘There were a lot of other things . about him, but we’ve lost a wonderful friend and supporter.’ He . described Mr Roebuck as ‘one of the outstanding writers on the game of . cricket’. Police spokesman Captain Frederick . Van Wyk confirmed Mr Roebuck’s death was being treated as suicide, but . would not give details about the sexual assault allegations. In his long playing record, one . incident stood out – a spectacular clash with Sir Ian Botham when he . replaced him as Somerset captain in 1985. When Cambridge-educated Mr Roebuck . backed a club committee decision not to renew the contracts of  West . Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was . furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for . Mr Roebuck. Roebuck forged a successful career as a writer after his playing days . Part of the team: Roebuck (third left on the back row) played for Somerset during the 1980s with Sir Ian Botham and Sir Viv Richards . After retiring from cricket in 1991, . Mr Roebuck turned his hand to writing and broadcasting, and become one . of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket. He divided his time between homes in . Bondi Beach, Australia, and the South African town of Pietermaritzburg, . where he was helping a group of underprivileged boys through school and . university. Mr Roebuck, who was unmarried, was at . the centre of controversy in 2001 when he received a suspended jail . sentence for common assault after beating three teenage cricketers . across their bare buttocks with a cane. The South African boys had been invited to stay at his former home in Taunton, Somerset, for coaching in the late 1990s. Henk Lindeque, one of Mr Roebuck’s victims, said yesterday he was ‘shocked’ to learn of the cricket writer’s sudden death. ‘I haven’t had any contact with him . since the trial,’ Mr Lindeque said. ‘The problem was not so much that he . caned us but wanted to examine the marks. That’s when I decided to get . out of his house.’ Mr Roebuck, one of six children born . in Oxford to teacher parents, was apparently estranged from his family . for much of his adult life. On his website, he included . contributions from his ‘extended family’ of underprivileged boys from . South Africa and Zimbabwe – some of them cricketers – whom he assisted . with school fees, coaching or getting jobs.","Victim laid a charge of indecent assault against the former Somerset captain .

"Found dead: Drew Quinlan (pictured) had taken a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, his inquest heard . A privately educated schoolboy was found dead on the sofa of his family’s £4million townhouse after taking a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, an inquest heard yesterday. Drew Quinlan, 13, was found face down on the settee of his grandfather’s  four-storey home in Richmond, South-West London. He had consumed a toxic mixture of anti-depressants belonging to his family and alcohol, and had also been exposed to heroin in recent months, a post- mortem examination report stated. Despite troubled periods, Drew was the ‘happiest he had ever been’, according to relatives. He had returned from a school trip to France before spending the weekend at the park and having a riverside lunch with family. The evening before he died he had played video games with his uncle Michael Quinlan junior, who was also teaching him to play guitar. His mother was away and Drew had not wanted to sleep on the top floor alone so he had slept on the sofa near the family’s two labradors, his grandfather Michael Quinlan senior said. But the following morning Mr Quinlan senior woke to find the teenager’s lifeless body lying in an ‘unnatural’ position. He told the court: ‘I thought he was foxing, to the extent that I walked over and slapped him on the bottom and told him to get up. I grabbed his shoulder and pulled him up a little. Then I saw his face was blue.’ The post-mortem report showed ten times the therapeutic level of prescription drug citalopram and one and a half times the legal limit for driving of alcohol. He had also been an occasional user or exposed to heroin in the months before he died. Drew, who attended a boarding school for troubled children in Sussex but had previously attended a private school in South-West London, was raised by his grandparents believing they were his parents. Evidence: Drew Quinlan's uncle Michael Quinlan Junior, left, and Grandfather Michael Quinlan Senior, right, leave the West London Coroner's, Fulham . Plush: Drew Quinlan, 13, was found face down on a sofa in this house in an exclusive part of Richmond . Claims: Drew's mother, Samantha Quinlan, centre, heard evidence that  her son died after taking a lethal cocktail of drugs . A year earlier he had discovered that . the girl he thought was his sister and who was battling a heroin . addiction was in fact his mother. In the months before Drew’s death his grandmother Vanessa had died after a long fight with motor neurone disease. At . the time Drew died his biological mother was in rehab and he was . spending time with his biological father and his aunt. His uncle Michael . Quinlan junior, 30, who lived with them in the child’s grandparents’ house, was also a heroin user. His uncle and aunt both used the . anti-depressant citalopram and his mother a similar prescription drug. All . three said they had no knowledge of how Drew came by the drug. But his . aunt, Kathryn  Tippett Wilson, alleged that Michael Quinlan junior gave . Drew the drug in front of her just days before his death. Coroner . Jeremy Chipperfield recorded a verdict of accidental death at West . London Coroners’ Court. He said: ‘Drew was an intelligent and spirited . boy of 13. He was regarded as a loveable and good boy and was loved by . his family. Despite the recent traumatic events in the family he was . coping well in March 2011. ‘He spent March 27 – the last full day of his life – almost entirely in the company of his family. ‘All . of them claimed to be unaware that he used or acquired drugs in their . company but somehow or from somewhere he did acquire them and probably . took them in sufficient quality to kill him. ‘It is likely he obtained these drugs from members of his family with whom he was in contact on the last day of his life.’","Coroner told mother, father, uncle and aunt of Drew Quinlan, 13, were all heroin users and at some stage had taken anti-depressants .

"Fertility watchdogs have launched an investigation after a ‘dating-style’ website posted clearly identifiable photographs and personal details of British women who have donated their eggs. Infertile couples from all  over the world can browse  profiles of the donors, whose faces are clearly visible, to select the characteristics, body types or qualifications. The site, Premier Egg Donors, is run by Barrie and Tony Drewitt-Barlow, who made history in 1999 when they became the first gay couple to be named on their surrogate twins’ birth certificates. Age: 29 5ft 8in, 11st 8lb, fit, blue eyes, brown hair, fair skin . 'I am a vegetarian and a big animal lover - I have a horse and two cats' Age: 19  5ft 8in, 9st, fit, hazel eyes,  brown hair, fair skin . ‘My outlook would be to make the most of your life and enjoy what life can bring.’ Age: 30 5ft 5in, 11st, hazel eyes, brown hair . ‘I am responsible, reliable, have common sense and enjoy learning.’ Age: 22 5ft 5in, 8st 1lb, petite,  blue eyes, brown hair . ‘I am independent and have always been inspired by other cultures.’ Since then, the men have fathered three more children by American surrogates, and set up the British Surrogacy Centre in California. Three months ago, Barrie, 43, from Maldon, Essex, merged BSC and Premier Egg Donors. Some British women who donated eggs through BSC in the past are now on the Premier Egg Donors site, which is aimed largely at the US market. In contrast to Britain, surrogacy deals in the US are big business. The 12 British women on the site include a model and a parliamentary researcher. Several include photographs resembling those found on dating sites. One 20-year-old’s personal statement says: ‘I want to give people what I have. A beautiful child is the greatest gift.’ The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says that strict laws ban identification of egg donors. But in an apparent legal loophole, responsibility for protecting their identity rests with the licensed clinic where the eggs were donated. Laura Witjens, chief executive of the National Gamete Donation Trust charity, said: ‘The pictures look like sexy poses. Considering what the website is all about, it’s very distasteful. This is certainly something the HFEA should look into. They’re not acting within the spirit of the UK guidelines.’ Family business: The site, Premier Egg Donors, is run by Barrie and Tony Drewitt-Barlow, pictured here at their home near Alicante, Spain, with three of their five children born to American surrogate mothers . In a recent ITV interview promoting their business, the Drewitt-Barlows made no secret of the huge sums to be made in the US by bringing together infertile couples with donors, surrogates and doctors. Barrie said: ‘In the UK you can only pay a surrogate up to £15,000 in expenses – in the US, we pay them up to £35,000.’ For egg donors, the maximum fee for expenses in Britain is £750, but in America they receive £16,000 to £32,000. The BSC tells British women who want to donate eggs in America that US rules only allow this if they have previously donated elsewhere. BSC organises egg donation in this country at approved clinics, then says the women are eligible to donate in the US and can appear on the Premier Egg Donors website. Under HFEA rules, the centres where they donate are responsible for ensuring the women’s identities remain confidential. One British woman in her late 20s who donated eggs a year ago through BSC said that while she initially consented to her profile being featured, she had not realised her details were on the US site until The Mail on Sunday told her. She had first contacted BSC and was referred for a consultation in London’s Harley Street. ‘I gave them loads of information and a picture,’ she said. A few months later she went to the Herts and Essex Fertility Centre for the donation process. Women display Facebook information about their physical appearance and interests. The site also uses numbers to identify them . Barrie Drewitt-Barlow said both Premier Egg Donors and BSC America are based in Los Angeles. He added: ‘Ninety-five per cent of egg donors on this site are American and all donors are for couples going through the IVF process in the US. 'The HFEA does not hold authority in the US. If an English woman wants to advertise as a surrogate – which is also illegal in the UK –  or become an egg donor for couples in the USA, she can and will be identified. All our procedures are in line with the law.’ The HFEA said: ‘It is the responsibility of the UK fertility centre, licensed by the HFEA, to ensure they comply fully with regulatory requirements, such as confidentiality. We will be in contact with the centre involved to investigate.’ The Herts and Essex Fertility Centre said it did not know about one of its patients’ details being on the website and declined to comment.","Infertile couples can choose donors based on their looks, qualifications, body types and other personal characteristics .

"A fun-loving family is creating a massive 130ft-long waterslide in their back garden after buying it from a local leisure centre for just £50. Rachel Betts is making the huge flume for her two boys Oscar, 2, and six-month-old Oakley. Once completed, it will snake all the way around their two acre garden. The 26-year-old was given the enormous slide by her father Paul, who saw it being dismantled at his local leisure centre in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where it had been used for 20 years. He paid just £50 for the pipes, then the family spent a week carting them 25 miles across country to their home using a truck, trailer and lorry. Mother-of-two Rachel Betts pictured next to the giant waterslide being constructed in her back garden . Rachel Betts' father Paul picked up the pieces of the waterslide from his local leisure centre for just £50 .

Next to him is his son Shaun Betts, beside Shaun's grandmothers Marina Betts and Hilary Clements-Mann. On the right is Paul Bett's daughter Rachel Betts and her six-month-old son Oakley Betts-Brown . Rachel and her family have already constructed half the slide, which comes in 18 three-metre pieces. They hope to eventually create a treehouse at the end of the garden, with the slide spiralling out of it. 'I was absolutely shocked when dad said he had bought the waterslide, but I thought it would be brilliant to have in the garden,' said Rachel Betts, from the village of Stonham Aspal in Suffolk. 'It was very tricky to get all the pieces here as they are so big and heavy, but we managed to use our truck and hire an articulated lorry. 'We're planning to use it as a slide most of the year round, but we may put a paddling pool at the bottom in the summer and use a pump to get water flowing through. 'Oscar is really excited about it and we're looking forward to it too. We're all big kids.' Her father Paul said he saw the slide being taken apart and thrown on the skip and thought it would be fun to rescue it. 'We have often used the slide over the years and when I was taking my youngest daughter swimming when I noticed them breaking it up,' he said. 'I offered to have it and we ended up having 90 per cent of the black slide. Rachel's lucky to have a big garden and it fits in well and the children will be able to have amazing fun.'

It still needs a few improvements but we're getting there.' A spokesman for St Edmundsbury Borough Council spokesman said: 'The old flume had come to the end of its natural life, having undergone several repairs in the past. 'We are investing approximately £170,000 in a new flume which should be in place by early next year. 'As we understand it, the builder was approached by a member of the public who asked if he could take a few sections of the old flume to use as a feature in his garden. 'It would have cost money to put it into landfill and so the builder agreed that the man could take sections.'","Family constructs 130ft long waterslide in back yard for children to play on after buying it from local council .

The brothers were 17 and 19-years-old at the time of Shannon’s murder. 'This case remained open for many years but Shannon Siders was never forgotten and law enforcement's resolve to hold those accountable for her death never diminished,' said Newaygo County Prosecutor Robert Springstead reported WZZM13.

"He almost lost his balance when he sat down at the start and briefly lost his composure when someone dropped the F-word but, the subject of Rio Ferdinand aside, this felt like a happy homecoming for Ashley Cole. Not always everyone’s cup of tea during a Premier League career spent at Arsenal and Chelsea, Cole returned to England for the first time as a Roma player on Monday and was quite the charmer. There were no hard feelings towards Chelsea for ending his eight-year stay at Stamford Bridge this summer and an acceptance that Italy has yet to see the best of him. Ashley Cole said an emotional farewell to Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge in May . Ashley Cole was released by Chelsea at the end of last season following eight years with the Blues . Ashley Cole was speaking to the press ahead of Tuesday night's game at the Etihad Stadium . There were even a few wisecracks. When a question was put jointly to him and Rudi Garcia, Cole waited for the Roma coach to finish a long-winded answer in Italian before saying: ‘I agree with him!’ For Chelsea fans who are still coming to terms with seeing Frank Lampard playing — and scoring — against his old club, it will feel even more peculiar to consider the possibility of two of their 2012 Champions League heroes facing one another with different clubs at the Etihad  on Tuesday night. Asked if he was surprised to see Lampard score four goals in three games for Manchester City, Cole said: ‘Not really. I think everyone knows what Lampard brings to every team. ‘It’s another experienced player for City and he brings goals. He scored one against Chelsea. He probably didn’t like that but he’s paid to do a job. Ashley Cole could come up against former Chelsea teammate Frank Lampard . ‘It will be nice to see him but I never expected to play against him. I don’t think Chelsea were wrong (to let them both go). A decision was made and I’m fine with it. I had eight great years there and I still speak to the staff and players. ‘I’m not playing that well. I won’t get carried away. I need more games. I’m enjoying my football and hopefully I can emulate what I achieved at Arsenal and Chelsea.’ Cole will be the most experienced Champions League player on the pitch with 105 appearances, three more than Lampard. But he was left out of the 5-1 win over CSKA Moscow in the opening Group E fixture, as well as one of five consecutive Serie A victories. One criticism is that he does not get forward from left-back as much as he used to. ‘That’s because I’m old!’ said the 33-year-old. ‘When I get used to the league and the way we play, I’ll attack a bit more. Ashley Cole has endured a slow start to his Roma career . ‘I’m loving Italy, to be honest. Of course it’s different to the Premier League which is fast and furious. Serie A is slower, though we like to attack and play fast. ‘I loved playing in the Premier League, but this is something different for me now.’ The Italians know that City’s last-minute defeat to Bayern Munich has put more pressure on the Premier League champions to win tonight. Victory for Roma, meanwhile, would put them in a commanding position in the group after just two games. ‘Of course it will make it more difficult for them to qualify,’ said Cole. ‘We don’t want to think that far ahead but it will make it hard for them to catch up certainly and put us top of the group. Ashley Cole arrives in England for Tuesday night's Champions League clash against Manchester City . Ashley Cole has featured four times for Roma since his arrival in Italy in the summer . ‘It’s a new experience for some of our players but we’re confident that we can challenge the top teams, come to City, play well and maybe don’t lose the game — that’s the main thing. I think everyone knows how good City are now. They have been champions twice. They have (Yaya) Toure, (Edin) Dzeko, (Sergio) Aguero, (Joe) Hart and then they sign Lampard. ‘These players are known worldwide because they win things. They have won the Premier League and now they will be aiming to win the Champions League as well. ‘But there is pressure on them. They have big players and I know some of them — Hart and (James) Milner and Lamps — will always want to keep on winning, but there’s less pressure on us.’","Cole was released in the summer after eight years at Stamford Bridge .

By the time the new big screen turned from 59 minutes to 60 here, though, Wednesday were four goals adrift and a man short. By full time it was seven and, moments before that, one of the City team was posing for photographs in the centre circle with the game going on around him. Frank Lampard was certainly not to be blamed for that little sketch. Seeing a supporter sprinting towards him with security nowhere in sight, the hug he offered was perhaps the best self-defence mechanism open to him and it certainly seemed to work. Nevertheless, it was an image that summed up the closing stages of the night. City were on easy street by then. Wednesday, sadly, couldn’t wait to get home. For Lampard, life at his current club continues to improve. His first appearance in the 2-2 draw at Arsenal was rather uncomfortable and ended at half time. On Sunday, however, he marked an appearance as a substitute against his old club Chelsea with the equaliser. On Wednesday night he scored twice and won the penalty that led to his team’s fourth goal and saw Kamil Zayatte sent off. ‘It’s never a problem trying to get good players like Frank in your team,’ said City manager Manuel Pellegrini. ‘It’s only a problem if you don’t have good players. I was pleased for him. He played very well.’ By the end of the evening, Lampard had certainly emerged as one of City’s stand-out players. The second half was a desperately one-sided affair once the former England international had nudged home a cross from James Milner in the 48th minute. Prior to that, though, City had provided Gray’s team with absolutely no suggestion of what was coming. The first half had been a pretty even affair that ended with a good section of the City faithful agitated enough to implore their players to ‘get forward’. Ultimately, City heeded that advice and then some. Once Lampard scored, City moved their machine through the gears and Wednesday were simply rolled over. Wednesday did rally briefly and City second string goalkeeper Willy Caballero dropped to his left to save from midfielder Giles Coke after Yaya Toure — captain for the night — had conceded a rather unnecessary free-kick on the by-line.

Yaya Toure scythes down Sheffield Wednesday's Jacques Maghoma during the third round tie at the Etihad Stadium . Manchester City's James Milner beats Lewis Buxton to get a cross into the box . Born in Malaga, Pozo signed for Manchester City from Real Madrid’s youth system in 2012, though Real president Florentino Perez was desperate to keep him. The 18-year-old striker, known as ‘Mini Messi’, played his way into Spain’s Under 17s last year, and also topped City’s scoring charts at youth level. Jose Pozo scored Manchester City's sixth goal on Wednesday night in the 7-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday at the Etihad Stadium . Within minutes, though, City had scored twice more and the game was over. First Jesus Navas — impressive all night — crossed low for Edin Dzeko to sweep across Chris Kirkland with his right-foot shot before Lampard broke to feed the Spaniard. He carried the ball ten yards before driving a breathtaking shot high into the goal with his right foot from an angle. After looking comfortable at half-time, Wednesday suddenly looked demoralised. It threatened to be a testing final 25 minutes and it certainly was once Zayatte was sent off for upending Lampard with half an hour left. That cameo was typical of Lampard’s night. He was actually trying to dummy the ball when it bounced back off his standing leg and prompted Zayatte to make his challenge. Moments later, Toure scored the penalty and a rout was in the offing.

For a while, Wednesday resisted. The outstanding Milner struck a post and then Dzeko blazed the rebound over rather carelessly. A man down, though, pressure was always going to tell on Wednesday and City went on to score late goals through Dzeko, young substitute Jose Pozo and, in injury time, Lampard. Afterwards, Wednesday manager Gray was rueful. ‘We talked at half time about keeping it tight but we made mistakes,’ he said. ‘We are only human and we have ended up with a buffeting.’ By the end, the likes of Pozo and even outcast Scott Sinclair were on the field for City. It must be noted, though, that Pellegrini started with a very strong team and was ultimately rewarded with a victory that will do his team’s confidence no harm at all. The juggernaut rumbles on.

'He is due to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 20 January 2015.' North Yorkshire Police launched an investigation into the circumstances of the incident and appealed for witnesses. Since the collision, a host of footballers, former clubs, organisations and charities have used social media to send messages hoping former Professional Footballers' Association chairman Carlisle makes a quick recovery. Over a 16-year career, Carlisle, who is also a former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, made more than 500 appearances for nine clubs.

Pictured, a show of support from a Burnley fan . His most notable stint as a Premier League player came during his five years with Burnley, with him featuring for them in 2009-10, their first season in the division. As a sign of the Clarets' support for their former player, fans at Turf Moor clapped in the fifth minute of their game against Liverpool on Boxing Day to match the squad number Carlisle wore at the club. As well as Burnley, there have also been messages of support for Carlisle from the other clubs he played for, which include Blackpool, QPR, Leeds, Watford and Northampton. The Football Association, Football League and anti-racism organisation Kick It Out, for which Carlisle is an ambassador, all tweeted their support as well, while representatives from the PFA visited him in hospital. During his time in football and since retiring last year, Clarke Carlisle has campaigned to shed a light on what he has called the 'dark side of the beautiful game'. He was once named 'Britain's cleverest footballer' and has appeared on the BBC's flagship political programme, Question Time, and quiz show Countdown. In a TV documentary called Football's Suicide Secret he spoke to those working in the game about problems of depression and stress. He said: 'Everybody's perception of being a footballer is that you've made it. You're a superstar. Football provides some magical highs, but it also provides some really, really dark lows. 'As a footballer, I've experienced all the ups and downs of the game, but there's one taboo no-one wants to talk about, mental illness.' As part of his work highlighting racism and mental illness in football, Carlisle  appeared on Question Time . In the documentary, he spoke about his own attempt at suicide after he was injured early in his career. He said: 'I thought ""I'm going to take all these pills and kill myself because I'm of no use to anyone, because I know without football, they are going to see me for what I really am"", and that was nothing.' Carlisle, who is on the Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association, used the programme to call on footballing authorities to do more to support players. Carlisle has also campaigned against racism in the game and is an ambassador for the Kick It Out scheme. As part of his work, he visits schools to speak to students and he has criticised Fifa president Sepp Blatter for claiming racism is no longer an issue in the game. In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation who spoke to David Cameron to discuss issues of racism and homophobia in football.","Wife has been thanking fans for their support as he lies in hospital .

"The typical Fifties pin-up girl was slim and conventionally-posed. But a recently-unearthed collection of images has revealed the less familiar Hilda, a plus-sized redhead who broke the mold with her plump figure and light-hearted demeanor. A year after the death of Duane Bryers, the artist who created her, online gallery ToilGirls has published prints of one of America's longest-running pin-up girls, who graced calendars from the mid-Fifties until the Eighties. Although Hilda's creator passed away, his red-headed cartoon lives on today as a testament to the sex appeal of fuller-bodied women. Plus-size pin-up: Artist Duane Bryers used watercolor to create plump and endearing pin-up girl Hilda in the mid-Fifties, and she graced calendars for 36 years . Not only was Hilda one of the only plus-sized pin-up girls of her time, but she also displayed a fun, carefree and somewhat clumsy attitude, making her all the more charming. In one of Bryers' paintings, Hilda leans forward suggestively, squeezing between two rungs of a ladder to paint a wall. A handkerchief hangs out of the back of her yellow bikini, barely covering her ample behind. Another image shows an almost-nude Hilda warming up in front of a furnace, flashing a cheeky smile as she covers her breasts with her red pajamas. Bryers told the Arizona Daily Star in 2010: 'I got the idea for a plumpy gal pinup . and thought I'd like to make it into a calendar series. But how was I going to sell a plump girl?' He . then brought the series to the U.S.'s top calendar maker at the time, . Brown & Bigelow, who 'reluctantly put it in the line and figured it . would last a short time.' In . reality, while she may have been less prominent because of her curvaceous figure, the Hilda series endured for more than three decades, and today there are . numerous Tumblr, Facebook and Pinterest pages dedicated to the buxom . redhead. Enduring popularity: Though Bryers passed away last year just a month shy of his 101st birthday, his red-headed cartoon lives on today as a testament to the sex appeal of fuller-bodied women . One of a kind: Many Hilda fans today admire her uniqueness in a world of thin and conventionally attractive female icons .

'Her fresh and fun-filled freckled face create a symphony for the eyes. She's simply peachy-keen' The blogger calls Hilda a 'vision of femininity' and 'an ideal example of full-figure perfection.' She is all the more special in that . Duane Bryers did not base her on a real life model, but instead . fashioned her from his own imagination and fantasy.

"Michelle Obama, Malala Yousafzai, Hillary Clinton, and Amy Poehler are among those lending their support to the social media campaign, which encourages military intervention to recover the girls who were kidnapped from their school by Boko Haram rebels in north-east Nigeria. Malala Yousafzai told CNN that the kidnapped girls were her 'sisters'. Angelina Jolie also spoke publicly about the kidnapping, which she called 'unthinkable cruelty and evil'.

It's time to #BringBackOurGirls. -mo' The sign-off 'mo' means that the tweet was written by the First Lady herself and not a staffer. The campaign refers to the kidnapping of 276 girls from their school in Chibok, north-east Nigeria, on April 14. The Islamist militant group Boko Haram attacked the school, which had been reopened so that students could take their final exams, despite security concerns. Hilary Clinton was among those who tweeted in support of the campaign, which encourages military intervention to recover the girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram rebels on April 14 .

Backing: Celebrities including Mary J Blige have joined a worldwide social media campaign putting pressure on the Nigerian government to bring the girls back . Most schools in the state had closed due to fear that Boko Haram, which opposes 'Western' education, including the education of girls, would attack. On the night of April 14, more than 300 girls were kidnapped at gunpoint, but approximately 50 girls escaped by jumping off the back of the trucks as they drove into the Sambisa forest. Family members of the kidnapped girls formed makeshift search parties and ventured into the forest to find the girls, armed with homemade weapons, but they have not found the girls, whom they now fear have been sold into slavery. Jada Pinkett-Smith pledged her support by posting a photo from Unicef on her Twitter page . It has also emerged that the group had . kidnapped another 11 girls from the village of Warabe in Borno yesterday, . increasing the international pressure for the extremist group to be stopped and the girls returned. Nigerian Police are now offering a £300,000 reward to anyone who can help them find the missing children. Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram said he would sell the remaining captives as slaves for as little as £7. In a video, Shekau declares: 'I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.' The tweet that launched it all: Lawyer Ibrahim M. Abdullahi was the first to use the hashtag on April 23 during a UNESCO address .

Worldwide protest: Students from the European Student Union added their voices to the campaign . With outrage growing over the failure to rescue the girls, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of the country’s largest city Lagos last week to protest at their government’s inability to find the victims. The Bring Back Our Girls hashtag was first used on April 23 by a Nigerian lawayer, Ibrahim M. Abdullahi, who tweeted the phrase during a speech given by Dr Oby Ezekwesili, Vice President of the World Bank for Africa, at a UNESCO event. The hashtag gained traction in Nigeria and started trending there two weeks ago and has now been picked up internationally, with people around the world sharing photos of themselves holding up signs reading #BringBackOurGirls. Protests have also taken place around the world, with around 75 protesters rallying outside the Nigerian embassy in Washington on Tuesday wearing Bring Back Our Girls T-shirts.

'In the short term our goal is obviously to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies.' British Special Forces have also been put on standby after Foreign Secretary William Hague described the abduction as 'disgusting and immoral'. Military chiefs in London are . considering sending in the Special Air Service and the Special Boat . Service to help search for the schoolgirls. Militant: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, vows to sell the hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in northern Nigeria for as little as £7 during a video message . Explosion: The group have been behind a number of deadly attacks, including the bombing of Nyanya bus station in Abuja last week . Boko Haram translates into English as 'Western education is sinful'. They heavily oppose the Westernisation of Nigeria and want to impose Sharia law. Violence linked to the group and their insurgency is said to have led to an estimated 10,000 deaths between 2002 and 2013. Their recent attacks include a car bomb that killed 19 people and two bus blasts which caused 70 fatalities in the capital Abuja. On March 16, 100 people in villages across the country were killed in a series of gun attacks. The militants are currently led by Abubakr Shekau. He is known for targeting Christians as well as politicians who oppose the Islamisation of Nigeria. Shekau is the most wanted man in Nigeria. The US has offered a reward of £7m for information about his whereabouts. Hundreds have been killed in a crackdown on the group by Nigerian Police, including the group's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, who died in custody. Downing Street revealed British security experts would be joining teams from France and the US in trying to find the girls. The team has been drawn from Whitehall departments including Defence, International Development and the Foreign Office. It is likely to include military officers but will concentrate on planning, co-ordination and advice to local authorities, rather than getting involved in operations on the ground to free the girls. However, Mr Hague has become frustrated with the situation, after he first offered his assistance nearly three weeks ago. He told Sky News: 'It's difficult of course because this is primarily a matter for Nigeria and Britain can't just walk in there... and do as we like. 'It's very frustrating when the world can't act to deal with these things promptly because the trail goes cold of course after several weeks.' A social media campaign to raise awareness globally about the kidnapping is gaining momentum with celebrities including Mary J Blige adding their support. The mass kidnapping occurred the same day . as a bomb blast, also blamed on Boko Haram, that killed 75 people on the . edge of Abuja and marked the first attack on the capital in two years. The . militants repeated that bomb attack more than two weeks later in almost . exactly the same spot, killing 19 people and wounding 34 in the suburb . of Nyanya.

"Jose Mourinho insists Eden Hazard loves playing in England and the Chelsea boss has no concerns the Belgian could seek to evade the heavy tackles of the Premier League by moving abroad. Hazard has long spoken of his admiration for Zinedine Zidane, leading to speculation of a potential move to Real Madrid, while Paris St Germain were linked with the playmaker last term. The 23-year-old, who is in his third season at Chelsea after joining from Lille in June 2012, is in advanced discussions over a contract extension which Mourinho expects to be a formality.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho hopes that Hazard will stay in the Premier League . And the Blues boss does not expect the mercurial Hazard to disappear despite warning after the loss at Tottenham that the physical nature of English football means 'maybe one day we won't have Eden Hazard'. 'I think he loves it here. I think so,' Mourinho said. 'I think, I hope (he will stay).' Mourinho last season often bemoaned the frequency of fouls on Hazard and has again repeated his complaint, calling on officials to protect his prized asset by punishing persistent offenders. 'The first free-kick of every game is somebody kicking him,' Mourinho said. 'He has fouls and fouls and fouls. I don't see many yellow cards. 'Sometimes a yellow card is a consequence of violent conduct, but I also think that accumulation of small fouls is also violent conduct. 'The kid is suffering the consequences of that, but playing amazingly well. '(Against Tottenham) he was amazing. Even in the second half, with a difficult result to face, and to have the determination to keep believing till the end. He was fantastic.' Hazard was 'amazing' against Tottenham despite defeat, according to his boss Mourinho . Hazard is a huge admirer of former France and Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane . Hazard could be afforded a rare rest for Sunday's FA Cup third-round clash with Watford at Stamford Bridge. Diego Costa, too, is likely to come out of the starting XI, with a possible FA Cup return for Didier Drogba. The 36-year-old Ivory Coast striker won the competition four times during his first spell and became the first player to score in four FA Cup finals. Chelsea have won four of the last eight FA Cups and Mourinho is eager to prevail in the competition for a second time, after his 2007 success. He added: 'Every game and every competition, we try. So the next game is FA Cup, let's respect the competition, which is a beautiful one, and try to go all the way.' Diego Costa is likely to rested for Chelsea's FA Cup clash with Watford on Sunday . He will likely be replaced by Didier Drogba, who has scored in four previous FA Cup finals for Chelsea . He will not be underestimating Watford, but believes the fact Chelsea will be playing so soon after New Year's Day, when Championship clubs were not in action, could be to the visitors' advantage. 'The Championship clubs will be in a better condition than the Premier League clubs,"" Mourinho said. 'At the same time, normally the Premier League clubs have more potential, more quality. Maybe it's a way to make things level. 'One team has more quality but another team is fresh and ready for the game. So maybe matches between Premier League teams and Championship teams, this is a good way to level things. 'They have a good team.'","Eden Hazard loves playing in England, according to Jose Mourinho .

"When the two teams walk out of the Huish Park tunnel on Sunday afternoon there will be one amongst them wearing a Manchester United kit under his Yeovil Town garbs. Ten-year-old Harris, a United fan, was handed a late Christmas present by his father, Yeovil striker James Hayter, when he was told he had got him a place as a home mascot in their FA Cup third-round tie. The fixture is one of the biggest in Yeovil's history and Hayter admits, at 35-years-old, that it will be the greatest in his long career as a forward. VIDEO Scroll down for FATV's preview of Yeovil vs Manchester United . James Hayter will be lining up for Yeovil against Manchester United in the FA Cup on Sunday . 35-year-old Hayter has handed his son a place as a mascot at the game at Huish Park . 10-year-old Harris's hero is Manchester United captain and forward Wayne Rooney . But there was one in the Hayter household who celebrated even more than the player when Louis Van Gaal's team were pulled out of the hat to play the Somerset side. 'Harris said he wants to wear his Manchester United kit under his Yeovil kit,' Hayter explained. 'He was buzzing about the draw. 'I only told him on Tuesday he was going to get to be a mascot as well. So it's even better he's going to get to shake hands with all the players. He just can't wait for the game.' Harris's favourite player is Wayne Rooney and though Hayter draws the line at asking for the England striker's shirt at half-time, he added: 'He's asked me if I can try and get something off him. I'll do my best. Harris might be asking it before the game in the tunnel when he's lining up. It will be a good day for him.' Hayter's wife and two younger daughters will be at Yeovil's home for the game, although his parents, Mary and Richard, are unable to attend. They famously missed the moment their son scored the fastest hat-trick in Football League history, his first match after Harris was born a decade ago. Hayter, playing for Bournemouth at the time, came from the bench in the 84th minute in a match against Wrexham at Dean Court in February 2004, scored with his first touch and netted twice more within 140 seconds. But his parents had left the ground early to catch a ferry back to their home in the Isle of Wight. Hayter is famous for scoring the fastest hat-trick in Football League history in 2004 . Hayter (right) celebrates with Yeovil team-mates after scoring against Leyton Orient in last year's 3rd round . 'They were listening to the radio on the way back,' Hayter said. 'They heard a cheer on the way out and put the radio on and heard it was mine and were annoyed. Then listened in the car on the way to the ferry and heard I scored another two. They were obviously pleased, but they'd left to get the earlier ferry. They still shake their heads about it.' His father is too unwell to travel to the match, but they will be watching back home on television, eager not to miss this one. Hayter spent a large part of his career at Bournemouth, on their books as a teenager before enjoying a decade on the south coast between 1997 and 2007. While there, he heard stories about Bournemouth's famous victory against United, under manager Harry Rednapp, to knock them out of the cup in 1984. Hayter was only five at the time. Yet Yeovil have an even richer history of giant killing, knocking out 17 professional sides when they were a non-League club. 'It is something the manager Gary Johnson has spoken to us about in the previous two rounds,' Hayter added. 'He said that this was almost what Yeovil was known for. 'People know about Yeovil as they did so well in the FA Cup as a non-League team and they are one of the teams that has knocked the most league teams out. This club has a real history in the FA Cup.' Victory for the League One team against this United side, worth hundreds of millions of pounds, will be perhaps mark their greatest moment of all.

"Jose Enrique seems to have used the international break to start acting the fool - and maybe that is what inspired his new facial hair. The Spanish full back has grown a Charlie Chaplin-style moustache and, unlike his apparent inspiration, was determined not to stay silent and proudly displayed it on Twitter. It seems his girlfriend was not laughing about it, however. Jose Enrique posted a picture of himself sporting a Charlie Chaplin-style moustache on instagram . The left back (tackling against Basle) has only played three games for Liverpool so far this season . Enrique, 28, jokingly tweeted: 'Surprised my girlfriend with a new style of beard this morning, She didn't like it very much.. hahahahaha @AmyJaine.' Unfortunately for Chaplin and Enrique a certain 20th century dictator has rather tarnished the reputation of the 'toothbrush moustache'. Chaplin was born in east London in 1889 and was best known as an actor and comedian during the era of silent films. His best known movies include The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931) and 1940s The Great Dictator, in which he satirised Adolf Hitler. Chaplin made people laugh and we're sure Enrique's tribute moustache will have brought a smile to his Liverpool team-mates' faces - even if his girlfriend was not impressed.

"A defiant Roberto Martinez is refusing to curb Everton’s attacking style despite rumblings of discontent over his management at Goodison Park. The Spaniard masterminded a fifth-placed finish in his first season on Merseyside, but he has seen Everton slump to 12th position this term after losing five of their last seven Premier League games. Martinez’s side have leaked 31 league goals so far this campaign - only eight fewer than in the whole of last season. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch Martinez discuss Everton's style and Tim Howard's injury . Everton's Leighton Baines, Seamus Coleman, Samuel Eto'o and Antolin Alcaraz (left-right) appear dejected . Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has seen his side make 10 errors leading to goals already this season . ROSS BARKLEY: Midfielder hasn’t made the same explosive start to this season as he did in 2013. Granted, he has played six fewer games than at this time last season, but he has one goal from 13 shots, compared to three goals and 35 shots last year. SEAMUS COLEMAN: Right-back is suffering at both ends of the pitch this season. He has made 27 tackles (38 this time last term) and 575 passes (729 in 2013-14), but it is the five goals (two this season) and 15 shots (seven this season) that have been sorely missed. ROMELU LUKAKU: Since his big-money move, the striker has yet to hit the heights of last season. At this stage last term he had nine goals and a 25 per cent chance conversion rate - this season it’s six and 15.3 per cent. Also, he has been flagged offside 20 times (nine at this stage last season). There are understood to be concerns around the club and even in the dressing-room that the manager’s commitment to attacking football is leaving Everton exposed at the back, and there is little compromise to be found in Martinez’s single-minded approach. ‘You don’t win games by changing the style,’ said Martinez ahead of Thursday's trip to Hull City. ‘Changing only brings doubts. I’ve been in this situation too many times. ‘Maybe when I was a young manager starting out, you would start thinking about (changing style) after a run like this but it is very clear - in football you need to be outstanding at what you do. It’s not good enough to be average. ‘Are we going to concede goals? Of course we are. Are we going to lose games? Of course we are. But it’s important we know the way we want to play and that is never, ever going to be changed. Our style is very clear. It was very successful last season, giving us the biggest points tally in the Premier League in the history of our football club. Ross Barkley (right) has failed to hit the glittering heights of last season due to injury . Seamus Coleman (right) is not offering anywhere near as many goals as he did in the last campaign . Romelu Lukaku signed for Everton permanently in the summer and has struggled to continue his form . ‘I’m very much aware of the needs of the British game. I have been here long enough and I’m not someone who works in percentages. I don’t work on having a good defensive record to win things. ‘We work on other aspects and I like to have the talent that wins football games and try to build something that will allow the club to compete against sides that have spent a huge amount of money. ‘The players know what we are doing. We’re stronger than ever. We know where we want to go and how we are going to get there. I will allow the results to speak for themselves.’ Newcastle United's Jack Colback (left) pounces on a mistake by Ross Barkley to score against Everton . Martinez is aware of the criticism after Everton conceded three goals at Southampton and Newcastle United. But he is not about to let the pundits alter his way of thinking. ‘When you concede the kind of cheap goals we did against Southampton and Newcastle then you are going to get those comments,’ he added. ‘But the pundits are only assessing those two games, they haven’t got the deep information from watching that team over 18 months. That’s part of the manager’s job. ‘I’m probably the most open manager in the league. I don’t think anyone would have a conversation this open. I’m always open to other opinions, but the reality is I know what out football style is. It’s not about listening to opinions.’ Everton striker Romelu Lukaku (fifth left) scores at the wrong end against Southampton as Tim Howard dives . There was more bad news for Everton on Tuesday when it was confirmed that goalkeeper Tim Howard will be out for up to six weeks with the calf injury he sustained against Stoke City. The setback will almost certainly force Martinez into the transfer market next month, with Spaniard Joel Robles the only other senior keeper on the books. The Everton boss admitted centre backs Phil Jagielka and John Stones are unlikely to recover from ankle injuries in time to face Hull, while James McCarthy’s troublesome hamstring will continue to be monitored. Martinez, a qualified physiotherapist, is known to be concerned that Everton players have suffered 18 hamstring or soft-tissue injuries in as many months, and it was confirmed on Tuesday that the club’s highly-respected head of medicine Daniel Donachie has left Goodison. Howard has been ruled out for six weeks leaving Everton short on goalkeeping back-up .

"Not so long ago, it was more acceptable to smoke next to a baby than it was to sport a coat made from fox, mink or chinchilla. Such was public disgust, those who did venture out in a pelt were likely to find themselves deluged with red paint. But how times have changed. Once taboo, fur is now a regular sight on the catwalk, with labels such as Armani, Temperley and Vionnet using it in their collections. At the Cheltenham Festival last week, race-goers turned up swathed in expensive mink and raccoon coats, while on the red carpet, A-listers such as Kate Moss and Rihanna are as happy to strike a pose in a fur as they are in lace. So what does that mean for the rest of us? Is fur now OK to wear? Furry fashion: Pelts on the catwalk at Moncler during Paris Fashion Week and sported by Kate Moss (right) No, say PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals], who point to a recent Times News Service poll which found that 95 per cent of British women say they wouldn't wear fur. 'We may see more fur on the catwalk but that doesn't translate into what real people are wearing, unless they are the sort of people who would elbow aside a starving child on their way to kicking a stray dog,' said PETA founder, Ingrid Newkirk. In a jibe at fashionable fur wearers, she added: 'Fur is now so cheap that streetwalkers wear it and wage labourers in China can have fur slippers.' But Newkirk's view doesn't match up with figures released by the British Fur Trade Association, which show that domestic fur sales increased by a healthy 30 per cent between 2010 and 2011. Globally, sales are just as buoyant and have almost tripled since 2000. 'Fur sales are at a record high, with global sales of all types of fur increasing by 70 per cent to around $15 billion in the past decade, ' says Mark Oaten, CEO of the International Fur Trade Federation. 'The boom is thanks to high demand from the Far East and Russia but also due to designers reinventing fur as a material.' None of this comes as a surprise to Torben Nielsen, CEO of Kopenhagen Fur, the Danish body that manages sales for the country's fur farmers. Wrapped up: Pippa Middleton sports a fur hat to watch the races during the Cheltenham Festival . Fashionable: Furs on the catwalk at the Kopenhagen Fur show during Copenhagen Fashion Week . For Nielsen, quality and longevity are the main reasons for fur's continuing appeal, but he is keen to point out that fur is an eco-friendly material too. 'Real fur is a green choice,' he explains. 'Fashion is the most polluting industry in the world and it's really not very green. 'Cotton demands lots of pesticides and pollutes a lot but lasts for only half a year as a piece of clothing. Fur is expensive so you won't just throw it away. It can last for ever - perhaps 10, 15, 20 years or more.' Controversial though Nielsen's views . might seem, they aren't unusual. Writing in Grazia, fashion author and curator, Bronwyn Cosgrove revealed: 'I wear leather, I eat meat. I don't feel there is much difference ethically. Unless you are wearing a hemp sack, you run the risk of flaunting something unethical in your wardrobe. 'Synthetic fibres are potentially controversial, given the raw materials and processes used in production, while cheap, fast fashion often has questionable labour conditions and encourages waste.' 'We don't have a problem with fur coming back into fashion,' add PPQ designers, Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker. 'We don't think for a lot of people it ever went away. 'We eat meat and use and wear leather which essentially is skin with hair removed, so it would be contradictory to say otherwise.' Nielsen, meanwhile, is also keen to address the issue of fur farming, which is legal in Denmark, but is the main bone of contention for British consumers. 'Fur farming banned in some countries, including your own [UK] but it isn't because of welfare: it is because of public morality,' he says. 'If the [UK] Government looked at reports that compared animal welfare on fur farms to pig farming or something like that, they'd find they wouldn't  want to ban it. 'In Denmark, the conclusion is that welfare on fur farms is better than welfare on regular farms.' No change: Fur has never gone away say PPQ designers, Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker . Valentino included an ermine cape in the latest show . Shaggy furs dominated the catwalk at Vionnet . Cara Delevingne sports a fur coat during Louis Vuitton's Paris show . Trends too have played a part, with many designers fed up with the poor quality of faux fur, while outside of the fashion industry, a new generation have discovered real fur through purchasing vintage coats and trims. 'Fur coats are the lightest, warmest, wind-blocking garment you can own,' adds Cosgrove. 'Completely insulating without being bulky or heavy.' Fur is becoming an increasingly common sight in the celebrity world too. Tellingly, of the five supermodels who posed for PETA's 'I'd rather go naked than wear fur' campaign of the 90s, only Christy Turlington still avoids fur. The others, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss and Elle Macpherson, all wear it. Even animal rights activists aren't having the same impact that they once did. 'The growth figures of the fur trade just show pretty clearly that consumers are growing increasingly cold to the animal rights debate,' says Oaten. 'Animal rights activists are still shouting as loud as before, but people are choosing not to listen. 'Pop stars and actresses, such as Lady Gaga, Madonna, Kanye West and Sharon Stone, wear their fur proudly and brave the onslaught of ferocious attacks from animal welfare organisations like PETA. 'There will always be vegetarians, people opposed to nuclear weapons: that’s fine, that's what healthy democracy is about.' PETA, however, has no plans to give up on its fight against fur and recently recruited actress Olivia Munn to voice its new campaign video. Furry: Real fur hats were seen all over the Cheltenham Festival, on men as well as women . Fur fans: Lana del Rey slips out for a midnight snack in her fur coat, while Liberty Ross wore hers to a party . 'Stylish celebrities, including Eva Mendes, Natalie Portman, Kelly Osborne, Penélope Cruz, abhor the cruelty of the fur trade,' ripostes Newkirk. And it isn't just celebrities who've sworn off the textile. Although fur is popping up increasingly regularly on the catwalk, most recently at Louis Vuitton, for some, the material will never be acceptable. Stella McCartney is one designer for whom pelts just don't pay, telling Grazia that 'everything in my store and every single garment and accessory that you see is cruelty free in the sense that no animal has died to make anything in here.' And she's not alone. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, All Saints, Vivienne Westwood, Calvin Klein, H&M, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Liberty have all pledged not to sell fur. Meanwhile, Danish designer Henrik Vibskov has also sworn off the material, despite hailing from a culture in which fur is generally regarded as just another fabric. 'Nowadays you can get material that has the same structure and feel as real fur,' he explains. 'There's no need for us to use real fur. For me, fake [fur] is a better choice.' Another fashionista who won't touch fur is fashion writer Melanie Rickey, partner of High Street Tsar, Mary Portas, who says: 'I don't believe an animal existing in a tiny cage for its lifespan purely to be made into a coat or used as trimming is morally acceptable for me.' For PETA, however, the fashion institution that really isn't pulling its weight is Burberry, which recently ran into trouble over the use of peacock feathers on its £22,000 show stopper of a coat first seen during the label's London Fashion Week show. Peacock: Burberry's controversial feather trench on the runway (left) and on Anna Wintour (right) 'The Burberry brand may be known for its plaids but what it should be known for is a long track record of promoting cruelty to animals, including drowning, strangling and electrocuting animals on factory fur farms and now paying to have feathers ripped out of peacocks' sensitive skin by the fistful,' thunders Newkirk. 'The rising demand for peacock feathers, fuelled by heartless designers, translates to the trapping and slaughter of India's prized national bird. 'Anyone with an ounce of compassion should steer clear of these products of cruelty and instead opt for any of the many fashionable options that doesn’t cost animals the skin (or feathers) off their backs.' Burberry has responded by pointing out that the peacock feathers come from China, not India, and are sustainably sourced. What's more they say, fur accounts for less than one per cent of their business. Burberry's ethical policy reads: 'As a luxury brand there will be limited occasions when fur is considered important to the overall design but we insist that as with any animal product, it must be sourced without inflicting cruelty. 'Specifically, our policy prescribes the sourcing of fur from suppliers that are governed by high animal welfare standards, which limits the types and origins of furs used in our collection. 'In addition, Burberry believes in the accurate labelling of all garments containing fur, to clearly inform consumers about the product prior to their purchase. As a result, Burberry is a signatory to the US government's Truth In Fur Labelling Act.' Oaten and Nielsen's take on sourcing fur mirrors Burberry's, with both pointing out that the fabric is often a by-product of the meat industry. Oaten is also keen to mention that fur from endangered species is outlawed under the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) regulation and says that the industry would never use fur from domestic cats and dogs. The big question for consumers is who to believe. Are we to listen to PETA or to Oaten? Ultimately, it's a matter of choice. But whether you do decide to wear fur or not, it's worth thinking carefully before you splash out on that luxe mink coat.

Bony, pictured here holding off Liverpool's Lucas Leiva, failed to score as Swansea lost 4-1 at Anfield . Former Vitesse striker Bony waves to Swansea's travelling supporters after the final whistle on Monday night . The 26-year-old's display against Brendan Rodgers' side is unlikely to have put off potential suitors given his sterling goal-scoring record this year. Bony has scored 20 Premier League goals for Swansea in 2014 - more than any other player in the division. Liverpool are known admirers of the former Vitesse Arnhem forward, although they are not in a position to bid for him until the summer. That may leave the door open for Chelsea, who could be looking for a long-term replacement for Didier Drogba. The former Marseille striker has made a successful return to Stamford Bridge this season but at 36, and with just six months left on his current contract, Drogba does not represent Chelsea's future. Bony, pictured celebrating against Leicester this season, has scored eight Premier League goals this term .

He is set to represent the Ivory Coast at the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, with the Elephants' first game coming against Guinea on January 20. Their final group fixture takes place on January 28, although Bony could be missing for at least another fortnight if his country reach the final in Bata on February 8.","Wilfried Bony failed to score for Swansea against Liverpool on Monday .

"Beijing has issued a handy 64-page rulebook aimed at curbing the unruly behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad who have developed an ‘uncivilised’ stereotype. In an effort to smooth out international relations, Guidelines On Civilised Travel Abroad advises travellers to keep nose-hair neatly trimmed, avoid using fingers to pick their teeth and refrain from peeing in the swimming pool. China's Vice Premier Wang Yang said in May that the tourism louts had 'damaged the image of the Chinese people'. Peeing in the pool is not optional, China's new guidebook for tourists warns. (Swimmers head for the water in southwestern China in this 2012 photo) In the book, which also comes with helpful illustrations, tourists are urged not to occupy public toilets for long periods or leave footprints on the seat. Life jackets should be left underneath the seat in aircraft, the rulebook states, because ‘if a dangerous situation arises then someone else will not have a life jacket’. Nose picking in public is frowned upon. The handbook also dispensed country-specific advice: Chinese visitors to Germany should only snap their fingers to beckon dogs, not humans. Women in Spain should always wear earrings in public -- or they could be considered effectively naked. Customers enjoying food at a Chinese restaurant in Dublin, Ireland. Slurping is not encouraged (file photo). Diners in Japan should not play with their clothes or hair during a meal. Tourists are reminded that all air-conditioned places in Hong Kong and Macau are no-smoking areas, and mainlanders should not try to get refunds for food. Don’t... Do... Source: Guidelines on Civilised Travel Abroad, released by China National Tourism Administration . A 33-year-old tourist visiting Hong Kong from central Anhui province complained that the guidelines were too many and too specific. 'You cannot possibly look through all of the rules before you go travelling. 'Also the rules are different in different places,' he told the South China Morning Post. 'I think it's not very feasible.' But one tourist from Guizhou said the new rules provided tourists and locals with a better environment. While several countries have eased visa restrictions to attract affluent Chinese tourists, complaints about etiquette have made international headlines lately. Luxury French fashion Zadig & Voltaire sparked a huge controversy last year by claiming its new 40-room boutique hotel, due to open in 2014, will not be open to Chinese tourists. In February, a mainland Chinese man reportedly relieved himself in a bottle in a crowded Hong Kong restaurant, sparking anger online and prompting some locals to deride mainlanders as 'locusts'. Chinese tourists in North Korea have been accused of insensitive behaviour, such as throwing sweets at children ‘like they’re feeding ducks’. And in May a 15-year-old from Nanjing sparked an outcry after he carved his name into an ancient relief at a temple in Luxor, Egypt. China's list of dos and don'ts comes at the launch of ‘Golden Week’, a public holiday that began on October 1 . Despite the rulebook, some mainland tourists appear to have retained their own set of standards, however. Outside . Golden Bauhinia Square, one of Hong Kong’s main tour group hotspots, a . mother could be seen helping her son urinate into a plastic bag, the Post reported today.","Occupying public toilets for long periods of time and leaving footprints on the seat are discouraged .

"Former Sheffield United and Wales striker Ched Evans has been offered a route back into football - by Maltese side Hibernians. The 26-year-old convicted rapist had an offer to train with his former club retracted in November following strong local opposition, while Tranmere, Oldham and Hartlepool also rejected the opportunity to sign him. However, Malta's Hibernians, 15 points clear at the top of the country's domestic league having dropped just two points in 16 games, have revealed they have made an offer to Evans for the remainder of the season. VIDEO Scroll down to see Ched Evans declare his determination to clear his name . Ex-Sheffield United striker Ched Evans is without a club after being released from prison in October . Club vice-president Stephen Vaughan said: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill. 'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' Hibernians technical director Jeffrey Farrugia told Sky Sports News he believed a deal is close. 'I think we are quite close,' he said. 'We are waiting for his agent to call.' He added on Sky News HD: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.' Asked if he had spoken to Evans, Farrugia said: 'Me personally, no, but Mr Stephen (Vaughan) yes, he met him in the UK. They sat down with his agent so they can speak about a contract.' While reports that Evans might sign with a club in England set off a storm of controversy, Farrugia believed there would be no such reaction in Malta. 'We have no problem with that,' he said. 'He was punished and he did his sentence so he should have a second chance, and our club is ready, the door is open for him to start his new career again in professional football. 'I don't think it's a wrong message. Everybody in life has mistakes, so you should have your second chance.' He added of the possibility of protests against Evans at Hibernians' stadium: 'There won't be anything of this at our club. And I can't understand sometimes how English football, English clubs, think about all these things. Everybody must have a second chance. He paid for what he did, for us it's not an issue.' Scottish Championship side Hibernian moved to clarify they had not offered a deal to Evans . Evans recently released a video statement claiming his innocence alongside girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) Evans scored 48 goals in 113 for Sheffield United before being convicted in 2012 . Farrugia also believes that by moving to Malta, Evans can put himself in the shop window for other clubs. He said: 'For a player like him it's good to come to Malta to play these 26 games. He will be in the window for end of season, many clubs I'm sure they will go for him, so it's good for him to come here and enjoy the game of football. '(He's) a big asset for our club, (to have) the big quality of this player join our club. We need players like him in Malta.' Scottish Championship side Hibernian took to Twitter to ease fans' fears that they had made an offer to Evans, posting: 'Just to clarify we are #Hibs of Scotland and not #Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. See you in the morn, HFC'. Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011. He was initially given permission by League One Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players' union, the Professional Footballers Association. But following a backlash from Blades supporters, sponsors and patrons opposed to Evans' return - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted the offer. Tranmere chairman Mark Palios claimed the League Two club turned down an approach from associates of Evans' about the possibility of him playing for the club, before League One Oldham last month denied reports they had offered Evans the opportunity to train with the club.","Ched Evans convicted of rape in 2012 and released from prison in October .

"Olive oil may be good for your heart – but it could soon be taking quite a toll on your wallet. Prices are set to soar because of poor harvests in Spain, where hot, dry weather affected trees during the flowering season. Bottlers are paying up to 40 per cent more for their oil than in May, trade magazine The Grocer said. Industry experts fear Spain's olive oil crop for 2014-2015 could be half the size of last year’s bumper harvest  because of hot and dry conditions . Industry experts fear the country’s crop for 2014-2015 could be half the size of last year’s bumper harvest. Olive oil has gained hugely in popularity as health-conscious families switch to Mediterranean diets. Commodity analysts Mintec said it was too early to assess what the full impact would be. But one supplier told The Grocer: ‘Currently it is very difficult to purchase wholesale bulk olive oil in Spain as producers are withholding stock in anticipation of higher prices later in the year.’ Supplies of olive oil in Italy have also been greatly reduced by hostile bacteria destroying trees. The microbe, first identified in the Americas and never before seen in Europe, had infected 800,000 trees in Salento, in Puglia in, southern Italy, it was reported last month. Puglia produces about 11million tonnes of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop and some of the country's best oils. By mid-August the disease, Xylella fastidiosa, had cost the olive oil industry an estimated £200m. A hostile bacteria - Xylella fastidiosa - seen in Europe for the first time, is destroying centuries-old olive trees and threatening supplies of Italian oil (file picture) Below is a summary of the Italian virgin olive oil market worldwide, according to Unaprol (organisation of Italian oil producers), showing the main importing countries: . USA: Italy holds a market share of 51 per cent, with exports up two per cent in 2013. AUSTRIA: Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 48 per cent share. BRAZIL: Italy is the fourth-largest virgin oil supplier to Brazil with seven per cent of the market, following Portugal, Spain and Argentina. CANADA: Italy is in pole position with a market share of 70 per cent in 2013. CHINA: Italy is the second-largest virgin oil supplier. In 2013, the market share was 21 per cent.

"Hero: Veteran Thomas Wells, 94, has been called to the French Embassy in London where he will receive the Legion d'Honneur for bravely helping soldiers and civilians during the evacuation of Dunkirk . A soldier who risked his life saving others at Dunkirk beach during the Second World War has won one of the most prestigious military honours in the world. Veteran Thomas Wells, 94, has been called to the French Embassy in London, where he will receive the Legion d’Honneur for his wartime service to the French. The retired North East Ambulance Service instructor, who lives in Walkergate in Newcastle, treated French and Belgian civilians and soldiers during the evacuation of Dunkirk as shells rained down around him. After treating the wounded, the young Royal Army Medical Corps soldier  used his helmet as a paddle on a rowing boat, only just managing to get himself to safety on an English merchant navy ship in the English Channel. 'When you’re a medic you treat anyone, it doesn’t matter whose army,' he said. 'That’s the Geneva Convention.' 'It was the civilians I felt sorry for, they had to leave their homes with all with their bags on their backs and they were at risk of being gunned down too and many were.' 'For three days we were paddling out back and forth with our helmets on this rowing boat. We were getting shelled all the time. 'We had just made it onto the merchant ship when a bomb went down the funnel and killed the man sitting next to me.' His escape at Dunkirk followed a gruelling eight day walk by foot from Brussels with 149 Northumbrian Field Ambulance service, who he had joined in 1937. Yet just two years later the great-grandad was captured while serving in North Africa and, after a spell in an Italian prison camp, escaped a German camp in the dead of night - on a bicycle. Between 1942 and 1945 he was held at the German prisoner of war camp, where he was forced to break down tonnes of granite a day in a quarry. Brave: Mr Well's regiment, the 149 Northumbrian Field Ambulance . Stoic: As well as his brave service at Normandy, Mr Wells also spent three years in a German prisoner of war camp. He escaped on a bicycle and was found by American troops . One night after he finished his shift and was being moved back to camp he managed to sneak off and spotted the bike against a wall. He said: 'Someone must have been looking down on my that night. It wasn’t planned I just saw it and rode off for five or six miles in the pitch black in the direction of shelling which I thought must be the Americans.

Humble at . receiving his honour from the French, he said he will accept it as a . representative of all who served with him during his time in the army. He . said: 'I feel like I’m a custodian of 149 Field Ambulance. This is for . us collectively because the men were all brilliant. 'We lost a lot of . lads as well.'

Home to happiness: He married his late wife Joan in 1947. Mr Wells is accepting the award on behalf of the men he served with . Men wait in an orderly fashion for their turn to be rescued during the evacuation of Dunkirk. Thousands of seaworthy vessels in Britain, from Channel ferries to fishing boats, private yachts to sailing dinghies, crossed the Channel to bring the men home . After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to help defend France. In May 1940, three German Panzer corps attacked France through the Ardennes and quickly advanced to the English Channel. By May 21, the German forces had trapped the BEF and the remains of the French and Belgian armies in an area along the northern coast of France. The British force retreated to Dunkirk as it was the best site for an evacuation and the Battle of Dunkirk raged between May 26 and June 4 1940. However, in one of the most bizarre military manoeuvres of the war, the Nazis halted their final advance. This gave the allies three days to plan their escape and arrange the evacuation of 330,000 troops. Described as a 'miracle of deliverance' by wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, the evacuation is seen as one of several events in 1940 that determined the eventual outcome of the war. The mission, dubbed Operation Dynamo, saw hosts of pleasure boats and other small craft join warships to rescue the stranded troops, who had been pushed back by Axis forces.","Thomas Wells treated French and Belgian soldiers and civilians under fire .

"Jose Mourinho says that the additional games on New Year’s Day for Premier League clubs could make this FA Cup third round one of the most exciting yet. Mourinho, who won the FA Cup with Chelsea in 2007, will make extensive changes for the game against Watford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. And the Chelsea manager says that the fact that the Football League clubs did not have a game on New Year’s Day, unlike the Premier League, means that the ties will be evened up. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mourinho on squad rotation ahead of Watford cup tie . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says FA Cup shocks are more likely due to the Premier League's busy fixture list . Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Cahill, Filipe Luis; Mikel, Matic; Schurrle, Oscar, Willian; Drogba . ‘The Championship clubs will be in a better condition than the Premier League clubs,’ said Mourinho. ‘But at the same time normally the Premier League clubs have more potential and more qualities, so maybe it’s a way to make things level. One team has more quality and another team is fresh and ready for the game so maybe this is a way to level things between Premier League teams and the Championship teams. ‘We don’t have to analyse whether it’s fair or not fair – it’s the way it is. In relation to fixtures and accumulation of matches and fatigue and this kind of thing, it is the way it is, so we have to accept that.’ And Mourinho has refused to use the exceptionally-busy Christmas period for the Premier League, which sees Chelsea playing their fifth game in 15 days on Sunday, as an excuse for the 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on New Year’s Day. Chelsea host Watford in the FA Cup  on Sunday, after their 5-3 league defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day . ‘It the same for everybody,’ said Mourinho. ‘When it’s for everybody, you have to accept it. You know it’s difficult for the players but it is not difficult for my players, it is difficult for every player. My respect to every player of every club because it’s hard to do it. It’s the only country where they do it (the Christmas fixtures) and they do it with lots of pride. Eden Hazard and Diego Costa are among the stars likely to be rested but nevertheless Mourinho has repeated his call for referees to protect the Belgian star, who he says he is being targeted by Premier League defenders. ‘The first free kicks of every game is somebody kicking him,’ said Mourinho. ‘He has fouls and fouls and fouls. I don’t see many yellow cards. Sometimes the yellow cards are the consequence of violent conduct but I also think that the accumulation of small fouls is violent conduct. ‘And he is suffering the consequences of that but playing amazingly well and against Tottenham he was amazing even with the second half and a difficult result to face, to have the determination to keep believing to the end, he was fantastic.’ Mourinho was furious at the treatment he felt Eden Hazard was receiving during Chelsea's loss at Spurs .","Chelsea host Watford in the FA Cup third round on Sunday afternoon .

"Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo have held talks with French coach Loic Courteau about him joining the former Wimbledon champion’s team next year. The 50-year-old well-respected Frenchman is seen as having the credentials to add a wealth of experience to Murray’s staff after the departures this year of eight-time Grand Slam winner Ivan Lendl and long-term coach and friend Dani Vallverdu. Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo are looking at potential new additions to the coaching team . Loic Courteau worked with Mauresmo during her own career at the top of women's tennis . Courteau is a former coach and still a confidant of Mauresmo and helped guide the French two-time major winner to world No 1 in her own illustrious career. Courteau is currently coaching another Frenchman, the world No 25 Julien Benneteau, and has nurtured him to an Indian summer in his career. But he is said to be open to the idea of teaming up with Murray in 2015. Murray started working with Frenchwoman Mauresmo ahead of Wimbledon in June 2014 . Benneteau is 33 and, while Courteau is committed to working with him at next month’s Australian Open, it is possible he could be persuaded to switch to Team Murray after that. Such a move would further entrench world No 6 Murray’s relationship with coach Mauresmo. The 27-year-old Scot’s support group is currently looking somewhat depleted after Venezuelan Vallverdu left to coach Murray’s Czech rival Tomas Berdych and his long-term fitness trainer and good friend Jez Green also departed for pastures new.","Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo looking to add to coaching team .

"A quick message from Lewis Hamilton before he flew back to Los Angeles: I love Britain and Britain loves me. It was late on Sunday night and the Formula One world champion was clearly in a state of shock after beating Rory McIlroy to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. The bookmakers, and most pundits, had not given him a prayer and he had believed them. VIDEO Scroll down for Lewis Hamilton wins Sports Personality of the Year 2014 . Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton faced a furious backlash last night as he was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the year, beating golfer Rory McIlroy (right) and distance runner Jo Pavey (left) Hamilton posted a picture on Instagram with his award alongside his dog Roscoe . Before being driven away in a silver Mercedes from the ceremony in Glasgow’s Hydro en route to his private jet and a skiing holiday in the States, he said: ‘I’ve obviously seen stories. I’m aware of ups and downs of negativity and positivity within the Press and I’m sure it’s not easy for people watching on TV to understand who someone is. ‘It’s not until I meet people that things change.’ Hamilton, who lives in tax exile in Monaco, added: ‘I didn’t know how popular I was here. People realise I do raise the flag proudly. ‘I don’t know how many people called in, but I’m just overwhelmed.’ Within minutes of receiving the award amid a standing ovation from guests at the event in Glasgow, the racing driver was being attacked on social media sites such as Twitter for his status as a tax exile . During his speech, Hamilton said his family were his inspiration and paused to hug his brother Nicholas (right) Hamilton won 209,920 votes to McIlroy’s 123,745. Jo Pavey, the European 10,000 metres champion, got 99,913. The total cast was 620,932. What do the figures tell us? That the enthusiasm for neither candidate went off the dial. Last year Andy Murray won with 401,470 votes, despite fewer people watching the programme than this year (5.6m on average compared with 6m). McIlroy’s support on Sunday would have put him fifth in 2012, though that was Olympic year and competition was fierce. So why was his vote so low? Several possibilities: golf’s audience is older and less engaged than Formula One’s; Middle England did not like him choosing to play for Ireland in the Rio Olympics; the apparently ungallant manner of his break-up from tennis star Caroline Wozniacki; and, whisper the heresy, the possibility that Formula One is more popular than golf (this was the sixth time a Formula One driver has won Sports Personality against twice by a golfer)? McIlroy was disappointed afterwards, but spoke graciously. Asked about his Irish affiliation, he said: ‘I don’t think it’s a question of how British I feel. It’s a question of how people view me. Look, it’s a public vote and just because I declared for one country and not another doesn’t make a difference.’ Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet by his pet bulldog Roscoe . Roscoe certainly looked red carpet-ready, donning a large gold chain for the occasion . Roscoe looked at home on the red carpet, although Hamilton's other dog Coco was not present .

At the Australian Open I will be with him. With his experience he could work on his own,' said Courteau, who has been with him for five years.Â . Murray started working with Frenchwoman Mauresmo ahead of Wimbledon in June 2014 . Murray, who is currently finishing off a winter training stint in Miami, began working with Mauresmo in June and believes their arrangement will bear more fruit in 2015. His support team is currently looking somewhat depleted after Vallverdu quit to join Tomas Berdych and experienced trainer Jez Green also left. The Scot kicks off the new season next week with an exhibition in Abu Dhabi and then will represent Great Britain in the Hopman Cup in Perth ahead of the Australian Open.","French coach Loic Courteau has confirmed talks have taken place .

"Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph has lost his appeal against the red card he received in Sunday's draw with Sunderland. Delph became the third Villa player to be sent off in four games after being dismissed for a challenge on Jordi Gomez in the 0-0 Barclays Premier League stalemate with the Black Cats. The dismissal forced manager Paul Lambert to deny his side were a dirty team after Kieran Richardson and Gabby Agbonlahor - who had his red card against Manchester United rescinded - were also sent off this month.

The England midfielder is escorted off after becoming the third Villa player to see red in four games . But, even though Lambert said he thought the decision was 'harsh' and that the resulting three-game ban would be 'excessive', the club confirmed the decision had been upheld. The Football Association also confirmed it had upheld the ban, adding to its statement earlier in the day stating Newcastle's Papiss Cisse would serve a three-game ban for violent conduct. 'Meanwhile, a claim by Aston Villa that the suspension for a red card for Fabian Delph was excessive has been rejected by an FA Regulatory Commission,' their statement read. Gabriel Agbonlahor appealed to have his red card for a challenge on Ashley Young rescinded . Kieran Richardson (left) remonstrates after being sent off during Villa's 1-0 loss to West Brom . 'Delph was sent off for serious foul play against Sunderland on 28 December 2014. His three-match suspension will commence with immediate effect.' The 25-year-old former Leeds man will now miss crucial Premier League clashes with Crystal Palace and Leicester, as well as Villa's third-round FA Cup tie at home to Blackpool. Delph has been one of Lambert's most consistent players of the season and has broken into the England reckoning, making his debut in September's friendly victory over Norway and collecting two further caps in European Championship qualifiers.","Fabian Delph is suspended for three games after losing appeal .
