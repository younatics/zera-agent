"A man purported to be the notorious leader of the so-called Islamic State appeared at a mosque in Mosul, calling on people to carry out a holy war, according to witnesses and a video posted to the extremist group's website. A video promoted on social media sites tied to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria purports to show Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi leading Friday prayers at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, a move that comes weeks after ISIS seized control of Iraq's second-largest city. If it is al-Baghdadi, it would be one of the first known appearances of the militant leader to be captured on video. Very few images have been made public of al-Baghdadi. The Iraqi government has seen the video and is analyzing it, a spokesman in Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's office told CNN. The U.S. government also is looking into it. In the video, the man purported to be al-Baghdadi urges people to follow his call to create a ""caliphate,"" an Islamic state, in Iraq and Syria, and wage ""jihad"" during Ramadan -- the holy month of fasting for Muslims that began last week. ""God created us to worship him and spread his religion, and ordered us to fight his enemies for him and for religion,"" the man said. During the sermon, the man said Muslims are sinners if they did not seek this goal of establishing an Islamic state. Will al Qaeda fight ISIS Islamic state? ""I am being entrusted with this heavy burden and duty to be your imam, although I am not the best one among you,"" he said. ""Therefore, if you see me as righteous, you should help me and if you see me wrong, you should advise me and help me. Obey me as long as long as I obey God in ruling you. ...If I disobey God, then you are no longer obligated to obey me."" Al-Baghdadi's appearance comes days after ISIS declared him as the leader of its new ""caliphate,"" or Islamic state, extending from Aleppo in northeastern Syria to the Diyala province in Iraq. The extremist group also said it was changing its name from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria to ""the Islamic State."" CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, which shows dozens of people, including men who appear to be bodyguards, listening to the sermon and praying. Several automatic weapons are displayed near the man delivering the sermon. Al-Baghdadi was never identified by name, only as ""the emir of the believers,"" according to a woman who was at the mosque when he arrived. CNN is identifying the witness only as Bara'a out of a concern for her safety. ""It was a terrifying Friday,"" she said. The video identifies the man as Al-Khalifah Ibrahim, the name al-Baghdadi now goes by with his followers since ISIS declared the creation of the so-called ""Islamic State"" -- a move that enraged many Muslims. Four to five minutes before the sermon was to begin, the imam at the mosque was told, in front of followers, to step down, Bara'a told CNN. Then, black vehicles with blacked-out windows pulled up out front of the mosque, she said. The men who got out of the vehicles were chanting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great) as they walked in. ""The emir of the believers, he will give the sermon,"" said one of the men who arrived with al-Baghdadi. ""So listen to him."" Those who accompanied al-Baghdadi took over the first row in the mosque, she said. In the video, the faces of the people in that row are blurred. Bara'a was sitting on the second floor of the mosque, an area designated for women to gather during the sermon. ""We were crying quietly, fearing they will figure out we were crying out of fear and that they would harm us,"" she said. ""We were kept in the mosque for an hour. There were a number of gunmen who blocked the door."" Very little is known about al-Baghdadi, but a biography posted on jihadist websites last year said he earned a doctorate in Islamic studies from a university in Baghdad. He formed the militant group in Salaheddin and Diyala provinces north of the Iraqi capital before joining al Qaeda in Iraq. Al-Baghdadi was detained for four years in Camp Bucca, which was a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq. He was released in 2009.","Video refers to speaker as Al-Khalifah Ibrahim, a name he goes by with followers .

"(CNN)Nearly every piece of plastic still exists on Earth, regardless of whether it's been recycled, broken down into microscopic bits or discarded in the ocean. And the world keeps producing more of the material -- creating 288 million metric tons of it in 2012. About 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons of it end up in the oceans in 2010, according to a new estimate published in the journal Science. That report released Thursday ranks countries that generate the most plastic debris into the oceans, with Asian nations taking 13 out of the top 20 spots. Using World Bank data on 192 coastal countries, researchers estimated that China, the most populous nation, has the most mismanaged plastic waste per year and also generates the most plastic debris that end up in the ocean at 28%. Mismanaged waste means the material is littered or not properly disposed of-- meaning there isn't a formally managed waste management system. ""The study is not to point fingers at people, it wasn't to focus on the countries,""  said lead author Jenna Jambeck. ""The purpose was to make a global estimate."" But the data set Jambeck and the seven co-authors used was only available on a country-by-country level. Eight of the top 10 countries with mismanaged plastic waste are in Asia. ""Many of them are middle-income countries with rapidly growing economy,"" said Jambeck of the University of Georgia. ""They have also large coastal populations, they have high levels of mismanaged waste, they have trouble keeping up with infrastructure."" The United States also cracked the top 20 and had a higher rate of waste generation per person at 5.6 pounds per person than China (2.4 pounds). Low-income countries were less likely to end up on the list, because of less waste, Jambeck said. Since 1974, the world has undergone a 620% increase in plastic production, according to the researchers. ""When the waste was natural material, we could leave it and not think about it,"" Jambeck said.  ""Even disposing of it in the land was fine, but plastic has increased 650% in the last 40 years. ""It's a wake-up call. We need to look at this and the way we're collecting and containing our waste."" Plastic waste discarded in the ocean raises a number of concerns, scientists say. It may damage ecosystems and marine animals, contaminate our food supply, and lead to chemical leaching. Estimates of the time it takes to degrade plastic range from hundreds to thousands of years -- and because plastic has only been around for 100 years, there hasn't been enough time to observe the process, says Darby Hoover, senior resource specialist at Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Meanwhile, plastic waste keeps on growing with more people and more consumption, the report authors wrote. ""All that consumption is growing, unfortunately the waste management systems around the world are not keeping pace as quickly as the consumption and products -- there's a big mismatch,"" said Doug Woodring, who was not involved in the study but has worked on the issue of plastics waste  at the Ocean Recovery Alliance in Hong Kong. Last year, one study in the journal PLOS estimated that a minimum of 5.25 trillion floating plastic particles weighing 268,940 tons are in the ocean. This estimate included only surface plastics, and not the materials that have sunk. ""A lot of people think of an island of floating garbage, people envision that there are forms of an island you can see on Google Earth -- it's much more diffuse than that,"" Hoover said. "" All of our oceans are plastic soups- everywhere you can go."" Environmentalists have criticized the rampant use of plastics in packaging that are only used once and then discarded. The solutions have to be both local and global, Jambeck said. ""It's everybody's responsibility. Of course, don't litter and prioritize using reusables,"" Hoover said. ""At the same time there's a responsibility on companies who produce the products found in oceans, to make sure the materials they produce are recyclable, get recycled and look for ways to improve the infrastructure."" While China topped the list in the report, the country has made some efforts to curb waste. In 2008, China banned free plastic bags and five years later, banned the import of poorly sorted recyclables from other countries including the U.S. There are some successful models, said Woodring. For example, Taiwan places a surcharge on plastics sold on a company level and it pays for the sorting, capturing, cleaning and recycling. However, some countries lack infrastructure for waste management and recycling.","Research estimates amount of plastic going from land to ocean .

"(CNN)In Abidjan, hair can be a contentious topic. Many Ivorians are persuaded to eschew their natural hair in favor of chemical straighteners, wigs and extensions. Afros and dreadlocks are rarely depicted on local television, and those that wear their hair naturally can be shunned from their offices. ""I have one friend who has natural hair, and she has to wear a wig to work. They will not even let her inside the building with natural hair,"" says Azi Oyourou, founder of Re-Zen Up, one of the few salons in the capital that specializes in natural hair styles. The tide is slowly starting to turn, however, thanks in part to the efforts of a community movement, Nappys de Babi. The group currently hosts bi-monthly meet-ups where participants exchange stories and tips on how best to care for natural hair. ""My hair was breaking and one day I just decided to clip it. It was something I just did for myself with no motivation to start a movement,"" says Mariam Diaby, the group's founder. ""When I started the group, I just started with three or five friends who were wearing their hair natural. We added another friend, and another, and in three months we were about 200. Today we are a group of 8,500."" Since then, the movement has become mainly one of encouragement (Daiby has reappropriated the word ""nappy"" to be a mash-up of ""natural"" and ""happy"", while Babi is shorthand for Abidjan). Earlier this year, members around the world sent in clips of themselves dancing to Pharrell Williams' ""Happy."" Still, those embracing their natural locks continue to face resistance from the community at large. Bibi Gnagno writes a blog on the subject and has launched a natural hair consultancy and product line in Abidjan. American-born, the Ivory Coast transplant was fascinated with local perceptions of natural hair so much that she's in the process of filming a documentary, titled ""Is that (all) your hair?"" Gnagno has interviewed dozens of women about their attitudes regarding their hair. ""I ask women, 'Now that you've gone natural, what comments do you get?' For some of them, it's: 'What's wrong with you? Do you not have enough money to go to a salon? Did your husband leave you? Go get a perm,'"" she says. ""It's starting to change slowly but surely, but it's not as rampant as it is in the States. But it's on its way,"" she adds. There is also still a lot of misinformation about what's involved in caring for natural hair. Many locals concede that the knowledge has been lost, no longer passed down from mother-to-daughter. ""It's strange, because in Africa, people are supposed to know their own hair, but we don't most of the time,"" notes Oyourou, who says that girls start using relaxer as early as three-years old. Gnagno says reasons for this could be myriad. The media could play a role, as could the colonial legacy (the Ivory Coast was a French colony from 1843 to 1960). ""Under colonization a lot of things happen. You want to get closer to the colonizer because that's the person that holds the power, so you let go of a lot of things that resemble your culture,"" she surmises. As to why the time is suddenly ripe for a natural hair movement, Oyourou ties it to a larger trend of national pride. ""In the past few years, more people want to know about their traditions and what they have,"" she says. ""You see this with people who have been studying in France or the UK. When they come back, some people ask them, 'Why did you come back? You should have stayed there.' But the people that came back love their country. They want to develop their own country and learn more about it, and this is the same mind set that's made it possible for people to change their hair."" Mainly, though, the movement is about empowerment, says Gnagno, and about making women (and some men) feel better about themselves. ""I think hair and self esteem are linked. I know my own self-worth as a black woman has been linked to my hair and I developed more self-confidence when I started wearing it natural,"" she says.","Natural hair movement Nappys de Babi is growing in Ivory Coast .

"(CNN)I still remember sitting on the set of ""Crossfire"" that day in 2004 as the floor manager counted down to blastoff. I was thinking: ""Jon Stewart, wow. I hope Diane is watching.""  My wife, truth be told, rarely watched ""Crossfire,"" but she rarely missed ""The Daily Show."" By the time Stewart finished disemboweling my show, I was hoping she wasn't watching. From my perspective, the show that day was a debacle. I was unprepared for the onslaught since Stewart had recently been on ""Hannity & Colmes"" (Fox News' truly awful knockoff of ""Crossfire""), and had not attacked that show at all. But he had a different agenda this day. I thought his charge that a 30-minute debate show was ""hurting America"" was fatuous. But I love direct confrontation (obviously).  And I was not defensive because, as a former senior White House official, I know that being a cable TV host would never be the most important thing I do in my career. So I was actually interested in hearing Stewart's full critique of ""Crossfire."" I heard that full critique eventually, but the audience never did. The show went off the rails and Stewart, who began by denouncing our hostile environment, was within minutes calling Tucker Carlson ""a dick."" So he never got to deliver his thoughtful, insightful criticism of our show -- until after the cameras were turned off. When the show ended, Stewart and his executive producer, Ben Karlin, sat with me and ""Crossfire's"" executive producer, Sam Feist, for 90 minutes. We had the kind of thoughtful, respectful dialogue that our audience deserved but never got. It has been 10 years, and I do not have contemporaneous notes. And, as we have been reminded recently, memory is a tricky and unreliable resource. Still, this is what I remember from our chat: . Stewart thought it was absurd to pretend every issue could be reduced to a forced choice between the right and the left. I thought that was a good point. Some issues have seven sides, but better to air two than none. How Jon Stewart changed politics . Then he said we deliberately booked the show to provoke division. Guilty. A discussion of religion, for example, would feature a debate between, say, the Revs. Jerry Falwell and Al Sharpton, when the truth is most believers fall somewhere in between. His criticism stung because I agreed this was a major shortcoming of our program. Stewart's third point, though, is where we parted company. I asked him how he would organize a show like ours. He suggested that, on Social Security, for example, rather than two opposing politicians, we should get the nation's foremost expert -- say, from Harvard -- and ask him or her what should be done to shore up our retirement system. I told him that was silly, forgetting that this is precisely what he tries to do with his ""Daily Show"" interviews. This is not sophomore philosophy, I told him. There is no objective, Platonic truth. Some people, like me, believe retirement should be partly socialized. Others, such as Tucker Carlson, believe in a purely private system: If you don't save for your own retirement, your neighbor has no obligation to bail you out. Both arguments have roots in the American spirit: We are at once wonderfully communitarian and intensely individualistic. I felt then -- and now -- that rather than pretend there is not a major philosophical difference, or that there is one objectively perfect solution, we should debate our policy options vigorously. Jon Stewart's top 5 political moments . I still think Stewart's version of politics is naive. Washington is not -- and should not be -- the Holland Tunnel, where each side each takes a turn. Giving John Boehner control of the House on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and Nancy Pelosi the gavel on Tuesdays and Thursdays would be madness. The Founders designed the system to create conflict: that's why we have three equal branches of government, each checking the other. And yet Stewart did have a point about excessive partisanship. He called me a hack -- which I am, if by ""hack"" you mean someone who is a true believer in a particular political worldview. I believe deeply in the Democratic Party's vision for America -- and yet I also believe there is a time for bipartisan cooperation, and was proud to work for President Bill Clinton as he pursued many bipartisan efforts. Then and now I believed we needed more partisanship, not less, in the run-up to the Iraq War. I was a vociferous, bitter opponent of George W. Bush's war. What hurt America is that too few people were yelling about the looming disaster; too many were cowed into going along with the bipartisan consensus that we should send other people's sons and daughters to fight against a country that posed no threat to America. I am proud I was a loud voice of opposition. As I recall it, Stewart heard me out earnestly. Despite the televised food fight we'd just been in, he was gracious and respectful, curious and thoughtful. As he got up to leave, he left us with this moment of Zen: ""Imus came to Washington and bashed you guys, and he got like 300 new stations. So I think this will work out for me."" It did. It also worked out for me. CNN canceled ""Crossfire"" but has kept me on as a contributor, a role that I prefer. It gives me far more freedom than ""Crossfire"" did. Rather than always narrowly toeing the party line, I am more free to criticize my people, for example, when President Barack Obama failed to go to the Mexican border to see the child immigration crisis firsthand. I have not spoken to Jon Stewart since that day. I ran into him in a hotel lobby once, and he darted away like he'd seen a ghost. When I had a book I wanted to plug on his show, he wouldn't take my call. But I have remained an avid fan of ""The Daily Show,"" and will miss his searing, satirical wit. Even though he no doubt can't stand me, I stand by my introduction of Stewart that day on ""Crossfire"":  He is both the smartest funnyman on TV and the funniest smart man on TV.","Paul Begala co-hosted show where Jon Stewart launched attack on ""Crossfire""

"Former White House press secretary James Brady's death this week was directly related to wounds he sustained in the 1981 attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan, and authorities are now investigating it as a homicide, police told CNN on Friday.

But a Virginia medical examiner has ruled the case a homicide, prompting a new investigation, Metropolitan Police spokeswoman Gwen Crump said.

John Hinckley, the lone gunman who fired the shots that wounded Reagan, Brady, a police officer and a Secret Service agent outside a Washington hotel, was found not guilty by reason of insanity. He has spent the ensuing years in a psychiatric hospital.

"(CNN)A couple of weeks ago, the rally cry that had been bubbling in the wake of ""The Imitation Game"" suddenly grew louder. Matt Breen, editor-in-chief of The Advocate and one of the most impassioned, trustworthy voices out there when it comes to politics and civil liberties, started a petition. Visit Pardon49k.org and you'll see that it's gathered more than 272,000 signatures already and counting. Its call to action: a plea to the British government to grant pardons to the estimated 49,000 men who were convicted under the UK's anti-gay laws, just as Alan Turing -- the computer scientist and World War II codebreaker -- was in the 1950s. Truth be told, most apologies given would be posthumous like the one Turing received from Gordon Brown and Queen Elizabeth II a few years back. But to ignore the injustice they all suffered just because they're not there to hear us is to ignore history, do further injustice to their families, and that's something we quite simply cannot do. Hearing of the overwhelming response that Matt's petition was receiving, outspoken gay actor/comedian Stephen Fry echoed the sentiment at a London screening of the film. Members of Turing's family and the movie's cast joined Fry in drafting an open letter to Britain's political leaders, including David Cameron, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- insisting that those men deserved to have the stains of criminal conviction removed from their names. Benedict Cumberbatch, who so exquisitely plays Turing in the movie, said it best perhaps: ""Alan Turing was not only prosecuted, but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early, by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved, as all human beings do. Sixty years later, that same government claimed to ""forgive"" him by pardoning him. I find this deplorable, because Turing's actions did not warrant forgiveness -- theirs did -- and the 49,000 other prosecuted men deserve the same."" Indeed, part of what makes telling Turing's story so important is that thousands like him experienced the same cruelty as he did, enduring relentless discrimination simply for attempting to live complete, fulfilled lives. I've been a huge supporter of ""The Imitation Game"" from before its premiere and see it as this year's best film because, as I said, it so poignantly reminds us that we cannot ignore history. In minority communities like ours, we look to stories of legendary role models like Turing or Harvey Milk for inspiration. Instead of relying on oral traditions from family or friends, we must look to historians, artists, authors and moviemakers to help ensure that we remember where we came from. The heroes of our movement, alive or dead, are there to remind us of what we still need to strive towards. Turing's many achievements should have earned him royal accolades in the UK. His impact warranted no less than a Presidential Medal of Freedom or Nobel Peace Prize on this side of the Atlantic. The work he did helped to defeat the spread of fascism, and yet in return, the government took away his freedom. His persecution at the hands of their laws ended his life with pain and suffering. That same injustice was shared by close to 50,000 of our LGBT forebears, who selflessly accomplished feats that benefit us still today. ""The Imitation Game"" and efforts inspired by it, like Matt's petition, guarantee that Turing and men like him won't ever be forgotten.","Campaign grows to force UK government to pardon 49,000 men convicted under anti-gay laws .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)It started with a first-class aviation executive throwing a fit on a flight over her nuts. It ended Thursday with that former executive sentenced to jail for one year. Heather Cho was working for Korean Air on December 5 when, as a first-class passenger on an international flight, an attendant served her macadamia nuts in a bag. Cho wanted them on a plate and demanded that the plane go back to the gate at New York's JFK airport so a crew member could be kicked off the flight. A South Korean judge said that her actions threatened the development of the aviation industry and inconvenienced passengers, and ruled that she violated aviation law, changed a flight path and interfered with operations. Cho had the chief steward removed from the flight after the plane had left the gate. The flight arrived 11 minutes behind schedule. A year in jail may seem just as extreme as freaking out over nuts. But the flight attendant testified that she was pressured by another Korean Air manager to keep quiet about Cho's behavior. Prosecutors said during her trial that there was a systematic attempt to cover up the incident. The judge blasted Cho for her conduct, saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger, she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight. The case, dubbed ""nut rage,"" gripped South Korea, especially because Cho is the Korean Air chairman's daughter. There is growing resentment over the perceived privileges and nepotism for the families that control the country's top companies. Cho resigned as vice president at the company a few days after the incident and publicly apologized, saying she accepted ""full responsibility."" On Thursday, she appeared in court wearing a green prison uniform. She gazed downward. Her hair hung in her face. ""I don't know how to find forgiveness,"" she said. Park Chang-jin, the chief steward who was booted from the flight, has said the former executive treated crew members like ""feudal slaves."" Details of Cho's behavior on the flight have emerged. Park and Kim Do Hee, the flight attendant who served the nuts, had knelt in front of Cho in apology. Kim testified that Cho berated them about the service, and later shoved and cursed her. When the flight arrived in Korea, the flight attendant said another airline manager, Yeo Woon-jin, pressured her not to talk to investigators about Cho's physically abusing her and Park. Yeo was found guilty of interfering with an investigation. Following public fury over the December incident, Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho apologized to the flight attendants and the public. Asked in court in January if he knew that his daughter mistreated employees, he said, ""I just heard that she's strict with her workers."" CNN's KJ Kwon contributed to this report.","A former Korean Air executive is found guilty of violating aviation law after interrupting a flight over nuts .

"(CNN)It wasn't the screech of cannonballs, the thud of grappling hooks or the crack of muskets that most terrified the sailors of the Spanish Armada in the 16th century, but fire. The English vice-admiral Sir Francis Drake used fire ships -- aging hulks set ablaze and allowed to float freely into the Armada -- to devastating effect, forcing the Spanish ships to break formation. More than 400 years later, however, and fire is still one of the gravest threats to shipboard life. Old threat, new technology . Shipboard procedures such as fire drills, on-board alarms and locking fire doors may have gone a long way to mitigating the danger of fire at sea, but the US Navy is looking at new technology to help it battle the threat. Its latest solution is to send fire-resistant metal men into the smoky, red-hot holds of its fire-stricken warships, throwing fire retarding grenades and assessing damage with a camera that can see through smoke. Called the Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot (SAFFiR), the team at the Office of Naval Research (ONR) chose a humanoid-type robot as the best way of negotiating the narrow passageways, ladders and hatches (all designed for human mobility) of a modern ship. ""Every compartment and passageway on a ship is designed for human occupation and mobility,"" Dr Thomas McKenna, ONR program manager for human-robot interaction and cognitive neuroscience, told CNN. ""There are numerous barriers, like sills, that would block a wheeled robot. In addition, a humanoid robot can use firefighting gear designed for humans, such as protective coats, backpack fire suppressants, hand-held sensors and hose nozzles,"" he said . ""The long-term goal is to keep sailors from the danger of direct exposure to fire."" Shipboard fires, he said, throw up a different and more urgent set of problems than fires on land. ""Shipboard fires must be suppressed, whereas in many civilian fires, a building can be considered a loss and the focus might shift to containing the fire to prevent spread,"" he told CNN. ""On a ship, fire suppression is critical to the survival of the ship and its personnel; confined spaces, smoke, heat and gases can be a threat to humans."" Developed by researchers at Virginia Tech and sponsored by the ONR, the SAFFiR prototype was tested aboard the decommissioned warship USS Shadwell last year and unveiled at the Naval Future Force Science & Technology EXPO this month. Super-human range . SAFFiR stands 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 143 pounds. The unique mechanism design on the robot equips it with super-human range of motion to maneuver in complex spaces. The team equipped the robot with a suite of sensors that include a camera, a gas sensor and a stereo infrared camera that will allow it to find its way through the choking black smoke that would deter human firefighters. Its upper body has been designed to manipulate fire suppressing equipment and even to throw propelled extinguishing agent (PEAT) grenades. The robot, say developers, can handle a fire hose on its own. With enough battery power for 30 minutes of firefighting, SAFFiR is capable of walking in all directions, balancing in rough seas, and stepping around obstacles. ""Balancing on any type of terrain that's unstable - especially for bipedal robots - is very difficult,"" said Brian Lattimer, associate professor for mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech. ""Whole-body momentum control allows for the robot to optimize the locations of all of its joints so that it maintains its center of mass on uncertain and unstable surfaces."" Robot a team player . While the next generation of the robot will be designed with enhanced intelligence, communications capabilities and extended battery life, Lattimer said the robot would likely always take its orders from a human in a console. Despite this, the algorithms that are being developed would allow mobility and decision making by the robot as a team member. ""The robot has the ability to do autonomous tasks, but we have a human in the loop to allow an operator to intervene in any type of task that the robot's doing,"" he said.""We're working toward human-robot teams. It's what we call the hybrid force: humans and robots working together."" McKenna said that ultimately, SAFFiR could be used for a number of shipboard duties that are difficult or onerous for humans to perform. ""For instance, a bipedal robot could be configured to take shipboard measurements, scan for corrosion and leaks, and identify changes to the shape of the room from its original configuration,"" he said. ""By taking on these time-consuming tasks, SAFFiR could free up sailors for jobs that more fully take advantage of their training and technical skillsets."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"(CNN)A bad week for European football continued on Wednesday when world governing body FIFA announced it will not compensate clubs if the 2022 World Cup is moved to November-December. On Tuesday, Karl-Heinze Rummenigge, the chairman of the European Clubs' Association, said his organization's members wanted financial compensation following the proposed change. This was to cover the costs that Europe's clubs and leagues will spend on rescheduling their championships, many of which run between August and May. But FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke dashed those hopes when speaking in Qatar, the country that will host the 2022 finals. ""There will be no compensation. I mean, they have seven years to reorganize football around the world for this World Cup,"" the Frenchman told reporters. ""It is happening once and we are doing nothing that destroys football,"" he added. With concerns for both players and fans given the Qatari heat in June-July, a FIFA task force announced on Tuesday that the tournament should be played at the end of the year. Average temperatures in Qatar are around 25 degrees Celsius towards the end of the year, roughly 15 degrees lower than the traditional World Cup months. Valcke also said the duration of the competition would be reduced from 32 to 28 days. FIFA is expected to ratify the proposals when its Executive Committee meets in Zurich on 19-20 March. European clubs had been hoping for the tournament to be played at the start of 2022. ""UEFA and its National Associations had initially preferred for the 2022 FIFA World Cup to be held in January,"" the European governing body said in a statement. ""However, once the FIFA Task Force recommended to stage the competition from late November to late December 2022, UEFA suggested an option could be for the final to be played on December 23."" The English Premier League, whose chief executive Richard Scudamore said he was ""very disappointed"" by the switch, would prefer the final to be played earlier in order to maintain its traditional Christmas calendar, with matches having been played on December 26 for many decades. Meanwhile, Valcke suggested that the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, which normally takes place between January and February, will kick off in June because of the delay to the 2022 World Cup. The Confederation of African Football has yet to comment on the matter, having previously stated it will only readjust its calendar once FIFA has confirmed the dates for the Qatar tournament. In an unexpected move, FIFA announced that the 2021 Confederations Cup will not be held in Qatar. The tournament is often described as a World Cup warm-up given that it allows the host nation to fine tune its facilities and conduct a test run some 12 months before the main event. Valcke said the climate rules out Qatar and added that the tournament, which pits the World Cup holders against the hosts and champions of FIFA's six confederations, will be played ""in an Asian country,"" which has still to be determined.","FIFA states that European clubs will not receive any compensation following the proposal to play the 2022 World Cup in November-December.

"(CNN)Six heavily armed inmates who held their warden and a guard hostage at a prison in Taiwan have committed suicide after a dramatic 14-hour siege. The prisoners had broken into the prison's armory and seized a number of weapons, including rifles, handguns and more than 200 bullets, Justice Minister Lou Ying-shay told reporters Thursday. Warden Chen Shih-chih and the head of prison guards, Wang Shih-tsang, were found safe, according to the island's justice ministry. Officials said the six men turned their guns on themselves. The incident at the prison in the southern city of Kaohsiung unfolded at around 4 p.m. local time on Wednesday when the men grabbed a guard and member of the prison staff, the justice ministry told CNN. The six inmates all worked in the sewing factory and would have had access to scissors, the ministry said. The inmates pretended to be sick and went to the prison infirmary. While there, they grabbed the keys from prison staff but were unable to break out of the prison. They smashed their way into a room storing the prison's weapons instead. The facility's deputy warden, Lai Chen-jung, and head of guards, Wang, then offered themselves as hostages in exchange for the two held captive. The inmates then allowed Warden Chen to take the place of his deputy. The inmates, who were serving a range of sentences for crimes including murder, complained about their sentences, mistreatment at the jail, and the recent release of former President Chen Shui-bian on medical grounds, according to Taiwanese media reports. He was serving a 20-year sentence for corruption. One of the hostage takers, identified by Taiwanese media as Cheng Li-te, a member of a notorious criminal gang, issued a statement at around 11 p.m., which was read on Taiwanese television by Wu Hsien-chang, head of the Taiwan's Corrections Agency. In it, Cheng pleaded his innocence. ""I didn't kill anyone but I have to serve 18 years in prison. I'm not the only innocent inmate here. Who can speak out for us?"" He then complained that their monthly allowance of NT$200 (around US$6) was not even enough to buy underwear, and that prison inmates were denied the same chance of medical parole as former President Chen. The inmates demanded safe exit by car via a side door of the prison. The prison itself was locked down and surrounded by armed police, according to Taiwanese media, while relatives of the inmates were brought in to to assist with negotiations to secure the release of the hostages. Early on Thursday morning Deputy Justice Minister Chen Ming-tang reported that the hostages had been freed but that the six inmates had shot themselves. Warden Chen described how the inmates treated the hostages well, and seemed in good spirits throughout the siege -- even toasting each other before shooting themselves. He said Cheng and one of the other prisoners made sure their co-conspirators were dead before they shot themselves in the head. Chen Chun-hsiu, a senior prosecutor with the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors' Office, told reporters at a press conference Thursday that he spoke to Cheng during the standoff, and was told that he planned to end his own life. He added that he did not seem mentally stable. He said Cheng and the other inmates decided to take hostages to break out of the prison because they feared spending the rest of their lives incarcerated otherwise.

"(CNN)Jamie Brewer is about to make fashion history as the first model with Down syndrome to walk a runway during New York Fashion Week. Brewer, who is best known for the ""American Horror Story"" TV franchise, was recruited to strut her stuff Thursday for designer Carrie Hammer. ""Young girls and even young women ... (see me) and say, 'hey, if she can do it, so can I,' "" Brewer told Today.com. ""It's a true inspiration being a role model for any young women to (encourage them) in being who they are and showing who they are."" The actress/model is part of designer Hammer's Role Models Not Runway Models campaign, which highlights women making a difference. Hammer told Today she began the campaign a year ago when she was first asked to show her designs at Fashion Week. The designer said she wanted to represent the real women who make up her clientele and invited her friend Danielle Sheypuk, who uses a wheelchair, to be in her show. ""I called up my existing clients who were all incredible women, and one of them happened to be a doctor and a sex therapist who happened to be in wheelchair,"" Hammer told Today.com. ""It was never intended to be this incredible statement."" Hammer has designed a dress for Brewer, who is an advocate for those with intellectual disabilities, that she feels plays up her qualities as an actress and artist.

"(CNN)It's Anastasia Steele's graduation day, but all she can think about is Christian Grey, the powerful billionaire who wants to make her his sexual submissive. As he sits onstage, preparing to deliver a commencement speech, ""Christian stands out in his bespoke suit, copper highlights glinting in his hair under the auditorium lights. He looks so serious and self-contained,"" she thinks to herself. ""Ana,"" as she's known in E.L. James' erotic bestselling novel, watches Grey unbutton his single-breasted jacket, revealing the silk tie he used to bind her wrists to her headboard a few nights prior, and nearly loses it. Hot and bothered as she might be in her cap and gown, Ana does well to note that Grey, the title character from ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" would never be caught dead in an off-the-rack suit. If clothes make the man, ""this guy wouldn't have a brand,"" costume designer Mark Bridges said recently. Instead, Bridges commissioned Los Angeles bespoke tailor Johnathan Behr to build custom suits for actor Jamie Dornan, who plays the successful CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings with a sexual appetite for bondage and discipline in the film adaptation of the book, opening Friday. Behr's job was to translate Bridges' vision into suits befitting a young tycoon whose controlling demeanor imbues every aspect of his character. Behr knows the character well. Grey may be a fantasy, but he embodies the latest generation of men embracing the impeccably tailored suit as a status symbol. Bespoke tailoring tends to appeal to the Christian Grey type: a ""control freak,"" in Ana's words, who enjoys making personalized style choices with the help of a master tailor, creating a one-of-a-kind suit. As a costume designer, ""you're helping to tell story of the character, visually,"" said Hollywood costume designer Janie Bryant, who recommended Behr to Bridges for the ""Fifty Shades"" gig. ""You're seeing the whole character come to life through their costume,"" she said. Modern yet timeless . Behr knew little about the character or the production going into the job; even the film's title was kept secret before he met Dornan for the first time in November 2013. Bridges showed Behr a Canali suit ad from a fashion magazine, and Behr instantly understood the look: subtle, dark and elegant with a fitted, slim cut to show off Grey's sculpted physique, Behr said. ""No bold patterns, big shoulders or wide lapels. Just a very minimalist approach with a rich, dark, conservative color palette and timeless design,"" Behr said. Behind the covered windows of Behr's Wilshire Boulevard workshop, Dornan tried on seven suits made from lightweight Italian wool in five shades of gray, one brown, one French blue. The evolving color palette reflects Grey's softening attitude toward his young lover, Bridges told ELLE. While Behr went to work on the suits, Dornan worked with a trainer in Vancouver to physically prepare for the role of Grey, whose fitness obsession is another manifestation of his domineering character. By the time they met again four weeks later, Dornan's wiry frame had filled out, and things started to get tight, especially in the arms, Behr said. ""The look they were going for was very lean and tight, so it basically worked,"" Behr said. A tailor on location in Vancouver finished the seven suits, each of which bears characteristics of bespoke tailoring, a classic British style of suiting: a two-button, single-breasted, form-fitting coat with a 3-inch peak lapel, slanted lower flap pockets and side vents in back. The sleeves of the jacket are slim and tapered with working sleeve buttonholes, with about an inch of French cuff showing below the end of the sleeve, Behr said. ""The armholes were quite high, and the jacket was nipped in at the waist to give suppression, which makes the shoulder and chest line appear powerful, yet natural. The jacket length was short, just long enough to cover his bum,"" he said. The pants were skinny-legged, slim cuts with a low rise and tapered bottoms -- no cuffs, just a plain bottom with a touch of a break, he said. ""In short, the cut was modern yet timeless, elegant and quite conservative."" An era of personalization . Behr was a natural choice to dress the stylish billionaire. He has been making suits inspired by Savile Row for nearly 30 years. Well-heeled clients visit Behr's showroom for the customary four-step process of building a bespoke suit. Behr's path to bespoke tailoring began in his teens with a visit to high-end haberdasheries in San Francisco's Union Square. A light went off, and he vowed to one day own a store full of his own creations. At age 18, he commissioned his first bespoke suit and fell in love with the process. He undertook an apprenticeship with the Parisian-trained tailor who made his suit to learn the art of bespoke tailoring. Behr broke into Hollywood costume design thanks to Bryant, who hired him to build suits and coats for ""Mad Men"" Don Draper and Roger Sterling: power players like Grey who wear their control over others on their sleeves. Inspired in part by the sartorial elegance of ""Mad Men,"" the custom, tailored suit has been making a comeback in recent years on the red carpet and in the pages of fashion magazines. Classic suiting coincides with an era of personalization in which consumers can become ""co-creators"" of their own style, said Tom Julian, director of strategic business development for the Doneger Group, a fashion trend marketing group. ""There is a newfound appreciation of tailored clothing among millennials that brings in their point of view,"" he said. ""Especially for a guy who loves the technical aspect of how things are made, the more you engage them in the process, the more they like it, and they do it again."" Behr knows the type well: a man with a ""fanatical"" interest in his personal style who has the means to step up his game through custom or bespoke suiting. The difference between the two is often reflected in the price tag. In bespoke suiting, which typically starts in the four-figure range, a master tailor creates a unique pattern based on the client's preferences. Custom-made suits, which tend to start in the triple digits, are tailored to fit your body from an existing pattern. What's the appeal? The ability to steer the outcome, Behr said -- a characteristic that fans of the trilogy will immediately identify with Grey in his pursuit of naive Ana. ""Once a client has experience choosing their own fabric, lining and buttons and goes through the process of the basted fittings and the delivery of the finished product, they never go back to the ready-to-wear world,"" Behr said.

"(CNN)The rock stars of the '60s and '70s have, inevitably, gotten older. Many are now in their 70s; some have even passed on. Pattie Boyd still sees them as vigorous youths. ""I feel very lucky that I was part of that whole scene in the '60s and '70s,"" she says in a phone interview from her home in Britain. ""I love looking at the photographs because everyone was young, and they were so gorgeous to look at."" ""The photographs"" are the pictures that Boyd, 69, took of many of the era's notables -- including her former husbands, George Harrison and Eric Clapton. As Harrison's wife, she was there when the Beatles went through the frenzy of Beatlemania, the journeys of psychedelia and mysticism and the crumbling of their partnership. With Clapton -- who ardently pursued her for years -- she witnessed a guitarist at the peak of his solo fame as well as his struggle with addiction. She was married to Harrison from 1966 to 1977 and Clapton from 1979 to 1989. Boyd's photographs, including many of the Beatles and Clapton, went on display at the San Francisco Art Exchange on Tuesday and will remain on exhibit until March 15. The photos capture a rare intimacy and casualness. The Beatles are photographed on their 1968 visit to India, with the group looking relaxed and happy. In another picture, Clapton grins at fellow guitarist Freddie King in 1974. Then there's one of Harrison in the early '90s, clutching a ukulele -- a favorite instrument of the Beatles guitarist, who died in 2001. Some of the photographs only recently turned up, says Boyd. ""I'm quite a sloppy person as far as working out where all my negatives and slides are,"" she says. One of them pictures a group setting up the stage for ""The Last Waltz,"" the 1976 San Francisco concert filmed by Martin Scorsese. Boyd, who wrote a memoir in 2007, says there's some emotion underneath the pictures, even decades later. (After all, she inspired a number of songs on Clapton's ""Layla"" album, his way of channeling the anguish he felt for loving his best friend's wife.) But it's not necessarily sorrow or longing. The pictures also bring back a lot of happiness, she says. Many Harrison photos, particularly one from late 1967, show him at ease, before the agonies of the Beatles' business troubles took root. And Clapton never looks happier than when he's on stage: ""He never, never, never had stage nerves. In the middle of a conversation (he'd say), 'Oh, I've got to go on now,' and just walk on as if he were walking into his home."" She understands that -- despite time in front of the camera herself, as a model for the likes of David Bailey -- she'll probably always be looked at in the context of her famous mates. But that's OK. ""I can't rewrite history,"" she says. ""I'll always be linked to the Beatles, George and Eric."" It doesn't hurt, however, that she'll always see them as young and beautiful. ""We all get a bit older,"" she says, ""but, you know, I'm so glad that I have these photos.""","Pattie Boyd's photographs capture a rare intimacy and casualness of former husbands George Harrison and Eric Clapton .

"(CNN)Morocco is undeniably becoming a strategic platform to address the African continent. An increasing number of global companies choose to step in, first in Morocco, to then gain a faster access to other African markets. Its geographic proximity to Europe, its political stability and its competitive workforce constitute a powerful advantage. This is especially true for the aeronautics sub-contracting market. However, the country has still a long way to go to be among the top performers in this sector. The Moroccan aeronautics sector is enjoying an annual growth rate of 15% to 20% (with a slight softening to 13.8% in 2013 according to the Moroccan Office des Changes). Today, over 100 companies in the aeronautical sector are based there, employing over 8,000 people in total. This market is generating a turnover of around 800 million euros which represents 5% of Morocco's total exports, and the industry is one of the top priority sectors in Morocco's Industrial ""Emergence plan."" Factories are expanding and companies are recruiting to support their growth. According to the Moroccan Space and Aeronautical Industries Group, the sector is likely to double in size by 2020. Nevertheless, in order to become a heavyweight player in the sub-contracting market, Morocco will need to manufacture more complex components and improve its training programs to meet the needs of global aircraft manufacturers. Indeed, several countries are competing in the sub-contracting market such as Mexico, India or Malaysia. Even though the Moroccan aerospace and defense sector was in the worldwide top 8 recipients of inward investment between 2001 and 2011, some of its competitor countries offer lower-priced labor. Consequently, Morocco has to counterbalance by producing more complex parts and by improving the efficiency of its local supply chain (i.e. licensing local distributors). To become a key player and to attract global manufacturers, a significant pool of high-skilled personnel is required. The estimate is that 20,000 people will be needed by 2020 in this industry. This applies mostly to machinists and technicians levels, since there are already enough Moroccan engineers specialized in aeronautics. The Institute of Aeronautics Professions and the ISMALA were hence established to quickly redirect and complement Morocco's public sector educational system which was not taking aeronautics as a priority. Since then, more than 1,500 people have graduated from these institutes but aeronautics manufacturers still have to train young machinists in-house for an average of two years before they are completely up to speed. Another influential factor for Morocco's aeronautics industry future is Bombardier's on-going establishment in the country scheduled to open at the end of this year; first plant on the African continent enabling the company to sell several of its aircrafts, well suited for the continent needs. This location choice is not random, but largely due to Moroccan incentives and tax benefits (not revealed but said to be close to $20 million). This calculated move by the Moroccan authorities will have a big impact on the aeronautics industry and provide multiple business opportunities in this sector, especially for sub-contractors. The government also created a free zone for aeronautics companies close to Casablanca's airport. The American company Alcoa Fastening Systems has already chosen to set up there and will benefit from VAT and corporate tax exemption among other incentives. In 2012, Morocco's aeronautics exports exceeded its imports for the first time. The country has already achieved to attract several major global players but it seems that they are not yet planning to produce entire airplanes in the country. Morocco needs to overcome its training challenge and create more added-value to be able to succeed in the aeronautics sector. If it does, Morocco will have put Africa on the map of the aeronautics sector. More from Africa View . Read this: Tropical paradise with booming economy .

"(CNN)The police shooting death of a man who allegedly hurled rocks at vehicles and officers in Pasco, Washington, has sparked anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force. About 100 protesters marched outside Pasco City Hall Wednesday, with some chanting ""It was only a rock,"" CNN affiliate KEPR reported. Later in the evening, more protesters took to the intersection where the shooting occurred. Police say the man -- who was later identified as Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35 -- had allegedly been throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers. Officers attempted ""voice commands and low level force,"" and used a taser, police said, but those efforts were unsuccessful. After two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force. A video posted on YouTube shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. The video has had 170,000 views since Wednesday. Zambrano's family and protesters are pushing for answers. His cousins were in the crowd outside City Hall Wednesday.  They told reporters Zambrano wouldn't have been able to understand the commands. ""He didn't understand English and they were talking to him in English,"" one cousin said. ""Why not get a Hispanic officer?"" A witness, Juan Rodriguez, told KEPR that Zambrano was ""telling them to stop... but then the cops, they didn't listen and they just shot him. All three cops started shooting him."" The shooting is under investigation by other law enforcement agencies outside the Pasco Police Department, the department said in a statement, and the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. Franklin County Coroner Dan Blasdel said Zambrano's shooting death was the fourth fatal officer-involved shooting in the area in the past six months.  According to the Tri-City Herald, officers were cleared in the other three shootings. The coroner said his office would conduct a separate inquest in the Zambrano case with six community members after the law enforcement investigation is complete. ""I'm looking at doing an inquest because it's so controversial to the community,"" he told CNN. ""It takes the burden off the law enforcement and puts it in the hands of the citizens, and puts the facts in public. They can decide if it was justifiable based on the facts of the case."" The results of the law enforcement investigation will be sent to the Franklin County Prosecutor's office, which will consider whether to file charges against the officers. They were identified as Ryan Flanagan, a nine-year veteran; Adam Wright, a firearms instructor with eight years' experience; and Adrian Alaniz, who has two years on the job. The shooting comes in a period of strained police-community relations following the police-involved deaths last summer of Eric Garner, 43, on Staten Island in New York and Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri. The medical examiner ruled Garner's July 17 death a homicide due to compression of his neck and chest when he was taken down by an officer using a chokehold. His death sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the case. A few weeks later, Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown after an altercation in the street.  The death of Brown, who was unarmed, thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury declined to prosecute Wilson, a decision that led to national demonstrations.","Police shooting death of man who allegedly hurled rocks at cars and officers investigated .

"With President Barack Obama set to lay out his strategy to deal with ISIS on Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry left for the Middle East on an urgent new diplomatic drive with a single sales objective: Shore up support from Sunni Arabs to defeat what Kerry calls ISIS' ""genocidal agenda."" Kerry has said the United States will build ""the broadest possible coalition of partners around the globe to confront, degrade and ultimately defeat ISIS."" ""Almost every single country has a role to play in eliminating the threat and the evil that (ISIS) represents,"" Kerry said Tuesday before leaving on the trip that will take him to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The Obama administration has already gathered about 10 countries as part of a global coalition to beat back ISIS. But the strength of the coalition could hinge on whether it includes members from the Middle East, where ISIS poses the biggest threat. Obama laid out Kerry's marching orders during an interview last weekend with NBC News. ""I think that it is absolutely true that we're going to need Sunni states to step up, not just Saudi Arabia, our partners like Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey. They need to be involved. This is their neighborhood. The dangers that are posed are -- are more directed at them right now than they are us,"" Obama told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""And that's part of the conversation that John Kerry's going to be having this week"" Americans want efforts to dismantle ISIS to be undertaken by a coalition, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday; 60%  said Washington should undertake military action against ISIS ""only if other countries participate."" Kerry's Middle East strategy . In order to get a buy-in from Arab states, Kerry will take specific arguments to different countries. One key to his effort will be the new Iraqi government announced on Monday, which Kerry called a major milestone. Kerry hopes the new government will attract Sunni Arab help as it fights ISIS and bolster Sunni opposition to the group. The needs in any effort to defeat ISIS are great: military support, including air power, arms, training, and intelligence. U.S. officials say Arab partners will be asked to contribute what they can.  The effort was given a boost on Monday when the Arab league agreed to take urgent measures to combat ISIS and other extremist groups, reflecting a new sense of urgency in the region. Obama looking for for congressional support on ISIS . Kerry's coalition-building tour will first take him to Jordan, which borders both Iraq and Syria and is likely to play a major but discreet role in the coalition.  Jordan is already hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring Syria. In Saudi Arabia, Kerry will hold talks in Jeddah with the foreign ministers of six Gulf Arab states, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan. Kerry must also convince the Gulf allies to dry up funding to ISIS, which comes from many of their own nationals and stop the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria, considered the lifeblood of the group. Another critical aspect to this will be driving a wedge between Sunni Arabs and ISIS, and delegitimizing the group's ideology. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is seen as having a critical role to play in convincing other Sunni Arabs that ISIS is the enemy. The kingdom has been very effective in beating back al Qaeda in its territory, and officials and analysts say it has a unique religious credibility and legitimacy to combat ISIS now. There are already efforts within Middle East countries to root out extremists. Last week, Saudi Arabia arrested more than 80 extremists suspected of planning to carry out terrorist attacks both in the kingdom and abroad, and the UAE issued a statement last week saying it was ready to ""join the international community in an urgent, coordinated and sustained effort to confront a threat that will, if unchecked, have global ramifications for decades to come."" The UAE statement also called for a ""clear plan for direct intervention against ISIS."" Support, but slim chance for military intervention . But don't look for countries in the Middle East to join specifically with the United States and Western partners on a military campaign. Officials have downplayed suggestions of Arab military involvement, although have privately suggested even some minor participation from countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia would be important symbolic gestures about the need for Sunni Arab states to take responsibility in fighting extremism within their own region. What is unclear is whether Kerry, who visits the region the day after Obama delivers his speech laying out his strategy for combating ISIS, will make specific requests this week for a military campaign to combat the group in either Iraq or Syria. Arab diplomats say without concrete details on what type of military campaign the U.S. envisions, it will be hard for their leaders to sign up, no matter how badly they may want to. Another question is what happens after the campaign against ISIS. Arab diplomats say similar extremist groups are operating in Libya, the Sinai in Egypt and Yemen that pose a threat to the entire region and about which Washington and its Arab partners must have a conversation.  With its laser focus on ISIS, Arab diplomats complain the United States is not connecting the dots about the alarming trends in the region. ""Without a tacit understanding of how we are going to work at extremism in general, it's going to be tough to move ahead,"" one Arab diplomat said. ""You want us to join you in Iraq and Syria and then when we see a problem in Libya or Yemen or Egypt and you say forget it? I don't think that is how it's going to go. You can't be with us on one issue and be against us on another."" Which is why Kerry must carefully balance the concerns of a region nervous about a multitude of threats with the narrow U.S.  interests in combating ISIS. U.S. officials say a series of airstrikes last week against armed Islamist factions in Tripoli, Libya, were conducted by Egypt and the UAE. While neither country has acknowledged the action publicly, the move sent an important message to Washington that the region is ready to take measures into its own hands if the United States does not take their concerns into account. The U.S. saw competing Arab interests in aiding the Syria opposition contribute to the growth of extremists groups like ISIS. A similarly uncoordinated effort against the group could give birth to new, and potentially equally frightening, problems. Terror fears could help GOP in midterms .

"(CNN)The 2016 presidential race is just beginning. Yet we already can say this much: Despite a bump in the polls, and the fact that some conservatives consider him the prototype for successful leaders, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would be a terrible choice for the GOP nomination. Of course, Republicans have made bad choices before. A recent Des Moines Register survey found Walker to be the first pick of 15% of the GOP faithful likely to attend the Iowa Caucus. So why would Walker be a bad choice? Three reasons. The world is a dangerous place. We can't afford another commander-in-chief with no foreign policy experience who doesn't understand America's role in the world. As the governor of Wisconsin -- as opposed to U.S. senator (Rand Paul, Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz) or a former U.N. ambassador (John Bolton) -- Walker's diplomatic experience is limited to settling disputes with Minnesota during football season. He would be learning on the job while rogue actors like ISIS, Iran, Russia and North Korea threaten Americans, create unrest and perpetuate acts of terror. There are times to look to the states and elect leaders who can focus the nation's attention on domestic priorities like the economy, and there are times to look for leaders with a firm handle on foreign policy because the stakes are too high to gamble on that front. Guess which era we're living in. Built-in enemies are extra baggage. Walker has repeatedly fought organized labor in Wisconsin -- over collective bargaining, an attempted recall, running for re-election -- and scored impressive victories. But Walker has also antagonized that special interest, which will spend tens of millions of dollars in the presidential election to settle the score. Unions might otherwise feel ambivalent about a Hillary Clinton candidacy, especially with the prospect of an insurgent campaign by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who would likely embrace more firmly the divisive rhetoric about income equality that union members love to hear. If Walker is the GOP nominee, ambivalence will be trumped by anger. An activated and animated base of union supporters throwing money at the Democrats is a headache that Republicans don't need. Finally, courage matters. Walker is not eager to grab hold of thorny issues. On immigration, he likes sound bites, declaring his opposition to ""amnesty"" and his support for ""securing the border."" He uses platitudes about how ours is ""a country both of immigrants and of laws."" During a recent appearance on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos,"" host Martha Raddatz asked Walker what he would do about the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. The governor responded that, while he didn't support the immigration bills in Congress, he did think the debate needs a ""healthy balance"" and he was not ""advocating"" the deportation of all illegal immigrants. Finally, he said, ""we need to enforce the laws in the United States, and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country, and that does not mean amnesty."" Clear as mud, eh? Walker also has difficulty on common-sense issues that should not be all that thorny, like evolution. On a trip to London this week, presumably intended to beef up his ""foreign policy credentials,"" the governor bobbled a question on the topic and had to issue a follow-up statement. The only benefit that Republicans could reap from nominating Walker is that, while he is probably not ready to lead the country, he could settle an argument within the party that the GOP must resolve and put behind it if Republicans are ever going to win another presidential election. Most of the conservatives I know who think Walker should be the GOP nominee are convinced that Republicans keep making the same mistake of nominating moderates. The secret to beating Democrats, they say, is to draw contrasts and stay true to conservative principles. Republicans are confused: Do they nominate a moderate with wider appeal or a ""true conservative"" loyal to the party's principles? The way that those on the far right see it, they've failed twice with a moderate nominee (Sen. John McCain of Arizona in 2008, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012). If the party nominates another moderate in 2016 (former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former New York Gov. George Pataki, etc.), and loses again, that faction will continue to delude itself into thinking that the GOP must nominate a rigid conservative to win. There is only one cure for this delusion: Republicans need to scratch that itch and nominate a person they believe to be a strong conservative. Walker will do nicely. And when they nominate him, and lose anyway, they can put this argument to rest. Republicans will have run out of excuses. Only then, can they achieve the epiphany that could save them from going the way of the Whigs: Voters aren't just rejecting the GOP's messenger but its message. To many Americans, Republicans are mean-spirited, intolerant, xenophobic and reactionary obstructionists who care only about the rich, preserving the status quo and protecting the majority, and who are better at explaining what they're against than spelling out what they're for. Much of what we hear from Republican candidates -- especially those trying to woo conservative voters -- reinforces that perception. If the GOP crafts a better message, it won't have to worry so much about choosing the right messenger. But first, the party has an argument to settle. So, at the moment, there is only one message that matters: Run Walker, Run.","Navarrette: Walker doesn't have the foreign policy credentials or the courage needed for today's era.
He says the only plus if he's nominated is that it would prove America doesn't want a hard-right president ."
"Minsk, Belarus (CNN)The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany have signed up to a peace plan after lengthy talks, raising hopes that the brutal conflict in eastern Ukraine could be brought to a close. Despite the hopes, some European leaders have voiced skepticism -- after all, a previous peace plan agreed to in September disintegrated amid continued fighting. So now the leaders have struck a new deal in Minsk, Belarus, what happens next? Between now and Saturday night, we can expect to see continued fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and separatist forces. Under the terms of the agreement, the ceasefire line for the Ukrainians is the current front line and for the separatists it's the front line as it was at the time of the previous deal on September 19. This represents a territorial gain for the separatists since September. The separatists may seek to make a push over the next 2½ days to try to win more territory. It's not clear what will happen in the strategically important town of Debaltseve, where rebel fighters currently have Ukrainian forces almost surrounded after days of fierce fighting. An ""immediate and comprehensive"" ceasefire is due to come into effect from midnight Saturday into Sunday local time. The withdrawal of heavy weapons by both sides should begin no later than the next day after the ceasefire (Monday), according to the agreement. It should take no longer than 14 days. The Ukrainian forces must pull back their artillery of 100 millimeters or greater caliber by 25 kilometers (15½ miles) from the current front line, while the separatists must withdraw their artillery the same distance behind the front line as of September 19. This should create a demilitarized zone at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) wide between the two sides. A wider division -- 70 or 140 kilometers -- is required for certain specified weapons with a longer range. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is tasked with helping with and monitoring the withdrawal of the heavy weapons -- but it's not clear how this will play out. If the withdrawal of heavy weapons is successful, then local elections should be held in separatist-held areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Dialogue on this should start the day after the withdrawal. A change in the Ukrainian constitution is expected to make this possible, along with reforms to give the region greater autonomy. If all this happens, then the Ukrainian government may be able to take back control of its border with Russia in separatist-held areas by the end of the year. The release and exchange of all hostages and illegally held prisoners should be completed no more than five days after the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the agreement states. Speaking after the agreement was announced in Minsk, French and German leaders made clear that it was not perfect but said it was better than taking no action. Much of the finer detail remains to be worked out and this could prove to be where the agreement founders. Alexey Pushkov, head of the international affairs committee in Russia's lower house, the State Duma, acknowledged this, tweeting: ""Minsk talks have reached their goal. Now it's all about following the agreement: tensions are very likely. The key is in implementation.' Implementing a political deal will always be harder on the ground, where emotions run high. Persuading fighters to surrender territory they have lost comrades to gain may not be easy. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Minsk and Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote from London. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Donetsk contributed to this report.","The agreement signed in Minsk sets out a series of steps for eastern Ukraine .
A ceasefire should be followed by the withdrawal of heavy weapons and local elections ."
"(CNN) -- A record-breaking winner of 18 grand slam singles titles, Martina Navratilova is to join the ranks of tennis' super coaches. The 58-year-old will work with world No. 6 Agnieszka Radwanska next season in her first major coaching role. ""I didn't sleep very well last night thinking about getting back into match mode and the competitions,"" said Navratilova, who won a record nine Wimbledon singles titles. ""I am really excited about this opportunity to join Agnieszka's team -- I can't wait to get started."" Radwanska, who reached the Wimbledon final in 2012, hopes appointing Navratilova will help end her quest for her first grand slam. ""I am absolutely delighted that Martina has agreed to help me and my team next season,"" said the 25-year-old Pole. ""She is my idol in tennis and I am honored we will be working together. My goal is to win a grand slam, so to have someone with Martina's accomplishments in my corner is going to be hugely advantageous and give me a big boost. ""We are originally from a similar part of the world so we share an understanding about tennis and life, which I'm sure will translate into a successful relationship,"" added Radwanksa, referring to the Czech-born Navratilova, who is a naturalized American. The sight of a super coach courtside has become de rigeur in the men's game since Andy Murray sought the advice of eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl in 2012. That partnership paid off as the Briton went on to win his first majors at the U.S Open and Wimbledon before adding the 2012 Olympic gold medal on home soil in London. Since then, Roger Federer -- not shy of a grand slam or 17 himself -- has worked with Swedish ace Stefan Edberg. Reigning Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic opted for flamboyant German Boris Becker while Murray is now supported by French female major winner Amelie Mauresmo after his split with Lendl. Navratilova is about to break new ground by becoming the first super-coach on the women's tennis tour. The Czech-born American citizen will no doubt relish the chance to set new standards as that's just what she's being doing since winning her first grand slam at the French Open in 1975. Blending serve-and-volley style with a power game, the left-handed star blazed into the record books. Navratilova holds an open era record 167 singles titles and 177 doubles titles as well as 59 grand slam crowns - in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. She won a final grand slam title -- the 2006 U.S. Open mixed doubles with partner Bob Bryan -- just one month shy of her 50th birthday before retiring from the game. Navratilova is also known as a TV personality, an activist for gay rights and she has even turned her hand to writing detective novels set in the world of competitive tennis. Now she must solve the case of the missing grand slam for Radwanska in 2015.","Tennis ace Martina Navratilova to return to the game as a super coach .

"The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty is up by more than 50% this year, and the leading method of those shootings was ambush-style attack. That's according to the nonprofit Washington-based National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which released its findings Tuesday. There were 50 officers killed by firearm in 2014, up from 32 the previous year. Of those 50 officers, 15 were killed in ambush attacks, the Memorial Fund said. Ten were killed ambush-style in 2013, the Fund said. The FBI, however, found that five officers were ambushed and killed in 2013. According to the Fund's 2014 report, 126 federal, state, local, tribal and territorial officers were killed in the line of duty in 2014, compared to 123 in 2012 and 102 in 2013. CNN has not analyzed each case and cannot authenticate the group's findings. ""These troubling statistics underscore the very real dangers that America's brave law enforcement officers face every time they put on their uniforms,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said.  ""Each loss is both tragic and unacceptable -- a beloved father, mother, son or daughter who never came home to their loved ones."" He added that the Department of Justice is doing its own analysis of officer deaths in 2014 ""so we can mitigate risks in the future."" The report comes amid simmering distrust and tension between the police and some communities across the country. It was also published less than two weeks after the December 20 ambush shooting of two New York City police officers. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, approached Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos as they sat in their marked patrol car in Brooklyn on December 20 and shot them to death. The Memorial Fund evoked thoughts of Liu and Ramos' deaths in a statement Tuesday. ""With the increasing number of ambush-style attacks against our officers, I am deeply concerned that a growing anti-government sentiment in America is influencing weak-minded individuals to launch violent assaults against the men and women working to enforce our laws and keep our nation safe,"" said Fund Chairman and CEO Craig W. Floyd. ""Enough is enough.  We need to tone down the rhetoric and rally in support of law enforcement and against lawlessness."" The rhetoric Floyd was referring to isn't confined to the angry words and sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters after Michael Brown was shot to death in Ferguson, Missouri, or the New York death of Eric Garner after police attempted to subdue him, which also spurred national protests, said Fund spokesman Steve Groeninger. Groeninger said the uptick in ambush-style attacks was ""punctuated"" by the New York officers' slayings, but there were other targeted attacks against law enforcement in 2014 that concern the Fund. They include: . -- In Las Vegas in June, Jerad Miller and his wife surprised two police officers as they ate lunch, shooting them to death. Witnesses said the Millers placed a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a Nazi swastika on one officer's body. -- In Jersey City, New Jersey, in July, police said a man assaulted a Walgreens security guard and took his gun in order to carry out the ambush-style killing of an officer, according to the Jersey Journal. -- In September, two Pennsylvania State Police troopers were ambushed and shot outside the police barracks in Blooming Grove. The hunt for the alleged killer, Eric Frein, lasted for almost seven weeks. He was captured at an abandoned airport on October 30. Frein was hit with terrorism charges in November for allegedly admitting that he shot the officers to change the government and ""wake people up.""","Attorney general says report shows real dangers officers face every day .

"(CNN)Kayla Mueller was difficult to reach -- 6,000 miles away and held captive by the Islamic militants of ISIS. But her family and U.S. government officials say they went to great lengths to try to rescue the 26-year-old humanitarian worker, efforts that ultimately failed. Her parents announced Tuesday they'd received confirmation she had died. Now they're working to bring her body back from Syria. U.S. troops may have come close to rescuing Mueller in July when they staged a daring raid at an abandoned oil refinery near Raqqa in Syria in an attempt to find journalist James Foley, who was executed by ISIS in August, and other hostages. Several dozen elite U.S. commandos from units such as Delta Force and Navy SEAL Team 6 flew in aboard helicopters, a U.S. official told CNN, and engaged in a firefight with militants. Troops found evidence the hostages had been there recently, including writings on the cell walls and hair believed to be Mueller's, one U.S. official said. ""We devoted enormous resources, always devote enormous resources to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world,"" President Barack Obama said Tuesday in an interview with BuzzFeed News. A spokeswoman for the family said Mueller's parents often communicated with the White House in trying to free their daughter, who was taken hostage in August 2013. Last summer, the Muellers asked the Obama administration to consider trading Dr. Aafia Sadiqqi, known as ""Lady al Qaeda,"" in exchange for Mueller, the spokeswoman said. The Daily Beast first reported on the family's request to the White House. ISIS has repeatedly called for the release of Sadiqqi, who is serving an 86-year sentence in Texas. Authorities said she shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008. The White House did respond to the family, but the family spokeswoman gave no details on what the answer to their request was. Other rescue efforts included a trip by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who went to Iraq and Qatar and met with Syrian rebel leaders to try to secure Mueller's release. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, said one of his aides went to a refugee camp near Kobani, Syria, to look for her. Gosar said government sources told him a man showed up at a terrorist training camp in Syria claiming to be Mueller's husband. He appealed for her release and wanted to talk to her but was turned away. The family representative said the man was actually Mueller's boyfriend, who was kidnapped at the same time as Mueller. He'd been released from captivity and went back to try to get Mueller released, the spokeswoman says. He continues to stay in touch with the family. In clearing up another question, the spokeswoman said that contrary to many media reports, the family never turned down a military rescue mission because it was too risky. Instead, the family had reached out to the White House and asked for notification if there would be another rescue attempt after the failed mission last July. Mueller's family has not spoken out against the U.S. government's efforts, but James Foley's brother has complained the government didn't do enough. ""I don't have all the answers, but I do think that a more cooperative approach (is needed),"" Michael Foley  said. ""And there wasn't sharing of information. You wouldn't believe how difficult it was to get information (on) released journalists ... from the ways that we have these walls built."" On Thursday, an official with the Joint Chiefs of Staff said a report in The Daily Beast that alleged the administration failed to act quickly on British intelligence about the location of the hostages is ""clearly false"" and ""very ill-informed."" The official said once plans were developed and Pentagon had confidence in the ability to carry out the mission, officials made their recommendation to the White House and ""quickly"" received clearance to carry out the operation. There was no sitting on intelligence or any delay in acting upon it, the official said. Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council spokeswoman, said, ""U.S. forces conducted this operation as soon as the President and his national security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully and consistent with our policies for undertaking such operations.""

"(CNN)It's a neurological disorder that causes involuntary movements and noises -- known as tics -- but for leading goalkeeper Tim Howard, Tourette's syndrome was the making of him. As revealed in his autobiography, ""The Keeper,"" symptoms began to appear when he was 10, and not long after that, the American was diagnosed and told he also suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder. But Tourette's didn't derail his career. Indeed, he said it made him ""hyperfocus"" and theorized that it helps him to anticipate in penalty shootouts. Anyone who watched last year's World Cup in Brazil wouldn't doubt Howard's ability. He became a household name in his homeland as well as in other parts of the globe following his stellar display for the U.S. against Belgium in the round of 16. His performance in South America even earned him a place in the top 10 -- a rarity for a U.S. footballer -- in the Associated Press voting for 2014 male athlete of the year. He tied for sixth with Lionel Messi. The longtime Everton custodian sat down with CNN.com at the club's training ground last week to discuss family life, relationships and living with Tourette's. Howard didn't mince words when he called his marriage a ""failure,"" waxed lyrical about his children, nine-year-old Jacob -- who is a keeper, too -- and seven-year-old Alivia, and said if he had a choice, he probably wouldn't live his life without Tourette's. Q: Tim, let's talk about your life away from football. How happy are you at the moment? A: I'm lucky. I'm very fortunate. I've got great friends, great family. I throw everything into football and so it's nice to kind of have that escape. I'm happy by nature, and the greatest thing in the world is that I could want for nothing else. I appreciate what I've been given. Q: You mentioned you are lucky and very fortunate. What's the best thing about being Tim Howard? A: (Laughs.) I think the best part is my family. I think everyone would appreciate having a healthy family, having a good strong circle around them -- and I do. I don't take that for granted, I feel fortunate. Q: What's the most difficult aspect about being Tim Howard? A:  At the moment it's being away from my kids. I think any parent would agree that is difficult. But it's a sacrifice on the front end so I can retire before I am 40 and be home every day. Q: You discussed in the book the trips you made from England to Memphis to see your kids and how accommodating (former Everton manager) David Moyes was. This season we know you're taking time out from the national team to have a bit more time with your children. How often are you going back now? A:  I'm getting more opportunities because obviously there are longer international breaks; I am not playing, so I've been able to get back and see my kids a lot more often, which has been a godsend really. Q: But you are not going every week? A: No, gosh no. I wish. I got a generous manager (Roberto Martinez,) but not that generous (smiles.) He gives me time off when there are little pockets. Obviously football is the utmost importance for this club and when he has the opportunity to give me a leave of absence, he does -- and which again, I am thankful for because that is not something that is guaranteed. That's out of the goodness of his heart. Q: People often rate you as a goalkeeper, but how does Tim Howard rate himself as a father? A: Good question. I'd like to say 10, but hey, you know (laughs.) I look forward to getting home, being closer to my children and retiring, really, being able to do the day-to-day things -- going to school, picking them up from baseball practice and soccer practice. I think my daughter asked me to coach her soccer team, so I don't know how that's going to work out, but we'll see. Q: What if Jacob and Ali say, ""Dad, I want to be a pro athlete?!"" You've experienced the highs but have also paid the price personally. A: I would certainly guide them in that direction and help them through it. I think you learn from your failures in life more. I don't think you learn from success. Any parent knows you want to shelter your child from hurt and disappointment and failure, but at the same time you know they have to go through that to learn and to grow. It's been great for me, the highs and the lows. So I would push them in that direction. I think Jacob would like to be a goalkeeper, so we'll see. We don't push our children to be incredible athletes. We give them the platform to go have fun. Ali is a striker and she's doing really well and Jacob plays in goal and mimics everything I do, which makes me beam and sometimes cringe, but it's one of those things where I get so much pride watching him try to emulate some of the things I have done. Q: Like Daddy, does he yell in goal? A: (Smiles.) Yeah, we have had to have that conversation a few times. Ninety percent of what I do in the game is praise and to give direction. But every now and then I have to get on one of the guys, as they have to get on me. I think that gets highlighted, so I have to tell him most of the time its praise. Q: Tim, you were talking about failure. How would you classify your marriage with Laura? Was your marriage a failure? A: We got divorced so I think ultimately the marriage side of it is a failure. But in life and in parenting that's been a huge success. I think that's been part of the story and that's been a great part of the story. Q: In the book you mention how it may be difficult for you to ever get married again because of the sort of extended family you have. How much has your view changed since then? A: It has to be a very special dynamic, yeah. There is always hope for my personal life, but I think that my children are my No. 1 priority so everything else has to kind of fall into place in regards to them. Q: But are you ready for another long-term relationship if you found that right person? A: (Laughs). Oh, I don't know about that. That's something I'll let fall into place if it does. Q: Concerning life on the pitch, you talked about Tourette's syndrome helping you in aspects of goalkeeping. How different of a goalkeeper would you be if you didn't have Tourette's? A: It's a tough question to answer in terms of what my life would be like without it. I have no idea. I found a way to cope with it and succeed and so it's hard for me to say exactly who I would be or what type of goalkeeper I would be. I hope physically I would have the same attributes so I would hope that a certain time in my career I would figure out the mental approach to my game, but it's certainly helped me. Q: If someone said, ""Tim, you could live your life without Tourette's syndrome,"" what would you say? A: It's hard for me to imagine what a day would be like without Tourette's syndrome because I am so content and happy with who I am. (Pauses.) I would probably say, ""No.""","Tim Howard says the best thing about being Tim Howard is having his family .

"Bastrop, Texas (CNN) -- The wildfire raging near Austin, Texas, has destroyed nearly 1,400 homes and has ""potential for growth,"" a fire official said Thursday. The 34,000-acre Bastrop County fire remained 30% contained late Thursday afternoon, said County Emergency Management Coordinator Mike Fisher. ""There's still some potential for growth in size,"" he said. The fire has killed two people. A search team is helping local officials scour the area for other potential victims. A line crew working to restore electricity in the area became trapped and wound up being rescued from advancing flames by helicopter, Fisher said. Victoria Koenig, spokeswoman for the Texas Forest Service, said the fire has destroyed 1,368 homes -- more than double the estimate officials gave Wednesday. About 240 other homes have been lost in other fires since Sunday, the service said. Authorities said Thursday they were allowing some of the 5,000 people who had evacuated to return to their homes. For most of the past year, scores of wildfires have been burning across the drought-stricken state. In the past week, the Texas Forest Service said it has responded to 176 fires over 126,844 acres. On Wednesday alone, the service responded to 20 new fires covering 1,422 acres. Officials were expected to enlist the help of a DC-10 tanker to fight the flames, but it cannot be used until Friday, when the decision will be made about when and where to use the resource, Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald said. ""The crews that come in overnight are going to tell us those places that they still think they're going to need to treat with that,"" he said. The tanker, called in by the Texas Forest Service, can drop more than 11,000 gallons of retardant at a time across a swath three quarters of a mile long and 500 feet wide. Airtankers, scoopers and helicopters have assisted in efforts to battle the Bastrop fire, the forest service said. ""Most of the forward progress of the fire has stopped, but significant intense burning continues in the interior,"" the service said Thursday. The weather may bring ""a sliver of hope in the next five to six days,"" said HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen. ""Tropical Storm Nate over the Bay of Campeche may spread some rain to south-central Texas next week, but those chances seem slim at this point."" While the cause of the Bastrop fire remains unknown, officials in Leander, about 60 miles northwest of Bastrop, said they believe four teens were responsible for setting a smaller fire there that destroyed 11 homes this week, causing $1.4 million in damage. In Camp Bullis, north of San Antonio, a wildfire that broke out Wednesday afternoon had burned 290 acres by Thursday afternoon, said Bexar County Fire Marshall spokeswoman Laura Jesse. ""We're thinking now, with the water drops, it's more than 50% contained,"" she said, referring to the drops made by four helicopters. Another fire, 15 to 20 acres in area, destroyed four homes, three storage sheds and 15 cars, but was some 95% contained, she said. Jerry Hooten found little more than ashes when he returned to his home in Bastrop County. ""We ain't happy about it, but we're all alive,"" said Hooten, who is staying at an RV park outside the danger zone. ""I don't think it's registered in our brains that our house is gone and that, really, half of Bastrop is gone,"" said evacuee Claire Johnson.

"(CNN)It moves millions of people around the British capital every day, acted as a giant air raid shelter during World War II and in more recent times sections of it have been transformed to host hydroponic farms. Now the London Underground is being touted as a stylish new subterranean route for pedestrians and cyclists. London Underline -- which won the award for best conceptual project at the London Planning Awards last week -- proposes transforming disused tube tunnels into a network of underground pathways that will reduce the pressure on the city's bustling streets. The plans also highlight the possibility of offering excess space up for cultural and retail projects. ""Our concept proposes repurposing underutilized infrastructure to provide quick links between existing tube stations and key London landmarks and destinations,"" said Ian Mulcahey, managing director of Gensler London, the architecture and design firm behind the idea. An artist's rendering of an underline passageway show hip young things strolling past an underground coffee shop while a happy cyclist gives the thumbs up. In another image, a graffiti artist crouches down to tag an idle wall with her colorful signature. ""Anything is possible,"" Mulcahey continued. ""Our vision for the London Underline relies on infrastructure that's already in place. We'd like to bring it back to life."" In their submission to the LPA competition, Gensler highlighted the green credentials of the project as well as its transportation benefits. Pavegen technology which transforms footsteps into kinetic energy would help power electricity and WiFi networks in the tunnels, the company said. On top of all this, Underline could provide the added benefit of helping to reduce accidents involving cyclists on the road. There were 489 cycle incidents classed as fatal and serious in London's in 2013, according to data from Transport For London, the city's transport authority. However, some critics and cycle groups have branded the project as gimmicky and not a plan that would make cycling more convenient. ""This is something that rears its head every so often, ideas to put cycle pathways underground or in the sky,"" said Rosie Downs of the London Cycling Campaign group. Architect Norman Foster unveiled designs for SkyCycle, a network of elevated bike paths hoisted aloft above railway lines, in early 2014 although little has been heard of the idea since. A spokesperson for TFL also told CNN that even though there are a number of disused stations and tunnels beneath the streets of London there were none of ""significant length that are not already part of our operational railway."" Downes said she would rather see ""Dutch style"" infrastructure put in place on existing road networks to separate cyclists and heavy traffic. And TFL recently granted permission for two new sections of ""cycle superhighways"" which reserve long stretches of London road for cyclists only. ""The greatest way to encourage cycling is to make it easier for people to plan local trips to the shops or to schools,"" Downes said. ""Obviously if you are proposing underground tunnels, that's just not going to work,"" as many bike journeys won't go anywhere near the subway network, she added. Yet Mulcahey counters that the the Gensler idea is designed to augment existing cycle infrastructure rather than compete with it. Even if the London Underline idea doesn't take off, he thinks it could be applied to other cities with large underground networks. ""Commentators from all over the world are reaching out for more information about our proposal, to evaluate it against their own disused infrastructure,"" Mulcahey said. ""What we are saying with the London Underline is that we need to look at all the spaces that currently exist within cities, and ask ourselves: 'Are we using them in the best way that we can?' If not, what else could we do?""","Disused London underground tunnels proposed as pathways for cyclists and pedestrians .

"(CNN)He wishes he could cry uncontrollably, like his grief-stricken wife. But he's still in shock. Mohammad Abu-Salha knows at some moment something will unpin his anguish. ""It will come, when I'm by myself. It will come at night. It will come when I see their faces."" Much of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, is grieving at vigils and prayer services after three students were found shot to death. But for Abu-Salha, that has to wait. He needs to share with the world how wonderful the three were, how they left a light in their lives. Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, and Yusor Mohammad, 21, were his daughters. Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, was his son-in-law, who recently wed Yusor. Mohammad Abu-Salha, other family members and many Muslims believe their killing was a hate crime. Authorities aren't ruling that out, but think an irrational dispute over a parking space may have had something to do with it. Tuesday's slayings had the hallmark of a summary execution -- shots fired to their heads. A neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, turned himself in to police the same night and has been charged with murder. He has no prior criminal record and is cooperating with the investigation, police said. When is a crime a 'hate crime?' In the condominium complex where the two newlyweds lived, people heard gunfire and dialed 911. One caller heard five to 10 bangs and screaming, but she didn't know from which apartment. Another caller thought she walked right past it, when the shooting started. ""I heard about eight shots go off in the apartment,"" she said. ""More than one girl screaming. And then there was nothing, and then I heard about three more shots go off. ... I hid behind a car. ... I never heard gunshots before like that."" News of a killing near the University of North Carolina reached Abu-Salha. Then his son-in-law's mother called. ""She was frantic over the phone, and she was told by one of his colleagues that Deah was involved in that shooting and that there were three people killed,"" Abu-Salha said. He and his wife tried their daughters' cell phones. No answer. They got in the car and headed for the condo. ""So, we just drove there knowing what we are about to face. I almost crashed my car on the way there,"" he said. ""And then we found the police there."" They waited for four hours in front of the cordoned-off scene for word from police. But it came from the media and friends. ""We pretty much knew nobody survived,"" Abu-Salha said. Hicks had found a car belonging to one of the victims in what he claimed was his parking space, according to the law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Then Hicks went to the victims' condo and shot all three people, the official said. Opinion: Triple killing may not be a hate crime . Though Abu-Salha is in shock, he's not surprised. His daughter Yusor Mohammad had told him about the neighbor a few times before. He would appear mad about this or that, and at least twice, he had a gun in his belt, she had said. Mohammad was afraid of him. ""I can estimate a week ago, knocking at the door, yelling. I think that time, she was talking about him unhappy with some noise, because they had friends visiting,"" Abu-Salha recalled. Such gatherings were tame, he said. The couple wasn't into wild parties. His story sounded similar to one Amira Ata told, after she visited the couple in the fall for dinner and a board game. They were playing Risk, and Ata was losing badly. ""I mean, I know I was mad because they were beating me at the game, but that was it,"" she told Fusion. After she left, Mohammad called her to ask if the neighbor had hassled her, Ata said. Mohammad told her that the neighbor had appeared at their door, angry about noise and the extra cars parked in the neighborhood. He was holding a rifle. ""He didn't point it at anyone, but he still had it,"" Ata said Mohammad told her. Deah's brother, Farris Barakat, said Hicks had repeatedly harassed Deah about parking rules. Deah checked with the condo office more than once, and was assured Deah was following the rules. ""They gave him the clear and said, 'If Mr. Hicks bothers you again, please call the police.' And maybe they should have,"" Barakat told CNN's ""New Day"" on Thursday. Abu-Salha says he thinks his loved ones' killing was a hate crime. When Barakat lived in the condo by himself, there were no problems with the neighbor. They inflamed after his daughter, who wears a hijab, moved in with her husband, he said. It was a visible sign that they were Muslims. ""Daddy, I think he hates us for who we are and how we look,"" Abu-Salha said his daughter told him. He believes that people prejudge Muslims in their communities because of the constant news they hear about extremist terrorists and the association with Islam. However, Samantha Maness, who lives in the complex, told a local newspaper that Hicks exhibited ""equal opportunity anger."" Hicks had chastised Maness in the past, she told the News & Observer in Raleigh, for playing the music in her car too loudly and once because she and her friends made too much noise while playing a card game. ""I have seen and heard him be very unfriendly to a lot of people in this community,"" she said. ""He was definitely aggressive, and he spoke harshly when he was upset, from what I've seen."" Hicks' demeanor was well-known in the apartment complex, to the point that one tenant tried to take action last year, Maness told the newspaper. ""There was a lot of instances of him getting people's cars towed and just being very aggressive toward anyone who came -- visitors, residents -- and so someone in the community organized a meeting to talk about how he kind of made everyone feel uncomfortable and unsafe,"" she said. Authorities said they have not ruled out hate as a motive, but they have not found indications of that in searches of the suspect's computer. The FBI has opened a preliminary inquiry into the killings to look into whether federal hate crime laws or other federal laws were violated, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Investigators so far haven't found any indications of a hate crime, and evidence suggests the shooting resulted from a confrontation over a parking dispute, the official said. On what is believed to be his Facebook page, Hicks is quite vocal about his atheism. And those who say the shooting is a hate crime are passing around a post attributed to him: . ""When it comes to insults, your religion started this, not me. If your religion kept its big mouth shut, so would I."" CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the post. It is not directed against a particular religion. Hicks' wife, Karen Hicks, who has been in the process of divorcing him, said the shooting was not a hate crime. ""I can say with my absolute belief that this incident had nothing to do with religion or victims' faith."" Her husband had been at odds with various neighbors of various backgrounds over parking, she said. Rob Maitland, her attorney, said the shooting ""highlights the importance of access to mental health care services."" Whether it was a hate crime or wild rage over a parking space, the killing was utterly senseless to grieving students at the University of North Carolina on Wednesday. ""There is no mystic or theologian or philosopher out there who can make this ugly mess into something comprehensible,"" a student said at a podium microphone to thousands of students who gathered outside at the university after sundown Wednesday. Some lit candles. Mostly they stood silent with solemn faces. Another speaker stood at the podium. ""Let's pray in every language ... for these beautiful souls,"" said another speaker. Razan Abu-Salha was studying architecture. Barakat and Mohammad were on their way to becoming dentists and loved charity work. Barakat was raising money for a dentistry aid trip to help Syrian refugees in Turkey. The couple also fed the homeless and hungry in downtown Raleigh ""many times a year,"" Mohammad Abu-Salha said. ""They cooked loads of food."" ""They came heartbroken to tell me how many grown men they've seen, standing in line, waiting for a bite,"" he said. On Thursday, mourning continued with a Janazah -- or funeral -- prayer in the afternoon at Raleigh's Islamic Center, followed by an evening candlelight vigil at North Carolina State University. ""These three children were loved by thousands and thousands of people here,"" Mohammad Abu-Salha said. ""They're raised here, they belong here, they died here, and they will be buried here, and we have a story to tell all our lives."" Opinion: 3 slain college students strived for a better world . CNN's Evan Perez, Tina Burnside, Rick Martin, Melodi Smith, Tony Marco, Jeremy Grisham and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","The FBI has opened a preliminary inquiry into the shooting, an official says .

"The Southeast is preparing to be swaddled in a paralyzing blanket of ice and snow that could leave huge chunks of the region cold, slick and in the dark. ""This is one of Mother Nature's worst kind of storms that can be inflicted on the South,"" Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal told reporters Tuesday afternoon. ""That is ice. It is our biggest enemy."" Winter storm warnings stretched from Louisiana through Georgia, parts of eastern Tennessee, the Carolinas and Virginia on Tuesday. A separate ice storm warning extended from the Georgia-Alabama state line to just west of Charleston, South Carolina, with forecasters warning of ""potentially catastrophic"" accumulations in Georgia. Amtrak will suspend some of its rail service in the Northeast, South and Mid-Atlantic regions due to the winter storm forecast, the company said in a statement. At least five people have been killed in weather-related incidents, including three people who died when an ambulance driver lost control on an icy patch of road outside of Carlsbad, Texas, according to the state's Department of Public Safety. The ambulance slid off the roadway into a ditch, where it rolled over, caught fire and burned, the department's spokesman, Tom Vinger, said. A patient, a paramedic and one other passenger were pronounced dead on scene, he said. In Mississippi, where the northern part of the state could see up to four inches of snow, authorities blamed two traffic deaths on the storm. Residents of Charlotte, North Carolina, were looking at up to a foot of snow, while mountainous southwestern Virginia could see up to 14 inches. Roads were expected to ice up early, making them impassible. ""If you get even a tenth of inch of ice on a road, it's like a skating rink,"" said Kurt Van Speybroeck, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Dallas. And in Georgia, the state's largest utility warned that hundreds of thousands of customers could be out of power ""for days"" when ice-laden tree limbs crash onto electric lines. ""This has the opportunity to be a huge event when you're talking about the amount of ice you're looking at,"" Aaron Strickland, the emergency operations chief for Georgia Power, told reporters. The company expected between half an inch to an inch of ice in some parts of the state, he said. The new storm is the first test for a 32-member severe weather task force that Deal created after the January 28 snowfall that brought Atlanta to a standstill and led to blistering criticism of state and municipal leaders. Deal said his administration has brought in an additional 180 tons of salt and sand in an effort to keep roadways open, but he urged his citizens not to put themselves ""in jeopardy or danger."" A 'very unpredictable' storm . Deal and his fellow governors in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, both Carolinas and Virginia issued emergency declarations ahead of the weather. In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory said the storm was ""very unpredictable"" as storm warnings were extended northward early Tuesday, forcing state agencies to shift their footing to face the elements. ""Even within the last hour, we're seeing changes in the weather predictions, which makes it very difficult to work on logistics,"" McCrory told reporters in Raleigh. But he said he was happy with how his government dealt with the late January snowstorm, ""and we expect the same type of coordination, activity and teamwork."" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley dispatched additional Highway Patrol officers to help with the expected accidents and stranded motorists on state highways, her office announced. State workers and volunteers from the Red Cross and Salvation Army prepared to open shelters if needed. National Weather Service forecaster Jason Deese said the storm ""certainly looks like it could be of historic proportions, especially in the last 10 to 20 years."" Meteorologists will keep an eye across the Carolinas on Tuesday evening as the temperatures there will largely dictate Atlanta's fate, he said. Low temperatures are expected to sink southwest out of the Carolinas, so if the mercury drops precipitously there, it could mean trouble for Atlanta in the form of an inch of ice, he added. ""You've got to get right around 30 and ideally into the upper 20s (for significant ice accumulation). That certainly could happen with this system,"" he said. ""As for how much ice, that's the uncertain part."" There is also a possibility of snow falling on the ""backside of the system"" Thursday, which would further complicate matters, and once the ice starts melting, travel could be further hampered by chunks of ice breaking off overpasses, something that happened during the recent winter storm in Charleston, South Carolina, Deese said. ""That's going to create travel headaches as well, even after the storm is gone,"" he said. Travelers get another winter wallop . A run on supplies . As the skies turned heavy, Atlantans cleaned stores out of loaves of bread, gallons of milk, bundles of firewood and cans of beans and beer. In some stores, all that was left were the apparently less-popular corn and asparagus. After the ninth-largest U.S. metropolitan area was humbled by January's two inches of chaos, residents said they aren't taking any chances. Atlanta's city government announced its offices would be closed Wednesday, with only essential employees expected to report to work. The Atlanta Public Schools and other systems across North Georgia announced they would be closed Tuesday and Wednesday. And local leaders urged people to stay off the roads. ""As of midnight tonight, wherever you are, you need to plan on staying there for a while,"" Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said Tuesday afternoon. Even before the first raindrops fell, Jagannathan Santhanam had decided to throw in the towel. ""I will work from home and keep my kids home, too,"" the software developer said. ""It was not fun, especially with family members stranded for more than 24 hours in different places during the last storm."" Charles Davidson also opted for a similar strategy. ""My wife and I decided a few days ago that we were going to get groceries early in the day, and we're going to stay in,"" he said. ""We're going to stick around for the next two or three days."" It took Davidson more than seven hours to get from Georgia Tech near downtown Atlanta to his home in Marietta, a northwest suburb, during the earlier storm. Not going to happen this time: Lessons from stranded snow survivors . Flights affected throughout South . The system was taking its toll on air travel across the region. Airlines announced more than 2,400 flight cancellations Tuesday ahead of the storms. The greatest concentrations, according to Flight Aware.com, are in airports in Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham. Delta Air Lines said Tuesday that some employees at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport would sleep on planes because there weren't enough hotel rooms for them. On Wednesday, though, a Delta spokesman said employees did not end up sleeping on planes after all. Snow, sleet and rain are in the forecast through Wednesday morning, with temperatures in the 30s. By Wednesday, ice on the roads could make driving ""hazardous or impossible,"" forecasters from the National Weather Service warned. The storm already dumped sleet and snow in Texas and Arkansas, and could bring snow as far north as Pennsylvania and New Jersey later in the week. Washington is bracing for nasty weather Wednesday and Thursday. When the last storm struck two weeks ago in Georgia, roads were gridlocked almost instantaneously as commuters fled Atlanta en masse. Thousands of children across northern Georgia spent the night in schools, and countless motorists endured commutes of more than 20 hours, if they were lucky enough to get home at all. Snowed Out Atlanta, the Facebook group where Georgians asked for and offered help during the last storm, was ramping back up Monday. The forum posted alerts about school closings and the possibility of power outages and tips on how to prepare for the storm. And there were also -- shall we say -- more practical tips. One featured a drift packed with a variety of brews. Says the caption: ""The best part about snow is that it keeps my beer extra cold."" There's nothing like a silver lining.","Amtrak suspends some rail service in the Northeast, South and Mid-Atlantic .

"(CNN)Posts on his Facebook page rail against religion. But was that the motive of a gunman who allegedly killed three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina? As thousands of mourners joined funeral prayers for the three victims, conflicting details emerged about the suspect, 46-year-old Craig Hicks. His wife, who attorneys said is in the process of getting a divorce, described her husband as someone who believes everyone is equal. Karen Hicks told CNN affiliate WTVD, something inside his head must have snapped before the shooting. Neighbors told reporters that Craig Hicks was known for angrily confronting people over everything from loud music to parking issues in the area. One described him as someone who showed ""equal opportunity anger."" At one point last year, the situation got so bad neighbors organized a meeting ""to talk about how he kind of made everyone feel uncomfortable and unsafe,"" she said. But the victims' families said there's no question religion was behind the gunman's decision to pull the trigger. ""We have no doubt that the way they looked and the way they believed had something to do with this,"" said Mohammad Abu-Salha, whose two daughters were killed in the shooting. A Facebook page that is believed to belong to Hicks includes many posts that are critical of religion, particularly Christianity. ""If you plan to be enjoying heaven while multitudes are tortured ... then you are as much a sociopath as the god that you worship,"" one photo says. Another post describes religion as ""the world's most successful pyramid scam."" The page describes Craig Hicks as an atheist and an anti-theist. Anti-theists are a particularly outspoken group of atheists who can be confrontational about their disbelief, researchers at University of Tennessee at Chattanooga said in a recent study. ""Anti-theists view religion as ignorance and see any individual or institution associated with it as backward and socially detrimental,"" the researchers wrote. ""The anti-theist has a clear and -- in their view, superior -- understanding of the limitations and danger of religions."" But Karen Hicks told reporters that the shooting had nothing to do with religion. Her husband believed in people's rights, she said. ""We were married for seven years and that is one thing that I do know about him. He often champions on his Facebook page for the rights of many individuals, for same-sex marriages, abortion, race. He just believed, and I know that's just one of the things I know about him, is everyone is equal,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter what you look like or who you are or what you believe."" The Facebook profile includes numerous posts advocating same-sex marriage rights. There are photos of Craig and Karen Hicks together at Disney World, and a photo of him riding an all-terrain vehicle in the woods. A post on the page last month showed a photo of a gun on a scale. ""Yes, that is 1 pound 5.1 ounces for my loaded 38 revolver, its holster, and five extra rounds in a speedloader,"" the caption reads. Authorities haven't said what kind of gun the suspect used in this week's shooting. But one 911 caller described hearing six shots. Asked about the Facebook page and the gun photo at a press conference on Wednesday, his wife declined to comment. Instead, attorney Michele English stepped in. ""Mrs. Hicks has told us that her husband did have a concealed weapons permit. He was lawfully carrying a gun. He was a champion for Second Amendment rights,"" English said. ""He believed strongly in them and the constitutionality behind those."" The Office of the Capital Defender in Durham, North Carolina, said it will be representing Craig Hicks. His attorney, Stephen Freedman, did not respond to a request for comment. Recently, the accused gunman had been planning to play a very different role in the courtroom. He was studying to become a paralegal at Durham Technical Community College. He was supposed to graduate in May, his wife said. She told reporters that the shooting happened after her husband came home from class Tuesday. At the school, Craig Hicks was an ""exemplary student,"" college spokesman Carver Weaver said, and no trouble about him was ever reported. Susan Sutton, who taught him in her classroom just before the shooting, told WRAL that HIcks was ""bright, hard-working and kind."" But at the Finley Forest condominium complex where Hicks lived, neighbors painted a different picture. Christopher Lafreniere, a driver who often towed cars from the complex, told WRAL that Hicks called so much to request that cars be towed that it became a problem for the company. ""He didn't like people parking in his space, and he was really, really adamant,"" Lafreniere said. ""I didn't understand why."" Last year, the problem became so severe that members of the community had a meeting to discuss it, Samantha Maness, 25, told the News & Observer newspaper. ""There were just a lot of instances of him getting people's cars towed, and just being very aggressive towards anyone who came, visitors, residents,"" she said. ""And so someone in the community organized a meeting to talk about how he kind of made everyone in the community feel uncomfortable and unsafe."" Asked whether she thought the shooting had anything to do with religion, Maness said Hicks displayed ""equal opportunity anger."" ""I have seen and heard him be very unfriendly to a lot of people in this community,"" she said. ""He was very angry, anytime I saw him,"" she told WRAL. When is a crime a 'hate crime'?

"(CNN) -- Tribal fighters took control of a top Yemeni city on Tuesday, a setback for an embattled government whose wounded president is hospitalized in Saudi Arabia. More than 400 tribal gunmen took over Taiz in southwest Yemen, witnesses there said. Government forces have been regrouping in an effort to re-enter the city. Yemen's government has faced international criticism for excessive use of force against anti-regime protesters and the deaths of anti-government demonstrators in Taiz. Are you in Yemen? Share your photos and videos from the scene, but please stay safe. Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, recovering from burns over 40% of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official briefed on the matter said. Whether he will return to Yemen remained uncertain. Saleh was wounded Friday in an attack at his presidential compound. An Arab diplomatic source with knowledge of Saleh's condition said one shrapnel wound was 7 centimeters (2.75 inches) deep. Fighting between government and tribal forces has been raging in the capital of Sanaa, where thousands of anti-government protesters have been pressuring Saleh to give up power since January. And there has been unrest elsewhere. At least 15 people were killed in Abyan Monday night and Tuesday morning in clashes between Islamic militants and security forces, according to a security source in Abyan. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has a presence in the southern province of Abyan, a U.S. official said. It's also home to an Islamic militant movement that has targeted government troops in recent days. The Abyan dead include nine soldiers, four militants and two civilians in Zinjibar and other suburbs in the province, according to the source, who asked to not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. There was also violence along the Saudi-Yemeni border, where there have long been concerns of infiltration by militants. A man trying to cross into Yemen from Saudi Arabia early Tuesday fatally shot two security officers and wounded another, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said Tuesday. The man, described as an ""infiltrator"" who tried to cross the metal-and-sand barriers at the border, fired at the security officers when they approached him, the agency said. Security personnel tracked the man and he was killed in an exchange of fire, it added. The turmoil in Yemen peaked Friday, when a mosque in Saleh's presidential compound was attacked. Yemen's state-run news agency SABA, citing a source in Saleh's office, reported last week that three guards and an imam were killed. Western diplomats said the attack came from a bomb. Yemeni investigations are ""focusing on what happened inside the mosque,"" not a rocket or mortar attack, diplomats said Monday. One diplomat said the attack was not a suicide bombing and that the Yemeni investigation was ongoing. The description of the attack as a bombing differs from what a Yemeni official told CNN last week. The official, who asked not to be identified, said that Saleh was in the mosque when two ""projectiles"" were fired during Friday prayers. Supporters of Sadeq Al-Ahmar, leader of the Hashed tribe and an opponent of the Yemeni government, were suspected in the attack. In response, Yemeni security forces shelled Al-Ahmar's home Friday, killing 10 people and wounding 35 others, according to Fawzi Al-Jaradi, an official with the Hashed tribal confederation. After Saleh was taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment, the tribal leader and Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi -- Yemen's interim leader -- agreed on a cease-fire, said Abdulqawi Al-Qaisi, spokesman for the Hashed leader. Yemen's largest opposition bloc has vowed to prevent Saleh from returning. ""The Yemeni people will do all in their power to not allow Saleh to re-enter the country,"" Joint Meeting Parties spokesman Mohammed Qahtan said Sunday. A U.S. government official said Monday he could not imagine the Saudis letting Saleh return. He said it was critical that the Saudis press Saleh to accept a Gulf Cooperation Council deal offering him immunity in exchange for stepping down. Saudi state-run Ekhbariya television reported Monday that Saleh had undergone two operations in Saudi Arabia and would return to Yemen after he recovers. A U.S. official told CNN Monday that the unrest makes U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen ""more difficult."" ""We rely on the Yemeni government as partners,"" the official said. ""The more the government is distracted by the political unrest, the more difficult it is for us."" The Yemeni government has had a ""big impact on acquiring information on AQAP,"" the official said, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. ""If that information flow slows or stops, it inhibits our ability to gather information."" CNN's Nic Robertson, Elise Labott, Pam Benson, Tim Lister and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","After rebel gunmen take over Taiz, witnesses say, government forces try to regroup .

"A young boy wanders through the high grass, looking lost after attending church services in Kakata, Liberia. The child, Moses Kallie, wears a black T-shirt that's too big for him.  It reads ""Trouble is my middle name."" Trouble has certainly come into his life.  He's lost 13 of his relatives recently -- his parents among them. They were all killed by Ebola. His village is a hotspot for the virus. So far 1,578 people are believed to have died from Ebola in Liberia alone, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization. The country has seen a 52% of increases in cases in just the past three weeks. That's in large part because there is little or no outside medical help for residents who get sick there. Searching for the answers: Can the world stop Ebola? In Monrovia, the country's crowded capital, doors to hospitals and clinics are shut tight, locked with thick padlocks. Many health care workers in West Africa have lost their lives due to the way the virus spreads -- through contact with bodily fluids from those who are infected. On Monday, the World Health Organization urged the affected countries to give health care workers both the adequate security and safety equipment they need, as well as appropriate education and training on infection control. A new Ebola clinic opened in Monrovia this week, but bodies lay on the ground outside its walls.  Ambulances filled with Ebola patients, some that have traveled seven hours to get there, are not unloaded. Without help to get them inside, the patients fall in the dirt, mere feet away from treatment. Without help, family members must care for these Ebola patients. And without the proper safety equipment, they too fall sick and Ebola continues to spread. The virus forces the local dead body management teams to work 12 hours a day, six days a week. All for a paycheck of $300 to $500 a month. Why I became a human guinea pig for Ebola . Dressed from head to toe in white protective suits and thick goggles, the burial teams try to stay safe, but nothing can shield them from the unspeakable horrors they've seen when they make their regular rounds. On Friday, Kiyee described what he saw when he entered a home: . ""I took the key and opened the door and went in and saw a 6-month-old child licking on the mother's skin,"" said Kiyee. The mother was lying on her stomach. She had died from Ebola. The baby was searching for the mother's milk. ""Right away I started shedding tears."" WHO said on Monday the overall death toll in the Ebola outbreak has risen to 2,803 in the five countries at the heart of the epidemic: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal. When people go out in public, they are encouraged to take whatever precautions they can. In Monrovia, people get their temperatures taken wherever they go -- at the grocery store, the office and at church.  A fever is one of the early symptoms of the disease. At the little boy's church in Kakata, the pastor is both practical and philosophical about Ebola. He has spent his career thinking deeply about death and what happens afterward. When his congregation asked the Rev. Victor King if he's afraid of death he said ""No,"" but ""I don't want to die from Ebola."" Ebola outbreak: How to help . At his church, he's called off the part of the service where congregation members shake hands. He tells them not to hug when they see each other, and no one takes communion wine from the same chalice any more. Many in his congregation were at first displeased when he ended that practice, he said. Communion is the high point of the church service and it is central to their tradition of worship. But he believes the congregation, like many in Liberia, are starting to better understand the disease and how it spreads. After services, the congregation files out the door and stops at a container the pastor has placed right outside. The container looks like it should hold a sports drink. Instead, it contains bleach for them to wash their hands. To a person the congregation stops and takes their time to wash up thoroughly. Anthony Kallah, a teacher, is one of them. ""We are all afraid,"" Kallah said. ""This is a threatening disease.""","At least 1,578 people in Liberia have died from Ebola, according to the World Health Organization .

"The owner of country music's Grand Ole Opry sued the U.S. government on Monday, accusing two federal agencies of turning the 2010 flood that struck Nashville into a man-made catastrophe. Gaylord Entertainment was joined in the lawsuit by A.O. Smith, the Wisconsin-based water-heater manufacturer that saw one of its plants along the Cumberland River inundated in the May 2010 flood. Their lawsuit names the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service, which have acknowledged that a lack of communication undercut flood warnings. ""It is a simple fact that we incurred millions of dollars in damages because the Corps released so much water into the Cumberland River that it rose above the 100-year flood plain,"" the companies said in a joint statement. ""We have a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders to seek remuneration for the losses we sustained as a result of this negligence, and also to ensure that both parties make significant process improvements to prevent a man-made disaster from occurring in any future flood event."" In 2010, flooding hits Nashville hard . The Cumberland eventually crested at nearly 52 feet in downtown Nashville, almost 12 feet over flood stage and about 10 feet higher than forecast. The flooding killed 11 people in the city and inflicted more than $2 billion in damage, with an additional 15 people killed in the surrounding region. The Corps of Engineers referred questions about the lawsuit to the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The A.O. Smith plant in the Nashville suburb of Ashland City was covered in mud and silt after the flooding, with the company estimating its losses at $76 million. Meanwhile, Gaylord says the famous Opry House and its Opryland hotel and resort took as much as a $250 million hit from the flooding. Flooding closes curtains at Grand Ole Opry . The lawsuit argues that the Corps ""repeatedly provided incorrect and inaccurate information"" to the Weather Service, which issued flood warnings for the Cumberland River. The suit accuses the Weather Service of knowingly using outdated information from the Corps in preparing those forecasts. In a January 2011 report on the disaster, the Weather Service found that the Corps was forced to increase the flow of water from a dam on the Cumberland River amid record rainfalls over Nashville and the surrounding region on May 2. But forecasters weren't told about the additional releases, and the Cumberland passed its predicted crest of 41.9 feet within two hours of their advisory, the report stated. In its own assessment, the Corps of Engineers acknowledged that ""misunderstandings"" between its Nashville district office and the Weather Service threw off forecasts ""to some degree.""","Monday's lawsuit criticizes Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Principal Sherrie Gahn said she was shocked when she first came to Whitney Elementary School seven years ago. ""The kids were eating ketchup packets,"" Gahn said. ""I said to one of my teachers, 'What on Earth are they doing?' and she said, 'That's their dinner.' "" Whitney Elementary is in a dusty, rundown neighborhood of Las Vegas known as the Boulder Strip. The main drag, the Boulder Highway, is lined with pawn shops and low-rent motels. Families here live at the edge of financial disaster. Gahn estimates that 75 percent of her 622 students have experienced homelessness or are in danger of becoming homeless. ""There are pockets of Vegas that were bad,"" Gahn said, ""but it's gotten 10 times worse with the recession."" Under Gahn's leadership, Whitney Elementary has become the chief lifeline for its students and their families. In addition to the regular lunch program for needy kids, the school operates a food bank. Hundreds of students are sent home each Friday with food supplies to keep their families fed through the weekend. ""If we didn't have the food services, there would be a lot of hungry kids out there,"" said Kim Butterfield, a homeless advocate who works at the school. Butterfield also organizes a clothing pantry in one of the school's spare classrooms. The school provides an entire winter wardrobe to students in need of clothing. The school's efforts don't stop there. Gahn tries to provide whatever her students need, whether it's a dental appointment or a haircut. ""There is not an agency in Las Vegas that can actually take care of the number of homeless and poverty-stricken children that I have at this school,"" Gahn said. ""So the only course of action I could take was to become self-sufficient."" Over the years, Gahn has built up a network of donors that supply money, goods and services. She relies on grateful parents who volunteer at the school. Watch chefs whip up a special meal for the kids . Volunteer Shirley Hernandez has two grandchildren at Whitney and has seen desperate straits. ""Last year we didn't have Christmas,"" she said. ""They gave us Christmas."" The school also paid past-due utility bills to keep the family's water from being turned off. Hernandez is at the school most mornings, helping to fill food baskets, assisting kids who need clothes or helping out any way she can. She said she gives back because ""they helped us a lot."" Every teacher at Whitney has a story. For kindergarten teacher Michelle Olson it's the 5-year-old girl who kept falling asleep in class. ""She was getting up throughout the night to feed and diaper her baby sister,"" Olson said. Watch one Las Vegas family's plight . It may seem like a lot for an elementary school to take on, but Gahn said she has no choice. ""My goal here is to take away some of their survival needs,"" she said. ""Then they can come to school and feel safe and learn."" Whitney is not alone. A recent survey of elementary school teachers found that two-thirds of teachers reported spending money out of their pockets to help feed hungry students. The same survey, conducted by anti-hunger organization Share Our Strength, found that 17 million children in the United States are at risk of going hungry this year. Whitney Elementary demands a lot in return for the special attention. Gahn said she believes her students deserve rigorous classroom instruction and the efforts are showing results. In the seven years that Gahn has been principal at Whitney, students have doubled their proficiency scores on standardized reading tests. ""They have food in their bellies that they would not have had, they have clothes on their back they wouldn't have had and for the first time someone believes in them. It's beyond food and clothing,"" she said. ""It's helping them understand there are people in the community that love them and will nourish them. We want to help them create a new norm.

"(CNN)Marathon peace talks aimed at ending the bloody crisis in eastern Ukraine concluded Thursday in a breakthrough: A ceasefire that's due to start Sunday and an agreement for both sides to pull back heavy weapons. If the ceasefire holds -- which is far from certain -- it could end a 10-month conflict that has claimed more than 5,000 lives, many of them civilians, and plunged East-West relations to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. ""We had just two options: bad, and worse. So we decided at this particular period of time to get the bad option. Probably this option will save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers, and I hope this option will save lives of Ukrainian civilians, of innocent people, who are under a constant shelling of Russian-led terrorists,"" Ukrainian Prime Minister  Arseniy Yatsenyuk said. ""It's better to have this new deal rather than not to have (it). But we do not trust any words or any papers. We are to trust only actions and deeds,"" he said. The White House issued a statement with a tone of guarded optimism. ""The United States welcomes the agreement reached today in Minsk. ..."" it said. ""The agreement represents a potentially significant step toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict and the restoration of Ukraine's sovereignty."" The statement urged that all parties take ""immediate, concrete steps"" to fulfill their commitments. ""Heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the conflict zone, and Russia must end its support for the separatists and withdraw its soldiers and military equipment from eastern Ukraine,"" the statement said. Addressing reporters after the four-way overnight talks in Minsk, Belarus, Russian President Vladimir Putin said all parties had agreed to the ceasefire starting February 15 and called for restraint in the interim. ""I call on both sides to end the bloodshed as soon as possible"" and come to a real political solution to the conflict, he said. Putin said both sides have agreed to pull back heavy weapons. The talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany took so long, he said, because authorities in Kiev still refuse to have direct contact with separatists. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking alongside French President Francois Hollande, said more work remained to be done, but ""what we have on the table gives us great hope."" The agreement may not be perfect, she said, but it has provided a chance to improve matters in eastern Ukraine and is ""clearly preferable to the situation if we had done nothing."" Merkel said Putin would be talking to separatist leaders about the deal. They were expected to travel to Moscow on Thursday to meet with Russian lawmakers. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko headed to Brussels, Belgium, to brief European leaders on the situation. Both Hollande and Merkel paid tribute to his efforts on behalf of Ukraine in the talks. European Council President Donald Tusk said the agreement was ""welcome news and gives hope"" but that hope was not enough. ""The real test is the respect of the ceasefire on the ground,"" he said. He added that after speaking with Merkel, his feeling was ""that we should remain extremely cautious."" Said one young man in Kiev, who recently signed up to fight pro-Russian rebels: ""I don't believe in the agreement at all. We've signed agreements in the past and all of them were breached."" In a televised statement, two separatist leaders, Igor Plotnitsky, of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, and Alexander Zakharchenko, of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, indicated they supported the deal. ""We must give Ukraine this chance,"" said Plotnitsky, adding that the peace plan envisages constitutional reforms that will protect the rights of people in eastern Ukraine and change Kiev's approach. Zakharchenko said any violations of the terms agreed to so far, with further talks still needed on some points, would mean no more deals. ""All responsibility for any violation of the agreement is on Petro Poroshenko,"" he said. A previous ceasefire deal, agreed to on September 19, also in Minsk, broke down amid continued fighting. It called for a drawback of heavy weapons, greater autonomy in the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions and a buffer zone along the Russia-Ukraine border. The Kremlin released details of the new agreement, which is similar in part to the September deal, on its website, but it's still unclear how elements of it will work. The points include: . • An immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in parts of Donetsk and Luhansk starting at midnight on February 15. • The withdrawal of all heavy weapons by both parties at equal distances in order to create a security zone width of at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) from each other for artillery systems and more for longer-range weapons. The ceasefire line for the Ukrainians is the current front line and for the separatists it's the front line as it was at the time of the previous deal on September 19. • This process should begin no later than the next day after the ceasefire and should be over within 14 days. • The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has a monitoring team in Ukraine, will monitor the ceasefire line and withdrawal of heavy weapons. • A dialogue on new local elections and the special status of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions will begin the day after the withdrawal. • A law will be created to give amnesty to people involved in events in Luhansk and Donetsk. • Both sides must ensure the release and exchange of all hostages and illegally held prisoners by no later than the fifth day after the withdrawal. • Social payments such as pensions should be restored, and Ukrainian authorities should regain full control of the banking system in conflict-affected areas. • Full control of the border will be restored to the Ukrainian government, beginning the day after local elections are held. • Withdrawal of all foreign troops and military equipment from Ukraine, including mercenaries, and the disarmament of militia groups. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier voiced cautious optimism after Thursday's deal, which came after 17 hours of talks. ""We have not achieved everything, but at least there is a ceasefire. This also includes agreements on securing the eastern borders of Ukraine, elections and the exchange of prisoners,"" he said in a statement. ""It is a chance to move away from escalation and towards political momentum."" In a joint declaration, released by the German government, the four leaders stated ""their full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"" and that they ""firmly believe that there is no alternative to an exclusively peaceful settlement."" The leaders ""will use their influence on relevant parties"" to ensure the package of measures are put in place, the declaration said. ""Leaders share the conviction that improved cooperation between the EU, Ukraine and Russia will be conducive to the crisis settlement,"" it added. To that end, the three parties will hold further talks on energy supply and a possible free trade deal between Ukraine and the European Union, which is of concern to Russia, it said. The question of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty was a key issue going into the talks. Russia annexed its southeastern Crimea region last spring, shortly before separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kiev, triggering months of conflict. ""Ukraine will always be a unitary state. No federalization whatsoever! #UnitedForUkraine,"" Poroshenko tweeted after the deal was announced. In a post on his Facebook page, he said that ""we did not agree to a single ultimatum"" and that the ceasefire would be implemented regardless of any previous agreements. ""For the successful reform we need just one precondition: peace. And we tried to do our best to make Ukraine a successful state, peaceful, reliable with a very strong European aspiration,"" the Ukrainian president later told reporters in Brussels. The German- and French-led peace initiative was prompted by worsening fighting between separatists and Ukrainian government forces in recent weeks, threatening not only the lives of more civilians, but the stability of the region. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in the Donetsk region said separatist fighters that his team spoke to had learned of the ceasefire deal from CNN -- and were highly skeptical of any promises made. The noise of shelling could still be heard Thursday, and there was no obvious change in the tempo of the combat, he said. A separatist fighter who spoke to CNN in Dukuchayevsk, not far from Donetsk city, said: ""Ukrainians won't have a ceasefire. Ukraine armed forces, I mean. We can resolve this conflict only one way: Ukraine withdraws its armed forces from the territory of the Donetsk Republic. That's the only possible way."" ""How can we talk to them?"" asked another fighter. ""Only with this,"" he said, slapping his weapon. It's possible the separatists may seek to seize further territory before Sunday. Since the Ukrainian forces have to withdraw their weapons from the current front line as the ceasefire comes into effect, the separatists stand to keep hold of significant territory they've won in recent weeks. A spokesman for the National Defense and Security Council of Ukraine told CNN on Thursday that two Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 21 injured in the past 24 hours. Russian tanks, rocket launchers and armored personnel carriers had also crossed the border from Russia into Ukraine overnight, he said. Russia has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into Ukraine. But top Western and Ukrainian leaders have said there isn't any doubt that Russia is behind surging violence and separatists' efforts to take over territory in eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde on Thursday announced a new IMF bailout package that's worth $17.5 billion over the next four years. It has still to be approved by the board of directors. ""Over the past year, despite the challenging environment, the Ukrainian authorities have clearly shown their commitment to ambitious reform on several key fronts,"" Lagarde said. These include strong fiscal discipline and moves to strengthen anti-corruption measures. The deal replaces a separate $17 billion bailout agreed to last year by the IMF. Only $4.5 billion of those funds were distributed, bringing the IMF's total commitment to $22 billion. The crisis in Ukraine, which stemmed from a trade agreement, has forced more than 1.5 million people from their homes, according to the United Nations.

"Elections in Israel always generate much excitement domestically and internationally. However, they hardly produce conclusive results of a clear winner in terms of policies and leadership. No single party has won an absolute majority since the country was founded more than 64 years ago. Tuesday's election leaves Israeli politically more divided than ever: the ruling party Likud-Beitenu and its leaders Benjamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman are injured and badly bruised, but not knocked out. The party lost around a quarter of their combined seats in the Israeli Knesset. Nevertheless, in the mysterious ways that Israeli politics operate, Netanyahu is still best positioned to form the next government, but just barely and without absolute certainty. The results will lead to weeks, if not months, of the customary horse-trading process of building a coalition that brings together into government politicians who have at times little in common, let alone a coherent agenda. Israel's elections confound critics . Netanyahu's triumphant speech to his supporters on Tuesday night, following the declaration of the exit polls, couldn't conceal the fact that his party's showing in the elections was disappointing, and that the task of forming a stable coalition remains thorny. The center-left bloc did better than predicted. The biggest surprise of the elections was the newly-formed Yesh Atid Party (There is a Future), led by Yair Lapid, which gained 19 seats, and the Labor party which also managed to increase its number of seats slightly to 15. Following the counting of nearly all the ballots it became clear that Netanyahu's gamble on a joint list with former Foreign Minister Lieberman didn't pay off. The joint list lost to the resurgent, more right-wing, party Jewish Home, led by Naftali Bennett, and some votes even migrated to the center-left, which defied public opinion polls to become almost equal in size to the right-bloc. The election campaigning is over, the billboards on the streets are removed, and the election jingles are silenced. But challenges remain for the new government. Internationally, the Middle East has changed dramatically, as result of the Arab Spring, posing great strategic challenges. In Israel, Netanyahu's party wins but centrists flex muscle . Iran continues its pursuit of nuclear capability and resolving the conflict with the Palestinians seems to be as remote as ever. Domestically, disagreement with the ultra orthodox about serving in the army remains a contentious issue dividing the Israeli society, as does the genuine integration of the Arab minority into Israeli society, let alone the recent economic downturn, and the ever-growing gaps between rich and poor. And this is only a few of the challenges ahead. Even if Netanyahu seems to be the one with the most realistic chance to form a coalition, Tuesday's results show this is no foregone conclusion. Even as the ballots were being counted, the parties started informally negotiating the composition of the next government. The next few days and weeks will reveal Netanyahu's preferred partners. Will he opt for a distinctive right-wing coalition with which he might feel more ideologically comfortable, but will put him on a course of collision with many of Israel's friends around the world? If such a government decides to expand the building of West Bank settlements and procrastinate -- if not block completely -- any progress on the peace process, it will potentially lead to the isolation of Israel in the international community and to growing tensions with Israel's main ally, the United States. President Barack Obama, who has already questioned the wisdom of Netahyahu's policies and how well they serve the Israeli national interest, might take a more assertive approach to Israeli policies which he believes also hinder U.S. national interest in the region. Free from the need to be re-elected and considering Netanyahu's support of his opponent in the U.S. presidential elections, Obama might confront the expected Israeli prime minister's policies more proactively. Another option open to Netanyahu is to offer either Yesh Atid or the Labor party to join him -- though that would risk a rift with his traditional ultra-orthodox supporters or even parts of his own party. Alternatively, he might opt to lure parties from both sides of the political map, but this might prove to be way too complex to form, and extremely divisive to preside over, for the duration of the Knesset. It will be interesting to observe how the strengthened center-left bloc is going to approach coalition negotiations. Opinion: Time for U.S. to stop shielding Israel . Do they believe they can form a government themselves? Are they going to operate as a united bloc that will set clear red lines in order to join a Netanyahu government -- whether on the issue of progress in the peace process or socio-economic issues? Or will they will jockey for a position and outbid one another for a place around the Cabinet table? Working as a bloc and adhering to their pre-election promises might either guarantee them a stronger bargaining position in the negotiations to form a government or public credibility, which will pay off in the next elections. Israeli politicians are not known for such long-term calculations and the temptation of government might prove too big. Over coming weeks, speculation will mount about the nature of the next government, while the process of coalition building will occupy the Israeli political system and its public. Whatever the outcome of forming a government, the fragmented results of the election might produce a government incapable of giving the answers to the most pressing challenges Israel faces, and in the end might not even remain in power for too long, before a call for fresh elections.","Election result leaves Israel more divided than ever .
Benjamin Netanyahu can look left or right for coalition partners .
His group lost votes to more right-wing parties and a center-left bloc .
Whoever rules, it is not clear they'll be able to provide answers to Israel's pressing problems ."
"(CNN) -- Experts disagreed Tuesday over just how bad things have gotten at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in northeastern Japan, but all of them agreed that things could get worse. An explosion Tuesday at the plant elevated the situation there to a ""serious accident,"" on a level just below Chernobyl, a French nuclear official said, referring to the international scale that rates the severity of such incidents and to an incident 25 years ago in what is now Ukraine. His comments came before a fire was reported Wednesday in the No. 4 reactor building at the Japanese plant. The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale -- or INES -- ranks incidents from Level 1, which indicates very little danger to the general population, to Level 7, a ""major accident"" with a large release of radioactive material and widespread health and environmental effects. ""It's clear we are at Level 6, that's to say we're at a level in between what happened at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl,"" Andre-Claude Lacoste, president of France's nuclear safety authority, told reporters Tuesday. The core meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Middletown, Pennsylvania, in 1979 caused no injuries or deaths, and only low levels of radiation were found later in plants and animals, experts said. At least 30 people died following the 1986 explosion and fire at Chernobyl, and large swaths of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia were contaminated from the nuclear fallout. Thousands of cases of childhood thyroid cancer resulted, according to Dr. Ira Helfand of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which opposes the use of nuclear power. Japanese nuclear authorities initially rated the incident that began last Friday with a 9.0-magnitude earthquake in northeastern Japan followed by a tsunami at Level 4, according to Greg Webb of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Level 4 is characterized as a minor release of radioactive material that necessitates only measures to control food due to contamination. But in the latest information about the explosion, Japanese authorities did not give it a rating, Webb said, and the IAEA did not cite one either. But Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund and author of ""Deadly Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Threats,"" said the level is far beyond 4. ""We are way beyond Three Mile Island level and heading into Chernobyl territory,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""This is at least a 5, probably a 6 and it could end up a 7."" He added, ""This is not going to end well. At the very least, we're going to have a very expensive mess to clean up, and the worst is that we we spread radioactive particles across hundreds or thousands of square miles of Japan."" The Institute for Science and International Security agreed the initial rating was low. ""The explosion in the Unit 2 reactor, the third so far, and the fire in the spent fuel pond in the reactor building for Unit 4 means that this accident can no longer be viewed as a level 4 on the INES scale,"" the institute said Tuesday in a posting on its website. ""This event is now closer to a level 6, and it may unfortunately reach a level 7,"" it said. Level 6 events have broad consequences that require countermeasures to deal with the radioactive contamination. Level 7 events would constitute a larger release of radioactive material and would require further countermeasures. Another way to measure the incidents would be to rank them in comparison with Chernobyl, deemed the worst, and Three Mile Island. ""My guess is this is now number two, but I need to need to look at the data more carefully,"" said James Acton, an associate in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment and a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow. Tom Cochran, a senior scientist in the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he would guess that the incident ranks ""a little worse than Three Mile Island and not nearly as bad as Chernobyl."" But, he complained, he could not look at the data because they had not been made available. ""There are too many variables: First is the lack of transparency on the part of the Japanese."" Even if the Japanese prove capable of keeping coolant in the three reactors that have experienced partial core meltdowns, many uncertainties remain, he said. One of them is whether the containment vessels will keep any molten nuclear material from entering the environment. ""If it does pool in the bottom of the reactor, after some period of time it will probably eat through the reactor into the primary containment area which is, or should be, sealed, but may not be,"" he said. If the containment system is breached, ""you have more or less direct access to the environment. At that point, you expect the volatile fission products and the gaseous fission products to get out of the system. That would be things like Krypton 85, Iodine 131 and Cesium 137."" Given that prevailing winds were blowing out to sea and people who lived within 20 kilometers of the plant had been evacuated, Cochran said he was sanguine about the possible outcome. ""But you can always play the game of, what's the worst-case situation? And the worst case can get pretty bad."" Whatever happens, the incident will greatly affect the calculation of probabilities associated with nuclear power risk, he said. The probability of a core melt had been estimated at about one chance in 10,000 reactor years of operation, he said. ""We've had now three core melts in 30 years in less than 500 reactors, he said, referring to Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and now Japan. ""So the probability of a partial core melt is one chance in several hundred instead of one chance in 10,000. So, it's not a good statistic."" Many experts said it could be a long time before they are able to determine the incident's impact. ""We don't know enough to assess the long-term or short-term effects of this,"" said Kirby Kemper, a nuclear physicist, physics professor and vice president of research at Florida State University. Kemper said it appears the radioactive material released had largely dissipated into the atmosphere. However, he added, authorities would will have to test the soil for contamination in the 20-kilometer radius of the plant that was evacuated before anyone should be allowed to return home. Trying to place the situation on the INES scale is premature, said David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University. ""I've been asked to put a number on it a few times and I've resisted,"" he said. Cochran said his concerns transcend nuclear power. ""We've watched Exxon Valdez, the BP oil spill, numerous coal mining accidents, Chernobyl, TMI, now Fukushima, slag ponds, TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) reactors giving way. You have got to ask yourself, how many wake-up calls do you need before you get serious about building a safe, renewable-energy economy?""

"ALBANY, New York (CNN) -- At the age of 21, Christopher Jenkins appeared to have everything going for him. The University of Minnesota senior was good-looking, had a near perfect grade-point average and had a future in business. Christopher Jenkins, 21, vanished on Halloween 2002. Four years later, police ruled his death a homicide. Then, suddenly, he vanished. He was last seen celebrating Halloween at a bar in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 2002. Jenkins' friends said he left about midnight. Four months later, his body was found in the Mississippi River, still wearing his Halloween costume. Minneapolis police classified the drowning as accidental. Jenkins' blood-alcohol level was well above the legal limit, and police told his parents that he'd probably had too much to drink after bar -hopping with friends. They thought he'd fallen into the river. Despite a lack of evidence, his parents, Steve and Jan Jenkins, insisted that there had been foul play. ""He was loaded into a vehicle, a van, driven around and eventually murdered,"" Jan Jenkins told CNN. ""He was murdered and thrown away like a piece of trash."" Hundreds of miles away, Kevin Gannon, a retired detective with the New York Police Department, was investigating the mysterious deaths of several college men from New York state. Each of the deaths had been ruled an accidental drowning.  Watch how clusters of drowning deaths raise suspicion » . In 2006, nearly four years after Jenkins died, there was a break in the case. A tip from a man in jail, described by Minneapolis police as a witness or suspect, caused police to change Jenkins' cause of death from ""unexplained drowning"" to homicide. It was a lucky break for Gannon. He had promised the parents of Patrick McNeill that he wouldn't quit until he'd found out how the Fordham University student died. McNeill's body washed up in the East River two months after he left a bar in New York. Gannon enlisted the help of another former NYPD officer, Anthony Duarte, when Christopher Jenkins' death became a homicide. In 2003, the two traveled to Minneapolis to investigate Jenkins' death. They learned about a string of student drowning deaths, many of them involving young men who attended colleges along the Interstate 94 corridor in the Midwest -- in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. Nine of the deceased attended the University of LaCrosse, in Wisconsin. Three attended colleges in New York state. In all, the investigators say they've connected the bizarre drowning deaths of at least 40 college-age men across the country. The two detectives believe that in each case, and in others they investigated, the men were drugged and then their bodies were slipped or tossed into the water to make it appear as if they'd drowned. Why would the killer or killers put the bodies in the water? The effect of water on evidence makes for an almost perfect crime, Duarte said. Not only does it make it appear like an accidental drowning instead of a murder, but the water frequently washes away key pieces of evidence such as fingerprints and fibers, so the killer can't be identified. Together, the two detectives began mapping out the drowning deaths and working the case backward. Instead of focusing on where the bodies had been found, they used GPS devices and tracked river flow patterns and water levels to figure out where the bodies entered the water. As Gannon and Duarte investigated the deaths, they began to see a trend. The cases spanned 25 cities in 11 states, and at least some of them were connected by a creepy symbol left near the water's edge: a smiley face painted on trees and other surfaces. The detectives believe that the smiley faces were left by the killer or killers. They varied in size, with each face more haunting than the next. The most sinister was found in Iowa. It was drawn in red with a devil's horns. Next to the smiley face was a note that read, ""Evil Happy Smiley Face Man."" Asked whether he believed there was a hidden message in the smiley faces, Duarte told CNN, ""The message is, they're taunting the police."" Duarte and Gannon said they found 12 other matching symbols similar to gang graffiti. But, to protect their investigation, they wouldn't describe them in detail. The detectives say the string of deaths could be the work of more than one killer because some of them took place on the same day in different states. ""It's so widespread. We have so many different victims in so many different areas,"" Duarte said. ""It would, in my view, be impossible to be one person."" The detectives also believe the victims were targeted. All of the young men were popular, athletic and good students. Who would commit this type of crime? ""The type of person that would be the opposite, not smart, someone not good in school, maybe doesn't have a job, not popular,"" Duarte said. Gannon and Duarte believe that the young men were drugged to weaken them and given a substance that couldn't be detected by an autopsy. ""I believe these young men are being abducted by individuals in the bars, taken out, at some point held for a period of time before they're entered into the water,"" Gannon said. He also believes the victims were abused mentally and sometimes physically before they were killed. ""This is a chance for them to have power and control over somebody else and manipulate. The fear of death is just as important as the act of death itself,"" Gannon said. Minneapolis police are not convinced that Jenkins' death was the work of a serial killer. ""Although we have collaborated with investigators from the FBI and communicated with other jurisdictions in which similar drowning deaths have occurred, we can neither confirm nor endorse the 'smiley face murders' theory currently being publicized,"" the department said. The FBI also has its doubts. ""To date, we have not developed any evidence to support links between these tragic deaths or any evidence substantiating the theory that these deaths are the work of a serial killer or killers. The vast majority of these instances appear to be alcohol-related drowning,"" the bureau said in a statement. Still, Gannon and Duarte are concerned that the killing could continue. They say whoever killed Jenkins might already be stalking other college students. ""Unless you've been out there to the scenes to evaluate [them] yourself, if you haven't done that, you're basically Monday-morning quarterbacking,"" Gannon argued. Duarte thinks local police forces did not investigate the cases adequately and that the FBI could have done more, too. ""I don't think any of them went out to the field and beat the bushes,"" he said.","Deaths of 40 male college students have been ruled ""accidental drowning""

"Jules Bianchi ""did not slow sufficiently to avoid losing control"" during his crash at the Japanese Grand Prix, according to an FIA report published Wednesday. The Marussia driver, who suffered life-threatening head injuries, crashed into a recovery vehicle at Suzuka in October and was immediately taken to hospital. The 25-year-old remains unconscious at a French hospital in Nice but is breathing unaided and is no longer in an artificial coma. The Frenchman suffered a diffuse axonal head injury after colliding with the Sauber of Adrian Sutil, which was being removed from the circuit. According to a 396-page report put together by a 10-person panel at the FIA - Formula One's governing body  -- ""Bianchi did not slow sufficiently to avoid losing control at the same point on the track as Sutil."" The report also states that during the ""two seconds Bianchi's car was leaving the track and traversing the run-off area, he applied both throttle and brake together, using both feet. ""The FailSafe algorithm is designed to over-ride the throttle and cut the engine, but was inhibited by the Torque Coordinator, which controls the rear Brake-by-Wire (BBW) system,"" said the report. ""Bianchi's Marussia has a unique design of BBW, which proved to be incompatible with the FailSafe settings."" According to the report, Bianchi's car, which weighed 700 kilograms, hit the  6500kg crane at a speed of 126 kilometers an hour. ""Bianchi's helmet struck the sloping underside of the crane,"" read the report. ""The magnitude of the blow and the glancing nature of it caused massive head deceleration and angular acceleration, leading to his severe injuries. ""All rescue and medical procedures were followed, and their expediency are considered to have contributed significantly to the saving of Bianchi's life."" The FIA also confirmed that the actions taken following Sutil's crash were ""consistent with the regulations"" and state there was no ""apparent reason"" why the safety car should have been deployed sooner. It also states that Bianchi ""over-controlled the oversteering car, such that he left the track earlier than Sutil, and headed towards a point ""up-stream"" along the barrier. ""Unfortunately, the mobile crane was in front of this part of the barrier, and he struck and under-ran the rear of it at high speed."" Bianchi's Marussia team folded in November after administrators failed to find fresh investment. In the days after the crash, Marussia moved to address accusations that Bianchi had not reduced his speed and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so. ""The Marussia F1 Team is shocked and angered by these allegations,"" said the statement issued in October. ""At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital, and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family, it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules' accident. ""Regarding point 1, Jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags. That is an irrefutable fact, as proven by the telemetry data, which the team has provided to the FIA. ""Regarding point 2, an audio copy of the full radio transmission between Jules and the team, and a written transcript, were provided to the FIA. ""It is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to Jules' accident did the team urge Jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so.""","Jules Bianchi suffered head injuries after crash at Japanese Grand Prix .

"Two days after the grisly discovery, the case of the Los Angeles hotel water tank corpse is a mystery with many unanswered questions. The decomposing body of Elisa Lam floated inside a water tank on the roof of the Cecil Hotel while guests brushed their teeth, bathed and drank with water from it for as long as 19 days. A maintenance worker, checking on complaints about the hotel's water, found the 21-year-old Canadian tourist inside one of four water cisterns Tuesday morning, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Rudy Lopez said. How and where did Elisa Lam die? Los Angeles robbery-homicide detectives are treating this as a suspicious death for obvious reasons, Lopez said. Falling into a covered water tank behind a locked door on top of a roof would be an unusual accident. An autopsy was completed, but the cause of death is deferred pending further examination, assistant chief coroner Ed Winter said Thursday. That may take six to eight weeks. It will be several weeks before investigators have the toxicology lab report which would show whether Lam had any drugs in her system. Any marks, injuries or wounds may suggest Lam died elsewhere and was dumped into the tank by her killer. Water in Lam's lungs could be a sign that she drowned, but it might not tell why she was inside the small tank. One clue comes from security camera video of Lam inside a hotel elevator the last day she was seen. She is seen walking into the elevator, pushing the buttons for four floors and then peering out of the opened elevator door as if she is hiding or looking for someone. Clad in a red hoodie, Lam at one point walks out of the elevator before returning to it, pushing the buttons again. She then stands outside the open elevator doorway, motioning with her hands, before apparently walking away. Lam checked into the Cecil Hotel five days earlier, January 26, on her way to Santa Cruz, California, according to police in her hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia. Why did it it take so long to find Lam? Lam's parents reported the University of British Columbia student missing in early February. Her daily calls home stopped on January 31, police told reporters on February 6 at a Los Angeles news conference. Because it was an international case -- and her parents and sister flew to California to find answers -- the case may have gotten more attention than most of the several thousand missing person reports made in Los Angeles each year. A search of the hotel then found no sign of Lam, including a trip to the roof with a police search dog, Lopez said. Strange things began happening with the hotel's water supply later in the month, according to Sabina and Michael Baugh, a British couple who spent eight days there until checking out Wednesday. The water pressure dropped to a trickle at times. ""The shower was awful,"" Sabina Baugh said. ""When you turned the tap on, the water was coming black first for two seconds and then it was going back to normal."" The tap water ""tasted horrible,"" Baugh said. ""It had a very funny, sweety, disgusting taste. It's a very strange taste. I can barely describe it."" But for a week, they never complained. ""We never thought anything of it,"" she said. ""We thought it was just the way it was here."" Knowing now what they didn't know then about the water is sickening, Michael Baugh said. ""It makes you feel literally physically sick, but more than that you feel it psychologically.  You think about it and it's not good."" Eventually, the hotel maintenance department investigated the water problem, sending a worker to look into the tank, police said. He saw Lam's lifeless body at the bottom. A hard-working family . Randy Schmidt, a spokesman for the University of British Columbia, said Lam was registered in a class in August, but was not registered in any classes this year, according to records. ""Unfortunately, we do not have much more to say, other than to extend our deepest sympathies to the family,"" said Schmidt. According to Los Angeles police, Lam tended to use public transportation. Teika Steins, manager of a hostel in Toronto, Canada, said Lam stayed a week there in early December. Steins called the young woman friendly and outgoing. Flowers and signs were left Thursday outside the temporarily-closed Lam family restaurant in Burnaby, British Columbia. Tanya Grohmann, who works nearby, said she was saddened by the loss and the fact the family did not know what happened to the young woman. ""They are a hard-working family. They immigrated here,"" she told CNN affiliate CTV. ""They've been in the neighborhood for nine years working. ... They're honest people."" Why did hotel stay open after discovery? New guests continued to check into the Cecil in the hours after firefighters removed Lam's body from the water tank. But each guest was asked to sign a waiver releasing the hotel from liability if they become ill. ""You do so at your own risk and peril,"" the hotel's release said. Guests who already paid for their rooms would not get refunds if they move out, it said. CNN's repeated calls to the hotel for comment were unreturned Wednesday and Thursday. The Los Angeles Public Health Department immediately tested the water supply, but told the manager they could stay open as long as they provided bottle water and warned guests not to drink the tap water. The results of the testing showed no harmful bacteria in the tank or the pipes, according to Angelo Bellomo, director of environmental health for the department. Chlorine in the city's water may be the reason it is safe, he said. All of the tanks and pipes in the building still must be drained, flushed and sanitized, Bellomo said. The water will be retested after that process, which should take several days, he said. Several guests interviewed by CNN on Wednesday indicated the hotel management did not tell them about the body in the water supply they had been drinking and bathing in. Qui Nguyen learned about it from a CNN reporter Wednesday morning. He decided not to sign the waiver and instead find a new hotel. Many of its guests are tourists from other countries drawn by the hotel's billing as a ""European-style"" hotel that is the perfect accommodation for ""spend-thrifty travelers."" But if they take Kim Cooper's tour bus ride through the neighborhood, they would hear about the Cecil being the former temporary home to at least two convicted murderers, including ""Night Stalker"" serial killer Richard Ramirez. Ramirez paid $14 a day to stay on the 14th floor during his 1980s killing spree, Cooper said. The Cecil Hotel is ""in the heart of the action, allowing our guest to embrace the city and the surrounding areas that make Los Angeles famous,"" according to the description you'll hear when you call there and are placed on hold. In fact, the hotel is just a few blocks away from the infamous Skid Row district in downtown Los Angeles, but 16 miles from the beaches of Santa Monica, eight miles from Hollywood's Walk of Fame and 12 miles from glamorous streets of Beverly Hills that are prominently featured on the Cecil's website. If you want a reservation at the Cecil you will have to wait until next month. The website said the hotel is ""sold out"" until March 1.  After then, you can book a room for $65.

"(CNN) -- Someone conducted keyword searches on ""chloroform"" using a desktop computer located in the home Casey Anthony shared with her parents, a computer examiner testified Wednesday in Anthony's capital murder trial. The searches were found in a portion of the computer's hard drive that indicated they had been deleted, Detective Sandra Osborne of the Orange County Sheriff's Office testified. However, she told jurors, deleted material remains on a computer's hard drive and can be retrieved until it is overwritten by new data. It had not been overwritten on the Anthonys' computer, she said, and ""a complete Internet history"" was obtained. Anthony, 25, faces seven counts in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. The toddler's family last saw her on June 16, 2008, but no one alerted police until July 15, when the girl's maternal grandmother tracked down the suspect and demanded answers. Prosecutors allege Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and suffocated her by putting duct tape over the little girl's mouth and nose. They allege Anthony put her daughter's body in her car trunk before disposing of it. Caylee's skeletal remains were found in December 2008, less than a mile from the home of Anthony's parents. Anthony has pleaded not guilty and denied having anything to do with her daughter's death. Defense attorney Jose Baez has said that when all the facts are known, it will become clear his client is innocent. The searches using the keyword ""chloroform"" were conducted in March, three months before Caylee disappeared, according to testimony. It appears the computer user first searched for ""chloraform"" on Google and received results for ""chloroform,"" said John Bradley, owner of the software development company that created the software used to retrieve the data. One of the search results was from Wikipedia.org, which was accessed, he testified. It also appeared searches were conducted using terms such as ""inhalation,"" ""self-defense,"" ""meningeal artery,"" ""ruptured spleen,"" ""alcohol"" and ""head injury,"" he said. The user either typed those terms in to search, Bradley said, or in some instances might have clicked on links on the Wikipedia site to go to a different page. Searches were also conducted on ""how to make chloroform,"" ""neck breaking"" and ""making weapons out of household products,"" Bradley testified. During his cross-examination, Baez attempted to show that the user apparently did not spend a great deal of time looking at the pages referencing chloroform. Only a few seconds elapsed in some cases before the next site was accessed, Bradley said. Bradley agreed with Baez's assertion that the links do not tell jurors what was on the websites accessed, and that some could have been jokes or information on self-defense. He also agreed he could not say how closely the user was examining the websites or whether a user was looking at multiple browsers. While there were two user-created profiles on the computer, Osborne told Baez she could not tell who performed the searches. She also testified she found no reference to chloroform on a computer belonging to Ricardo Morales, Anthony's former boyfriend. Shown a photo Morales earlier admitted posting on his MySpace page featuring a couple with the caption, ""Win her over with chloroform,"" Osborne said either it had been deleted and overwritten or posted from another computer. She said a keyword search would not necessarily have located the picture, since the keyword was embedded in pixels in the picture. Morales earlier testified he posted the photo as a joke. Osborne said she also was asked to find any records on the computer relating to a Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. Anthony told authorities Gonzalez, who had been Caylee's nanny for years, abducted her. Osborne testified she found searches for Gonzalez on people search sites, Google and high school class reunion sites, along with the social networking site MySpace. All of those searches were conducted on July 16, 2008 -- the day after Caylee was reported missing to authorities, she testified. But Osborne said she found no searches for Gonzalez before that date, another blow to Anthony's claims to authorities that she had been frantically searching for Gonzalez and her daughter during the month before police were notified Caylee was missing. Anthony's former boyfriend, friends and acquaintances who saw her during that time recalled her shopping, eating out, going to parties and hitting nightclubs, but all of them testified she never mentioned her missing daughter and none of them noticed any change in her demeanor. Her mother testified that Anthony had moved out of her parents' home about the time Caylee went missing, offering little in the way of explanation, and that when she inquired after Caylee, she was told she was with her nanny. Police were never able to find the nanny. They did find a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez, who denied ever meeting Anthony or Caylee and later sued for defamation. Earlier Wednesday, jurors heard testimony that a second cadaver dog alerted to the potential scent of human remains in the backyard of the Anthony home, but -- like the first dog -- failed to do so again once land in that area was disturbed. Within three to four minutes of being given a command to search in the yard, ""I saw there was an area of interest he kept going back to and sniffing pretty hard,"" Osceola County, Florida, sheriff's Sgt. Kristin Brewer said of her dog, Bones. The dog made a second lap around the backyard and then gave his final alert -- sitting down, she said. The alert was within six to eight feet of that made the same day, July 17, 2008, by another cadaver dog, named Gerus, Brewer said -- although she did not find that out until afterward. She said she and Bones returned to the Anthony home the following day, but several crime scene units were working there and ""a lot of dirt, mulch, pavers ... changed the landscape quite a bit."" Bones did not alert to any locations in the yard on the second search, she said. Gerus also did not alert the second day, Gerus' handler, Orange County sheriff's Deputy Jason Forgey, testified Tuesday. Gerus also alerted to the smell of human remains in the trunk of Anthony's car, Forgey testified Tuesday. When the dog passed around Anthony's white Pontiac Sunfire on July 17, 2008, ""he started indicating in the rear of the vehicle,"" Forgey said. ""I could tell he was working something."" After the trunk was opened, Gerus put his front paws inside and then lay down, signaling that he had detected the scent of remains. Forgey explained the conflicting results in the Anthony backyard by saying that he believed Gerus alerted to a scent on the surface of the land. Once technicians disturbed the surface, he said, the scent was diminished ""where the dog wouldn't find it. It was gone at that point."" On cross-examination, however, Forgey said he does not know the real reason behind the conflicting alerts. Still, he said, ""in every single time (Gerus has) had an alert besides this case, he's had a find,"" that is, he found remains. Brewer offered a similar explanation on Wednesday. ""Whatever he was alerting to could have been moved or destroyed or dissipated because of all the work that had been done,"" she said, ""or they may just not have dug enough to find what was below the surface."" A crime scene investigator, the operator of a towing company and members of Anthony's family all have testified they smelled a bad odor coming from Anthony's car after it was found abandoned in a parking lot on June 27, 2008, and then towed four days later. A bag of trash found in the trunk, which had been sitting there for weeks during a Florida summer, has been suggested as a possible source of the odor. But Forgey told Burdick his dog does not alert on trash, and has been trained around garbage. Forgey told Baez that he's smelled human decomposition on numerous occasions and ""I smelled it clear as day"" in Anthony's car. Also Tuesday, FBI forensic chemist Michael Rickenbach testified he analyzed pieces of Anthony's trunk liner, carpet and parts of the spare tire cover, among other items. On those, he said, chloroform ""residue"" was found, but it was at low levels. But he did not want to offer specific levels, saying it would not be appropriate because he conducted qualitative testing, confirming chloroform's presence, rather than quantitative testing, which would detect its level. Under questioning from prosecutor Jeff Ashton, Rickenbach said the samples were sent to him in a cardboard box, not a sealed container, which could have allowed some of the chloroform to evaporate, lowering the levels present. Having the car trunk open for a time might also lower the levels, he said. On Monday, Arpad Vass, a senior research scientist at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, testified that the presence of chloroform on a carpet sample from the trunk was found at a ""shockingly high"" level -- far beyond what normally would be seen in environmental samples. Both Vass and Rickenbach tested the carpet inside the trunk. However, Vass, who is not a chemist, was attempting to find compounds associated with human decomposition. Rickenbach was specifically testing for the presence of chloroform. Vass told jurors in the Orlando courtroom that the presence of a decomposing human body is the only plausible explanation for the odor in Anthony's trunk and the results found in forensic testing.

"This academic year, the major lesson in America's public schools will be on the civil war. No, not that Civil War. I'm talking about the brawl between what are usually ideological allies. Conservative vs. conservative, liberal vs. liberal. On the left, the Obama administration, the Department of Education and Secretary Arne Duncan are scrapping with allies in the teachers' unions. On the right, pro-accountability education reformers are battling supporters of local control who think the federal government should butt out of the education business. This war won't be won or lost in boardrooms, classrooms or conference rooms but in the worlds of politics and public relations. You might have a powerful idea to reform the education system. But if you don't spend the time, money and effort fashioning an effective communication strategy to sell it, you're toast. You can't bring a policy paper to a Twitter fight. Take Common Core. You might think the word ""common"" describes the shared success that we'd like students to have. If you take underperforming schools and less-demanding curricula in some states and raise them to a level where they compare to higher-performing schools in states with more demanding curriculum, you give students a ""common"" experience. For the disadvantaged, this is a good thing. But for those parents who are happy with the education system and content with the product, the word ""common"" can be terrifying. They worry about a one-size-fits-all process that holds back high achievers so all students in different schools and different states get the same level of education, even if the results students have in common are mediocre. Here's a quiz about one of the most controversial -- and poorly marketed -- stabs at education reform in recent years. Common Core is ... a. A good and harmless idea that has been unfairly maligned by a small band of critics on the left and the right. b. A reasonable concept that has been poorly executed and terribly communicated by the elites who devised it. c. A nonsensical method of teaching that reeks of a big government and corporate takeover of the public schools. d. A gigantic ""fail"" that is taking on water faster than the Titanic after the ship hit the iceberg. e. All of the above. The answer is e. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Exactly. That is precisely what the opponents of Common Core say about, for instance, its meandering method of teaching math. Equations that could once be solved in two steps now take six or seven. The sad part is that the idea was good to begin with: develop a common curriculum that outlines what students should know at every grade level so that students attending different schools in different states get roughly the same education. What good does it do society to have a high school diploma in Mississippi that doesn't compare to one in Massachusetts? Forty-five states and the District of Columbia signed on to Common Core right out of the gate a couple of years ago, and the federal government provided grant money. But not long thereafter, 10 states -- including Indiana, Oklahoma, Missouri and Iowa -- dropped out. More are likely to follow. All of this seems familiar. In the 1960s and 1970s, Americans grappled with ""new math,"" a dramatic change in how math was taught in elementary schools that was prompted in part by the federal government's desire to ratchet up teaching of math and science. Some complained and thought traditional ways of teaching math were better. In the 1980s and 1990s, Americans were rattled again when they were introduced to ""whole language"" instruction as a new way of teaching students to read by encouraging them to think strategically about the meaning of words, phrases and sentences in their entirety. Again, there were critics. Now, here we are again: at each other's throats over a concept that many people don't even understand. There are lessons in this debacle for both sides. Common Core supporters can't concoct a new national curriculum and then fail to effectively communicate what they did, why they did it and what effect it's going to have on kids. Politics is a reality. Learn to navigate it, or stay out of the arena. And elitism and condescension are better repellents than bug spray. Opponents have to shelve the ""look out for No. 1"" approach to education. Americans are part of a collective with public roads, public libraries, public schools. How other people's kids are doing in other states is your problem, just like, one day, paying for your Social Security and Medicare will be theirs. I hope that the people behind the new curriculum have learned some humility and are ready to show us why we should listen to them. And I hope more states stick with the Common Core and give it another chance.","Ruben Navarrette: The debate over the pros and cons of Common Core rages on .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Promising to return America to the ""moral high ground"" in the war on terrorism, President Obama issued three executive orders Thursday to demonstrate a clean break from the Bush administration, including one requiring that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility be closed within a year. President Obama signs the order requiring that the Guantanamo Bay facility be closed within a year. During a signing ceremony at the White House, Obama reaffirmed his inauguration pledge that the United States does not have ""to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals."" The president said he was issuing the order to close the facility in order to ""restore the standards of due process and the core constitutional values that have made this country great even in the midst of war, even in dealing with terrorism."" A second executive order formally bans torture by requiring that the Army field manual be used as the guide for terrorism interrogations. That essentially ends the Bush administration's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods. ""We believe that the Army field manual reflects the best judgment of our military, that we can abide by a rule that says we don't torture, but that we can still effectively obtain the intelligence that we need,"" Obama said.  Watch Obama sign the orders » . ""This is me following through ... on an understanding that dates back to our founding fathers, that we are willing to observe core standards of conduct not just when it's easy but also when it's hard.""  Watch Obama vow that the ""U.S. will not torture"" » . A third executive order establishes an interagency task force to lead a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases. The task force, Obama stated, will also ""provide me with information in terms of how we are able to deal [with] the disposition of some of the detainees that may be currently in Guantanamo that we cannot transfer to other countries, who could pose a serious danger to the United States."" The president also signed a memorandum requesting a delay in the Supreme Court's hearing of the case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a legal U.S. resident contesting his detention for more than five years as an enemy combatant. He has been held in a military brig without the government bringing any charges against him. Al-Marri's case is scheduled to be heard by the high court in March or April. Al-Marri ""is clearly a dangerous individual,"" Obama said. ""We have asked for a delay in going before the Supreme Court to properly review the evidence against him."" During the second Bush term, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay became a lightning rod for critics who charged the Bush administration with torturing terrorist suspects. President George W. Bush and other senior officials repeatedly denied that the U.S. government had used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects.  Watch experts debate the Guantanamo dilemma » . The decision to close the detention facility received immediate backing from Obama's general election opponent, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain. McCain, in a joint statement with South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, said he supported Obama's decision to ""reaffirm America's adherence to the Geneva Conventions, and begin a process that will, we hope, lead to the resolution of all cases of Guantanamo detainees."" Thursday night on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" McCain said he thinks the new president may have been hasty in the decision and should have taken the time to consider everything associated with closing the camp before forcing himself into a timetable. Specifically, McCain said he thought Obama needed to consider what would happen to the prisoners held at Guantanamo before ordering the facility to be closed. ""So, the easy part, in all due respect, is to say we're going to close Guantanamo,"" McCain said. ""Then I think I would have said where they were going to be taken. Because you're going to run into a NIMBY [not in my backyard] problem here in the United States of America."" A number of congressional Republicans criticized Obama's decision. ""We cannot risk going back to the politically correct national security policies that left us vulnerable in the lead-up to 9/11,"" Michigan GOP Rep. Peter Hoekstra, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a written statement. ""Without a clear plan for the detention and interrogation of captured terrorists and combatants, we are unnecessarily risking the safety of our nation."" Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, an outspoken critic of the Bush administration, praised the action, calling it ""a first key step in restoring America's image and credibility in the world."" ""The Bush administration never understood what the Guantanamo detention facility symbolized to the rest of the world,"" Murtha said in a written statement. ""They saw it as simply a prison. ... The problem with Guantanamo was never about its bricks and mortar. The problem with Guantanamo is that its very existence stains and defies the moral fiber of our great nation."" Obama's move highlights a fierce struggle over where the prison's detainees will go next. iReport.com: Closing Guantanamo is a ""risk"" Asked about that issue Thursday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, ""We have developed some options in terms of how many we think could be returned to other countries to take them. That diplomatic initiative has not started. That will await work in carrying out the executive order."" ""We have identified a number of possible prisons here in the United States"" that could take the detainees. However, Gates added, ""I've heard from members of Congress [representing] where all those prisons are located. Their enthusiasm is limited.""  Watch what may happen to Guantanamo's inmates » . Rep. Bill Young, R-Florida, said he has ""quite a bit of anxiety"" about the possibility of transferring detainees to U.S. facilities. ""Number one, they're dangerous,"" Young said. ""Secondly, once they become present in the United States, what is their legal status? What is their constitutional status? I worry about that, because I don't want them to have the same constitutional rights that you and I have. They're our enemy.""

"U.S. veterans are dying because of delays in diagnosis and treatment at VA hospitals. At least 19 veterans have died because of delays in simple medical screenings like colonoscopies or endoscopies, at various VA hospitals or clinics, CNN has learned. That's according to an internal document from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, obtained exclusively by CNN, that deals with patients diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and 2011. Hospital delays are killing war vets . The veterans were part of 82 vets who have died or are dying or have suffered serious injuries as a result of delayed diagnosis or treatment for colonoscopies or endoscopies. Barry Coates is one of the veterans who has suffered from a delay in care. Coates was having excruciating pain and rectal bleeding in 2011. For a year the Army veteran went to several VA clinics and hospitals in South Carolina, trying to get help. But the VA's diagnosis was hemorrhoids, and aside from simple pain medication he was told he might need a colonoscopy. Congress demands answers on VA deaths . ""The problem was getting worse and I was having more pain,"" Coates said, talking about one specific VA doctor who he saw every few months. ""She again examined me and gave me some prescriptions for other things as far as pain and stuff like that and I noticed again she made another comment -- 'may need colonoscopy.' ""I told her that something needed to be done,"" said Coates. ""But nothing was ever set up ... a consult was never set up."" ""I had already been in pain and suffering from this problem for over six months and it wasn't getting better,"" Coates said. ""I told her that if you were in as much pain as I was and had been going through you wouldn't wait another two months to see what's going on. You would probably do it this week."" Coates waited months, even begging for an appointment to have his colonoscopy. But he only found himself on a growing list of veterans also waiting for appointments and procedures. He was finally told he could have a colonoscopy, many months later. ""I took it upon my own self to call the department that scheduled that and ask them about it. And they said this was the earliest appointment that I could get. And I explained to the lady what I had already been through and how much pain I had, and I said if I wait this long there might not be ... (anything) we can do about it then. I could be even dead by then. And the only thing she could tell me was 'I understand that, sir, but I don't have any control over that.' "" Finally about a year after first complaining to his doctors of the pain, Coates got a colonoscopy and doctors discovered a cancerous tumor the size of a baseball. The now 44-year-old veteran is undergoing chemotherapy in an effort to save his life. It is unclear whether anyone responsible at the VA has been fired, demoted or even admonished for the delays in care and treatment. Some of the people responsible may have even received bonuses in recent years for their work, despite the delays in care or treatment for the veterans. According to the document obtained by CNN, 10 veterans are confirmed to have died in the South Carolina and Georgia region alone. And the document shows 29 vets or their families were sent the disclosures, notifying them they had serious ""adverse events"" because of delayed care. And according to the document the problems go far beyond Georgia or South Carolina. In the Florida region, five veterans are dead, and 14 vets or their families were sent the disclosures, notified that they suffered ""adverse events"" because of delayed or denied care or diagnosis, according to the exclusive document. In the Rocky Mountain region, two veterans died, and four families were sent the disclosures or notified. In the Texas region, seven vets or their families were sent disclosures about adverse events and serious injuries suffered because of delayed care. Coates filed a legal claim, citing the ""failure of the Columbia (South Carolina) VA Medical Center to timely diagnose his rectal cancer.""  The VA settled, but admitted no wrong-doing. ""I don't know what my outcome is going to be,"" said Coates. ""I just try to live every day like it's my last day."" The new document obtained by CNN shows a worse problem than has previously been made public by the VA. As CNN has previously reported,  as many as 7,000 veterans were on a backlog list -- waiting too long for colonscopies or endoscopies -- at VA facilities in Columbia, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia. After CNN's detailed accounting of dela-related deaths at the Columbia and Augusta VA hospitals, a bi-partisan group of Congressmen visited the hospitals, demanding answers. ""We have a duty to make sure that the veterans who serve get the best health care possible,"" said Rep. John Barrow, D-Georgia. ""And it is very obvious that for too long and for too many folks that hasn't happened."" The VA said the backlog at those two hospitals has been solved, but that is not a good enough explanation for Rep. Jeff Miller, the chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. ""The fact that we've had veterans who have died in the very facilities that are supposed to be taking care of them, and not by natural means, by means that could have been prevented is egregious,"" said Miller, R-Florida. ""And it's not acceptable."" Miller said the VA, from the top down, has consistently ignored his committee's requests to find out who is responsible. Even with the delays in care which have led to deaths and serious injuries, the congressman said not a single person has been fired or even demoted, and in fact some of those responsible may have even gotten bonuses. ""I grieve for the families who lost loved ones that could have been with them this Christmas that would be celebrating 2014 today had the backlog not existed,"" said Miller. ""That's not what anybody in this country wants for our veterans."" He said the lack of accountability is what angers him most. ""That's why we asked the question again today, with members of the South Carolina delegation and Georgia delegation, tell us exactly who was disciplined and how. I don't want to hear the excuse anymore that  'It was multi-faceted. ...There were many people involved' ""  said Miller. ""Well if there were many people involved then they all need to go. We are not asking for one particular person, we want to know exactly why things happened and who was held responsible, At this point publicly, we haven't seen anybody held responsible."" CNN has made repeated requests for interviews with top officials at the VA, including President Obama's appointed head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Secretary Eric Shinseki. The requests have all been denied, or ignored. The VA did issue a written statement from Dr. Robert Petzel, the Under Secretary for Health at the department of Veterans Affairs.  In the statement, Petzel wrote that ""The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cares deeply for every Veteran we are privileged to serve.  Our goal is to provide the best quality, safe and effective health care our Veterans have earned and deserve.  We take seriously any issue that occurs at any one of the more than 1,700 VA health care facilities across the country."" He also stated: ""As a result of the consult delay issue VA discovered at two of our medical centers, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) conducted a national review of consults across the system.  We have redesigned the consult process to better monitor consult timeliness.  We continue to take action to strengthen oversight mechanisms and prevent a similar delay at another VA medical center.  We take any issue of this nature extremely seriously and offer our sincerest condolences to families and individuals who have been affected and lost a loved one."" In August 2007, presidential candidate Barack Obama gave a campaign speech to veterans specifically addressing wait lists, denied care and poor treatment of vets. He promised his administration would be different. ""No veteran should have to fill out a 23-page claim to get care, or wait months -- even years -- to get an appointment at the VA,"" said then-candidate Obama. ""When we fail to keep faith with our veterans, the bond between our nation and our nation's heroes becomes frayed. When a veteran is denied care, we are all dishonored."" But Coates said for him the speech is an empty promise. ""Someone needs to stand and face the person who suffered and the veterans who have died and say, 'Hey it was me, I let the ball drop,' "" he said. ""How many lives are we going to lose from this?"" ""When is it going to be corrected?""","CNN has learned 19 veterans died because of delays in basic screenings .

"(CNN)A former star player of its arch city rival Tottenham Hotspur returned to the Emirates Stadium to leave Arsenal's Champions League hopes in tatters. Bulgarian international Dimitar Berbatov now plays for AS Monaco and scored the second goal in the French Ligue 1 side's shock 3-1 win in the last 16, first leg tie Wednesday. On a night of upsets, Hakan Calhanoglu's sublime second half strike gave Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 home leg win over last season's finalists Atletico Madrid. Spanish title holder Atletico also had Tiago sent off for a second yellow card late in the game and saw an equalizing effort from substitute Fernando Torres chalked off because it was ruled the ball had gone out of play before he scored. Tiago had been denied by home keeper Bernd Leno in the best chance of the match for the visitors. Its coach Diego Simeone summed up the match but still believes his team has a fighting chance of progressing. ""We each had a clear chance, they took theirs and we didn't. It could have been a worse result,"" he said. English Premier League Arsenal was a strong favorite to progress when the draw for the knockout stage was made, but Monaco absorbed early pressure before going ahead just before halftime from a counterattack. Joao Moutinho found Geoffrey Kondogbia, whose fierce shot took a slight deflection off Per Mertesacker and flew past David Ospina in the Gunners goal. German international Mertesacker was at fault for the second just after the break as he was caught out of position and allowed  Anthony Martial to find Berbatov. The striker, who played for Manchester United and Fulham after leaving Tottenham, controlled the pass instantly before firing an unstoppable shot high into the net. Trailing 2-0 Arsenal desperately sought a reply and both Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck were guilty of glaring misses in front of goal. Monaco also remained a threat on the break and Berbatov and the excellent Moutinho combined to set up Martial for a chance which Ospina blocked. Arsenal was given late hope when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored in injury time with a curling strike from just outside the penalty area. But its chances of going through took a nosedive when Oxlade-Chamberlain turned from hero to culprit when he lost the ball on the halfway line. Winger Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, who had come on as a late substitute for Berbatov, raced clear and scored with an emphatic strike. It left it a desperately disappointing night for Arsenal and its manager Arsene Wenger, who forged his reputation as manager of Monaco before coming to the English Premier League. And prospects for the second leg scarcely look any better, with Monaco having an excellent defensive record in the Champions League and holding three away goals. ""We are confident in our ability and we deserved to win,"" Berbatov told Sky Sports. ""We wanted to win more than them and were fighting all over the pitch,"" added the 34-year-old veteran. Wenger admitted that his team face an uphill battle to reach the quarterfinals with the handicap of a two-goal deficit. ""The task is massive now, the third goal makes it even more difficult but we will have a go.""","Arsenal beaten 3-1 at home by AS Monaco in Champions League .

"(CNN)Islamist militants freed about 250 Yazidis held captive for more than six months in Iraq, a local official said Sunday. Most of those released Saturday were children and the elderly, said Saman Jabari, the Kurdistan Democratic Party leader. Once they were freed, they walked up to a Peshmerga checkpoint southwest of the city of Kirkuk, according to Jabari. They are now under the care of Kurdish authorities. Yazidis are among Iraq's smallest minorities. They are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism.

"Those trying to draw conclusions from the information trickling from the investigation into the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 should go carefully. It is plausible that, as Malaysia's Prime Minister asserted, the plane's flying for hours after losing contact with air traffic control was ""consistent with deliberate action,"" but it's not the only logical explanation of the airplane's bewildering trajectory. Statements that the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System was intentionally disabled, for example, leave out the fact that the ACARS is required to send the satellite contact requests (so-called ""handshakes"") that, according to news reports, were reported to have occurred for hours after the flight's disappearance. The plane has multiple functions and channels connected to the ACARS and at least some of it must have still been working. For example, one part of this communications system is used for messages between the airplane and air traffic control (clearances, position reports, etc). Another is used to communicate, essentially with text messages, between the airplane and the airline. Messages can also be sent automatically for maintenance functions such as reporting faults and sending routine engine data. The range of functions that would have been available for someone to disable is not yet clear. And at least one news report described altitude excursions between 45,000 feet and 23,000, which one pilot suggested might have been done willfully to render passengers unconscious. But this strikes me as behavior that would also be consistent with the airplane flying completely unattended with the autopilot off. Though these oscillations are larger than I might expect, it would be a natural behavior for the airplane to fly relatively large but gentle pitch oscillations. This would be true especially if the airplane's auto-throttles were also for some reason disabled. There have been statements made that such changes could only be made by a skilled aviator, but what ""skilled aviator"" cannot hold altitude within 20,000 feet? Incapacitation or something else that could prevent the crew from controlling the plane -- fire, collision, explosive depressurization -- could also be indicated, which wouldn't necessarily mean the cockpit was breached by anyone. The airplane reportedly made ""suspicious turns."" However, it is the nature of those turns that will reveal if it was deliberate ""heading"" (directional) changes or if nobody was flying the airplane at all. If the autopilot was off and the airplane was essentially flying on its own, I would expect a variety of heading changes. These changes could be initiated by turbulence during flight. If the airplane's routes were controlled intentionally by selecting the heading or by programming the flight management computer, the flight path would be very straight, then a turn that would last usually from 10 to 30 seconds, followed by more straight flight. While a close-up analysis of the flight path would be required to determine the case, it seems that officials are not even sure if the flight path headed northwest toward Pakistan or southwest into the vast Indian Ocean. On the technical side, the Boeing 777-200ER is a fly-by-wire airplane -- that is, movement of the controls is converted into electrical signals that interact with flight-control computers and instruct the plane's control surfaces on the wings and tail. Its characteristics may be able to explain much of the airplane's behavior. With the autopilot off, the airplane will adjust the pitch (the up or down movement of the nose of the plane) to maintain a speed set by the pilot. It will pitch up if it's going faster than the desired speed and pitch down if slower. This is called pitch trim. Anyone who has flown even a small aircraft will be familiar with this concept. Therefore, when disturbed, it will fly a series of pitch changes as it settles down on the trimmed airspeed. Pitch protections built into the system ensure that the airplane never goes too fast or too slow. Temporary input on the control wheel, or changes in the airplane's weight as it burns off fuel, temperature and other normal atmospheric changes along the course can initiate the altitude changes as the airplane continues to seek its trimmed speed. Heading changes are also what I would expect to see in an autopilot-off situation. The 777's fly-by-wire roll control law controls the tilt of the wings. The airplane would be subject to atmospheric disturbances that could act to tip a wing up every now and then, but built-in protections prevent the plane from exceeding bank angles in excess of 35°. While a conventional airplane would tend to spiral down in that situation, the 777 incorporates automatic pitch compensation, so the airplane could easily hold its altitude in these turns. The fly-by-wire control system on the 777 makes it a very stable airplane, capable of flying for hours with the autopilot off without crashing. If the flight path can be shown to be very straight lines with neat turns followed by another straight line, then I would throw out the ""autopilot-off"" theory, but it seems as though officials can't even determine where the plane was heading, much less the nature and cause of some heading changes. The consistent theme in the mystery of this flight has been very little data, and the exact nature of that scant data is vague and changing. Whatever exact scenario can account for the possible incapacitation or deliberate actions of the crew, the loss of the transponder and other communications and the airplane's mysterious flight path is likely to be a situation we have not seen before. I would urge that we not jump to conclusions based on inconclusive evidence. The evidence we have may be ""consistent with deliberate acts,"" but it is also consistent with other explanations as well.","Bill Palmer: Deliberate acts are not the only possibility in disappearance of Malaysia flight .
He says it's not clear what systems, such as ACARS, were turned off and when .
Palmer: Descent reported might be from 777 adjusting to no autopilot, not deliberate act .
Palmer: Much of 777 behavior could be from built-in systems reacting; guessing inadequate ."
"New Age guru James Arthur Ray is out of prison, but the families of three acolytes who died in a sweat lodge ceremony vow to keep on eye on him if he tries to rebuild his self-help empire. Ray left an Arizona prison Friday after serving 20 months for the negligent homicides of three followers who sought spiritual breakthroughs but died of overheating in a sweat lodge near Sedona in October 2009. Ray was driven Friday afternoon from a minimum-security prison in Buckeye, said Arizona corrections spokesman Bill Lamoreaux. He did not stop to talk with the media and others at the prison gate, Lamoreaux added. Neither Ray nor his representatives could be reached for comment, but he will remain in Arizona for the next 90 days, Lamoreaux said. The 55-year-old son of an Oklahoma preacher, Ray built a multimillion-dollar business as a best-selling author and motivational coach. His book, ""Harmonic Wealth: The Secret of Attracting the Life You Want,"" made him a New Age star. He was was riding high as he planned his October 2009 Spiritual Warrior weekend at the 70-acre Angel Valley retreat outside Sedona. According to testimony at his trial, acolytes who flocked to Angel Valley's red rock foothills were willing to shave their heads, meditate in the desert for 36 hours without food and water and then symbolically die and be reborn in the sweat lodge ritual. Fifty-five people followed Ray into the sweat lodge; three died from overheating and 19 others were hospitalized after they collapsed, vomited, had trouble breathing, hallucinated, foamed at the mouth or fell unconscious. Ray was convicted of negligently causing the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; Lizbeth Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota; and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee. Ray was found negligent, but acquitted of manslaughter charges that could have sent him to prison for 30 years. Relatives of Brown, Neuman and Shore vow to keep an eye on Ray should he attempt to rebuild the self-help empire that included best-selling books, motivational seminars, speaking engagements and $10,000-a-head weekend retreats. They planned to confront Ray as he left prison and ask him to sign a ""promise"" to adhere to certain ethical practices. It was not immediately known whether they were able to do so or whether he signed. The promise also was sent this week to 160 other self-help practitioners -- including well-known personalities such as Deepak Chopra, Ram Dass, Tony Robbins, Suze Orman, Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Phil McGraw. The promise was issued by a new foundation founded in the memory Brown, an avid skier, surfer and free spirit who had a large circle of friends. Her parents, George and Ginny Brown, attended Ray's trial and founded SEEKsafely, an organization that educates consumers about the unregulated self-help industry. Members of Neuman's and Shore's families also are active in the organization, the Browns said. Ray's sweat lodge exercise was based on a Native American purification ritual ""as old as time itself,"" as Ray told participants in a recorded pep talk before the ceremony. Built of willow sticks and tarps, the lodge was 5 feet high and 23 feet across, with a pit in the middle. It was pitch-black inside, and people huddled together shoulder to shoulder. Stones heated to an orange glow -- one for each participant, 55 in all -- were added to the pit at each 15-minute round. Ray said the stones were symbolic of earthly ancestors and called them ""grandfathers."" Participants believed the ritual would lead them to powerful spiritual breakthroughs. But things started going wrong after a couple of hours. According to participants who testified during the trial, Ray ignored pleas for help, turning up the heat even as participants keeled over and were dragged from the tent. Neuman quietly hunkered down until she slipped into unconsciousness, according to testimony. Brown drew her knees to her chest and rocked back and forth, chanting, ""We can do it."" Shore carried one sickened woman out before collapsing next to Brown. Ray acknowledged at his sentencing that he was responsible for the deaths, but offered no excuses for his lack of action as the chaos unfolded. He and his attorneys maintained that he wasn't aware people were dying or in distress, or he would have stopped the ceremony. His defense centered on the possibility that toxins in the tarps contributed to the deaths. The Browns took the occasion of Ray's release from prison to draw attention to their organization, holding a news conference in Manhattan. But their focus really isn't on Ray. They want to honor their daughter's memory by informing others. ""I really don't want to spend much time watching him,"" Ginny Brown said over the telephone. ""But I feel angry that people knew he was dangerous and it wasn't public information."" She feels her daughter died needlessly, and that 20 months behind bars wasn't enough to bring about a change of heart from a man who, according to testimony at his trial, walked out of the sweat lodge where people were suffering and dying, went to his room and took a shower.","New Age guru James Arthur Ray leaves Arizona prison early .

"For the first time, a patient in an American hospital has been diagnosed with Ebola. The unidentified man, who is being treated at a Dallas hospital, didn't show symptoms until several days after he arrived in the United States from Liberia. Officials are tight-lipped about how he contracted the virus or how he's being treated, citing privacy concerns. But shortly after the news broke Tuesday evening, more than 50,000 tweets about Ebola flew through Twitter in a one-hour period, many of them panicked responses. Should we be concerned? The short answer: no. Now let's get to the long answer. Could the patient's fellow passengers be infected? The patient being treated in Texas flew from one of the Ebola hot zones -- Liberia -- to Dallas. But his fellow passengers aren't thought to be at risk because you can only contract Ebola through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who's actively sick with it. It's not like a cold or the flu, which can be spread before symptoms show up. And it doesn't spread through the air. ""It's very unlikely that (Ebola victims) would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers,"" said Stephan Monroe of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What's to stop other Ebola patients from getting on a flight and coming here? The CDC has issued warnings to avoid nonessential travel to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the countries hit the hardest by  the outbreak. And it's also working with airport officials in those nations, and in Nigeria, so every person getting on a plane is screened for fever. ""And if they have a fever, they are pulled out of the line, assessed for Ebola and don't fly unless Ebola is ruled out,"" CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said. How do airport authorities know what to look for? Those stricken with Ebola suffer ghastly symptoms -- including vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, fever and unexplained bleeding. That's part of the reason why the odds of getting Ebola from plane passengers is very low, the International Air Transport Association said. ""It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel."" What's being done when the planes land in the U.S.? The United States isn't planning on banning flights coming from the hot zones in West Africa, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in August. But once flights land at a U.S. airport from one of those countries, passengers are screened again. ""And there are facilities available that if an individual is detected exhibiting these symptoms, that they can be quarantined and promptly evaluated by a medical professional,"" Earnest said. Are those procedures being followed? CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said when she and two colleagues recently returned from reporting in Liberia, they got a mixed bag of responses from Customs and Border Protection officers. ""We all said we were journalists who had just been in Liberia covering Ebola,"" Cohen said. ""One of my colleagues was told, 'Oh, OK, welcome back home, sir' -- and (was) just let in -- that was it."" Cohen herself got a different response. ""I was told, 'Wait a minute, I think I got an email about this,' and the border patrol officer went and consulted with his colleagues,"" Cohen said. That officer later told her she should check her system for 21 days. ""I said, 'What should I be checking?' And he wasn't sure,"" Cohen said. The third colleague merely had his boots checked to see if there was mud on them. ""Three very different responses. They can't all be the way to do it,"" Cohen said. ""I was surprised at how sort of chaotic it felt."" So, how did Dallas patient slip through? The Ebola patient in Dallas didn't start showing symptoms until several days after he landed in the United States, Frieden said. Isn't he putting others at risk? The paramedics who took the patient to the hospital have been isolated, the chief of staff for Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNN. They have not shown symptoms of the disease so far. The ambulance that carried the patient -- ambulance No. 37 -- was in use for two days after the transport but was properly decontaminated, said Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed. Frieden said the patient himself had a handful of contacts with people after he fell ill and before he was isolated -- a period of about four days. A CDC team arrived in Texas to investigate the people who came in contact with the man. Those people will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop symptoms. If they do, they'll be isolated. ""It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks,"" Frieden said. ""But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here."" How is this not concerning? Although there's no vaccine and no cure, the one real advantage we have with Ebola is that doctors know how to control it. Ebola isn't ""some mystical pathogen (with) some bizarre mode of transmission,"" said Bruce Ribner, director of Emory University Hospital's Infectious Disease Unit. And we have the resources to contain it. How are we so confident? For starters, the United States has the luxury of better health care compared to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The U.S. has facilities that can ""do the kind of isolation that apparently is very difficult to do within the health care infrastructure in the African countries that we are talking about,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. Secondly, remember Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol? The doctor and the American missionary were infected in Liberia, brought to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, placed in isolation units, treated and discharged. They were the first humans with Ebola to ever arrive in the United States. And they are now fine.","Unlike a cold or the flu, Ebola cannot be transmitted before symptoms show up .

"It was three years ago that people across the nation and around the world held their breath. After a two-month trial, the jury in the Casey Anthony murder trial announced they had arrived at a verdict. Anthony was found not guilty of first-degree murder and the other most serious charges against her in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter. The nation was first introduced to Casey Anthony in July 2008. The country fell in love with her precious daughter, Caylee, who had gone missing in Orlando, Florida. A massive missing persons search for the little girl ensued. Police were suspicious of what Anthony, then 22, was telling them. She lied about her nanny taking the child. She lied about working at Universal Studios. Anthony suddenly became the most hated woman in America. On July 16, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of child neglect. Her attorney was an unknown Florida lawyer named Jose Baez. A Florida grand jury indicted Anthony on capital murder charges October 14, 2008.  A utility worker found Caylee's skeletal remains in a wooded area near the Anthony home in December 2008, and several months later, prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty. Florida v. Casey Anthony: A look back at evidence and testimony . Watching in the wings was another Florida lawyer, Cheney Mason. A former president of the Florida Association of Criminal Lawyers, Mason, who just that year had been selected by Florida Monthly magazine as one of Florida's top lawyers, was disgusted with the local media coverage about the relatively inexperienced Baez. ""I was offended by it. I was offended by the fact that he wasn't being treated fairly. I didn't know Baez. I had never met him,"" Mason said. Baez started asking Mason, a Florida death penalty qualified attorney, for advice. That propelled Mason to want to meet Anthony. He remembers going to the Orange County jail to introduce himself. ""They brought her to the room, and I have to tell you I was really surprised to see how small she is ... how tiny she is. I stood looking at a child herself. I said this can't be,"" he said. I sat down with Mason exclusively to talk with him about his new book, ""Justice in America."" In it, he insists that the jury got it right, and the rest of the country had it wrong. ""Could she look you in the eye?"" I asked. ""Oh yes,"" Mason responded, describing her demeanor as quiet, afraid and unsure. After that meeting, with Anthony's approval, Mason decided to join the team pro bono. He said the unpaid time he spent on the case ""was well over a million dollars"" and cost him tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. Mason said in the years before trial, he normally met with Anthony in a lunch room at the jail. The jail would clear everyone out before Anthony came in. A stationary video camera in the room was positioned on their conversations, so he and Anthony would cover their mouths and speak in low tones to each other, Mason said. Shortly before jury selection was to begin, Mason got word that Anthony's handwritten letters describing sexual abuse at the hands of her father were going to be made public under Florida's open records law. He believed it was only right that Anthony's parents, George and Cindy, were warned. He called them to his office late on a Friday afternoon. ""We had them one at a time come into my personal office and made the announcement: 'Monday's going to be a bad day for you George. I felt man to man I would tell you in advance."""" Mason said George Anthony's reaction was ""basically none."" ""He looked at me ... I turned sideways a little bit, he clapped his hands down on his thighs -- let out a big sigh but didn't say anything,"" Mason said. ""He never admitted doing anything,"" Mason said. ""All we had were the letters and (separately) the statements Casey had made to the psychiatrist."" Next it was Cindy Anthony's turn. ""We called Mom in, Cindy, and told her and she immediately welled up with emotion, cried, was very upset,"" Mason said. Once a jury was selected it was time for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Baez gave the opening statements. In the midst of telling the jury what the evidence would show, he delivered a bombshell that turned the case on its head by telling the jury that his client was a victim of sexual abuse by her father. The country was stunned and so was Mason, who was sitting next to Anthony in the courtroom. ""I didn't know that he was going to say that. We had talked about all aspects of it, and I did not know. I don't know if anybody knew that he was going to say that other than himself,"" Mason recalled. I asked Mason if he was concerned the defense would not be able to establish this with evidence as promised during the opening statement. Mason said he was. ""Yes, I was concerned about that because I knew we didn't have the ability to prove that unless George got on the stand and confessed,"" he said. The prosecution responded by making George Anthony its first witness. The first question Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton asked him was whether he had sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony responded with a definitive no. The trial went on for weeks. Witness after witness took the stand for the prosecution in the largely circumstantial case.  They finally rested their case on June 15, 2011. Then it was the defense's turn. Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered at all. They said the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool, and that Casey Anthony and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. Casey Anthony: 'I didn't kill my daughter' In the midst of the defense case, Mason described how out-of-court conversations with the prosecution suddenly turned to possible plea discussions. Anthony was approached with the possibility. ""Casey got very angry about that. She got very angry to hear talk about it. She didn't want to hear it."" Mason said. ""Casey would fight it 'til her last breath. She didn't kill her daughter."" Mason said he believes it took a lot of courage and strength for Anthony to end any talk of a plea agreement. She knew what was at stake in this death penalty trial. So, plea discussions were stopped in their tracks, Mason said, and the trial went on. Then, on July 5, 2011, after deliberating for 10 hours, jurors announced they had reached a verdict. ""She was holding her breath like a deep sea diver, waiting as we all were,"" Mason said. Anthony was acquitted by the 12-person jury on the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child. But the jury convicted her on four misdemeanors of providing false information to law enforcement officers. Anthony now lives in an undisclosed location in Florida and doesn't go out of the home she is living in because of the public hate and continued threats to her life, Mason said.

"(CNN)At least 10 people and two attackers were killed in Tuesday's attack against the luxurious Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli said. Five foreigners -- one American, one French citizen, and three people from Tajikistan -- were killed in the attack, Essam al-Naas said. Five Libyans were killed. The Libyan branch of ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, and released photos of the two gunmen, it said had carried out the attacks as Abu Ibraheem Al-Tunsi and Abu Sulaiman Al-Sudani. Their naming convention indicates that the men were of Tunisian and Sudanese origin, respectively. Al-Naas said it appears the attackers were Libyans. American contractor David Berry was among the people killed in a terrorist attack at the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, on Tuesday, according to Cliff Taylor, chief executive officer of Crucible, a security firm where Berry was working. The FBI is expected to open an investigation into the incident, two U.S. officials told CNN. A State Department official confirmed the death of a U.S. citizen, but would provide no further information. A French citizen was among those killed, according to the French Foreign Ministry. Al-Naas earlier said at least two Libyan security personnel had been killed in the attack and that three gunmen were holed up in the hotel. An online group that supports ISIS said the attack was carried out in the name of Abu Anas al-Libi. Al-Libi was an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa. He was captured by U.S. special forces in Libya. He died in a U.S. hospital this month. A spokesman for the Corinthia Group in Malta told CNN there had not been a hostage situation in the hotel, as some reports suggested. ""We are trying to take possession of the hotel back to assess the damage,"" he said, but Libyan security forces were not yet allowing that. The attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel. The gunmen then shot their way into the hotel. Guests were evacuated to safety, however. The five-star hotel is popular among government officials, some of whom reside there. A witness to the events told CNN that all roads leading to the Corinthia Hotel had been sealed by security forces. People were warned to stay away, the witness said, adding that there had been exchanges of gunfire. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","Libyan branch of ISIS claims responsibility; names attackers .

"(CNN)Emile Hirsch should have probably stuck to screening movies at Sundance. The ""Lone Survivor"" actor is being charged with felony aggravated assault and intoxication, prosecuting attorney Ryan Stack of the Summit County (Utah) Attorney's Office said Thursday. Legal papers allege that Hirsch had a verbal and physical altercation with Daniele Bernfeld -- a Paramount executive -- at TAO nightclub in Park City during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in January. The early morning altercation reportedly involved Hirsch putting Bernfeld into a chokehold so forceful that she ""couldn't breathe"" and caused her to black out. Two bystanders pulled Hirsch off of Bernfeld before police arrived. Some ""redness"" was seen around Bernfeld's neck, according to authorities. The incident happened after Hirsch allegedly confronted Bernfeld, calling her a ""rich kid"" and questioning why she looked ""so tough."" Hirsch reportedly admitted to being in a verbal confrontation with Bernfeld and that he had consumed three to four drinks that evening. He also claimed that he did not know Bernfeld personally. That's not quite the same story he's sharing now. According to Hirsch's lawyer Robert Offer, he consumed an ""enormous amount of alcohol that night"" and has since checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation facility, where he currently remains. Offer says Hirsch has no memory of what happened at the time of the allegations but is ""devastated"" over the incident. Hirsch was at Sundance for the premiere of ""Ten Thousands Saints,"" in which he stars with Ethan Hawke. A Paramount representative has yet to respond to messages seeking comment. TAO declined to comment. Hirsch is due in court on March 16.","Emile Hirsch charged with felony aggravated assault and intoxication after incident at Sundance .

"The Supreme Court continued its recent hands-off approach on gun control, refusing on Monday to accept a challenge to New Jersey's restrictions on carrying weapons in public. The justices without comment let stand a state law that anyone who wants to possess a handgun outside the home for self defense first prove a ""justifiable need"" for doing so. Four gun owners in the state, backed by 19 states and several advocacy groups, argued the measure violated their Second Amendment rights. The law mandates that local police and a judge first approve such gun permits. The court has in the past year rejected similar challenges in Texas, Maryland, and New York. But all states allow at least some limited ability to carry a concealed weapon in public, often requiring ""good cause"" by an individual before a permit is issued. Vermont, Arizona, Alaska, and Wyoming do not require any permit for a concealed weapon. There are as many as 275 million guns in the United States, the Justice Department estimates. Handguns were used in three quarters of the more than 10,000 homicides involving firearms in 2005. The current debate follows the Supreme Court's landmark 2008 ruling that affirmed an individual's right to own a gun for the first time. But that divided ruling, which struck down restrictions in Washington, D.C., confined the analysis to the home. The justices left in place other gun laws, including those ""forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools."" Efforts by various groups to expand the right to the streets have mostly failed. But a federal appeals court earlier this year ruled San Diego County's limits on those seeking a concealed carry permit was unconstitutional. That could lead to a high court examination of the issue in coming months. Efforts to craft compromise gun-control legislation have stalled in Congress despite the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre in 2012 and a string of mass shootings since. The emphasis has shifted to the states where gun-rights advocates have made legislative gains. The New Jersey case is Drake v. Jerejian (13-827).","The Supreme Court let stand law requiring proof that a gun needs to be carried in public .

"(CNN)The popular image of wrestling may be of WWE superstars pretending to fight each other in luridly-colored spandex but Yogeshwar Dutt's version of the sport has a much more earthy appeal. With a battle-worn face that wears the story a thousand bouts and more, the Indian freestyle wrestler has risen from the mud wrestling pits of rural India to produce moments of unscripted theater on crash mats around the world. Today, Dutt is warming up inside the Chaudhary Devi Lal Stadium complex tumbling across a padded floor in preparation for some training bouts overseen by his coach. The vast gymnasium in the town of Sonipat, a few miles north of New Delhi has become a center of excellence for Indian wrestling in recent times with the 32-year-old becoming one of the country's most celebrated mat men. It might be easy to attribute his success -- Dutt is a double Commonwealth Games champion and an Olympic bronze medalist -- to his impressive, muscle-bound physique, but wrestling isn't just about throwing your weight around, he argues. It's also requires brain power. ""Wrestling is very different compared to other sports. It requires equal use of power as well as equal use of mind,"" Dutt told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It is usually said that wrestlers do not have a sharp mind, but the wrestler (has to) use their brain really well ... you have to take a decision to attack or defend within a second."" The indoor facility he trains in is a world away from the traditional open-air mud wrestling pit -- called Akhada -- in his home village of Bhainswal Kalan. Dutt took up the sport when he was eight years old, learning an ancient form of wrestling called Pehlwani in the mud before switching to mats during his teenage years. During his time in the sport Dutt says wrestling's popularity in India has surged. ""I have seen the difference of day and night. When I was small there was a mud pit wrestling area in my village and not a mat,"" he says. ""There was no infrastructure and facilities when we used to wrestle, but today many have turned professional and now everyone wants to be an Olympic or World champion,"" he added. ""The most important thing is wrestling was the game of the village and now it has reached the city. And now the people in the city like to play and see wrestling."" The sport's growing profile has been aided by Dutt's success and that of his contemporary Sushil Kumar, a former world champion and Olympic silver medalist. ""I've known Sushil from the days I started going to the Akhada and we used to meet each other in national matches,"" he said. ""We have been friends for the past 18 years. We have changed the mind set on wrestling in India with our friendship -- that is a really big thing."" While Kumar has enjoyed the more successful career to date, Dutt may now be entering a golden period. Last year was particularly fruitful as Dutt clinched a second Commonwealth Games title in Glasgow, Scotland in August before making history at the Asian Games the following month. When Dutt beat Tajikistan's Zalimkhan Yusupov in the final of the 65 kg freestyle final in South Korea he ended an Indian wrestling drought, winning the country's first gold medal at the Games in 28 years. It was an emotional moment for Dutt who dedicated the win to his father who died shortly before the 2006 Asian Games held in Doha, Qatar. ""It was my father's dream that I wrestle for the country and make the name of the country proud,"" Dutt said. Dutt's recent good run might have come earlier had he not been plagued by injuries. His cauliflower ears are testament to a life spent grappling with opponents -- head, neck and back injuries have all sidelined him for extended periods. But it was injuries to his knees that have threatened to permanently derail his career. Tears to both the anterior and medial cruciate ligament of his right knee following the 2008 Beijing Olympics required two operations and 10 months out of the sport. Dutt completed a triumphant return to action in 2010 winning the Commonwealth Games title and won a bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London before another knee injury saw him sit out 2013. ""There was lot of pressure on me that I have to win a medal in 2012 because you have a dream and if a man comes so close to his dream and then (fails) it is very painful. I go with a mind set that I have to win and if you win only then will the name of the country be known."" Achieving a podium at the Olympics -- India won just six medals in 2012 -- has earned Dutt a degree of personal fame in his homeland along with some other perks. In 2012, his local government in Haryana awarded him cash and land following his Olympic success and the following year he was recognized on a national level when he was the recipient of a Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award. His sights are now firmly set on preparing for one final push for Olympic gold in Rio next year. ""Now that I have won gold at the Asian Games, I will try to win gold at the Olympics and dedicate it to my father,"" he said.","Yogeshwar Dutt is an Indian wrestler who won bronze at the 2012 Olympics .

"As a young teen, Bernard Tomic boasted he would win all four grand slams and become world No. 1. They were big words indeed. So far, though, the 21-year-old's indiscretions far outnumber any achievements with his tennis racquet. Yet local hopes will realistically rest on the former junior No. 1 when the Australian Open begins next week, given the home struggles of the nation's top female player, Samantha Stosur. Tomic has had brushes with the law -- caught speeding on multiple occasions, including once in his Ferrari -- been accused of a ""tank job"" at a grand slam and admitted himself he hasn't always given 100% in matches. In November he was photographed topless and receiving a lapdance at a nightclub on Australia's eastern Gold Coast. Call him tennis' tainted talent. But if you think that's bad, wait until you hear about his dad, John. He had long been labeled one of those difficult tennis parents even before being given an eight-month suspended sentence in September for headbutting his son's former hitting partner, Thomas Drouet. Drouet later claimed in a diary published by Australian newspaper the Herald Sun that John had punched Bernard after a dispute while practicing and shot him in the leg with a BB gun. The elder Tomic has been banned from ATP tournaments until May and, just like at last year's French Open and Wimbledon, won't be allowed into the grounds at the Australian Open. On the eve of the season's first major, Patrick Rafter -- captain of  Australia's Davis Cup men's team and one in a long line of tennis greats the country has produced -- said it's time for Bernard to put everything behind him and live up to his own hype. ""He's 21 but we've got to be careful we don't keep calling him young because he's a man now, he should be taking responsibility for himself,"" Rafter told CNN's Open Court. ""We've seen a lot of other kids take responsibility for themselves."" Rafter, usually mild mannered, ripped Tomic at the 2012 U.S. Open when he fell meekly to Andy Roddick, calling it a ""disgraceful"" performance. Tomic lost 6-3 6-4 6-0 and won just five points in the final set. Outspoken former world No. 1 John McEnroe, now a television analyst, labeled it a ""tank job"" and legendary Aussie coach and ex-player Tony Roche reportedly berated Tomic during a Davis Cup encounter against Germany weeks later. That October, Tomic said he gave merely ""85%"" in a defeat at the Shanghai Masters. Lack of effort has never been an issue for his Davis Cup teammate Lleyton Hewitt -- a two-time grand slam winner, and victor over Roger Federer in Sunday's Brisbane final. Tomic, in another faux pas, once turned down a chance to hit with his childhood hero Hewitt at Wimbledon. A liking for Melbourne, London . And he ended 2013 by losing six straight matches, with his year-end ranking tumbling to 51st from a high-water mark of 27th in June 2012. ""He's going through some tricky times with his family life, but that motivation, he doesn't seem to really have it that much,"" said Rafter, a two-time U.S. Open champion. Federer was quoted as saying by Fox Sports Australia in late December that ""we all expect more from Bernard,"" adding that 2014 would be pivotal. ""It's going to be one of those seasons where he (needs to) prove himself on the tour and not (linger) around No. 50 in the world,"" said Federer. At his home major at least, Tomic's issues seem to disappear. With all of Australia behind him, Tomic fared well in 2011, 2012 and last year, with his talent -- and unorthodox game -- there for all to see. All three occasions he was stopped by either Rafael Nadal or Federer. Wimbledon is the other major where he excels. At the All England Club in 2011, Tomic became the youngest man in 25 years -- since Boris Becker -- to reach the quarterfinals. ""He has got youth on his side where he can develop over the next couple of years and become a great player,"" said Rafter. ""He's had success, especially at Wimbledon, so there's no reason why he can't do well."" Tomic couldn't be reached for comment but his agent, Fraser Wright, said in an email that the player was devoting ""total attention to the Aussie summer tournaments."" And in December Tomic, while reiterating that his father was still a vital member of his team, told an Australian television show that he needed to become ""wiser."" ""You've always got to think about what you're doing and what the consequences are,"" he said when asked about the lapdancing incident. ""Sometimes I don't think like that. ""I've got to become a little bit more wiser, and I think mature a little bit more."" With Stosur perennially struggling in Melbourne, former world No. 1 Hewitt long past his best after years of injury problems, and three major prospects -- Nick Kyrgios, Thanasi Kokkinakis and Ashleigh Barty -- perhaps not ready to make a splash, Tomic figures indeed to be Australia's main contender in Melbourne. But Kyrgios and Kokkinakis fill Rafter with hope. ""You see a lot of juniors come through and you wonder how they are going to fit in with the men's and how they are going to make that step from juniors,"" said Rafter. ""But these two boys seem to be very exciting that we've got coming through, and a couple other young kids. ""But a lot of things can go wrong. There can be injuries or mentally you can't deal with it, so we've got to try to control that side of it a little bit as well."" Tomic is proving to be a fine example.","Bernard Tomic is Australia's top men's hope at the first grand slam of 2014 .

"The arrest of an American teenager for allegedly attempting to join the Islamic militant group ISIS has stunned people in the working-class Chicago suburb where he lives. Neighbors and attendees of a local mosque described Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, as a nice, polite young man. ""He's the last person that we'd think that would happen to,"" Bahauddin Ali Khan, a member of the mosque that Khan regularly attended in Bolingbrook, Illinois, told CNN affiliate WLS. FBI counterterrorism agents arrested Khan on Saturday at O'Hare International Airport where he was planning to fly to Vienna and then onward to Istanbul, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Letter to family . He had reportedly explained his reasons for attempting the journey in a three-page letter he left for his family in the bedroom he shared with a sibling in Bolingbrook. He invited his family to join him in the ""Islamic State"" -- the name ISIS uses to refer to itself -- but warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans, according to a criminal complaint. Khan wrote that there is an obligation to ""migrate"" to territory controlled by ISIS, which has used bloodthirsty tactics to seize control of large areas of Syria and Iraq. ""We are all witness that the Western societies are getting more immoral day by day,"" Khan wrote in the letter, according to the complaint. ""I do not want my kids being exposed to filth like this."" He said he couldn't bear the thought of his taxes in the United States, which along with other countries is carrying out airstrikes against ISIS, being used to kill his ""Muslim brothers and sisters."" Planned to meet contact in Istanbul . During questioning at the airport, Khan waived his Miranda rights and told FBI agents that a person he met online had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in Istanbul. That person, Khan told agents, was to take him into ISIS territory. The Department of Justice said the $4,000 round-trip ticket to Istanbul was bought on September 26. But details on who purchased it for Khan and who he was to meet in Turkey were not disclosed. According to the complaint, Khan told authorities he was planning on working in some type of public service for ISIS -- like a police force -- providing humanitarian work or taking up a combat role. Turkey, the complaint notes, is a common transit point for foreign fighters from Western countries who travel to join ISIS. 'The kid was polite' Khan's family members, who attended his initial appearance in a federal court Monday, have declined to talk about him, asking for privacy. But neighbors in Bolingbrook expressed shock at the news. ""Surprised, really surprised,"" said Steve Moore, who says he's known the family for about two years. ""The kid was polite. I didn't expect anything like that in the least bit."" Neighbors told WLS that Khan graduated from the Furqaan Academy, an Islamic school across the street from his house. The Muslim Association of Bolingbrook, which runs the mosque Khan attended, said it will cooperate fully with authorities, the broadcaster reported. Another of the mosque's members said Khan taught there. ""He would never get angry. Really nice guy,"" Ali Idrees told WLS. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? Search finds writings and drawings . What's unclear is how the teenager was radicalized and if his family knew what he was planning. Agents searched Khan's Bolingbrook home, where he lives with his family, finding pro-ISIS writings and drawings in common areas of the house, according to the criminal complaint. That suggests some of his views may have been known to members of his family. Khan has been charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

"(CNN) -- Chinese government authorities have intimidated and unlawfully detained parents and relatives of children who died in last year's Sichuan earthquake and harassed their supporters, an Amnesty International report said this week. Rubble litters Beichuan, China, nearly a year after an earthquake killed thousands. The 52-page report, released Sunday and titled ""Justice Denied: Harassment of Sichuan Earthquake Survivors and Activists,"" documented instances where parents and relatives said they had been detained for up to 21 days for trying to get answers from officials about their children's deaths. Some said they had been detained several times. ""By unlawfully locking up parents of children who died, the government is creating more misery for people who have said in some cases they lost everything in the Sichuan earthquake,"" said Roseann Rife, deputy program director of Amnesty International Asia-Pacific. ""The government of China must cease harassing earthquake survivors who are seeking answers and trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives."" CNN was not immediately able to get a response to the report from the Chinese government's Ministry of Civil Affairs and Ministry of Justice. The report accused authorities of having prevented parents and relatives from complaining to higher officials about the quality of construction in the buildings that collapsed, referred to by critics as ""Tofu Dregs Construction."" It further alleged that many parents complained that their phones had been tapped and that they were arbitrarily detained so they would not be able to seek justice in the courts. The human-rights organization called on Chinese authorities ""to take immediate action to address the grievances of survivors and relatives of those who were killed or injured"" during the 8.0 magnitude earthquake, which struck at 2:28 p.m. May 12, 2008, when many children were in school. As of September, official figures put the death toll at 69,227, with another 17,923 people missing. No official accounting of student deaths has been released, though artist Ai Weiwei has posted the names of 4,827 children who died in the quake, the report said. Parents and survivors have said school buildings were disproportionately affected because they were shoddily constructed, and they have accused government officials and construction contractors of being responsible. The report cited Sichuan Executive Vice-Governor Wei Hong as stating that the earthquake itself was the most important cause of the collapse. But such arguments were not persuasive to some parents. ""Except the school building, other buildings in Beichuan county did not collapse during the earthquake,"" said the father of a 15-year-old who died at Beichuan Middle School.

"Hong Kong (CNN)The Lunar New Year is here and countries throughout Asia are celebrating. But should we be ushering in the Year of the Sheep, Goat or Ram? It depends, says Isaac Yue, who teaches Chinese mythology at the University of Hong Kong. ""The Chinese character yang can be translated as all of these animals -- even the gazelle is called yang in Chinese,"" he says. A wander through Hong Kong's streets and shopping malls yields few definitive clues. Store windows are decked out with cartoon-like sheep, cheeky goats and curly-horned rams in a marketing bonanza some say is bigger than Christmas in the West. ""I'd be more inclined to translate it as goat for the simple reason if you look at the way the character yang is written, even in its ancient form, you can see that there is a pair of horns so it more closely resembles a goat than a sheep,"" says Yue. Both sheep and goats are raised in China, but the former are only found in the grasslands on the country's northern fringes. Goats are more commonplace. The ram --  a male sheep -- is a third candidate, preferred by some who don't like the meek, docile characteristics associated with the sheep. Other places are clear which zodiac animal they are celebrating. In Vietnam, where the celebration is known as Tet, they are ringing in the Year of the Goat. Money changers in the country say they have struck up an unlikely trade in Nepali and Ugandan banknotes -- both feature goats -- and they have been changing hands at several times the official exchange rate as people clamor for something more unusual to stuff inside their lucky envelopes. Whereas in Japan, people have been busy dressing up their pets in sheep outfits and sending sheep-themed New Year postcards to mark 2015. In China, the annual mass migration for Spring Festival, as the celebration is often called there, is taking place, with 2.8 billion trips expected as the country heads home or on vacation for the festive period. Of course, the confusion over the choice of animal is unlikely to dampen the festivities, which stretch for two weeks or more, and few Chinese are troubled by the English speaking world's sheep/goat distinction, at least according to China's official news agency. ""I've never thought about that question before. Do we have to tell them apart?"" Chen Xufeng, an office clerk in Beijing, was quoted by  Xinhua as saying. ""I've seen more goats in zodiac images, but I prefer to buy a sheep mascot, as sheep are more fluffy and lovely,"" he says.","The Lunar New Year, which begins February 19, is celebrated throughout Asia .

"May 20: Massachusetts, a brother and sister are snatched. A truck driver sees a vehicle that the suspected kidnapper is driving and calls police, who find the kids inside, under blankets and pillows. They're safe. The children's father is arrested. May 22: A car with a 1-year-old girl inside is stolen near a Georgia day care. A security camera image shows a suspect getting into a vehicle and driving away. Police get a call from a resident because the suspect's car has been parked on a nearby street all night. The child is rescued. July 1: An Ohio boy is believed to have been abducted by his father, who has a troubled history, and law enforcement officials are afraid the boy will be harmed. A group of friends at a diner spot the car driven by the alleged abductor and call 911. The man is arrested and the kid is safe. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which documents these ""success stories,"" says they would never have happened without Amber Alerts being issued in each instance. A closer look at the Amber Alert system . And though these cases didn't get the same national attention as the search for San Diego teenager Hannah Anderson, they are among hundreds that demonstrate why the program is critical to saving children's lives, said Robert Hoever, a director of special operations for the center. Between the program's inception in 1996 and July of this year, at least 656 children have been rescued because citizens saw or heard an Amber Alert, according to the center, which works with law enforcement, broadcasters and federal authorities on the nationwide program. Hoever defined ""success stories"" as verified abduction reports in which children are recovered safely. Of the 2,064 children who were the focus of Amber Alerts between 2005 and 2012 (the years for which the center has complete figures on the number of alerts) 394 were rescued. The vast majority of those cases --  2,030 -- were resolved, though ""resolved"" can have different meanings. It could be that a case, once investigated, is determined to be falsely reported to police. And, some cases are still ongoing. But investigating a case takes time, and actions taken in the first hours after a child disappears are crucial, experts say. Why Hannah's case was unusual . Reports: Father of Hannah Anderson's abductor had violent past . ""Hannah's case stood out because it has other tragedies -- the killing of her mother and brother, the nationwide manhunt. But it's also very important because it was just textbook how this program should be used,"" Hoever said. ""You had the combination of a new technology, with very careful moves by investigators to broaden the sending of the Amber Alerts as new leads came in."" On August 4, a 10-second, high-pitched tone rang on thousands of mobile phones across the West Coast -- the first use of a new wireless alert system. Learn more about the Wireless Emergency Alerts system . The alert announced that authorities in Southern California were looking for 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and her 8-year-old brother Ethan. The children's grandmother had reported them missing, the same day that James DiMaggio's home burned down. The children's father, who gave television interviews in the hope of keeping his daughter's case in the spotlight, would later describe DiMaggio as a onetime family friend. Inside DiMaggio's charred house were found the remains of the children's mother, Christina Anderson, and a body that would later be identified as Ethan's. Hannah had last been seen at cheerleading practice near her San Diego home August 3. When authorities heard that DiMaggio might be heading into Nevada, the alerts were expanded to that state, Hoever said. When new clues suggested DiMaggio might be entering Oregon and Washington state, the alerts were activated there. Ultimately, when Idaho became a possible landing spot for the suspected criminal, cell phones buzzed there, too. The teenager's abduction was the first time the new, federally administered Wireless Emergency Alerts program was issued statewide, California Highway Patrol spokesman Erin Komatsubara told HLN. ""The wireless program was also used in five states at one time,"" Hoever said. ""That is the largest use of the program I've seen."" Key moments in James DiMaggio manhunt . Riders who made a difference . The Idaho horseback riders who spotted Hannah and DiMaggio in rugged terrain sensed something was wrong. The teenager and the man were inappropriately dressed for the wilderness and their tent was pitched on a mountain like someone inexperienced in camping might do. But the horseback riders were cautious, exchanging a few words with DiMaggio. But when they got home, they saw Hannah's Amber Alert on television. Trail riders say DiMaggio and Anderson 'just didn't fit' That made all the difference, they believe. ""People need to be aware and observant,"" rider Mary Young said on CNN this week. ""Otherwise we would have missed turning in that information."" The riders contacted Idaho State Police, and their tip over the weekend sent FBI agents swarming to the camping spot outside Cascade, in central Idaho. Hannah was rescued. DiMaggio died in a confrontation with an FBI agent. Who was Amber? Amber stands for ""America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response,"" but its namesake was Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old Texas girl who was last seen alive riding her bike in a parking lot in January 1996, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. A witness said a man with a black, flatbed truck was talking to the girl and snatched her bicycle. Four days later, Hagerman's body was found in a creek eight miles from her home, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Dallas and Fort Worth residents were heartbroken. One resident wrote a letter to a radio station suggesting that the Emergency Alert System be used to notify the public when a child is reported abducted. Read the letter . The first success of the program came after a November 1998 kidnapping, Hoever said. A motorist heard an Amber Alert on the radio after an infant was abducted from an Arlington, Texas, apartment complex. The motorist ""called into law enforcement saying, 'I'm riding next to the car that you're looking for!' He was almost ecstatic, saying 'I can see the baby next to her!'"" Hoever said. The police tracked down the vehicle and rescued the baby. Healing, answers may be slow in kidnapping .","Since Amber Alerts began, more than 650 kids have been rescued .
Hannah Anderson's case was unusual for several reasons, expert says .

"Was a police officer justified in shooting and killing Michael Brown? That's the question at the heart of the looming legal battles over the controversial case. What charges could Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson face? What would state and federal authorities have to prove in order to pursue charges? And does the fact that the gunman was a police officer change how the case could play out? Here's a look at what legal analysts say could happen next. Was a state crime committed? A local grand jury has started hearing testimony, but that doesn't mean any particular charges are being recommended by prosecutors at this point, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""An investigation is just an investigation. ... It's just something that they're looking into,"" Toobin said. For a criminal case to go forward, the grand jury must decide whether a crime was committed, and whether it's more likely than not that the accused person -- in this case, Wilson -- committed the crime, said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor. After a fatal shooting, a range of charges are typically on the table, said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos, a criminal defense attorney. ""They're going to be anything in the spectrum of murder, manslaughter (or) negligent homicide,"" he said. The prosecutor will make a recommendation to the grand jury. From there, the grand jury could decide to indict Wilson, or that there isn't enough evidence to move forward. In order to bring charges against Wilson, nine of 12 jurors will have to agree. But the prosecutor plays a key role in the hearings, which are not open to the public. ""The grand jury ultimately decides whether to indict, but it's 100% the prosecution's show. ... The prosecutor could, in theory, make less of an effort if he doesn't want someone indicted,"" Cevallos said. Some residents and community leaders contend St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases. J.Tom Morgan, a former district attorney in Georgia who knows McCulloch, defended him as fair and objective. ""I believe Mr. McCulloch will present the facts and the evidence to the grand jury and the Missouri law as he is required to do so,"" Morgan said. ""We do not put defendants on trial just to see what a jury will do."" Were Brown's civil rights violated? As part of a federal civil rights investigation, authorities are interviewing witnesses and weighing a number of factors. Key among them: whether Wilson exhibited ""racial hostility,"" Toobin said. ""The most important thing would be, did he say anything that indicates racial hostility, either before, or after, or during (the shooting)?"" Toobin said. Wilson is white, and Brown was African-American. ""The bar is very high,"" Hostin said, ""and they're difficult cases to prove."" But race doesn't have to be a factor in the shooting for investigators to allege there was a federal civil rights violation, Cevallos said. Federal statute says it's a crime for government officials ""to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution."" Federal prosecutors could argue that Brown's right to life was violated, Cevallos said, but it's a tough case to make. ""They have to show that the officer intended to deprive somebody of that constitutional right. They would have to show intent to kill...which is not a particularly easy showing to make,"" he said. When can police use deadly force? The fact that Wilson is a police officer could influence whether he faces charges -- and how the case plays out. ""Often jurors are extremely sympathetic to police officers,"" said Paul Butler, a professor at Georgetown University Law School and a former federal prosecutor. ""They think, even if he made a mistake, he's got the hardest job in the world, so they often want to cut police officers some slack."" Authorities also weigh different factors when deciding to prosecute police. ""There are issues that come up when you're prosecuting cases against police officers, because police officers by the very nature of their jobs can use deadly force,"" Hostin said. Police officers have the same rights civilians have to self defense, Cevallos said, and they also have the right to make arrests. ""To do that,"" he said, ""they can use deadly force to prevent an escape."" If Brown was trying to get away from the officer, Cevallos said, the Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Garner allows the use of deadly force when an alleged felon is trying to flee if ""the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others."" But given the number of times Brown was shot, along with newly released audio that may show a pause in rapid gunfire, Wilson has a lot of explaining to do, the analysts said. ""Evidence suggests that he wasn't fleeing and was facing the officer,"" Cevallos said. ""If that's true ... the officer has to explain six shots. He has to explain a reason for each of those six shots. He has to have justifiably been in fear of his life or fear of some imminent serious bodily harm.""

"Attorney General Eric Holder led federal and local officials Tuesday in announcing a massive overhaul of the New Orleans Police Department, which has been plagued for years by corruption, excessive use of force, illegal searches and widespread racial discrimination. In what Holder called the most wide-ranging such agreement in the nation's history, the Justice Department and NOPD reached a deal on a consent decree that was filed in federal court in New Orleans. The deal includes more than 100 recommendations dealing with virtually every aspect of the department. ""The consent decree requires the Police Department to make broad changes in policies and practices relating to use of force, stops, searches, arrests, and interrogations,"" Holder said. Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez, who heads the Justice Civil Rights Division and played a key role in the agreement, joined Holder and top city officials at a New Orleans news conference. ""This landmark consent decree is the most comprehensive agreement the Civil Rights Division has ever entered into with a police department,"" Perez said, ""and it will serve as a blueprint for reform for departments across the country."" New Orleans cops convicted in post-Katrina shootings case . If, as expected, a federal judge approves the agreement, it will mark a dramatic day in the police department's history. A DoJ investigation in the 1990s resulted in a temporary improvement in police conduct, but officials say there was no court-backed consent decree with tough requirements, and the NOPD slipped back into its old ways of doing things. Officials said they expect the agreement will stick because of the wide-ranging, detailed requirements including a minimum of four years of federal and court monitoring. The sweeping agreement requires detailed documentation of cases in which police use force, and a review of each case by officials in the police department's Public Integrity Bureau. Even traffic stops are dealt with in the agreement because of complaints of inappropriate police conduct, and racial profiling. Officials also said the agreement makes an important change by requiring the videotaping of suspect interviews to ensure there are no longer threats to harm the suspect or his family. Payment for off-duty security work, which had been a source of department corruption, will be limited and carefully scrutinized. One of the most egregious examples of police misconduct stemmed from a fatal shooting at the city's Danziger Bridge in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Four police officers shot and killed two people and wounded four others in the incident, but only in the past year did a federal court exact punishment on the officers. Other police departments, including those in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, also have agreed to consent decrees with the DoJ for controversial policies and patterns of alleged misconduct. But officials familiar with the cases say they do not compare with the heavy requirements being placed on the NOPD. Mayor Mitch Landrieu has been fully supportive of federal efforts to clean up the department. The federal investigation was launched shortly after Landrieu took office in 2010. The probe led to findings in March 2011 that the department was riddled with corruption and suffered from management dysfunction. Details on how to address the many problems have been hammered out behind closed doors the past several months.

"Gleneagles, Scotland (CNN) -- European momentum endures at the Ryder Cup, despite a brief reality check. Two years on from the ""Miracle of Medinah"", those in blue responded to an early blow from its American opponent to end a breathless day in prime position. As the sun dipped below the Ochil Hills in Scotland, Europe carved out a 5-3 advantage, roaring back in an afternoon session that spoke of the continent's deep reserves. That the pairing of world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and No. 3 Sergio Garcia scrambled desperately to grab a tie in their afternoon match, having lost in the morning, underlines the point. New heroes were born — rookies Victor Dubuisson and Jamie Donaldson among them — as familiar fault lines in American ranks were exposed once more. It was actually the first pairs session victory Europe had enjoyed since 2010, and the best foursomes win in their history, after the U.S. had secured a morning lead of 2½ - 1½. No wonder European captain Paul McGinley ended the day displaying that trademark grin of his. ""Today shows how important momentum switches are and how it can have a domino effect. For our guys to respond as well as they did shows a real strength of character,"" McGinley told reporters. ""For me it's not about two points dropped if (McIlroy and Garcia) lost, but they went out this afternoon and rectified this morning -- it was probably as good as a win from where they were. ""It's not a perfect science, but two out of three rookies (winning) isn't bad. The afternoon rookies had great partners in Lee Westwood and Graeme McDowell — there aren't better guys on your shoulders in a Ryder Cup. ""It's a great day but let's take stock — we have a big day tomorrow."" Europe fly in foursomes . Not a single slice of red could be seen at the conclusion of the afternoon matches, which will no doubt cause McGinley's counterpart Tom Watson a bout of introspection. In the morning, the rookie pairing of Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed had shot down Ian Poulter, nicknamed Europe's postman because he always delivers. Yet after comfortably disposing of Poulter and Scotland's Stephen Gallacher the American pair were rested for the foursomes contests -- Watson later conceded the error of judgment. Meanwhile Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley showed signs of fatigue as they surrendered their 100% record as a pairing to Graeme McDowell and European rookie Victor Dubuission -- they had earlier dispatched Europe's gun pairing of McIlroy and Garcia. The one afternoon match that had seemed a U.S. banker was the one that pitted rookie Jimmy Walker and world No. 10 Rickie Fowler against that gun pairing. Two up with three to play, and with the European pair hell bent on redemption, the American's conservatism when trying to close out the match opened the door. McIlroy birdied 17 before an arrowing second into the 18th from Garcia put pressure on Walker to hole a final putt to win the match. He couldn't, and their opponents could breathe a sigh of relief. ""We owed each other a lot,"" Garcia told reporters. ""We knew we weren't playing great but fought as hard as we could and half a point is huge."" Fulsome support . The day had begun in darkness, spectators dashing through the gates at 6am, desperate to secure a seat in the grandstand around the first tee. By quarter past there wasn't a spare seat to be had, by half past the 2,500 strong gallery were in full voice and by the time the captains arrived on the tee, excitement was palpable. Former U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and Sweden's Henrik Stenson lapped up the acclaim as they made the long walk from the range to the tee, through a tunnel bedecked with images of Ryder Cup legends gone by. The honor of hitting the first ball of the 40th instalment of the Ryder Cup fell to another ex-U.S. Open champion, Webb Simpson, who mishit his shot, before Bubba Watson again encouraged ear-splitting noise from the crowd as he crunched a drive into the rough. The European pairing were less wayward but after a halved first hole they grabbed the initiative on the second hole and didn't let go. Stenson, the 2013 FedEx Cup winner, proved the difference on the second hole, Rose the difference on the fourth — a rapier-like approach yielding another birdie. Two more birdies, on nine and 10, took the match out of Watson and Simpson's reach, the first point of Scotland's Ryder Cup secured with another birdie on the 14th. American fightback . It didn't take long for the U.S. to respond. Poulter's ""postman"" tag preceded him on the tee. But the rookie pairing of Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed paid no heed to the Englishman's reputation. Despite earning the loudest cheers thanks to the presence of Scotland's own Stephen Gallacher, Poulter and partner fell behind on the first and failed to rally. A stretch of five birdies in six holes chipped away ever so slightly at Poulter's mantle, Gallacher perhaps overcome by nerves on his own Ryder cup debut. A victory, secured by the same 5&4 margin Rose and Stenson had managed, answered that early European pressure. Behind them McIlroy and Garcia were locked in a ding-dong battle with Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley, who put their unbeaten Ryder Cup record on the line. Having lobbied McGinley for months to play together, McIlroy and Garcia prised out a one-hole lead after the Spaniard chipped in on four. But by the 10th, Mickelson and Bradley had established a two-hole lead, erased by European birdies on 11 and 13. Another McIlroy birdie on 15 titled the balance towards the blue half but Bradley's brilliant eagle on 16 ensured they would go up the last all flat. None of the four played it spectacularly, but it all came down to the match's final blow, which Mickelson duly dispatched to maintain that winning streak for a few hours at least. Read more: Big Phil draws first blood against McIlroy . For a long while it looked like Europe would also be able to boast two points after the morning session as U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer, from Germany, and Denmark's Thomas Bjorn raced into a three-hole lead. But Rickie Fowler and his partner Jimmy Walker hung in, and despite going two down on the 13th, the latter — a rookie — showed firm resolve to sink a birdie putt on the last and secured a vital half. Two of the afternoon's foursomes matches, where players take alternate shots, were on the course before McIlroy and Garcia had finished their morning round. First out were a group that had all missed the morning session, England's Lee Westwood — playing in his eighth Ryder Cup — alongside rookie Jamie Donaldson, Matt Kuchar joining Jim Furyk. The U.S. were ahead after the third, but fell two behind on the 11th as Donaldson warmed to his task. The deficit was reduced on 16, but after Kuchar fluffed a chip on the last, Europe secured a two up victory. Behind them Rose and Stenson picked up where they left off in the morning, going two up after six holes on Zach Johnson and Hunter Mahan, both fresh after a morning rest. Despite twice being pegged back to all square, Rose was equal to the test, his putting stroke proving the difference on 15 and 17 as a 2&1 victory made it a two-point day for the pair. The last match out saw another test of Mickleson and Bradley's 100% record, with French rookie Dubuisson and McDowell accepting the challenge. McDowell, playing for the first time in the competition without fellow Northern Irishman McIlroy by his side, played big brother to the 24-year-old as they charged into a three-hole lead. Despite having their lead dented twice, once on the front nine and once on the back, they scampered to the finish line to secure a 3&2 win and a near-perfect European afternoon. McDowell, himself a U.S. Open champion, ended the day by saying of his partner: ""This guy is going to be the next superstar of European golf, I'm telling you."" As the sun set on an absorbing first day, the pairings for Saturday's morning fourballs were announced. Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson will be off first again, playing Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar. Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson are out second playing Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan. Martin Kaymer and Thomas Bjorn square off against Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed while Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy go off last against Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler.

"(CNN)It's a club that has recently been embroiled in an unsavory racism controversy but that hasn't deterred a leading Japanese tire manufacturer deciding that Chelsea are the right fit for a shirt sponsorship deal. Financial details were undisclosed but English Premier League leaders Chelsea's deal with the Yokohama Rubber Company is reportedly worth $62 million a year allowing the tire manufacturer to emblazon its brand across the front of the London club's shirts for five years starting next season. The deal is second only to Manchester United's agreement with Chevrolet -- worth $81 million a year -- and demonstrates the English Premier League's continuing global appeal. Chelsea's current kit sponsor is South Korean company Samsung. ""This shirt partnership with Chelsea will give Yokohama an opportunity to showcase our company to a huge worldwide audience thanks to Chelsea's ever-growing popularity,"" said Yokohama chief executive officer and chairman Tadanobu Nagumo. ""We look forward to launching our iconic new Chelsea Yokohama shirt this summer."" Chelsea, who play Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup final on Wembley, are the most watched Premier League team on television globally, with over 31,000 broadcast hours -- and more than 500 million fans, according to the west London club. ""Chelsea and Yokohama are a perfect fit. Both are global organizations with a focus on performance and innovation, as well as having huge ambition and an unwavering culture of success"" said Chelsea Chairman Bruce Buck. ""We believe that Yokohama will play a key role in helping us drive our global expansion in international markets such as the U.S. where they have operated with distinction for many years."" The sponsorship deal with Yokohama is being widely credited as a success for Christian Purslow, who was appointed to run Chelsea's global commercial activities in October -- as well as providing a likely treasure trove for the club's manager Jose Mourinho to dip into during the summer transfer months. The announcement follows a 36% rise in shirt sponsorship income for English Premier League clubs on the 2013/14 season -- with European clubs getting $777m from sponsors in a bid to get their brand on some of the world's biggest clubs' kits. Whilst the Middle East is a burgeoning sponsor in Europe -- United Arab Emirates and Qatar based companies spent $181m this season -- it's a Japanese brand that's now scored a deal with Chelsea.","Chelsea sign shirt sponsorship deal with Yokohama Rubber Company Ltd .

"A woman who was babysitting a 5-year-old who fatally shot himself Monday with her gun has been charged with abandoning or endangering a child, a felony, and jailed in Orange County, Texas, police said Wednesday. Bail was set at $250,000 for Melissa Ann Ringhardt, 19, said Clint Hodgkinson, chief deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Office. The death was ""avoidable,"" according to Hodgkinson, who said Ringhardt failed to secure the gun while she was caring for the boy, John Allen Read, and a 6-month-old, both children of Kayla and Joe Read. Ringhardt was a regular babysitter for the family, with whom she had been living in Vidor, Texas, for the past few months, police said in a statement. Vidor is 95 miles east of Houston. Father charged after 2-year-old fatally shoots herself . ""Ringhardt stated to investigators that she was carrying a handgun on her person in the home that day because she was scared being at home alone,"" the statement said. ""The handgun was a semi-automatic .40 caliber pistol. Ringhardt left the handgun on a coffee table in the living room and went to the bedroom to take a nap. When she was awakened from her nap, she noticed she didn't see John around the house. She began looking until she found him deceased in the living room with the fatal gunshot wound."" The infant was not hurt. Hodgkinson said the elder child sustained a gunshot wound to the head and is believed to have died instantly. Kids and guns: Not isolated tragedies . With no phone at the house, Ringhardt carried the boy's body to his grandparent's house nearby, and police were called. At the time of the shooting, the child's mother was at a hospital with another of her children, and the father was out of town on business. The father, Joe Read, said his neighborhood was not unsafe. He would not comment further. ""The preliminary investigation appears to be that the shooting was accidental,"" police said in a statement. This is at least the fourth instance since June of a child dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. New law allows schools to teach gun safety to first-graders . Last weekend, a 2-year-old girl fatally shot herself in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and the toddler's father faces involuntary manslaughter charges, police said. In New Orleans, a 5-year-old girl died June 23 after she came ""into contact with a .38-caliber revolver and accidentally shot herself in the head"" while her mother was at a store, police said. The girl's mother was charged with cruelty to a juvenile until the 5-year-old died, at which point prosecutors added a second-degree murder charge. A judge in the case threw out the murder indictment last month, and the district attorney's office said it would appeal the decision, CNN affiliate WDSU reported. In August, a 3-year-old boy in Dundee, Michigan, found a .40-caliber handgun belonging to a family friend on a closet floor in his home. He died after accidentally shooting himself in the head, police said. The family friend was charged with careless discharge of a weapon, a misdemeanor. Two weeks ago, 2-year-old Michael Garcia Jr. was taken to a hospital after shooting himself in the legs with a .45-caliber handgun registered to his mother, according to CNN affiliate WFTV. The boy's wounds were not life-threatening, and the boy's father was charged with child neglect, the station reported. According to the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 703 children under the age of 15 died in accidental firearms deaths between 2001 and 2010, the latest year for which data are available. During the same period, 7,766 children under the age of 14 suffered accidental firearm injuries.

"It's a slick production with a nefarious goal: A 55-minute video released by ISIS, praising its victories and warning the United States from getting in the way of its goal to create an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria. It's propaganda, terrorism experts say. A recruitment video aimed at English speakers. But the U.S. intelligence community is focused on one jihadist who appears briefly at the end of the video. The ISIS fighter, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, is shown orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men. It is too early to know if this militant hails from North America, or maybe spent some time there, or what his exact story might be. But the intelligence community is already analyzing the video in an attempt to identify the man's origin, a U.S. official told CNN. It is too early to tell where his dialect is from, the official said. In the video titled ""Flames of War,"" the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. But the ISIS fighter -- who is masked and wearing a camouflage uniform -- seamlessly switches to English. There are a number of men digging a ditch behind him. The jihadist claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and who now, after an ISIS attack, are ""digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed."" CNN cannot independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers, as the propaganda video claims. How the 'Islamic State' is run, from oil to beheadings . The video then shows a group of militants executing the men, who fall into the ditch. The man who committed this atrocity on film could be an Arab who was educated in the West. Or he could be an American or Canadian. If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera. ""Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera,"" said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University. ""Why? Because he seems American. The message is aimed at a Western audience."" The intent, Cilluffo told CNN, is to project fear to Americans, and to project power. The difference between ISIS and al Qaeda . Intelligence officials will sift through every detail of the man's voice, looking for any clues of a particular dialect that might lead investigators to local communities to seek additional clues, Cilluffo said. The U.S. will also compare the clues of the jihadist's language to see whether it is consistent with those individuals who are known to have gone to fight for ISIS. The video is undoubtedly propaganda and a recruitment piece for the terrorist group, Cruickshank said. But it is also a warning to the West that if it gets involved in the fight, it will be a tough outing for foreign troops. The video doesn't exactly goad the United States and the West into launching attacks against ISIS, but those who appear in the video try to convey a sense of toughness, Cruickshank said. The video glamorizes ISIS, according to SITE Intelligence, which monitors terrorist groups. ""It serves as not only a powerful recruitment piece, but a stern warning to their opposition about 'flames of war' rising against them by the fighters,"" according to a summary by SITE.

"(CNN) -- Jenna Nielsen was 22 years old, 8½ months pregnant and looking forward to bringing her third child into the world when her life came to a violent and abrupt end on June 14, 2007. Jenna Nielsen was driving her newspaper route when she was stabbed to death two years ago. She was working her new job on a newspaper delivery route she'd taken to help her young family make ends meet. That's when police say she was stabbed to death in front of a convenience store in Raleigh, North Carolina -- a crime that has police and family members still looking for answers. Marking the two-year anniversary of his wife's death, with no arrests and no named suspects announced by police, Tim Nielsen can only shake his head when he ponders who may have targeted his wife. ""I believe she was just at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" said Nielsen, who has returned to his native Utah, where his family helps him raise his two children -- Schyler, 5, and Kaiden, 2. ""My wife had no enemies.""  Watch an update » . Police say that two years ago last Sunday, Nielsen arrived at the AmeriKing Food Mart about 3:30 a.m. to deliver papers. She'd parked and just finished loading the newspaper vending machine when she was attacked on the way back to her car. Nielsen was stabbed in the neck. Two of her car doors were left open and her purse and car keys were still inside, police said. Authorities will not publicly speculate on a motive. But Jenna's family believes the attack may have been an attempted sexual assault and that Jenna fought back. Investigators say they have received thousands of tips and interviewed hundreds of people, but they still don't have a clear picture of a suspect. Laura Hourigan, spokeswoman for the Raleigh Police Department, said investigators remain confident the case can be solved. ""This case is actively being investigated still,"" she said. ""But we have a few missing pieces and hope for the public's help."" Early in their investigation, the police released a composite sketch obtained from two witnesses who saw the attacker fleeing the scene of the crime. But they have since backed away from the image, saying it was misleading people. They describe Nielsen's attacker as a short, slightly built man in his late teens or early 20s with black hair pulled back into a long ponytail. He was wearing a dark sleeveless shirt and baggy blue jeans shorts, according to witnesses. Shortly after Nielsen's death, a knife was found by a homeless man not far from the scene of the crime. Police won't comment on whether the knife might be the murder weapon. There has been other evidence collected. ""They found DNA, but I can't say more than that,"" Tim Nielsen said. Other members of Nielsen's family quote police as saying they have DNA evidence from the killer, but have not been able to match it with anyone they've interviewed over the years. The family has stayed active in keeping Nielsen's case in the public eye. They've held ""Vigils Against Violence"" the last Sunday of every month and maintain justice4jenna.org, a Web site devoted to her memory and to the effort to track down her killer. ""It's hard to believe that it has been two years since someone selfishly stole you from our family,"" reads the site's home page. ""There isn't a day that goes by that you and Ethen [the name planned for her unborn child] are not in our thoughts. ""Schyler and Kaiden are growing so fast. They look like you, act like you and laugh like you -- for that we are able to see you each and every day through them. Schyler asks about you often and helps Kaiden remember Mommy."" The family also have been advocates for the so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act, state legislation that would create a fetal homicide law in North Carolina. Currently, state law does not consider a killing a double homicide when an expectant mother is slain. Jenna Nielsen's father, Kevin Blaine, takes every chance he can to plead for help from the public . ""Help find the people that did this to her,"" he said. ""The person who did this is still out there."" The family is offering a $15,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for Nielsen's murder. Anyone with any information on this crime is asked to call the Raleigh Police Department at (919) 227-6220.","Jenna Nielsen was eight months pregnant when she was stabbed to death .

"Georgia teen Kendrick Johnson, who was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at his high school in January, died as the result of ""unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma,"" according to a newly released, independent autopsy report. The report, obtained exclusively Tuesday by CNN, directly contradicts the finding of an autopsy conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that determined that Johnson's death was the result of positional asphyxia.  The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office determined that his death was accidental. Johnson, 17 and an athlete, was found January 11 headfirst in a rolled wrestling mat at a Lowndes County High School gym in Valdosta, Georgia. Inconsistencies in official reports on the condition of Kendrick's body have led the family and community to question the official cause of his death. The family's attorney, Chevene King, has sent the independent autopsy report to the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the U.S . Attorney for Georgia's Middle District and Lowndes County Coroner for review. The coroner can call a coroner's inquest, a process that resembles a grand jury proceeding.  After reviewing evidence and testimony, a jury would decide the cause of death, although the findings alone would have no civil or criminal consequences. ""Coroner's inquests are not something you do every day.  I cannot tell you the last time a coroner's inquest was done in this office,"" Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson said. ""I want to do the right thing by the people and the county and all concerned; I'm just not sure we have enough information.  I'm not about to refute anybody's findings because I'm not a doctor,"" said Watson. On May 1, a judge granted the Johnsons' request to exhume their son's body for the purposes of a conducting an independent autopsy at their expense. That autopsy, conducted June 15, found blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues, ""consistent with inflicted injury."" It was conducted by Dr. William R. Anderson with Forensic Dimensions in Heathrow, Florida. ""This is unexplained -- most very, very likely inflicted, as opposed to something he caused himself, inflicted by another -- and therefore needs to be investigated as an open homicide investigation,"" Anderson said. ""I've never had a case that I can recall where the prosecution actually was told that this may well be a homicide -- the prosecution being the state, the police and so forth -- and then they didn't bother prosecuting. It's mystifying,"" he added. Anderson's finding supports the narrative of the initial patient care report, written by EMTs with the South Georgia Medical Center Mobile Healthcare Service on January 11, the day Johnson's body was discovered. That report said, ""bruising noted to the right side jaw."" However, a January 25 report by the Valdosta - Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited ""no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body."" The autopsy results released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation May 2 identified ""no significant injuries."" A spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the agency stands by its report after reviewing the findings of the independent autopsy. U.S. Attorney Michael Moore is reviewing the case but has not launched a formal investigation. ""We've been working on this for some time,"" he said. ""I'm sure at the appropriate time, I'll speak with his pathologist."" ""There are some members of the community that question the result,"" Moore continued. ""I want to make sure members of the community and the family and everyone involved has confidence in my work and my decision."" The spokesperson for Civil Rights Division has not yet responded to questions about the new report.","New autopsy: Teen's death caused by ""apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma""

"Orlando (CNN) -- Duct tape found on Caylee Anthony's skull was placed there after the toddler's body had decomposed, not before she died, a forensic pathologist testified Saturday as the murder trial of the girl's mother ended its fourth week on a contentious note. Prosecutors claim Caylee's mother, Casey Anthony, used chloroform to make her daughter unconscious then used duct tape to cover her nose and mouth, suffocating her. The girl's skeletal remains were found in a wooded field six months after her family last reported seeing her. Dr. Werner Spitz said he believes the tape was placed on the body long after the flesh had disappeared to hold the jaw bone on, perhaps because someone wanted to move it. Spitz also criticized the Orange County medical examiner, Dr. Jan Garavaglia, for conducting what he termed a ""shoddy autopsy"" by failing to cut Caylee's skull open to look inside. Spitz' testimony came after Chief Judge Belvin Perry ordered the first defense witness off the stand and threatened attorney Jose Baez with contempt proceedings for failing to tell prosecutors about the man's planned testimony. Forensic anthropologist William Rodriguez told Judge Belvin Perry after the jury had been excused that he was preparing to testify that no conclusions can be drawn from duct tape found near the girl's body because of decomposition and movement of the bones by animals. Rodriguez also said he planned to testify that a video prepared by a prosecution expert superimposing Caylee's living face with a picture of her skull and the outline of a piece of duct tape was an ""unheard of"" application of technology meant only to provide initial identifications of remains. But Rodriguez' opinions were not contained in his report filed with the court, and weren't shared with prosecutors. That violated Perry's rule that all expert testimony be shared with opposing attorneys, Perry said. ""It appears to me that this was quite intentional,"" Perry said to Baez. ""This was not some inadvertent slip."" He ordered Rodriguez off the stand, but said he will be allowed to testify on Monday, after prosecutors have a chance to interview him. Perry said the law would appear to authorize him the right to exclude the testimony, but said that would be too drastic a step. ""It would be totally unfair to Ms. Anthony to have his testimony excluded on this critical issue,"" he said. But he said he would be watching Baez' conduct closely and will consider contempt proceedings at the end of the trial. ""I am not making any promises or warranties about what I will do if it happens a second time with this witness,"" Perry scolded Baez. Rodriguez and Spitz are part of the defense effort to discredit, among other things, a prosecution theory that duct tape found clinging to the girl's remains may have been the murder weapon. Duct tape similar to that found with Caylee's body was located on a gas can from the Anthony home that Casey Anthony took from a storage shed during her daughter's disappearance, according to earlier testimony in the case. Spitz began his testimony challenging the thoroughness of the autopsy performed on Anthony, saying examining the inside of the skull is standard practice. He testified that dried sediment he found indicated the body had decomposed on its left side, with the face pointing slightly up. That differs from evidence at the scene indicating the skull was upright when it was discovered. Spitz said the lack of DNA found on the tape would suggest it was placed on the girl's skull by someone who wanted to move it for some reason. The tape, he said, was intended to keep the jawbone from falling off. On cross-examination, prosecutor Jeff Ashton asked Spitz if the sediment was not ""brain dust"" but perhaps something that carried into the skull by water while the body lay under water in the flood-prone spot where it was found. Spitz responded that the fact that the material was residue from the girl's body was as plain as the jawbone on the replica skull he was using as an illustration during his testimony. But he acknowledged that the material had not been chemically proven to be from the girl's body. Ashton also questioned Spitz' characterization of Garavaglia's autopsy. He challenged the physician -- who co-wrote a book on forensic investigations -- to cite any specific protocol requiring that a pathologist saw open the skull of a thoroughly decomposed body -- including in his own book. Spitz said that he could not, but that his long experience and training tells him that failing to look at the inside of body's skull is poor practice. ""The skull, the head, is part of the body, and when you do an autopsy you examine the whole body,"" he said. Defense attorneys claim Caylee was not murdered, but that she accidentally drowned in the family pool on June 16, the day she was last seen. They argue that Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked and covered up the death. George Anthony has rejected that scenario in his testimony. Casey Anthony is charged with seven counts, including first degree murder, in the death of her daughter, whose remains were discovered in a wooded field in December 2008, six months after her last family saw her. Saturday was the third day of the defense case. The case will enter its fifth week Monday. In Session's Mayra Cuevas, Ilana Rosenbluth and Michael Christian contributed to this report.

"London, England (CNN) -- What if you could buy a smartphone that would last you for the rest of your life? This is the dream of Dutch designer Dave Hakkens, whose 'Phonebloks' concept has captured the public imagination and received celebrity endorsement from the most unexpected quarters. Phonebloks is a radical cell phone idea that aims to dramatically reduce global electronic waste ('e-waste') by offering users the opportunity to upgrade parts -- or bloks -- of their cell phone rather than having to replace the entire device. Hakkens says that he came up with Phonebloks as a response to the accelerating pace of technological waste: ""I don't like the direction electronics are heading. They get more disposable and get a shorter life with every model. This gives a lot of e-waste."" The environmental campaign organisation Greenpeace estimates that global e-waste now amounts to between 20 and 50 million tons a year. Put into perspective, they say that quantity of waste, loaded onto container trains, would stretch all the way around the world. Speaking at the CleanUp 2013 conference in Melbourne Australia, Professor Ming Wong, director of the Croucher Institute for Environmental Sciences at Hong Kong Baptist University, described the growing problem of e-waste as a ""timebomb."" ""[It] is the world's fastest growing waste stream, rising by 3 to 5% every year,"" said Wong. The Phonebloks concept aims to decrease e-waste by offering consumers the opportunity to replace individual components of their phone, while retaining the device's basic frame. Once constructed, Hakkens hopes that the Phonebloks handset will be built from components that can be 'clicked' together like Legos. Each component will have its own function e.g. Bluetooth, WiFi, battery, or camera. When a component stops working or needs to be upgraded, it can be quickly replaced with a new 'blok'. In theory, Hakkens believes that choosing separate components could enable users to personalize their cell phone to their own specifications, adding an improved camera, increased storage or a larger battery. ""The idea is to set up a platform which, if used correctly, can reduce the amount of waste significantly,"" Hakkens says. At present, Phonebloks is still a long way from reaching the market -- indeed its inventor hasn't even asked for any money to begin developing it. For now, Hakkers has simply been gathering support for the concept through the ""crowd-speaking"" platform Thunderclap. At the time of writing, the Phonebloks concept video has received more than 12 million views on YouTube and been shared on social networks more than 650,000 times. The project has also received support from the actor Elijah Wood and television correspondent Jessica Northey. The Phonebloks concept is not without its critics. Some argue that making a device that can more easily be upgraded will increase e-waste rather than reducing it. Others suggest that it would be impossible to build a functional smartphone in a modular way. Hakkens says that at the very least his campaign has shown that there is an appetite for an environmentally friendly cell phone and that even though the concept was only officially launched a week ago ""we are already having conversations with some serious players."" Tom Dowdall, a Climate and Energy spokesperson for Greenpeace, says that the interest in Phonebloks may be useful in underlining the growing prooblem of e-waste: ""Hopefully the popularity of the Phonebloks concept will spark more action from the major manufacturers. It should not be beyond the innovative phone companies to make products that are upgradable and designed to last."" Read more: Technology of tomorrow . Martin Cooper, the inventor of the cell phone, told CNN that while the Phonebloks concept is 'well-meaning' he suspects it will never become a reality: ""the main reason that the Phoneblok will not hit the market is it will cost more, be bigger and heavier, and be less reliable ... By the time it could be brought to market, the problem that engendered it will be gone."" Andy Redfern, co-founder of the 'ethically-conscious online retailer' Ethical Superstore says he thinks Phonebloks is an excellent concept, but agrees with Cooper that it will be difficult to produce: . ""Phonebloks seems such an obvious idea that it makes you wonder why no one has ever taken this approach before ... However it faces two significant challenges - one technical and one cultural,"" Redfern says. ""To reduce cost and increase battery life as much of the phone functionality as possible is crammed on to a single piece of silicon ... So the technical challenge is meeting the current battery life and size requirements if we are going to benefit from easy upgrades. ""And culturally? Well we want the lightest phone with longest battery life. The Phoneblok is likely to have to compromise on that and we will have to change our expectations and our thinking."" ""However,"" Redfern says ""creating a phone that feeds our appetite for upgrades without having to throw away the whole phone would seem to make great sense.""

"His mother ran down the street, tears streaming down her face. His father said he was ""devastated."" When a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in his fatal shooting, Michael Brown's family believed they were denied justice. Ahead of the decision announced late Monday, Michael Brown Sr. called for calm. After word of the grand jury decision broke, some protesters smashed the windows of a police cruiser and tried to overturn it. Others picked up bricks and smashed the windows of a restaurant. Police responded by firing tear gas.  A chant arose, "" F*ck the police! "" The unrest came after the family challenged those outraged with the decision to channel their frustration in ""ways that will make a positive change."" But the violence in Ferguson spread, leaving family attorney Benjamin Crump to call for peace and a ""constructive response."" ""Michael Brown and the unknown Michael Browns are crying out from the grave, saying we have to change this system that let people kill them or .... without consequence,"" Crump told CNN. What options remain available to the Brown family or what actions might give them some solace? Ferguson: What's next? Federal investigations . The U.S. Justice Department is conducting two civil rights investigations: one into whether Wilson, who is white, violated the civil rights of Brown, who was black, and the other into the police department's overall track record with minorities. The investigations will likely require lots of time, if similar past cases are any indication. Last week, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said the lack of an indictment could push the federal government to ""open a much more stringent and powerful investigation"" of Brown's shooting. Protests spread far beyond Ferguson . ""Now they know he's not going to be prosecuted on a state level, and the feds have a right to do a completely independent investigation, and they're not bound in any way by grand jury determination,"" he said. But Crump late Monday sounded pessimistic about that route. ""That is a very high standard and it's not very likely. The family understands if there is no indictment it is likely the killer of their child won't be held accountable and that's heartbreaking to them."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder stressed that the federal civil rights investigation into the shooting death of Brown, 18, continues. ""Even at this mature stage of the investigation, we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence,"" Holder said. ""And although federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases, we have resisted forming premature conclusions."" 'A thousand Fergusons across America' Possible lawsuit, alleging wrongful death . The family could file a wrongful death lawsuit against Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department, Callan said. Crump told ""AC360"" that the family is considering the option of civil remedies to obtain ""some sense of justice."" Callan said Brown's family could file a lawsuit under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code -- a federal statute that permits damages against state officials for violations of legal or constitutional rights. But another CNN legal analyst, Mark O'Mara, said law enforcement officers are afforded certain legal protections. CNN commentator and legal analyst Mel Robbins said she expects the family to allege wrongful death and intentional infliction of emotional distress. They will allege that Wilson had no justification or was negligent in shooting Brown, she predicted. Such a lawsuit would likely include the fact that Brown's body was in the street for four hours after his killing. What's next for Darren Wilson? A push for change to the system . In a  video released last week by STLForward.com, Michael Brown Sr. thanked supporters for trying to end what he called racial profiling and police intimidation. But he asked for a calm response if there were no indictment. ""Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer. No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my son's death to be in vain. I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change. Change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone."" Late Monday, the family was away from the cameras, dealing with their disappointment. Before then, they encouraged the public ""to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen."" St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said physical and scientific evidence, along with witness statements, led to the grand jury's decision. Still, he acknowledged the Brown family's huge loss. ""My heart goes out to them. Regardless of the circumstances. They lost a young man, they lost a young life,"" McCulloch said.

"(CNN)Romance is alive and well across Africa this Valentine's Day -- romance literature, that is. Some of the continent's top writers have joined forces to mark the occasion by releasing an anthology of romantic short stories for free in digital and audio formats. Each story is no more than 1,000 words and has also been translated into languages spoken by all the writers -- Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, Kiswahili, Kpelle, pidgin and French. Contributors include celebrated Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina -- voted one of TIME's 100 ""Most Influential People in the World"" last year -- and award-winning Nigerian authors Toni Kan and Abubakar Adam Ibrahim. Well-known authors Elnathan John and Mukoma wa Ngugi, writer and publisher Eghosa Imasuen and New York Times journalist Helene Cooper have recorded audio versions of the stories. The initiative, announced by Ankara Press, an imprint of Nigerian publisher Cassava Republic, has a clear directive. ""Our mission is to read and hear what romancing in different languages might sound like and mean, as well as showing how romance can break away from the genre stereotypes and still be entertaining,"" said publisher Bibi Bakare-Yusuf. In light of recent turmoil in Nigeria, the anthology also serves a serious purpose. Bakare-Yusuf explains that the stories provide ""a sensuous antidote to election fatigue that reflects the realities of African lives.""

"(CNN)Boko Haram fighters have carried out their first known lethal attack in Chad, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday, as the threat from the Nigeria-based Islamist militants spills over into neighboring nations. The fighters killed four civilians and a soldier in the predawn attack on the fishing village of Ngouboua on the shores of Lake Chad, according to residents and Chadian security sources. The attack came hours after 21 people were killed in two separate attacks on Akida ‎and Mbuta villages near the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri, according to residents and a local community leader. Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that news had come in overnight of the attack on Ngouboua and details remained hazy. ""We are still getting information about how many people affected, we know that thousands of refugees were there,"" he said. ""The reports that we've received, the town was attacked by about 30 militants using boats, they attacked parts of the town itself, the 'chef de canton' himself was killed. We were in contact with a refugee during the attack but the phone line went dead. We are still trying to find out more about the situation there."" Mamadou Dian Balde, of the UNHCR in Chad, later told CNN that the chef de canton, or local leader, who was killed had been ""a great champion of refugee protection."" Authorities have not yet confirmed the final death toll, he said. But reports from the ground indicate three-quarters of the village was torched by the attackers and many residents have fled to surrounding areas. The village was peaceful and had generously taken in many refugees from the conflict in neighboring Nigeria, he added. The violence in northeast Nigeria has caused more than 157,000 people to flee into Niger, Cameroon and Chad, Edwards said. Some 100,000 of those are in Niger, 40,000 in Cameroon and the remainder in Chad. Nearly 1 million more people are believed to be internally displaced inside northeast Nigeria, according to that country's national emergency management agency, Edwards said. ""With the violence that's plagued northeast Nigeria spilling over into Niger, Cameroon and Chad, UNHCR is now calling for urgent humanitarian access to refugees and internally displaced people in these countries to provide urgently needed assistance,"" he said. ""For many refugees, for locals, for aid workers too, the situation is now becoming increasingly terrifying."" Earlier this month, several African nations -- including Nigeria, Niger, Benin, Cameroon, and Chad -- pledged to deploy 8,700 troops, police and civilians as part of a regional effort to fight Boko Haram. The assault by Boko Haram on Chadian soil may be a response to that initiative. An attack earlier this month by Boko Haram militants against Chadian soldiers on the border between Cameroon and Nigeria left 13 dead and 21 injured, the United Nations said last week. The Chadian soldiers were deployed to fight Boko Haram in Cameroon and Nigeria.

"(CNN)Fans of a heroic dog who fought in vain to save her owner's life in an Ohio house fire have donated more than $28,000 toward the $25,000 goal for the care of the 9-year-old boxer named Carmen. The injured dog, owned by Ben Ledford of Goshen Township, is doing much better in an animal hospital recovering from smoke inhalation, said Phil Ledford, the victim's brother, on the Crowdrise website. ""Our family continues to be amazed at the amount of donations, support, thoughts and prayers being said for our family and Carmen. We are still trying to find the right words to truly express our appreciation,"" Ledford said in a Wednesday note. ""Carmen is still doing well,"" said Ledford. The canine is now in physical therapy.

""It's exciting to see her recognize us, try to greet us and give us expressions that show her personality shining through once again,"" he said. On Thursday, Carmen was ""a little more awake"" and her ""appetite continues to improve as you can see she is cleaning her bowl."" Many dog lovers posted messages with their donations. ""We have a boxer baby, and this act of devotion is not surprising,"" Don and Lukasz Mallory wrote Friday on the crowdfunding site.  ""Prayers to the family for their loss and to Carmen for a fast recovery. If a dog can be this devoted to a human being, how much more should we be to each other."" Carmen dramatically tried to save her owner's life in the February 5 fire. Deadly flames licked all around her, but Carmen refused to leave her owner in a suburban Cincinnati basement. First responders to the fire found Carmen on top of Ledford, trying to shelter his face from the heat, smoke and flame, according to CNN affiliate WCPO. Ledford, 33, was taken to a hospital where he died. Carmen ended up at Cincinnati's Care Center, a critical care veterinary hospital. Carmen was initially battling severe lung damage, Dr. Daniel Carey, a vet at the hospital, told WCPO. The canine was taken off a ventilator on Tuesday and began breathing on her own, according to the Facebook page of the animal hospital Care Center Vets in Cincinnati. She was to come off fluids and IV medications Friday. Dr. Marlo Anderson, another vet at the hospital who is caring for the dog, told WCPO she was not at all surprised that Carmen tried to save her owner. ""A lot of dogs instinctively know when there's a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go to try to protect their owners, so she very well may have been trying to protect him,"" she said.

"An 80-foot-tall statue of Jesus Christ stands atop of a hill overlooking the Syrian Christian town of Saidnaya, about a 40-minute drive from Damascus. The statue is part of the ancient Cherubim Monastery in the Qalamoun Mountains, a quiet, spiritual place that's very important to Syria's Christians. But these days, there is a gruesome sight at the feet of the statue of Christ the savior. About 30 mutilated and charred bodies lie in piles near a footpath that leads to the monastery. The dead are rebel fighters who tried to storm the monastery but were killed as they advanced, Syria's government says. The attack happened on January 19 and allegedly involved hundreds of rebel fighters. The regime says that in all, 60 militants were killed in the fighting. ""They came from another mountain a few miles away and destroyed our front gate,"" says a pro-Christian fighter who supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and was involved in the battle for the mountaintop. The Cherubim Monastery is not a civilian target these days. Dozens of pro-Assad fighters, mostly Christians, as well as regular Syrian army forces, are stationed there. The force has a tank, artillery pieces, mortars and light weapons at its disposal. Many of the Christians in Saidnaya say they are under threat from radical Islamists among rebel fighters battling the Assad regime. ""Times are awful,"" one man told CNN on a visit to the monastery. ""We always have to watch our backs and be ready for an attack. We always carry a gun and a grenade because we could be attacked at any moment."" Christians are a minority in Syria. They make up about 10% of the population. But Christianity has a rich history here. Jesus was baptized in Syria, some of the earliest relics were found here, and the town of Ma'aloula, also in the Qalamoun Mountains, is one of the last places where the ancient Aramaic that Jesus spoke is still the main language. But Ma'aloula was recently invaded by al Qaeda-linked militants of the Jabat al Nusra rebels. Nuns were kidnapped and have yet to be released. All this is stoking fears among Syria's Christians that their existence in Syria might be under threat. ""I don't just think so. I am sure they are targeting us because we are Christians ... and we have had many attacks,"" one fighter at the Cherubim Monastery told CNN. Many of Syria's Christians support the Assad regime, fearing that the end of the current government could lead to instability and an Islamist power grab. In Saidnaya, Christian fighters work closely with the Syrian military, and the opposition accuses them of shelling rebel-held towns in the Qalamoun Mountains from the Cherubim Monastery. Christian leaders in Syria say they are not taking sides in the conflict, but just protecting themselves, their towns and neighborhoods while the opposition has done little to assure them that Christianity would have a place in Syria if the Assad regime were to fall.","Fighters stationed at the Syrian Christian town of Saidnaya support the current regime .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN)Indonesia has announced that death row inmates and ringleaders of the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, will be transferred from Kerokoban prison. It's the first step in their last walk to the firing squad. The two -- who were convicted of a failed attempt to smuggle heroin to Australia in 2005 -- are now more than likely to be taken out to a field on Nusakambangan, a prison island off central Java, and shot dead. Besides the horror of the death penalty -- something Australia only dispensed of in 1967 -- there is so much unnecessary tragedy in this case. Some of it rests on the shoulders of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), who tipped off the Indonesian police after receiving information from a worried father of one of the duo's mules. Some rests on the own shoulders of the men, who made one terrible, foolish mistake while young. However, a lot of it also rests with Indonesia and its President Joko Widodo, whose cruel lack of compromise and desire to clear out the prisons has seen him categorically turn down any chance of clemency -- even though this potentially flouts Indonesian law. Widodo has said he will deny clemency for all drug offenders. Indonesian legal teams are now scrambling a submission to the administrative court, arguing that the president can't deny clemency for all drug cases, but must consider each case individually. Widodo is also following the lead of the Indonesian public, which in the main believes in the death penalty.  Of course, this is in stark contrast to the work Indonesia does to get its own citizens off death row around the world. The president's hard-line stance isn't just about trying to win some breathing space with an electorate, which in the vast majority is disappointed with his presidency. He may be also trying to distract them from ongoing corruption scandals, the persistence of cronyism and his inability to break free from the shackles of his political benefactor Megawati Sukarnoputri. Most significantly though, Widodo has announced a war on drugs, which he sees as devastating the nation. The drug ""crisis"" is described by Widodo as a ""national emergency.""  According to the president, 4.5 million Indonesians need to be rehabilitated from illicit or illegal drug use, and 40 to 50 young people die from drugs a day. This data has shown to be based on questionable statistics. Even so, it tempers much of Widodo's  thinking on the need for rehabilitation. And here's where another perspective on rehabilitation comes in. In Chan and Sukumaran, dubbed the pastor and the painter respectively, the president not only has clear examples of rehabilitation, but effective tools  for combating the scourge of drug smuggling in his own country and rehabilitating those of his citizens most in need . This is in part due to the characteristics and qualities of the Indonesian prison system. Let's just say that the two were, with the rest of the Bali Nine, allowed to board flights for Australia and nabbed by the Australian Federal Police instead of Indonesia's National Police. Serving up to 10 years in an Australian prison, would they have been reformed? With a recidivism rate of over 50% and the sterile security conditions that commonly lead to psychological distress and not change, probably not. That might lead one to assume that something about their time in Kerobokan prison contributed to their reformation, something they would more than likely not have experienced here in Australia. What can be learned from this hypothesis?  Chan and Sukumaran's experiences show genuine clear signs of rehabilitation. So how could this rehabilitation occur in Kerobokan prison, which is claimed to be a ""hell hole""? By default and not by design, prisons like Kerobokan share many positive aspects that are often overlooked by contemporary prison reformists. As Indonesian corrections don't have the resources to care or provide for inmates, the inmates take it upon themselves to fund and run their own rehabilitation programs. There is also more buy in from NGOs who also support the inmate programs and the amazing support structures that are created by inmates in prisons in developing countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. These include their own businesses to support themselves and family, which keep them occupied and sometimes away from criminal pursuits. In the end, in some cases, the prison community becomes a natural environment for rehabilitation. A study on recidivism in Indonesia may paint a more accurate picture as precise figures are hard to come by. Of course, corruption, criminality and drug running remain very real issues. Chan and Sukumaran demonstrate a clear sense of remorse and with it the chance of redemption. If rehabilitated returning fighters can be used to help dissuade and can be used to help other young men from making the same mistake, why can't convicted and remorseful drug smugglers do the same? Beyond how unpalatable the notion may be to many, this is yet another reason why it is a real shame the two will be executed -- here are clear examples of successful rehabilitation that should be held high with pride by the Indonesian government, not shot down in history. Instead, their execution could potentially dampen other inmates' enthusiasm to reform or change in Indonesia. In all prisons, hope is critical for moral and rehabilitation, especially in under-resourced prisons where conditions are harsh. In this case, as with many more, the death penalty is no silver bullet solution, and in fact hits terribly wide of the mark. There is no conclusive evidence that the death penalty has any real deterrence value. These two men, who fully admit they made an awful error judgement in while their early 20s, offer a glimpse on how Widodo's war on drugs can be won without having to lose more lives -- without having to fire a single shot.","Two Australians are days away from being executed on drugs charges in Indonesia .

"Ottawa (CNN)Christianne Boudreau's voice wavers slightly as she recounts how her little boy became an ISIS militant. Every word seems tinged with anger and regret, but most of all, purpose. The process of radicalization is gradual and persuasive, she said. And deadly. Her son, who joined ISIS's ranks in Syria, was killed in fighting there more than a year ago. ""It's so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,"" she said. Boudreau's son, Damian Clairmont, converted to Islam after a troubling period in high school in Calgary, Canada. The mother remembers her son's religion bringing him peace. She didn't suspect anything when Clairmont told her he was leaving for Egypt to study Arabic. In reality, the 22-year-old was in Syria alongside ISIS fighters. He was killed during fighting near Aleppo in January 2014. (Aleppo was considered Syria's most dangerous city at the time, with intense fighting between government forces, rebels, and ISIS militants). How did her boy -- the one in photos kneeling by a Christmas tree, or shirtless and raking leaves as a child, or sitting in a laundry basket as a toddler -- end up losing his life fighting for the creation of an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East? Boudreau is now lending her support and voice to two organizations trying to combat radicalization. Hayat Canada and ExtremeDialogue.org are two new online resources for parents, teachers and communities to help counter extremist messages and recruitment. ""The way a lot of it happens is one main recruiter plants the ideology in their mind and the Internet reinforces that with the information that they can search up and other contacts that they can make easily online,"" Boudreau said. Canadians have joined ISIS to fight -- and die -- in Syria . Her message boils down to this, something reminiscent of anti-drug ads: Talk to your kids about ISIS before they do. ""We need to start arming ourselves with the knowledge, the awareness, the education, and to be able to deal with these issues and be able to speak with our children at an early age,"" Boudreau said. ""We do the same thing with sex education, with drugs, and this is just one more thing that our kids are faced with, a challenge."" The lack of understanding and resources available to families like hers was devastating, she said. She was especially afraid for Clairmont's younger siblings. ""We were living in a really desperate black hole of trauma and we didn't know how to heal from it, and I was terrified that the anger would burn within them and not being able to cope with this type of trauma and that they would follow the same path,"" she said. While growing up in Calgary, in Alberta province, Boudreau remembers her son as a cuddly, warm and compassionate little boy.  That changed in high school, when he experienced problems with peers and became withdrawn. He attempted suicide just after his 17th birthday, his mother said. After his recovery he converted to Islam. ""I saw some positive changes start to happen. He became social again. The old Damian that I knew when he was younger, much younger, was starting to come out. He was socializing, he was peaceful, he was grounded, he wasn't drinking, he wasn't using drugs, there were lots of positive changes,"" Boudreau said. But that changed when Clairmont moved out on his own, changed mosques and sought out more and more radical content online, his mother said. What Boudreau learned is while youths can become radicalized online, there is nothing to counter it or to provoke questions about what they are being told. ""In fact, what's out there is only something that can reinforce those ideas so we really need to start challenging the ideologies that are being placed in their minds,"" Boudreau said. Canadian security officials came to her door in 2013, breaking the news that Clairmont was suspected of being a militant and was likely in Syria, not in Egypt. The next time she spoke on the phone with Clairmont, she confronted her son and he admitted that he was in Syria. ""He was compelled to go there to help save women and children to stop the torture, to stop Bashar al-Assad and that's what drew him there and as he told me, 'I'm finally doing something productive in my life, mum,' ""  Boudreau said. She says her son was further brainwashed in Syria and the he eventually sided with ISIS, believing they were the stronger group and he was more likely to survive fighting for them. Boudreau wishes the Canadian government had the power then to do what it is doing now: Confiscate passports of Canadians suspected of communicating with terrorists. She wants the government to go even further, to detain and provide counseling and help to those being indoctrinated in extremism. There are families, she says, that are desperate as they see their children being drawn by jihadist propaganda. ""The biggest problem we have is that parents -- a lot of the time -- want to be able to place the blame somewhere else,"" she said. ""We want think that our children are safe and it could never happen to us. It's always going to happen to somebody else. That's a big mistake we all make as parents.""","Damian Clairmont left Canada to go fight alongside ISIS .

"On the surface, Hong Kong transmits an image of prosperity, comfort and convenience. But beyond the façade of pristine skyscrapers and bustling shopping malls, a darker life exists for some of the territory's newest residents. Deep into Hong Kong's New Territories, close to the border with Mainland China, lies Ping Che, a decrepit village that has become a prison for many of its inhabitants. One of them is Arif, 26, a wiry, long-haired asylum-seeker from Bangladesh. His house, barely more than a few slabs of sheet metal propped against decaying beams, runs along open sewers. Flies circle near the improvised toilet -- basically a hole in the kitchen floor. The water is dirty and the electricity supply unreliable. With only a shoddy air conditioner salvaged from a garbage dump, he mostly wilts in the humid summer weather and freezes in the winter cold. One night, while sleeping, part of the roof dropped onto his head. ""I need to live in a better place,"" he says, with a hint of irritation. Arif's nightmarish living situation is typical for the hundreds of people who arrive in Hong Kong each year to escape torture or persecution in their home countries. But that's when their troubles begin. While they wait for their claims to be screened, in a process that can take years -- and usually ends in rejection -- asylum seekers are barred from working, forced into crumbling housing and are given just enough food to survive. According to some rights activists, this is intentional. ""The government tries to dissuade refugees from seeking protection by intentionally causing hardship,"" explains Cosmo Beatson, who directs Vision First, a Hong Kong refugee aid organization. ""It's not humane."" With no way to join society and no way to return home, these survivors languish in miserable situations like Ping Che, hoping for a reprieve that often never comes. ""Many of us came here to save our lives,"" says Arif. ""But I think better die. Better die than live like this. How we're living is not life."" 'I lost everything' Four years ago, Arif was a pharmacology student in the Khulna district of Bangladesh. Described by Beatson as a ""really smart kid,"" Arif ran a business to support his family. But his success drew the envy of terrorist groups in the war-torn country, who burned his vehicle, assaulted him, and threatened to kill him if he didn't pay huge sums of ""protection"" money. Fearing for his life, he enlisted the help of an agent, who promised to take him to Ireland, his ""dream country."" Instead, the agent stole his belongings and left him stranded in Hong Kong. ""I lost everything,"" says Arif. ""When I learned I was in Hong Kong, I was so shocked."" Arif was safe, in a technical sense. Like many other countries and territories, Hong Kong is bound by international laws preventing the deportation of refugees to countries where they risk harm. Refugees are allowed to file claims for protection when they arrive, and may legally remain until their status is officially determined. Those who are successful may be relocated to a third country, where they can attain legal status. In theory, Hong Kong is a big ""waiting room."" In practice, Hong Kong is more of a prison. Left with unpleasant memories of the 1970s influx of Vietnamese war refugees, which swamped its support systems, the Hong Kong government does everything it can to discourage refugees from integrating into its society. To prevent economic migrants from trying to claim asylum, the government bans refugees from working -- those caught working face 22 months in jail. Instead, it forces refugees like Arif to depend on a non-profit, the International Social Service (ISS), for welfare. Every month, ISS gives Arif a HK$1,200 ($155) stipend for rent -- which barely covers his room in Ping Che, with nothing left for deposits or utilities. Like other refugees, he gets HK$900 ($116) worth of food -- a bit more than US$1 per meal -- which must be picked up from faraway collection depots and then carried home. The aid amount has not been adjusted for inflation since 2006. ""I've watched the 7 kg bag of rice turn into 3 kg,"" says Beatson, who works closely with the villagers. ""People are going hungry."" Salim is a 43-year-old asylum seeker from Bangladesh who lives with Arif. Nine years ago, he escaped Bangladesh after terrorists seized his retail business and tried to kill his family. But, he says, ""Hong Kong is not a better life."" His broad frame fills his cramped bedroom, which is littered with filth-encrusted objects: old appliances, cookware, and furniture, many held together with tape. Because ISS aid only covers the bare minimum, Salim and his cohabitants hunt for clothes and other household essentials in a nearby garbage dump. Salim says the ISS does not provide adequate medical care. ""When I am sick, the doctors say, 'we cannot check you.'"" Instead they give him tablets of Panadol, a feeble painkiller that Beatson says refugees receive ""whether they have migraines, dermatitis, venereal diseases, cancer, or are giving birth."" ""The suffering caused is purposeful,"" continues Beatson. ""[The government] causes so much slow pain that the people have no choice but to leave."" However, a spokeswoman for ISS says that each client is ""individually assessed for needs, special concerns, and vulnerabilities,"" and that medical assistance is provided at the discretion of social workers. In response to suggestions that aid is insufficient, she replies ""any assistance program will always be a compromise."" ISS does not determine aid levels, she adds, as the agency is funded directly by the government and only carries out government instructions. Officials stand behind the austere policy, which they say is designed to keep its welfare system from getting overloaded with outsiders. ""The objective of humanitarian assistance is to provide support, which is considered sufficient to prevent a person from becoming destitute while at the same time not creating a magnet effect,"" Hong Kong's Social Welfare Department wrote in a statement emailed to CNN. Salim has a simpler explanation: ""The Hong Kong government doesn't care. To them, we are not people."" 'Like finding out heaven is fake' Claimants who persist long enough to receive a status determination are often devastated to find they have been rejected without explanation. According to Vision First, Hong Kong has received over 12,000 torture claims in the last 21 years -- and has accepted five. ""This number is unbelievable,"" says Beatson. ""It's an effective zero percent recognition rate."" For those in Ping Che waiting to be screened, these figures cause despair. ""It's a tunnel with no light at the end,"" says Beatson. ""When it dawns on refugees what they're stuck in, they're in shock. They conclude that Hong Kong is safe, but they would've rather died. It's like finding out that heaven is fake."" To alleviate refugees' suffering, a small group of Hong Kong NGOs has formed what it calls the Refugee Concern Network to try and coordinate help. One of its members is Julee Allen, who manages a refugee aid center in Hong Kong's Chungking Mansions. The center provides psycho-social support for more than 300 clients. But the work, she says, is very difficult. In her first month on the job, a man suddenly broke down into tears. ""He pulled up his shirt and showed me stab wounds all over his torso and started explaining what has happened in his country. ""When he left and shut the door behind him, I lost it. I spent 30 minutes crying, just saying, 'My God, how can we help someone who has been so deeply, deeply wounded?'"" Beatson says that the aid organizations simply cannot help everyone. ""All the charities combined only have about three million HKD (US$128,926). We need hundreds of millions,"" he says. ""Our work might help five hundred people a little, but how do you help 6,000? ""We have to put pressure on the government,"" he adds. Hong Kong legislator Fernando Cheung is one of the few politicians trying to help. He first visited Ping Che in February and describes the sight as ""shameful."" Cheung immediately demanded a special meeting with the Hong Kong Security Bureau to voice his concerns, but was rejected. ""They are trying to evade the problem,"" he says. Unsatisfied, Cheung believes that government inaction jeopardizes Hong Kong's international reputation. ""The government wants to project Hong Kong as a world-class city with advanced systems. They want investment. ""But the city is in many ways a façade,"" he says. ""On the outside, it's got nice decorations. But if you look inside, it's empty -- there's no heart."" There has been minor progress. Late last year, court rulings determined that Hong Kong's refugee screening systems were incomplete. In June, the government announced a new system, which will screen not just torture claimants but all sufferers of persecution and cruel treatment. ""It's a step in the right direction,"" says Cheung. But there are no improvements planned for refugee welfare -- which is the most urgently needed reform. A provision allowing refugees to seek employment would raise living conditions immeasurably, but this seems a remote possibility at best. If things don't improve soon, Hong Kong's treatment of refugees will continue to fall short of the international standards it claims to embrace, and Ping Che will continue to wither. Advocates say change is possible but only if people understand what the refugees are going through. ""Being an asylum seeker, refugee, or torture claimant is not a choice people make,"" says Allen. ""Some seismic event has just turned that person's life upside down. If they could just go home and be safe, they would -- but they can't. It's important to remember it could be you -- it could be me -- it could happen any second."" As for Salim, all he wants is an opportunity for dignity. ""In the United States, Canada, Australia, they give people a chance,"" he says. ""It is 2013. We should give a chance to everyone.""","Advocates say Hong Kong government policies make refugees' lives 'a living hell'

"(CNN)My son Jason Rezaian and his wife were taken at gunpoint from their apartment in Iran more than 200 days ago. Since then, he has been languishing in a jail with no firm trial date in sight. Our patience has been exhausted. It is time to release my son or let him face a fair trial. Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, was taken with his wife, Yeganeh, from their apartment on July 22. Jason, a dual Iranian-American citizen, has been at Evin Prison, held on suspicion of somehow posing a security risk to Iran. Yeganeh was released in early October, and through November she was permitted three phone calls and two visits each week. But last month, she was only permitted one brief visit. In a meeting December 22 with two members of Jason and Yeganeh's interrogation team, I was informed: ""The West has an unfair view of us (the Iranian Revolutionary Guard). We do not rape, we do not torture; we do not waterboard. We are not Guantanamo. ... We do everything by Islamic, true Islamic law."" When I visited my son in Evin on Christmas Day, he told me: ""I will be a model prisoner if I am granted my rights under Islamic law. Rights attributed to Imam Ali, a fair and just man. And I don't believe I've been granted any of them: the right to meet with my attorney, my trial scheduled in a timely manner, and visitation rights with my wife."" Following my trip, Iranian newspapers -- moderate and hard-line alike -- highlighted that I had met with Jason twice. Last weekend, in Munich, Germany, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif commented on his role in that process. But while I sincerely appreciate Zarif's ""humanitarian"" efforts, as well as the orchestrating of Jason's one telephone call to me for Thanksgiving Day, the fact is that as a dual citizen and therefore Iranian mother, it is my right to visit my son in prison. In fact, in the early months, I was told the Iranians were asking Jason, ""Where is your mother?"" when I wasn't there all the time because they are so accustomed to seeing mothers waiting outside the prison gates. Yet in January, I was given no assurances of permission for further visits. Iran's ways are often inscrutable. There are apparently three separate security apparatuses, and Jason seems now to have been handed off to a legal branch (the judiciary) that appears to be taking its time scheduling his trial. Iran's Constitution spells out that once a prisoner's file is completed, the prisoner is to be moved to a public ward, where he can interact with others and have access to a telephone. Furthermore, once assigned to a court, a trial date must be set within 60 days. As his file was sent in early January, the case should be heard in early March. And yet there are rumblings that Jason's case will not be heard until after Nowruz, the Persian New Year, which is on the first day of spring, March 21. Anyone with knowledge of Iran knows that nothing happens during the two weeks following Nowruz, a period when even newspapers don't publish, so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before April 6. All this is taking a huge toll on Jason. It weighs heavily on him knowing how much his wife, his brother, their families and our relatives in the United States and Iran are worrying about him. And it deeply pains him to know that this situation has come about because of suspicions -- no matter how baseless -- about his contacts and associations. All this frustration is compounded by the knowledge that the length of his detention far exceeds that of other American journalists in Iran. This week, Iran is celebrating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. It is traditionally a time when pardons are granted and prisoners are released on bail to visit with their families. Jason is fully aware of this. Whatever the unknown charges against him may be, surely Jason is at the least entitled to regular visits from his wife and phone calls with his mother? Our family has been exceedingly patient during these seven months. We have been respectful of Iran, of its laws and its procedures. But our patience ran out some time ago, and it is difficult, nearly impossible, to maintain respect for a system under which someone who was born and raised American is being detained ""as an Iranian"" even as his rights under Iran's own laws are being so flagrantly violated. I am calling on Iranian Human Rights Minister Mohammad Javad Larijani, Javad Zarif, President Hassan Rouhani and the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to ensure that Jason's rights are observed. Please review the evidence and release my son or ensure that he receives a fair trial immediately. It is long past time.","The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian has been detained in Iran since July .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Veteran Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party on Tuesday, saying he has found himself increasingly ""at odds with the Republican philosophy."" Sen. Arlen Specter was expected to face a tough re-election battle in 2010. ""This is a painful decision. I know I'm disappointing many of my colleagues,"" he said at a news conference announcing the move. ""The disappointment runs in both directions. ""I'm putting principle at the top of the list,"" he added. The switch puts Senate Democrats one vote shy of a filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats. They can reach the 60-seat mark if Al Franken holds his current lead in the disputed Minnesota Senate race. ""As the Republican Party has moved farther and farther to the right, I have found myself increasingly at odds with the Republican philosophy and more in line with the philosophy of the Democratic Party,"" Specter said. ""In the course of the last several months ... I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak."" Specter, a five-term Senate veteran, was facing what most political observers believed would have been a tough fight for the Pennsylvania GOP Senate nomination in 2010. Specter said President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would campaign for him as he runs for re-election -- now on the Democratic ticket -- in the 2010 race. Obama called Specter shortly after learning the news during his daily economic briefing in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning, according to a senior administration official. ""You have my full support, and we're thrilled to have you,"" Obama told Specter. Jubilant Senate Democrats also welcomed the news.  Watch constituents cheer for Specter » . ""Sen. Specter and I have had a long dialogue about his place in an evolving Republican Party,"" Reid, D-Nevada, said in a written statement. ""We have not always agreed on every issue, but [he] has shown a willingness to work in a bipartisan manner, put people over party and do what is right for Pennsylvanians and all Americans."" Reid called Specter a ""man of honor and integrity"" who would be welcome in the Democratic caucus. One key Senate Democrat warned that reaching the 60-vote mark would not automatically ensure a Democratic victory on every major issue. ""It's great news,"" North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad said. But it means ""a lot less"" than some people think. ""The Democratic caucus is not homogenous. [There is a] lot of disagreement in the Democratic caucus, so this idea that it's some great watershed event ... I don't think so."" Neither party has had a filibuster-proof majority in the U.S. Senate since the 95th Congress, from 1977 to 1979. The Democrats controlled 62 seats during the first two years of the Carter presidency.  Learn about other senators who have switched parties » . Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele ripped Specter, calling him a Republican in name only who was out of step with the rest of the party because of his ""left-wing voting record."" ""Some in the Republican Party are happy about this. I am not,"" Steele said in a written statement. ""Let's be honest -- Sen. Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind. He left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record."" Steele said Republicans ""look forward to beating Sen. Specter in 2010, assuming the Democrats don't do it first."" Steele later said Specter essentially ""flipped the bird"" at the GOP leadership with his decision. Speaking to CNN's Gloria Borger and Kyra Philips, the chairman said it was ""not only disrespectful but downright rude"" of Specter to make this decision after the national party made it clear that it would stand behind him in a contentious primary fight.  Watch more of Steele's comments » . National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John ""Cornyn went out on the line for this man,"" he said. ""For the senator to flip the bird back to Sen. Cornyn and the Republican Senate Leadership, a team that stood by him, who went to the bat for him in 2004, to save his hide is not only disrespectful but down right rude. ""I'm sure his mama didn't raise him this way,"" Steele added. Specter was expected to face a very tough primary challenge in 2010 from former Rep. Pat Toomey, who nearly defeated Specter in the Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary in 2004. A Quinnipiac University survey of registered Pennsylvania voters released last month showed Specter trailing the more conservative Toomey in a hypothetical primary matchup, 41 to 27 percent.  Watch why Specter decided to switch » . A separate Franklin & Marshall survey showed Specter leading Toomey 33 to 18 percent. Another 42 percent, however, were undecided. More than half of the Republicans polled in the Franklin & Marshall survey said they would prefer to see someone new in the Senate. Specter singled out the conservative group Club for Growth, which endorsed Toomey in 2004 and has endorsed him for 2010, as one the primary culprits behind his increasing political isolation in the Pennsylvania GOP. He argued that the organization, which targets moderate GOP incumbents who do not adhere to the doctrine of supply-side economics, had helped undermine the competitiveness of the Republican Party across much of the country. Club for Growth members and other conservatives ""don't make any bones about their willingness to lose the general election if they can purify the party,"" he said. ""I don't understand it, but that's what they say. ... There ought to be a rebellion [against them]. There ought to be an uprising."" But Club for Growth President Chris Chocola replied in a statement, ""Sen. Specter has confirmed what we already knew: He's a liberal devoted to more spending, more bailouts and less economic freedom. Thanks to him, Democrats will now be able to steamroll their big government agenda through the Senate. ""This cynical play for political survival calls into question whether Pennsylvania taxpayers can believe anything Arlen Specter says."" Numerous Republicans are angry with Specter over his recent vote in support of President Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan. ""When the stimulus package came up for a vote, I felt that it was indispensable to vote aye in order to avoid the possibility of a 1929-type depression,"" Specter said. He said that the vote highlighted a ""schism"" and an ""irreconcilable conflict"" between himself and the bulk of the GOP. Specter, one of only three GOP senators to vote for the measure, has been part of a dwindling group of GOP moderates from the northeastern part of the country. The 79-year-old Kansas native and former Philadelphia district attorney has been a leading Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee for much of the past two decades, serving as its chairman from 2005 to 2007. Specter has been a defender of abortion rights in an overwhelmingly anti-abortion party and opposed Reagan's controversial nomination of Robert Bork to a Supreme Court seat in 1987. But he drew criticism from many women for his aggressive questioning of law professor Anita Hill, who accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during Thomas' 1991 confirmation hearings. Specter served on the Warren Commission, which investigated the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, helping develop the so-called single bullet theory that Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally were hit by the same slug. He has survived bouts with cancer three times, most recently undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease in 2005.

"(CNN)Disability doesn't mean disadvantage. And Farida Bedwei, a celebrated software engineer from Ghana, is proof of that. Born in 1979, Bedwei was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of one -- cerebral palsy is an incurable neurological disorder that affects body movement and muscle coordination but does not interfere with the ability to learn. Bedwei has steadfastly refused to let her disability affect her career trajectory. Today, as the co-founder and chief technical officer of software company Logiciel, she is considered one of the most powerful women in financial technology on the continent -- in 2013, South Africa's CEO Magazine named Bedwei  the most influential woman in business and government in Africa for the financial sector. Her greatest achievement, Bedwei says, is the development of a cloud software platform that is being used by 130 micro-finance companies nationwide. These institutions administer loans to their customers by sending a code to their mobile phones via SMS. That code can be exchanged for money at any branch, making small loans available immediately. Here, Bedwei reveals how tech can transform lives and how she defied the odds to find success. Create an education plan that works for you. Bedwei lived a nomadic childhood thanks to her father's role at the United Nations Development Programme. As a result, the family resided in Dominica, Grenada and the United Kingdom before finally settling in Ghana when Bedwei was nine years old. Bedwei was home schooled until the age of 12, and then continued her education at a government school where she was able to socialize with other children. Her family noticed her passion for computers, so it was decided for Bedwei to skip senior high school and enroll in a one-year computer course at the St. Michael information technology center. At 15 years old, she was one of the youngest in the class. A challenge, perhaps? But one she took in her stride. ""I'm sure most of my classmates were wondering what I was doing with them. And that it how I started my career as a software engineer because through that course I realized what aspect of IT I was going to specialize in.  I loved the idea of solving problems and creating things,"" she says. Found your dream job? Fight for it. Following her graduation, the passionate programmer began looking for work and found her dream role at Soft, a premier software company in the region. She recalls: ""I went and saw the head of the technical division and I told him, I want a job here, I don't have any experience, but I'm inspired to learn... If you give me the chance, I promise you that you'll never regret it. So he said, 'OK, fine... come and join.'"" Know when you need to move on. Three years later, Bedwei was on the move again and soon found work as a senior software architect at Rancard Solutions. ""I was with them for nine years. For the first three years of my stay with them, I was actually going to school part time. I already had a diploma in Information Systems, but I wanted something else to add to it.

"(CNN)A San Francisco woman battling cancer is prepared to battle the state of California in court for what she says is her right to die on her own terms. ""I am suing the state of California to help me achieve a peaceful and dignified death at the place and time of my choosing,"" Christie White said Wednesday at a news conference. White has had either leukemia or lymphoma since 2007, undergoing rounds of radiation, chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. Though she's in partial remission now, White has seen other friends with terminal illnesses suffer and would like ""to have the option of aid in dying in California,"" the lawsuit says. White was joined by physicians, also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, who want the right to administer aid-in-dying treatments to patients without penalty. Two of those physicians have been diagnosed with terminal illnesses, offering personal and professional perspectives on the issue. ""I have a lust for life. I may want to stick around for the duration, but I should have a choice,""  said Dr. Robert Liner, a retired obstetrician who is in remission from stage IV lymphoma. Liner brought up the case of Brittany Maynard, whose decision to ""die with dignity,"" as she called it, went viral in a video she made of her story and an op-ed she wrote for CNN. Her case reignited the debate over patients' right to decide when and how they die. Maynard's desire to die when she wanted meant she and her husband had to move from San Francisco to Oregon, one of three states that have ""death with dignity"" laws that allow terminally ill, mentally competent residents to voluntarily request and receive prescription drugs to hasten their death. Washington and Vermont are the others. Judicial decisions in Montana and New Mexico authorize doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses in such circumstances, although the rulings haven't become state law. Having to move to another state compounded the emotions the family was already facing, said Maynard's mom, Debbie Ziegler. ""Moving added so many layers of stress and sadness that I can understand why people who are ill feel they would need to file a lawsuit,"" Ziegler said. Maynard, who had brain cancer, died in November 2014. The lawsuit, filed by White, Liner and others Wednesday, would update the text of Section 401 of the California Penal Code adopted by the California Legislature in 1874. The Assisted Suicide Statute says, ""Every person who deliberately aids, or advises, or encourages another to commit suicide is guilty of a felony."" The plaintiffs, which include White and the five physicians, are seeking a declaration that  would allow doctors to administer dying aid to mentally competent, terminally ill adults without criminal liability. ""Such choice is at utmost importance for all of us,"" said Dr. Dan Swangard, another plaintiff. Swangard has suffered from pancreatic cancer and metastatic disease to the liver. He is in remission. Kathryn L. Tucker is the executive director of Disability Rights Legal Center and also represents White and the physicians. Tucker has spent 20 years working for ""end of life advocacy"" and has seen many ballot initiatives fail. This lawsuit provides a ""faster and viable avenue"" than traditional legislation that she has seen fail numerous times. Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, said the lawsuit is evidence that ""so many people are in favor"" of giving patients the control when it comes to their end-of-life plan. ""How people die doesn't belong in the hands of a lawmaker or a politician,"" Diaz said. His wife's commitment to the issue, he said, has been the catalyst for last month's proposed legislation in California and for Wednesday's lawsuit filing. Even after her death, Diaz said he is ""amazed and so proud"" of his wife. Barbara Coombs Lee is the president of Compassion & Choices, the organization that made the video about Maynard. She called news of the lawsuit ""a wonderful development."" ""Giving people the choice of aid in dying is enormously important for their peace of mind,"" Coombs Lee said. Dr. Aaron Kheriaty is a psychiatrist and chairman of the medical ethics committee at the University of California, Irvine. He said organizations and lawmakers have tried and failed four times in California to pass legislation regarding ""end-of-life options,"" usually calling the concept a variety of palatable names such as ""death with dignity"" or ""aid in dying"" to distract voters from what the issue really is: ""assisted suicide."" Kheriaty said that most people who consider suicide don't want to die but are looking to ""escape intolerable suffering,"" or in the case of those facing terminal illnesses, ""anticipated suffering."" ""Modern medicine has other options to help with suffering at the end of life,"" Kheriaty said. Kheriaty finds the concept of ""suicide as a rational or reasonable option"" to be worrisome, as it brings acceptance to what he calls a ""public health crisis.""  He said allowing physicians to legally assist suicide opens the door for insurance companies to potentially prey on the most vulnerable patients. Diaz said that he understands the concern, but that if his experience in Oregon with his wife was any indication, these aid-in-dying treatments are administered only in very specific cases and only after immense scrutiny of the patient. He added: ""I don't think we should base policy in fear."" Tucker said that ""in order for a patient to obtain aid in dying, there are many safeguards in place."" ""These treatments are limited to a small group of patients,"" she said. California Attorney General Kamala Harris is listed as the defendant on the lawsuit, as she's the only one who can overturn a previous law. A representative from her office responded with ""no comment"" to the lawsuit. CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this report.","A woman and her physicians sue California for the right to ""die with dignity""

"The first police officer at the scene of Tupac Shakur's 1996 drive-by murder has revealed the last words spoken by the late rap legend. And they're not exactly peaceful. ""He looked at me, and he took a breath to get the words out, and he opened his mouth,"" says Chris Carroll, a retired sergeant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, in a new feature with Vegas Seven. ""And then the words came out: 'F**k you.'"" Rolling Stone: 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time . Shakur was shot multiple times on September 7th, 1996. After leaving a boxing match with former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, the rapper and his bodyguards got into a scuffle with 21-year-old Crips gang member Orlando Anderson in the lobby of the MGM Grand casino. Carroll, who worked with the city's bike patrol unit, had also been watching the same Mike Tyson fight, but was unaware of the brawl taking place in the lobby. Later, a white Cadillac pulled up beside Knight and Shakur while they were stopped at a traffic light and one man began shooting out of the back window. Carroll was the first officer to respond to the grisly scene. ""I grab the car door and I'm trying to open it, but I can't get it open,"" he says. ""[Knight] keeps coming up on my back, so I'm pointing my gun at him. I'm pointing it at the car. I'm yelling, 'You guys lay down! And you, get the f**k away from me!' And every time I'd point the gun at him, he'd back off and even lift his hands up, like 'All right! All right!' So I'd go back to the car, and here he comes again. I'm like, 'F**ker, back off!' This guy is huge, and the whole time he's running around at the scene, he's gushing blood from his head. Gushing blood! I mean the guy had clearly been hit in the head, but he had all his faculties. I couldn't believe he was running around and doing what he was doing, yelling back and forth."" Rolling Stone: Saul Williams to star in Tupac-inspired musical . Carroll says when he finally was able to open the door, Shakur's limp body fell out of the vehicle, ""like he was leaning against the door."" ""So I grabbed him with my left arm, and he falls into me, and I've still got my gun in the other hand,"" he continues. ""He's covered with blood, and I immediately notice that the guy's got a ton of gold on -- a necklace and other jewelry -- and all of the gold is covered in blood. That has always left an image in my mind. . . After I pulled him out, Suge starts yelling at him, 'Pac! Pac!' And he just keeps yelling it. And the guy I'm holding is trying to yell back at him. He's sitting up and he's struggling to get the words out, but he can't really do it. And as Suge is yelling 'Pac!,' I look down and I realize that this is Tupac Shakur."" Carroll says he attempted to get a ""dying declaration"" of a potential suspect from Shakur, but the rapper was ignoring him at first. ""And then I saw in his face, in his movements, all of a sudden in the snap of a finger, he changed,"" he says. ""And he went from struggling to speak, being noncooperative, to an 'I'm at peace' type of thing. Just like that. . . He went from fighting to 'I can't do it.' And when he made that transition, he looked at me, and he's looking right in my eyes. And that's when I looked at him and said one more time, 'Who shot you?'. . . He looked at me and he took a breath to get the words out, and he opened his mouth, and I thought I was actually going to get some cooperation. And then the words came out: 'F**k you.' After that, he started gurgling and slipping out of consciousness."" Rolling Stone: Kendrick Lamar covers Tupac at iHeartRadio Awards . So why is Carroll coming forward with with information in 2014? Two reasons: Retiring from the Metro has allowed him the freedom to speak about the homicide case without being reprimanded (""It's been almost 18 years,"" he says. There's clearly never going to be a court case on this.""), and he also didn't want ""Tupac to be a martyr or a hero because he told the cops 'F**k you.'"" Carroll says Shakur never spoke another word -- remaining silent even when another officer tried to draw out a declaration in the ambulance. ""As soon as he got to the hospital, he went into surgery and was heavily sedated, and I guess he went into a coma and really never came out of that, until they took him off of life support,"" he continues. ""So that moment I talked to him was his last real living moment where he was speaking. I talked to the cop who rode in the ambulance with him. He said Tupac never came out of it, and he never said anything at the hospital. There was nothing else."" See the original story at RollingStone.com.","The rapper was gunned down in 1996 .

"(CNN)The U.S. Army has agreed to provide hormone therapy for Chelsea Manning, the soldier serving a 35-year prison sentence for leaking a huge trove of classified documents. The prisoner formerly known as Bradley Manning, and once held to be male, said in August 2013, the day after her court sentencing, that she is female. Just over a year later, it emerged that she had filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming she ""has been denied access to medically necessary treatment"" for her gender disorder. The commandant of the Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks in Kansas, where Manning is serving her sentence, issued a memo on February 5 authorizing the addition of hormone therapy to Manning's treatment, USA Today reported Thursday. The memo cited a recommendation that the therapy was ""medically appropriate and necessary."" The news was welcomed by Manning's legal counsel in the lawsuit. ""We are thrilled for Chelsea that the government has finally agreed to initiate hormone therapy as part of her treatment plan,"" said Chase Strangio, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""This is an important first step in Chelsea's treatment regimen and one that is in line with the recommendations of all of her doctors and the basic requirements of the Eighth Amendment."" But Strangio said that the approval of the therapy was only a partial victory. ""The military continues to refuse to let Chelsea grow her hair like other female prisoners, a critical part of her treatment plan that has been recognized by her doctors,"" he said. Also, the delay in getting the hormone treatment ""came with a significant cost to Chelsea and her mental health,"" Strangio said. At the time of her 2013 announcement that she planned to live as a woman, Manning asked for support and said she wanted to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. Manning said she was diagnosed in 2010 with gender dysphoria, which her lawyers describe as ""the medical diagnosis given to individuals whose gender identity -- their innate sense of being male or female -- differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, causing clinically significant distress."" A Kansas judge in April granted the former Army intelligence analyst's request to formally be known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. She was convicted last year of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. Manning was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against her, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act.

"(CNN)Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says his government had blocked what he called a U.S.-backed coup plot that included plans to attack the presidential palace with a military jet. ""It is the government of the United States that is behind the plans of destabilization and coups against Venezuela. I have come here to denounce it. ... We have dismantled a coup attempt against democracy, against the stability of our homeland,"" Maduro said in a televised address Thursday. ""It was an attempt to use a group of officials from the air force to provoke a violent act, an attack."" He didn't name which members of the military were allegedly involved, but claimed that the U.S. government and right-wing opposition groups in Venezuela were behind the plan. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki on Friday dismissed the claims. ""These latest accusations, like all previous such accusations, are ludicrous,"" Psaki said. ""As a matter of long-standing policy, the United States does not support political transitions by non-constitutional means. Political transitions must be democratic, constitutional, peaceful and legal. We've seen many times that the Venezuelan government tries to distract from its own actions by blaming the United States or other members of the international community for events inside Venezuela,"" Psaki continued. ""These efforts reflect a lack of seriousness on the part of the Venezuelan government to deal with the grave situation it faces,"" she said. Venezuelan authorities detained those involved in the plot on Wednesday and Thursday, Maduro said. Maduro said the plot centered around a plan to commandeer a Super Tucano jet and attack the presidential palace this week, or a public demonstration that he was attending. Other buildings were on the target list, he said, including the teleSUR network's headquarters and Venezuela's Defense Ministry. U.S. officials, he said, provided visas to those involved in the plot and paid them in dollars. It's not the first time the Venezuelan leader has lobbed serious accusations against the United States. Shortly after former President Hugo Chavez's death, he suggested that the United States might have poisoned the socialist leader to cause the cancer that killed him. He expelled a group of U.S. diplomats from the country last year and accused the Pentagon and CIA of conspiring against him. The State Department has repeatedly rejected such accusations. Last year, it said Maduro's claim that U.S. officials had conspired against the Venezuelan government was ""baseless and false."" On the day of his election in 2013, Maduro vowed to use an ""iron fist"" against any coup attempts against his government. On Thursday, Maduro said the latest coup plot was tied to a coup attempt last year that involved several Venezuelan air force generals. The accusations come as opposition protesters mark the one-year anniversary of a wave of anti-government demonstrations that rocked Venezuela last year and led to the arrest of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. CNN's Michael Roa, Diane Ruggiero, Michael Martinez and Laura Koran contributed to this report.","Accusations are ""ludicrous,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman says .

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton is worried that European governments are being ""too wimpy"" in dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, London's mayor Boris Johnson said Friday. Johnson, on a trade mission to the United States, said that he was struck by the former secretary of state's insistence that Europe must do more to stand up to the Russian leader over Ukraine. ""One thing in particular she really wanted to get across -- that was she thought the Europeans were being too wimpy in dealing with Putin,"" Johnson said, at a Politico Playbook Breakfast event in Washington. Stressing he was not quoting Clinton word for word, two days after meeting her in New York, Johnson said that he was impressed by the likely Democratic presidential candidate's ""brilliant mastery"" of foreign policy. ""She thought in particular that we in Britain should be less dependent on Russian hyrdrocarbons and she thought we should get on with seeking alternative sources,"" Johnson said. ""Her general anxiety was that Putin, if unchallenged and unchecked, would continue to expand his influence in the perimeter of what was the Soviet Union. She spoke of alarm in Estonia and the Baltic states. I was very, very struck by that."" ""I was struck by the firmness with which she wanted us in Britain to stick it, to take it to Putin,"" he said, once again underlining he was not using Clinton's exact words but offering a ""brutal summary"" of what she said. Johnson, who is known for his scruffy shock of blond hair and colorful turn of phrase, said Clinton backed President Barack Obama's strategy on tackling ISIS and thought there was more everybody could be doing to support Kurdish Peshmerga forces fighting the extremist group. The mayor, who recently visited Kurdish areas in Iraq, quipped that he would not overstate the danger of his trip -- in a reference to NBC newsman Brian Williams who was suspended for six months for exaggerating his experiences during the Iraq war. ""You get in trouble over here .. I was nearish to the front line. I wouldn't say bullets were wanging over my head."" Johnson also said that Clinton was ""particularly gracious and charming"" in their meeting, considering his comments about her in a Daily Telegraph article in 2007 in which he accused her of ""purse-lipped political correctness"" and said she reminded him of a ""sadistic nurse in a mental hospital."" ""She was so nice and so kind that even in that article she found something to agree with,"" he said Friday. Johnson also weighed in on the controversy stoked up by a possible Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal who said in London last month after the Paris terror attacks that Muslim communities had made parts of the British capital and other European cities ""no go areas"" for people who did not share their faith. He said that Louisiana Gov. Jindal and those who shared his views were in need of some ""gentle education"" on the issue. ""I would be more than happy personally to escort Governor Jindal around any area of London that  he thinks is a no go zone. It really isn't true, it is complete nonsense ... there are no no go zones and nor will there be."" The flamboyant Johnson, while remaining mayor of London, is running for a seat in parliament at the next UK general election in May, and has long been tipped as a future leader of the Conservative Party and possible future prime minister.","Johnson says Clinton wants tougher European response .

"Courtroom experts call it a one-of-kind murder mystery that some people believe has yet to be completely solved. The remarkable story of Timothy Hennis and the stabbing deaths of a mother and two small girls is full of shocking legal twists and turns. During the course of 21 years, Hennis underwent three trials for the same crimes in three courtrooms. The case puts constitutional questions about double jeopardy squarely under the spotlight. It all began in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1985. Hennis, who was then a 27-year-old Army soldier based at nearby Fort Bragg, visited the home of Kathryn Eastburn and her husband, Gary, a captain in the Air Force. The Eastburns were planning to move outside the country and had placed an ad in the newspaper to sell their dog. Hennis stopped by the house in response to the ad. Four days later, when neighbors became concerned, police entered the home to find the bloody bodies of Kathryn Eastburn and two of her daughters. The youngest Eastburn child, a 22-month-old girl named Jana, was found in the house alive. Police said Gary Eastburn was undergoing training in Alabama at the time of the killings. Hennis came forward to police when he heard on TV news that authorities were looking for a man who visited the house in response to a newspaper ad. Investigators had been gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. A witness named Patrick Cone said he was near the Eastburn home the night of the killings and saw a tall white man wearing jeans, a knit cap and a Members Only jacket leaving the Eastburns' driveway with a trash bag. A police artist drew a sketch based on Cone's description. Prosecutors said the sketch resembled Hennis. Police put Hennis in a line up, and prosecutors said Cone identified Hennis as the man he saw. In 1986, his first trial . Police arrested Hennis and in 1986, prosecutors put him on trial. They said his motive was sex. The theory was that ""Hennis' wife was out of town, he had a new baby and so he decided to make a pass at a married mother of three -- and that didn't go well,"" former local reporter Scott Whisnant told CNN's ""Death Row Stories.""  Whisnant had covered the case in depth for Wilmington's Morning Star newspaper. Gary Eastburn told police several items were missing from his home, including an envelope of cash, an ATM card and the Eastburn account password. Police said the ATM card was used to withdraw $150 twice over two days. Prosecutors said Hennis was behind on his rent, which was about $300. He paid his rent the Monday after the killings, prosecutors said. A woman who used the same bank ATM shortly after the Eastburns' ATM card was used told investigators she saw a man nearby matching Hennis' description. During the trial, prosecutors showed jurors gruesome police photos to illustrate their case. The jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced Hennis to death. While on death row, Hennis received a mysterious, anonymous letter in the mail: ""Dear Mr. Hennis,"" the letter said. ""I did the crime, I murdered the Eastburns. Sorry you're doin the time. I'll be safely out of North Carolina when you read this. Thanks, Mr. X"" The letter's author was never determined. A second chance to prove his case . Hennis' lawyers appealed his case to North Carolina's Supreme Court, where judges ruled that the graphic police photos had wrongly influenced jurors to render a guilty verdict. The ruling allowed Hennis a rare second chance to prove his case in a retrial. Compared with the first trial, Hennis' defense attorneys engineered a complete 180 on their strategy. After exhaustive preparation, they attacked many of the prosecutors' most damaging accusations one by one. They discredited the prosecutors' star witness, Patrick Cone, and his testimony. He had testified that the weather was clear the night of the killings, but another witness said it was overcast. A new defense witness who looked similar to Hennis testified he was walking in the neighborhood at the time of the killings. The witness, John Raupaugh, ""lived down the street from the Eastburns,"" Whisnant told ""Death Row Stories."" ""He was an uneasy sleeper and had a habit of walking the neighborhood at 3 in the morning. He often wore a beanie hat and he had a black Members Only jacket."" Raupaugh's testimony, defense attorneys said, gave jurors the reasonable doubt they needed to acquit Hennis in 1989. Escaping death row as a newly freed man, Hennis then re-enlisted in the Army, eventually retiring in 2004 as a master sergeant. But prosecutors continued to pursue the case. In 2006, vaginal swabs from a rape kit taken from Kathryn Eastburn's body yielded new evidence. DNA testing was an imperfect science in the 1980s, so the semen found in Kathryn Eastburn's vagina wasn't pursued as evidence during the first trial. But by the 2000s, technological advances in DNA analysis had improved. Experts said the DNA from Eastburn's rape kit was consistent with Hennis' DNA. U.S. Army steps in . A team of military attorneys evaluated the case and the Army decided to pursue it. Hennis was recalled to active duty two years after his retirement and promptly arrested on three counts of murder. ""Tim Hennis is the only person in United States history who's been tried for his life three times after guilty and not guilty verdicts,"" said Whisnant, whose book ""Innocent Victims"" was made into a 1996 TV movie. Many observers were surprised. Wasn't Hennis shielded by constitutional protections against so-called double jeopardy? ""In the simplest terms, if a defendant is acquitted and the prosecutor says to the judge, 'I want a do-over,' that is clearly prohibited. That's the definition of double jeopardy,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""But if a different prosecutor in a different court comes up with a different way to frame charges in the same crime, then that is generally permissible."" Maj. Rob Stelle of the Army Judge Advocate General Corps, who worked on the Hennis case, told ""Death Row Stories"" that the military's ability to prosecute a case that has already been tried is ""well-settled law. Nothing the state does actually effects what the federal government can do."" ""In a very narrow category of cases where the federal government believes an injustice has been done, then federal prosecutors will step in,"" Toobin said. ""But by and large, they operate in separate spheres."" When it came down to it, the prosecution's case in Hennis' court-martial hinged on the DNA testing results. ""The sperm found in the vagina of Mrs. Kathryn Eastburn is the person who raped and slaughtered her and her children. And that's Timothy Hennis,"" Maj. Matt Scott, another Army JAG attorney who worked on the case, told ""Death Row Stories."" The jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced Hennis to death. He now sits in solitary confinement on death row at Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas, awaiting appeal. But many unanswered questions remain. ""There's a ton of physical evidence in that house that they can't explain,"" Whisnant told CNN's ""Death Row Stories."" A head hair was found in the Eastburns' bed that is not Hennis', Whisnant said. Unidentified DNA was found under Kathryn Eastburn's fingernails. ""We should be running that DNA against our known database,"" Whisnant said. ""Let's find out what happened."" It likely will be a long time before the final page is written in this bizarre murder mystery. Even after the appeals process is over, Hennis cannot be executed without presidential approval. In recent years, that hasn't happened very often. The U.S. military has not executed anyone from its ranks since 1961.","Soldier Tim Hennis convicted in 1986 and 2010 of murdering a mother and her two girls .

"New Delhi (CNN)At least 11 passengers were killed when a train jumped the rails in southern India on Friday, authorities said. Nine cars of the Bengaluru-Ernakulam Express train derailed some 50 kilometers from Bangalore in Karnataka state at around 7.30 am local time, said Chandrashekhar Gupta, a spokesman for India's southwestern railway. Rescue crews have retrieved 11 bodies from the wrecked compartments, Gupta told CNN. More than 25 people were injured in the derailment, nine of them critically, he added. India's vast railway network runs 7,000 trains serving 13 million passengers every day, according to officials. But the country's rail safety record is poor, with several accidents reported each year. Authorities say they are using new technology and training their workforce to try to improve safety standards.","More than 25 people are injured, nine of them critically, an official says .

"(CNN)An Argentine prosecutor said Friday there is enough evidence to continue an investigation into whether President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner hid Iran's alleged role in a deadly 1994 bombing, a probe that paused after a different prosecutor died mysteriously last month. Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor Alberto Nisman claimed before he died in January: that evidence shows Fernandez and other top officials tried to cover up Iran's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Pollicita sent his report to a judge, who is expected to examine it next week after he returns from vacation. The judge can determine whether the case can proceed to trial. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, alleged last month that Iran was behind the attack, and that Fernandez, to help sweeten a trade deal, covered up Tehran's involvement. That trade deal, Nisman alleged, involved cash-strapped Argentina receiving Iranian oil in exchange for meat and grain. Nisman made the allegation in a nearly 300-page report. But on January 18, one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations, he was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Nisman filled with fear before his death, friend says . In his trash can, investigators say, was a 6-month-old draft warrant for Fernandez's arrest. Fernandez initially called it a suicide, but a test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman's hands. Fernandez said a few days later that she didn't believe Nisman killed himself, alleging that some members of the country's intelligence agency fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and were responsible for his death. The President and the other accused government officials deny any cover-up in the bombing. Anibal Fernandez, the President's general secretary, said the allegations against Fernandez are ""a clear maneuver to destabilize democracy"" in the South American country. He also said the investigation lacks ""judicial value"" or ""importance."" About 10 years ago, Nisman was appointed as special prosecutor to investigate the bombing by then-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez's late husband.

"(CNN)Rapper Drake pulled a Beyoncé, surprising fans late Thursday with a 17-track album. ""If You're Reading This It's Too Late"" may have been tipped off earlier in the day when the artist debuted a short film titled ""Jungle,"" which ranges from historical footage to scenes of a young Drake singing and rapping. Soon after, he tweeted what appeared to be his album cover. Tracks include collaborations with artists Lil Wayne, Travi$ Scott and PartyNextDoor. A handwritten note on Drake's OVO site gives shout-outs to the Toronto Raptors, Madonna and Ginuwine, among others. The rapper also took to Instagram to ask whether fans liked his mixtape. Billboard's Keith Caulfield reports that the album could be the rapper's fourth No. 1 on the publication's 200 chart. ""While it's still a bit early to get a proper projection on what it might sell through the end of the tracking week on Sunday, Feb. 15, sources have floated figures as high as 400,000,"" Caulfield writes.

"(CNN)With her hijab, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha may have stood out. But in every respect, she felt that she fit in -- as a proud, and blessed, American. Even if most of her North Carolina neighbors didn't wear the same Muslim head covering that she did, Mohammad believed that there were ""still so many ways that I feel ... embedded in the fabric that is our culture,"" meaning the American culture. ""That's the beautiful thing here, is it doesn't matter where you come from,"" she said last summer as part of NPR's StoryCorps project. ""There are so many different people from so many different places, ... backgrounds and religions. But here we're all one. ""It's beautiful to see. People of different areas interacting and being family, one community."" Yusor Mohammad's light, her idealism, was extinguished Tuesday with gunshots that killed not only her, but her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. A neighbor of the victims, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, turned himself in to police the same night and has been charged with murder. Authorities haven't announced any motive, but Mohammad's father thinks he knows. His daughters and son-in-law died, Mohammad Abu-Salha said, because they were Muslim. If so, that constitutes a hate crime. The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement Friday afternoon that said the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened ""a parallel preliminary inquiry"" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated. President Barack Obama mentioned the FBI inquiry in his Friday afternoon statement about the ""brutal and outrageous murders"" in the college town of Chapel Hill. ""No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship,"" he said. ""Michelle and I offer our condolences to the victims' loved ones.  As we saw with the overwhelming presence at the funeral of these young Americans, we are all one American family."" Investigators indicated they haven't found any signs of a hate crime so far, saying the evidence suggests the shootings stem from a parking dispute. But 150 Islamic, Arab, Jewish, Sikh, Asian-American and other civil rights and faith groups want a closer look. In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, they said there is enough circumstantial evidence to ""warrant a federal hate crime investigation,"" an inquiry they say is important to the victims' families and Muslims across the United States. ""Federal leadership is necessary in this case in order to send the strongest message to the public that acts of violence like these have no place in civil society and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" the groups write. ""... As American Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim now, more than ever, fear for their safety, the American people need to hear a strong message from our nation's chief law enforcement officer."" They aren't the only ones demanding action out of Washington. Suzanne Barakat, Deah Shaddy Barakat's sister, said Friday on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that a disagreement over parking didn't spark the killings, because her family members knew to avoid the ""disputed"" parking spot. Her family members were targeted because they were Muslims, Suzanne Barakat said, adding that Hicks terrorized her family and the slayings should be considered an act of terrorism. ""It's time people call it what it is,"" she said. The story has gotten traction internationally. Al-Azhar, an Egyptian center of Islamic scholarship, has called the killings a ""terrorist cowardly act"" rooted in ""racism and Islamaphobia."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he has called Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry. Before Obama made his statement, Erdogan said, ""President Obama, Mr. Kerry, (Vice President) Biden, at this point have not made any declaration of respect. This is telling. ... And if you stay silent when faced with an incident like this and don't make a statement, the world will stay silent towards you."" Many of the victims' friends and relatives gathered Thursday for their funerals and for candlelight vigils on college campuses such as North Carolina State University in Raleigh, which is where Barakat met his future wife, and where she and her sister went to school. ""These three people, as young as they were, were a source of inspiration, warmth and light for our community,"" said one woman speaking at the vigil. That's how Nada Salem knew them. They weren't just Muslims, she said of her friends, but ""three good people."" ""No one should die like that,"" Salem told CNN's ""New Day,"" ""especially when you're that great."" Mohammad Abu-Salha, father of the two slain women, said the problems started not when Barakat lived in the condo by himself, but when his new wife, Yusor Mohammad, moved in. He said his daughter told him, referring to the neighbor, ""Daddy, I think he hates us for who we are and how we look."" Yusor Mohammad's good friend, Amira Ata, agreed that something doesn't add up. She recalled one time Mohammad told her about the neighbor coming over with a gun to complain about noise after a few friends had gone over to play a board game. ""We were completely shocked because it's not normal for you to have a disagreement of some sort with your neighbor and for you to go over there with a gun,"" Ata said. When the news came out about the slayings, that neighbor jumped to mind. Ata said ""the only thing that really makes sense is that he didn't like them because they were different."" ""If he went and maybe killed all the neighbors, maybe then we can be like, 'Oh, he has an issue,' "" she said. ""They were our friends, and we feel like they were targeted for a reason."" Police said Hicks has no prior criminal record and is cooperating with the investigation. Rob Maitland, the lawyer for Hicks' wife, Karen, said the shooting ""highlights the importance of access to mental health care services."" Karen Hicks, who has been in the process of divorce, said her husband had been at odds with various neighbors of various backgrounds over parking. That's what this is about, she said, contending that what happened is not a hate crime. She said, ""I can say with my absolute belief that this incident had nothing to do with religion or the victims' faith."" Opinion: 3 slain college students strived for a better world .

"(CNN)I remember some lonely Valentine's Days. Yes, you know it's just one big commercial Hallmark invention. But you still envy your peers who are sitting down to an expensive candlelit dinner with their honey, loving their cheesy card and enjoying the roses. You think that every couple you see is lucky in love, even though it's not true. If you drill down on your blossoming blues, you will feel like you are destined to be alone forever and then work yourself up into a pretty yucky pity-party. I am not making light of the situation. Being single on February 14 can be painful when the day is marketed everywhere as the official designated romantic day of the year. It's especially miserable if you've been trying hard to meet someone and striking out, or if you've recently broken up with someone you loved. It's important to try and do an end run around any deepening sadness. There are a number of ways to avoid a noxious slump. You can remind yourself how lucky you are in other ways (mildly effective), how artificial the day is (so what?), how many of those couples will actually break up (mean-spirited) or you can make Valentine's Day a blast and actually enjoy yourself. Don't turn Valentine's Day into a Cry Day, a Moping Day or a Drinking Day. Here are some of my favorite remedies for lonely Valentine's Days: . Distract yourself with something fabulous . Sometimes, that's the only way to get out of a really bad mood. In other words, simply be so engaged in something that you can't even remember it is Valentine's Day. So this would be a good day to go do something that was fully absorbing and exciting. It might mean going to a scalper and splurging on a great game, band or Broadway show. Or, be a tourist in your own city and go on a city lights helicopter tour, or do your first sky dive. Less expensive, but still expansive -- how about signing up for a day or evening at a Korean or Russian spa and getting the full treatment! The point of all this is to keep yourself in the moment as opposed to being alone with your refrigerator, giving in to its siren call to open the door and eat every carton of ice . Have a fantastic dinner party with friends . Happy is the person with a dense network of friends. A study by a group of researchers at Brigham Young Hospital said that having a ""rich network"" of intimate relationships (friends and family) was more predictive of mental and physical health than whether the person struggled with alcoholism, smoking or major diseases. There is basically nothing better for you than hanging out with people you love or like a lot.  A raucous dinner party of your favorite peeps is going to make you happy, feel fortunate and know that your life is on the right track, whether or not you have that special someone. Better yet, make it a pajama party so you are not alone at 2 a.m. wondering why you ever got a king-sized mattress. Spend a day with Mother Nature . Yes, your heart beats faster when you are in love. But it also beats faster when you are in the mountains hiking, snowshoeing, skiing or maybe on dirt bikes exploring back woods trails. Mother Nature fills your heart with wonder, even adoration, and those endorphins pulsing through your body create contentment and sometimes, bliss. Your world seems complete -- and it is. Feeling strong and getting physical is a good anecdote to the blues. And if the outdoors doesn't woo you, consider finding a gym ""boot camp"" for the weekend or sign up for a dance class that doesn't need to be partnered. I learned some African dances from the Sierra Leone area and they are a perfect way to raise the mood. Make someone else's day great . There's nothing like going to help someone less fortunate than you that makes you kick yourself in the butt for even momentarily feeling sorry for yourself. Bring Valentines to a children's hospital, a homeless shelter or maybe just your shut-in great aunt. Give joy to others. You will like yourself better and you might continue this custom even after you have found a loving partner. Maybe get a group of other single friends to go with you and go out afterward together so that you can share that fulfilled feeling of having given love to people who badly need it. There are other things you can do, but the point is that single people can find a way to celebrate this day that will not feel like a compromise. Love is wonderful -- it expands your heart and soul -- but you don't need a spouse or partner to experience it.  On the other hand, be assured, romantic love is out there and it only takes one great introduction, one chance moment in a grocery store, or one click of a profile online to change your luck and make next Valentine's Day a very different one. But who knows? You might like all the things you did this Valentine's Day so much that you'll do the same thing next year -- just adding, the love of your life.","Being single on Valentine's Day can be painful when it's marketed everywhere as the romantic day of the year .

"Weeks of brutal Israeli strikes on the heavily-populated Gaza strip have seen a number of political actors come forward to present a cease-fire plan. The deadlock, however, seems to be between Egypt and Qatar -- both of whom have considerable leverage over Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.  The truth is that due to political bias on each side, neither country is fit to be an exclusive mediator in this situation. But only one of these two states holds undeniable geographic and political advantages: Egypt is the only Arab state that borders Gaza, meaning that -- for better or worse -- it is the strip's only access point to the outside world. Egypt is also the only one of the two that has a direct diplomatic channel with the Israelis, which is essential to implement any deal. During the Muslim Brotherhood's rule in Cairo, Qatar offered Egypt $8 billion in grants and loans, a strategy that may have been well meant, but that ultimately backfired. Because the Muslim Brotherhood felt Qatar was a reliable source of funding, it didn't feel the need to even negotiate a political compromise and economic reform with other factions of Egypt's political and civil society, which was a condition set by western lenders to extend a $4.8 billion loan. This expedited the downfall of the group. The truth is that Qatar's overall strategy with the Muslim Brotherhood has failed miserably: It resulted in the alienation of the Brotherhood in Egypt -- so much so that the group was ousted from power in a popularly-backed military coup, and meant that many Egyptians were indifferent to the bloody massacre of the group's members that followed. Qatari support for Muslim Brotherhood affiliates elsewhere in the region, such as Libya, Jordan, and Tunisia, has also backfired resulting in them being sidelined from power. All of this adds to quite an unfortunate year for the Gulf emirate. Qatar's continuous financial and media support for the Muslim Brotherhood through the once-popular Al Jazeera Arabic, the 24-hour, Egypt-centric Mubasher Misr, which largely reflects a Muslim Brotherhood perspective, and a slew of new Qatari-backed Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated news websites based in London, have further poisoned relations between Qatar and Egypt. Egypt's Foreign Minister recently accused Qatar and Turkey of undermining his country's efforts for a cease-fire in Gaza. Furthermore, some in Egypt consider Qatar's increasingly close ties with Turkey a liability. Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is likely to be the country's next president, in an interview with CNN called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a ""tyrant"" adding that Egypt has no genuine role to play in Gaza. There is no doubt that Egypt will reject any offer it feels will diminish its regional role, especially one coming from Qatar and Turkey. It is ironic, therefore, that the efforts of Qatar and Turkey, who both want to see an end to the bloodshed in Gaza, are self-defeating. Hamas has genuine reasons to reject what are said to be the exact same cease-fire conditions it previously accepted in November 2012 when Egypt was ruled by its Muslim Brotherhood affiliates. The cost in Gazan lives this past fortnight has been too high to accept a return to a situation where Gaza was effectively the world's largest prison complex, with the lifting and not a mere ""easing"" of the blockade at minimum. Qatar's move to offer Hamas a safe refuge after the group decided to leave Syria in the wake of the civil war was a strategic move. This gave Qatar a significant advantage over most states in the region -- except, that is, for Egypt. Qatar's recent proposal to finance a commercial port in Gaza will likely reduce Egyptian control of the movement of individuals, goods and materials in and out of the strip, and is best done with Egypt's approval and oversight rather than without it. In an apparent attempt to placate Egypt, Qatar's foreign minister called its role in Gaza essential, although Egypt was conspicuously absent from a Paris meeting on the current conflict that included Qatar, Turkey and some Western states. Egypt's absence could perhaps be due to a Qatari-backed proposal announced by the Doha-based former Israeli MP Azmi Bishara to internationalize the Rafah Crossing and place it under the supervision of the U.N. and some Arab nations. Qatar should not repeat the same mistakes that offered the Brotherhood in Egypt and elsewhere a false sense of omnipotence and infallibility, and should understand that Egypt's geographical and political leverage trumps any financial and media coverage Doha can offer Hamas. If the genuine intention is to stop the Israeli onslaught on Gaza, Doha must concede its soft power to Cairo's hard power. The sooner Qatar realizes this, the sooner the horrible Gaza conflict will come to an end.","Egypt and Qatar have leverage over Hamas, writes Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi .

"(CNN)It swept across 214 countries worldwide and killed more than 18,000 people. The 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, dubbed ""swine flu,"" put the entire world on alert. The outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic until August 2010. But threat of deadly disease outbreaks didn't stop -- or start -- there. In 2003, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crossed the world, originating in Asia and reaching Canada in less than a day. Then, in 2012, a new virus emerged in the Middle East and has now entered the global arena. Aptly named Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) it continued to spread globally with outbreaks now taking place in South Korea. As of June 3, 1179 people have been infected with MERS-CoV across 25 countries --including 442 deaths -- according to the World Health Organization. The current outbreak in South Korea has led to 35 confirmed cases -- including 3 deaths -- and as of June 2, 1369 people were under quarantine. The virus began its spread slowly initially but is now gaining momentum. In 2014, the disease on everyone's mind was Ebola. The Ebola virus has infected more than 27,000 people across ten countries to date, with more than 11,100 deaths as of 13 June 2015. However, despite the high number of infections, the spread of Ebola remains technically an outbreak, not a pandemic, because it hasn't spread globally. ""It will only be over when the last person with Ebola is either dead or recovered without infecting other people,"" stated Peter Piot, who co-discovered the virus in the 1970s, at the 2015 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. But he warned that risks from such outbreaks were far from over, saying: ""There will be other Ebola outbreaks and there will be other epidemics, not least influenza."" But is the world ready? Hundreds of infectious diseases continue to plague the planet in both urban and rural locations, from ones spread by insects, such as Chikungunya, which is currently sweeping through the Americas, to those spread by water, such as cholera, or human contact, such as Ebola. ""Infectious organisms can travel in humans, food and insects ... you can't stop disease from crossing borders,"" says David Heymann, head of the Centre for Global Health Security at think tank Chatham House. One initiative in place to identify those posing a more global risk is the WHO-led Global Alert and Response Network (GOARN). ""[It's] a series of laboratories, national public health institutions and groups like Medecins Sans Frontiers who report regularly when an outbreak occurs,"" says Heymann. The goal is the rapid identification, confirmation and response to outbreaks of international importance. ""The ones with most risk are airborne,"" says Heymann. The greatest pandemic to date was the Spanish flu which spread in 1918 and is estimated to have infected a third of the world's population at the time and caused approximately 50 million deaths. More recently, the hardest hitting outbreaks were the SARS coronavirus in 2003, followed by H1N1 influenza virus in 2009. All of which were respiratory infections with the potential to spread far and fast. ""With flu I'm quite sure there will be another pandemic,"" says Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at Imperial College, London. Barclay researches the origin of pandemics and why some viruses cross species to jump from animals into humans. In the case of H1N1, the virus was a re-assortment of bird flu and pig influenza viruses, resulting in a new form infectious to humans and with no immunity among those at risk. ""If it's a new one, there's no pre-existing antibodies to hold that off ... and you may then pass it on to someone else,"" says Barclay. Experts agree that future outbreaks and potential pandemics may occur, but the lessons learned from previous ones should enable a faster response. The key is to identify the virus, estimate its threat and its potential to spread across a population as quickly as possible to then put a pandemic preparedness plan into action. ""Flu is difficult to control in terms of an outbreak,"" says Barclay, as the virus has the ability to spread before people show symptoms, meaning measures such as airport screening are ineffective. The converse is true for viruses such as Ebola and particularly SARS, where people are only contagious once showing symptoms of the disease. ""We were able to contain SARS,"" says Barclay, because patients could only transmit the virus days after symptoms had begun. If a patient was admitted to hospital soon after their symptoms appeared, there was a lesser risk that they had already infected others in their wake. The challenge facing public health teams across the world is the fact they must be ready to expect the unexpected. SARS, swine flu and Ebola took everyone by surprise. ""It's completely unpredictable in the end,"" says Barclay. Confronting this unknown are mathematical modelers, including the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) -- a network of scientists who visualize how a disease might spread. ""It's useful to predict where an outbreak is going,"" says Irene Eckstrand, the former scientific director of MIDAS. Under Eckstrand's leadership, the modelers in her program predicted scenarios for various big outbreaks, including H1N1 and currently Ebola. Information about the biology of the virus, the mode of transmission, and the geographical spread can be used to predict who will be affected next and how fast they'll be reached. The various scenarios modeled are then used to inform policy decisions such as travel restrictions and school closures by determining their impact. It's also crucial to envision the distribution of vaccines, to ensure the most vulnerable are reached first. In the case of Ebola, models helped determine the number of hospital beds required in high-risk areas. The likelihood of disease models accurately reflecting reality are regularly called into question but Eckstrand states they are crucial when working with the unknown. ""Infectious disease models are never going to accurately predict the future,"" she says. ""[They] are better at saying 'if we do this, here's the range of things that can happen.'"" When a virus is well understood, such models can be generated quickly. ""Models can integrate complexities in a way our brains can't,"" says Eckstrand. However, the spread of a disease is about more than its biology. Human behavior plays a key role and is much harder to predict, as was the case for Ebola, where burial traditions and cultural practices aided transmission when the outbreak emerged. The lack of trust between those affected in West Africa and their health authorities also prevented people from seeking diagnosis and treatment. ""[There's been a] great deal more collaboration in Ebola,"" says Eckstrand speaking of weekly phone calls between those working on control, including scientists, researchers, homeland security and national laboratories. ""The world is unprepared,"" stated WHO director general Margaret Chan at a session alongside Peter Piot in Davos. ""After H1N1, the conclusion was the world is ill prepared for severe and sustained disease."" In her eyes, the scale of Ebola last year was unprecedented. New ideas are needed to prevent this happening again in the future. ""We need to think outside the box in the future,"" says Barclay, whose team works on the development of vaccines to stop the H1N1 pandemic in its tracks. But she doesn't think disease-specific vaccines are the way forward for all outbreaks. ""For Ebola, Chikungunya, Lassa fever, Marburg ... are we really going to invent one for each one?"" Barclay instead thinks one way forward could be therapeutics that tackle the symptoms of disease, meaning where diseases have similar symptoms -- such as Ebola and Marburg virus disease -- there could be a drug against the symptoms of all of them to reduce further spread of infections. But when it comes to influenza, where the greatest global risk lies, the experts seem more optimistic. ""If we had another flu pandemic we would be fairly well set to run models quickly,"" says Eckstrand. Given the likelihood of another pandemic, Barclay's team see it fit in this case to develop disease-specific antivirals and vaccines against influenza when it arrives. In 2009, the development of an H1N1 vaccine slowed down the spread of the virus during the second wave of its transmission. The time taken for development meant it wasn't available during the first big wave of infections. At the core of it all, the global monitoring systems in place are constantly being tuned to spot any strange, or new, occurrences. ""I look at GOARN as a safety net,"" concludes Heymann. GOARN is growing its capability to both spot and control disease outbreaks, with a network of labs, provision of advice and assistance when a new outbreak occurs. It is also building capacity within countries through improved labs, technology and skilled staff, to enable systems to be in place worldwide to tackle new or emerging infections spreading throughout a population. ""Countries that have had Ebola are more ready to deal with it, like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),"" says Heymann of the country where the disease was first identified in 1976. Congolese communities now have a word for the disease and messages are in place to send out when a new outbreak occurs. With MERS now climbing to the top as the infection on people's minds, its worth knowing that whilst we may not be quite ready to prevent disease outbreaks, we are, at least, more ready than ever before. Epidemics throughout history .","Ebola, SARS and swine flu are just a few of the deadly diseases outbreaks in recent years .

"(CNN) -- Recently developed ""touch DNA"" technology has cleared all members of JonBenet Ramsey's family of her slaying, authorities said Wednesday. Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy said no one in the Ramsey family is considered a suspect and formally apologized in a letter to John Ramsey for the cloud of suspicion his family has lived under for nearly 12 years. ""To the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry,"" Lacy wrote.  Read the letter » . Instead, DNA tests conducted earlier this year point to an ""unknown male,"" in the 6-year-old child beauty pageant contestant's December 1996 slaying. Early on in the case, Boulder police said parents John and Patsy Ramsey, and their son, Burke, were under ""an umbrella of suspicion"" in JonBenet's death, although they were never named as suspects. John Ramsey found his daughter's body in the basement of the family's Boulder, Colorado, home on December 26, 1996. She had been strangled and beaten. Testing in 1998 showed that DNA evidence found in the girl's underwear and beneath her fingernails was from an unidentified man and did not match anyone in the Ramsey family.  Follow the timeline » . Tests conducted in March revealed that new DNA collected from a pair of long johns matched a sample previously taken from the child's panties. Genetic material was scraped from the waistband of the long johns, which JonBenet was wearing over her underwear when her body was found. Lacy said in her statement that authorities believe the long johns were either replaced or removed by her killer. Additional tests were conducted to ensure that the genetic material did not come from law enforcement or medical examiner's personnel, the statement said. ""The unexplained third-party DNA on the clothing of the victim is very significant and powerful evidence,"" Lacy's statement said. ""It is therefore the position of the Boulder District Attorney's Office that this profile belongs to the perpetrator of the homicide."" That same DNA also exonerated John Mark Karr, a one-time schoolteacher, after he was arrested in Thailand and confessed to the killing in 2006. Lacy was widely criticized for the handling of Karr's arrest. Lacy took pains to state that her office does not consider JonBenet's father, her mother -- now deceased -- or older brother to be suspects. She said she released the findings in the interest of justice. Lacy blamed ""evidence reported by the media"" rather than ""evidence that had been tested in court"" for suspicions cast on the Ramseys as the case was investigated, suspicions that she said ""created an ongoing living hell for the Ramsey family and their friends."" She added, ""We believe that justice indicates that the Ramseys be treated only as victims of this very serious crime."" John Ramsey told CNN affiliate KUSA that he is ""grateful"" that there is ""irrefutable DNA evidence"" that clears the family.  Watch John Ramsey express his gratitude » . ""It's hard for people to accept and think that someone could come into a home and murder a child from their bed and we were perhaps an answer,"" he said. ""It became an entertainment event for a lot of the media, sadly. ... It boosted ratings, attracted viewers, to develop that controversy."" Ramsey continued, ""You know the pain, the intense pain that we felt was the loss of our child. The accusations and the finger pointing weren't significant ... We were deeply crushed by the loss of our child, particularly in the manner that it happened."" Ramsey said his late wife also would be ""thankful for the continuing efforts to find the killer."" Atlanta attorney Lin Wood, who represents the Ramseys, told CNN that Patsy Ramsey's death is ""one of the sad notes of today's news, because she's not here with us to celebrate the vindication of her family."" ""What's happened today, though, is irrefutable DNA evidence has now resulted in John and Patsy and their son, Burke, being officially cleared in this case,"" he added. ""This family suffered too many years, too many heartaches of being falsely accused in the murder of their child.""","New DNA tests exonerate all members of JonBenet Ramsey's family .

They have also extended their presence far south of their historical northern stronghold, advances that prompted Yemen's entire executive branch to resign on January 22, following a successful siege of the presidential compound. In the process, the Houthis have destroyed Yemen's legal government, thrown out its draft constitution, infiltrated its intelligence services and security forces, and demanded that all sides in Yemen's complex and acrimonious socio-political-economic system play by their rules. Meanwhile, their military expansion is beginning to fuel sectarian Sunni support for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which is recruiting and expanding its operations. Despite all this, President Barack Obama is still defending the ""Yemen model,"" describing it as the ""best option."" And Michael Vickers, undersecretary of defense for intelligence, insists that the United States has been able to continue some of its counterterrorism operations in Yemen despite the rising influence of the Houthi movement and the fact that the administration has had to suspend some operations as the Houthis have penetrated some intelligence installations. All this leaves the United States with few counterterrorism options in Yemen aside from the ability to conduct drone strikes. Yet the Yemen model was never supposed to be just about drone strikes, especially as the U.S. drone campaign in Yemen has not been intense enough to disrupt AQAP. The terror group retains some of the capabilities of an insurgent force, is able to establish and control its own safe havens, and can still challenge Yemen's security forces directly. Since Obama is (rightly) unwilling to deploy U.S. forces to fight the AQAP insurgents directly, any strategy for dealing with that group therefore rests on having a viable partner on the ground to conduct operations against the group. But even in its heyday, before the collapse of the current government, the administration's Yemen policy had had only limited success. America's main goal in training specialized units in the Yemeni military was to enable them to focus on killing AQAP high-value targets. Yet while Yemenis needed — and received — special counterterrorism capabilities to take out these top AQAP commanders, the military was no match for insurgents on the ground. Unfortunately, the administration's Yemen model did not bridge the gap between what the Yemeni army could do and what it needed to do. Meanwhile, U.S. policy also too often ignored other potential local allies in Yemen, some of which had a successful track record against AQAP. So what can the United States do now? There is no easy strategy for success in Yemen. But one thing is certain: A partnership with the Houthis -- who prefer to run the country as puppet masters from the wings, infiltrating rather than controlling the Yemeni military and governmental institutions -- is not the answer. The fact is that the Houthis are not perceived on the ground as a neutral actor, and their actions are driving Yemen toward a sectarian conflict in a country where religious fighting has been virtually nonexistent. A further barrier to working with the Houthis is that Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. partner in Yemen, sees them as an Iranian proxy and as a threat. Riyadh has reacted to the rise of the Houthis in Sanaa by suspending most aid to Yemen, ending the much-needed financial assistance that kept the economy afloat. Getting the Yemeni state to a point where it is stable is a costly endeavor, and the Saudis are unlikely to pay the price to sustain what they see as an Iranian foothold on the Arabian Peninsula. The White House needs to admit that its counterterrorism model is not working, and should perhaps heed calls from both sides of the aisle for an increase in special operations forces and covert operations in Yemen beyond the trainers and advisers already there. A small deployment of special operations troops -- not a ""massive"" ""perpetual"" deployment of U.S. troops -- could both enable and assist Yemeni army units fighting AQAP insurgents. These forces could identify and support local partners in the fight against AQAP, working with others beyond the central government. They could also identify local populations tempted by AQAP assistance in their fight against the Houthis. The United States must also change its regional, political and diplomatic approach. We have to abandon the notion that our only alternatives are working exclusively through a dysfunctional (or, in this case, nonexistent) central government or outsourcing our policy to regional partners. Instead, we must work to establish relationships with power brokers in key areas of Yemen such as oil-rich Ma'rib and Hadramawt provinces. Of course, we will need regional interlocutors to make connections and build ties, but the United States will have to own and execute its own political strategy. That strategy should aim at constructing coalitions of locals willing to fight against AQAP while also seeking to mediate the disputes that are tearing Yemeni society apart and creating openings for AQAP to expand. The problems in the Middle East today will not be resolved purely by state-to-state interactions, nor will they be solved by redrawing borders. Ultimately, Yemen's AQAP problem is never going to be solved by dealing solely with the central government, which has little control over the entire country. At the same time, the White House is right when it says the United States ""cannot be an occupying force in a place like Yemen."" Large numbers of American troops in Yemen would probably be as unwelcome as the Houthi militias. But doggedly defending the current Yemen strategy -- an approach that risks descending into complete failure -- is misguided. We need to be honest with ourselves -- whatever we were trying to do in Yemen has failed. It's time to turn the page.","The United States suspended operations at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen this week .

After posing for Salvador Dali at 13 and for her first Vogue cover at 15, Dell'Orefice recently told New You magazine that she's actually worked more in the past 25 years than ever before. ""I had a very respectable career but I didn't have a specific look,"" said Dell'Orefice. ""I was a chameleon.""

"(CNN)Battered Boston is bracing for another big one. Blizzard warnings will be in effect from 7 p.m. Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday for much of eastern Massachusetts, including metropolitan Boston. Snow accumulations of 10 to 14 inches are forecast, with winds from 30 to 40 mph likely. Gusts of up to 75 mph -- hurricane strength -- are expected. Travel will become nearly impossible with whiteout conditions expected, along with dangerous wind chills well below zero. Power outages can be expected in many areas, the National Weather Service said. Speaking of hurricanes, the storm will have a widespread wind field, and blustery, frigid conditions may reach as far south as the North Carolina mountains. Some areas of the country will have temperatures 40 degrees below normal. Many will see single digits for their lows. And many will be below zero. In Boston, it seems like they have been digging out from under the snow for weeks, only to have more fall. Three storms have Bostonians ready to break up with the white stuff. The snow that has already fallen in Boston is almost the stuff of mythology. The city has set a record 42 inches for the whole month of February. It's only about half over. And it's caused small business to hurt. So much so that Gov. Charlie Baker on Friday declared next week as Valentine's week. Can't get to your romantic restaurant on Saturday, or you forgot to make reservations? The governor is giving you an extension. Mayor Marty Walsh said Thursday the city is bringing in additional resources to help deal with the expected snowfall. ""The Saturday storm creates a sense of urgency. We're taking extra steps to make sure Boston and people can dig out on Sunday,"" he said. He urged people who were going out to celebrate the lovers' holiday do so early and do so close to home. With the special day on Saturday and bad weather in the picture, one restaurant owner said too many people are going to try to go out Friday instead. ""Everyone is going to try to cram it in on Friday. Everyone is already booked on those three days. We can only do so much business. We can't make it up on one day,"" Damien DiPaola, who owns Carmelina's, told CNN affiliate WBZ. DiPaola said he's been losing more than $10,000 a week in business due to the succession of storms. He thinks people who have reservations for Saturday and Sunday will cancel. Florists and other businesses who count on Valentine's Day for extra sales are having their own kind of troubles. Some flights bringing in flowers didn't make it yet, and drivers were navigating roads only to end up searching for a place to park while a runner races to make the delivery. Eight of Massachusetts' neighbors are pitching in, sending dump trucks and front-end loaders. New York City was giving up two snow melters, one of which was in action Thursday night, WBZ reported.","Strong winds are expected in this storm, all the way to western North Carolina .

"(CNN)Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has called for a ""religious revolution,"" asking Muslim leaders to help in the fight against extremism. In a speech celebrating the birthday of the Prophet Muḥammad, which coincided with New Year's Day, he said they had no time to lose. ""I say and repeat, again, that we are in need of a religious revolution. You imams are responsible before Allah. The entire world is waiting on you. The entire world is waiting for your word ... because the Islamic world is being torn, it is being destroyed, it is being lost. And it is being lost by our own hands,"" el-Sisi said. ""We need a revolution of the self, a revolution of consciousness and ethics to rebuild the Egyptian person -- a person that our country will need in the near future,"" the President said. El-Sisi, himself a pious man, was elected in May after leaving the military to run for the office. A former defense minister, he led the ouster of Mohamed Morsy -- the Islamist who was Egypt's first democratically elected President -- and has long positioned himself as a more secular option, and defender against extremist views. ""It's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world.  Impossible that this thinking -- and I am not saying the religion -- I am saying this thinking,"" el-Sisi said. He continued: ""This is antagonizing the entire world. It's antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible!​"" While el-Sisi's speech included some powerful language, H.A. Hellyer, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and research associate at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said the President has made similar statements in the past. ""There is little to suggest (el-Sisi) is interested in some sort of Lutheran reformation of Islam. By all accounts, he's quite comfortable with the prevailing leadership of the Azhari establishment. ""If anything, he wants to empower it further in order to push forward a counternarrative against radical Islamism. The real question is: How credible can such a state-empowered counternarrative be?"" Hellyer said. On Tuesday, the President visited the main Coptic cathedral in Cairo to attend a Christmas mass and make a short speech. He is the first president to attend such a mass since the revolution. ""We will build our country together. We will accommodate each other. We will love each other,"" el-Sisi said in that speech.","President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi speaks to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Muḥammad .

"Mangled limbs wrapped in blood-stained rags were strewn across rooms in the school. Run by the United Nations, the building was meant to be a refuge for more than 3,000 civilians fleeing the deadly conflict raging between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. But shells hit it in the early morning hours as those inside slept, punching huge holes in the roof and killing at least 20 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. ""We saw the shells when they hit and shrapnel was falling like rain,"" said Sanaa abu Gerard, a woman who witnessed the blasts. ""I was so scared and the school filled with smoke. We poured water in our eyes just to see."" The deadly strike Wednesday underscores growing concerns that in Gaza, where fighting is taking place in densely populated areas, safe havens appear to be anything but safe. It's the sixth time a facility run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has been struck in the current conflict, intensifying questions about the tactics being used by both sides in areas crowded with civilians. ""People who go to these places expect that they go there because they will be safe,"" said Pierre Krahenbuhl, the commissioner-general for UNRWA. ""And here is the confirmation that it appears that there is nowhere where you can be safe."" 'Such horror' The United Nations said it thinks the rounds that hit the school, in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, were fired by Israeli artillery. The Israeli military said it is reviewing what happened, acknowledging that it exchanged fire with militants in the area. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack. ""Nothing -- nothing -- justifies such horror,"" he said. The U.N. Security Council was expected to hold an urgent meeting Thursday morning over the attack on the shelter. Amnesty International called for an independent investigation into what it described as ""a possible war crime."" The coordinates of the school had been repeatedly communicated to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) -- as recently as 8 hours before it was hit -- the U.N. said. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, said that the Israelis were aware of the people sheltering at the U.N. building and that ""they were in no way or form a target."" ""We haven't ruled out that it was a Hamas mortar that landed in the premises,"" he said. But the United Nations pointed the finger at Israel. ""Based on initial elements we have clear indications in the first assessment that three projectiles hit the school, and on analyzing the shrapnel we believe we have all the elements in place to conclude it was Israeli artillery fire,"" Krahenbuhl said. Schools hit before . The deaths in the Jabalya school are far from the first time UNRWA facilities have been dragged into the current conflict, which has killed more than 1,300 people in Gaza, most of them civilians. The organization, which has been helping Palestinian refugees in the region for more than 60 years, says it's currently sheltering around 220,000 people in increasingly cramped conditions in its buildings. That's 12% of Gaza's population of 1.8 million. Civilians in Gaza have had to flee their homes amid the fighting and airstrikes -- but many of them say they feel they have nowhere to go in the small, impoverished territory. The U.N. facilities have been one of the few places available to seek refuge. Sixteen people were killed last week at a different U.N. shelter in northern Gaza. The Israeli military admitted misfiring a mortar into the courtyard of that school during clashes with militants, but it said the explosion couldn't have caused deaths because the courtyard was empty. A CNN team that visited the shelter several hours after the mortar attack saw evidence that people were badly wounded at the courtyard. UNRWA said seven of its staff members have been killed since July 7, the day before Israel began its operation against Hamas. U.N. schools were also hit during Israel's previous incursion into Gaza in 2009 -- in one instance, Israeli shells killed more than 40 civilians in the area of one school. Israel said at the time that Hamas was firing from the school grounds, an assertion that the U.N. disputed. Rockets stored in empty schools . The U.N. has also accused Hamas of violating the rules of war by storing rockets in three other schools in Gaza during the current conflict. The U.N. said it had abandoned the schools concerned because of the intensity of the fighting nearby. No weapons have been found in U.N. schools that have been sheltering people or that have been under the control of the U.N., according to John Ging, operational director of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The shelling of the Jabalya school has intensified criticism suggesting Israel isn't doing enough to avoid civilian casualties in its operation aimed at stopping Hamas rocket fire and taking out the militant group's underground tunnel system. ""If the strike on this school was the result of Israeli artillery fire it would constitute an indiscriminate attack and a likely war crime,"" said Philip Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Amnesty International. ""Artillery should never be used against targets in crowded civilian areas and its use in such a manner would never be considered a 'surgical' strike."" Amnesty also called on Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups ""not to endanger civilians by storing ammunition in UN facilities and other civilian buildings."" 'Safe zones not combat zones' Lerner of the IDF accused Hamas of exploiting civilians and humanitarian organizations. ""They are hiding behind the U.N. emblems, they are hiding behind the Red Cross ambulances and utilizing anything they can,"" he said. ""We on the other hand are warning the civilians ... We are trying to limit the impact."" But Israel is coming under increasing pressure to improve its efforts. While reiterating Israel has a right to defend itself, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said, ""We've also been very clear that Israel needs to do more to live up to its own standards to limit civilian casualties."" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf backed up the call. ""Hamas is taking steps here that put civilians at risk. But we do believe the Israelis need to do more,"" she said. The U.N.'s Ban put it more simply. ""United Nations shelters must be safe zones not combat zones,"" he said.","The U.N. says it thinks Israeli artillery was behind deadly strike on school .

"(CNN)U.S. helicopter gunships supported Iraqi ground forces battling ISIS militants in al-Baghdadi, military sources said, an action that brings U.S. troops closer to combat. On Saturday, the U.S. military said al-Baghdadi was ""contested,"" as Iraqi forces fought back. The U.S. military Friday deployed attack helicopters against an ISIS assault on the strategic Ayn al-Assad Air Base about 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of al-Baghdadi, sources said. Iraqi ground forces killed those attackers and the Apaches safely returned to base without firing a shot, the source said. Robert Baer, a former CIA officer, said the battles may indicate a deepening involvement of U.S. troops in the fight against ISIS. ""I think what we're seeing here is mission creep,"" he said. ""The Iraqi army is not up to the task. And without the United States Air Force and the military on the ground, a lot of these ... bases would be overrun."" Mark Hertling, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, said he thought the Iraqi army was improving. ""I think the Iraqi government is getting it back together and, yes, they do need help from coalition forces, U.S. forces right now,"" he said. ""But they're coming around and they realize what a scourge this organization [ISIS] is."" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby described the battle at the air base, saying, ""It looks like they at least got to the outer base limits. We're still looking at this and it's hard to say whether they breached the perimeter or not. But they certainly got to the perimeter level at the very least."" He said 20-25 people led by suicide bombers made the attack. Most, if not all, of the attackers were wearing Iraqi military uniforms, Kirby said. The base is huge -- roughly the size of Boulder, Colorado, Kirby said. That city is nearly 25 square miles. And U.S. forces were ""several kilometers"" away from where the fighting happened, the Pentagon said in a statement. Ayn al-Assad, the largest military base in western Anbar province still under government control, is where U.S. instructors train Iraqi pilots. Nearly 800 members of Iraqi security forces are training with coalition forces at the air base, the U.S. Central Command said. And while military officials say the U.S. forces were not directly threatened in the skirmish, Kirby acknowledged that ""no question that they're close to danger."" The U.S. team there -- some 400 strong -- doesn't feel immediately threatened, but do have the ""right, responsibility, obligation to shoot back"" should militants threaten them, Kirby said. U.S. officials have repeatedly downplayed the possibility of renewed ground combat in Iraq after the expensive and divisive U.S. combat operation that drew to a close with the final withdrawal of troops in 2011. But U.S. and coalition airstrikes do continue in the area. From Thursday into Friday, aircraft from the international coalition against ISIS carried out eight airstrikes in Syria and seven in Iraq, CENTCOM said. Five of the Iraq airstrikes targeted ISIS units and equipment near Ayn al-Assad. The other two attacked targets near Mosul and Sinjar. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the airstrikes killed at least 20 ISIS militants. One civilian died. CNN's Phil Black, said that Kurdish Peshmerga fighters were starting to move from the north toward the city of Sinjar, held by ISIS since the summer. The militants' seizure of the city provoked a major humanitarian crisis as its ethnic minority Yazidi population fled onto the rocky slopes of Mount Sinjar, where many became trapped without food and water. The Kurdish fighters are on the offensive but face a long, difficult battle to win back the city from ISIS, whose fighters are firmly in control there. On Thursday, ISIS attacked Peshmerga fighters in Sinjar, as well as Kurdish forces positioned north of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and the town of Ba'shiqa, east of Mosul. As fighting on the ground continued, ISIS pressed forward with its propaganda campaign. The organization released photos purporting to show ISIS attacks on security checkpoints near Ramadi and posted video purporting to show them parading captured Peshmerga fighters through the streets in cages. ISIS claims the video was shot in the Kirkuk province of Iraq. ISIS offered up video showing them fixing roads in the al Nibai area, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) north of Baghdad. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the images. CNN's Jim Sciutto, Jamie Crawford, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Hamdi Alkhshali and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","U.S. helicopter gunships support Iraqi troops battling ISIS, military sources say .

"(CNN)In Portugal and in particular for supporters of Benfica football club, the name of Eusebio da Silva Ferreira is synonymous with greatness. Even though my generation never actually saw him play, we were able to access plenty of archive footage in which he showcased his skill on the pitch. But the real insight came from generations before me, like my parents or grandparents. Through them, I was able to learn about the man and athlete known to the world as ""A Pantera Negra"" (The Black Panther). Those stories still resonate till this day almost like fairy tales. The young kid who ended up traveling almost 5,000 miles to pursue his passion for soccer and ended up with a lot more than he bargained for. The teen striker moved to Portugal at the age of 18, after a former Brazilian footballer working at the time as a scout, told Benfica's manager Béla Guttmann about his promising talents. Since joining the team in 1960 up until 1975, Eusebio won 11 league titles, one European Cup, five Portuguese cups, among several other team and individual records. People would say he was the best player to ever grace Portugal with his talent. That the way he exploded on the pitch with his fast pace combined with the power of his right foot was a joy to watch. Adding his phenomenal stats with 733 goals, including 41 for country, it then became obvious we were talking about one of the greats. It didn't take me long to understand what people meant every time they spoke about him. A few YouTube clips could easily testify to this and go as far as to reveal that such attributes would still make him a star, even in today's game. His success on the pitch, however, took on massive proportions, as it was not a mere sporting achievement. It was proof that Portugal was able to produce great talent and conquer new and different horizons. It gave people hope, happiness and some comfort, which was all much needed at the time. During the period when Eusebio burst onto the scene, Portugal was going through a rough stage under the decades-long dictatorship of Antonio Salazar. Only what was known as the ""three F's:"" Fado, Football and Fatima (the Virgin Mary) would cheer the masses. So the level of success that Portugal enjoyed under the leadership of Eusebio was crucial as a distraction that kept the population together. It is therefore no surprise that many people from all over the country admired Eusebio, regardless of the club they supported. As years went by and my passion for the game of soccer grew stronger, the ""King's"" (his other nickname) life and career became even more appealing to me. I can't deny that a big part of it has to do with my allegiance to Benfica, the club for which the Mozambique-born Portuguese footballer played 15 out of his 22 years as a professional athlete. It was obvious that this love affair would continue after his career ended. After retiring, he was offered a role as an ambassador, which he played until his last breath. Equally, he also acted worldwide as a spokesperson for the game. The part seemed fitting for a man of his skills. More than just making use of his legendary status, as a man he was known for being a humble, kind and tremendously charismatic, making him very popular across the country as well as beyond our own borders. It is then no surprise that, on January 5th, the world reacted with shock to the news of his passing at the age of 71. Soon after, I was called by CNN to travel to Lisbon in order to cover the story. I remember having mixed feelings at the time. On one hand I was saddened by the news, but on the other hand I felt incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to cover the story by attending his funeral from a journalistic standpoint. This had a very special meaning, as it allowed me to also pay my respects as a long-time admirer. I was able to witness how his death brought the country closer together. It was beautiful to see the amount of people that followed the coffin or showed up at the church. The crowds assembling close to his statue at the Stadium of Light, statue which by the way was covered from head to toe with flowers and scarves from various Portuguese clubs, as a sign of admiration. You could say that on that day, even the biggest soccer fanatic was colour-blind. There was no Benfica, Sporting or Porto -- there was only a unified country! At a time when Portugal is facing a long, hard financial depression -- which has not only affected our country's economy, but also our spirits -- it was remarkable to see that, even if just for a few days, fans -- including longtime rivals -- were paying homage to a man they've learned to respect and admire for his talent and flair, but also for his personality. His name is still very much present in the culture of not only the club, but the country. Being such a timeless character, I can only wait for the time where I tell my kids the same stories I was told growing up. It is an ongoing way of celebrating his life.

"(CNN)New York City has gone 11 days without a homicide, its longest stretch without any on modern record, the New York Police Department said Friday. The record was broken midnight Thursday. It was the 11th full day without a reported homicide. The last reported homicide was February 1, or Super Bowl Sunday, in Upper Manhattan, a police representative said Friday. Police then responded to a 911 call about multiple shots being fired and found five individuals with gunshot wounds, New York police said. One of those five, Graham Shadale, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene.

"(CNN)A deal aimed at imposing a ceasefire in Ukraine from this Sunday was concluded following talks between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. Yet despite 17 hours of talks in the Belarus capital of Minsk, during which President Vladimir Putin was seen breaking pencils on his desk in frustration, some of the agreement's most important provisions have yet to be clarified. And although German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande proclaimed themselves satisfied with the deal, both should know the chances of a durable settlement remain slim. Were the bloodshed to resume -- or, as is more likely, never stop -- what happens inside Ukraine largely depends on Putin; barring direct Western military involvement which remains unthinkable, the Russian leader maintains what strategy experts call ""escalation dominance,"" namely the ability to decide how much or little he wants to apply pressure, in the re knowledge that, even if Moscow miscalculates, Russia will not pay a heavy price. All the indications are that, when he ordered his crack forces into Ukraine a year ago, Putin had no clear idea of Russia's ""end game."" Still, wars create their own strategic logic and appetite grows with eating. So when Putin discovered the seizure of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula was swift and painless, he expanded his country's objectives by supporting ethnic Russian separatists in the rest of Ukraine. Until recently, the assessment of Western intelligence was that Putin's strategy was to support anti-government rebels in Ukraine as a bargaining chip to draw Ukraine away from its West-leaning aspirations, and lure it back into Russian influence. However, the latest Russian offensives indicate new objectives: Moscow's troops are consolidating the separatist rebel enclaves into one larger unit under Russian control, most likely as a prelude to Ukraine's permanent territorial division. The aim may no longer be to draw Ukraine into Moscow's orbit, but to destroy the nation, and condemn the remaining western rump of the country to the status of a failed state. There are other reasons why Putin may be in a rush to consolidate the Russian-held enclaves into one coherent entity. For without this happening, any long-term ceasefire will still leave the enclaves vulnerable to a sudden attack from Ukrainian government forces. Furthermore, the Russian enclaves as currently constituted are not economically viable; consolidating them alongside Russia's own borders will make it cheaper for Russia to subsidize the region, which is what Moscow will now have to do. And, finally, the extension of the Russian enclaves offers the advantage of eventually providing Moscow with territorial continuity between Russia itself and the Crimea peninsula which Putin has already legally incorporated into his country; at the moment, the peninsula -- which otherwise does not enjoy a land link with Russia -- has to be supplied by an expensive and vulnerable ferry connection. In short the logic of Russian political and economic calculations appears to coincide into virtually guaranteeing a deep push into Ukraine, and a spike in the number of casualties and displaced persons. Any resumption of the fighting on a scale that now looks likely will make it inevitable that Western governments will start supplying weapons to the Ukrainian military. But if Ukraine's firepower increases, the argument in many Western capitals goes, that will increase the price Russia has to pay in terms of personnel and equipment, and thereby persuade Putin to stop this adventure. It is a risky game with long-term consequences for the European continent. The reality is that Ukraine's military does not need Western-made military equipment; it operates Russian or Soviet-made one. So the chances are high that, once Western governments -- and especially the U.S. one -- decide to supply Ukraine with lethal military equipment, the supplies will come from the stocks of Soviet-made weapons which are in Poland and Romania, eastern Europe's biggest nations. Both border Ukraine, which makes the delivery of such weapons easy and unobtrusive, something U.S. President Barack Obama may prefer, in order not to foreclose any opportunity for a future diplomatic dialogue with Moscow. Although details of such planning are being kept under wraps, Polish Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak has already acknowledged the possibility that his country's military stocks may be used for this purpose. The outcome is almost exactly the same as what happened during the Yugoslavia civil wars of the 1990s, when the U.S. surreptitiously supplied the Croats and Bosnian Muslims in the Balkans with weapons to defeat the Serbs. That tactic worked at that time. But the snag is that Russia is not Serbia: Putin has staked too much on his Ukrainian adventure to accept anything which smacks of defeat. The result is, therefore, that Ukraine will settle down to a prolonged proxy conflict, in which the possession of every village or road will be closely contested, a bloody confrontation in which most European governments get involved, but none accept responsibility. And, as is often the case in such situations, the longer the conflict goes on, the less chances anyone has in controlling its protagonists. Russia is already finding it increasingly difficult to control ethnic Russian rebels in Ukraine, and that difficulty will only increase as times goes by. A large influx of weapons into Ukraine will also mean an expansion in the already considerable domestic black market for such weapons and a further boost for a variety of right-wing Ukrainian militias, many of which are already fighting alongside Ukrainian regular soldiers. Russia's allegation that Ukraine is under the control of ""fascists"" is nonsense but, if Ukraine seeks deeper into violence, extremists will increasingly come to the fore. It is this sort of ghastly, ghoulish fate which the deal that France and Germany brokered is designed to avoid. But the chances are that what was agreed is simply too little and too late to postpone a looming Ukrainian nightmare.","Despite a deal struck over Ukraine, the chances of a durable settlement remain slim, says Jonathan Eyal .

"Nasdaq suffered its second high-profile embarrassment in six months when it was forced to cancel trades in Kraft Foods after a trading glitch caused the company's shares to soar nearly 30 per cent. The error marred the completion of the recently split group's switch to Nasdaq and evoked memories of the exchange's botched handling of the Facebook flotation in May. The trading error and cancellation came a day after US regulators met to address concerns about the impact of technology on market stability. Weeks after Nasdaq's bungled handling of Facebook's public offering, a software error at Knight Capital caused the electronic trading and brokerage company to suffer a $440m loss, sending it to the brink of bankruptcy. Kraft shares, which together with Mondelez, the global snacks group created in the split, switched their listing from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq, surged as much as 28.9 per cent to $58.54 in the first minute of trading seconds after Irene Rosenfeld, the company's former chief executive, rang the market's opening bell. Within an hour, Nasdaq and other stock exchanges conducted a review of the processed trades, deemed them erroneous and cancelled them. Initial investigations suggested the erroneous trades were the result of a faulty trading algorithm. The episode highlights concerns among some market participants that the speed of transactions, driven by technical advances, often leaves the market susceptible to potentially hazardous errors. ""That's the problem with our market structure today, there is no room for any type of error,"" said Sal Arnuk, co-head of Themis Trading and a critic of high-frequency trading. ""These electronic trading systems and the HFT market-makers are set up to inflict the maximum amount of pain on any mistake."" Kraft's shares quickly retreated after the trades were cancelled and closed down 1.2 per cent to $44.87. ""Participants should review their trading activity for potentially erroneous trades and request adjudication through the 'Clearly Erroneous' process within the applicable timeframe for filing pursuant to the rule,"" Nasdaq said in a statement. Kraft said the company was looking into the situation but declined to comment further. ""Trading in Kraft was affected by a broker error that impacted multiple stock exchanges,"" Nasdaq said. ""Nasdaq's systems performed normally and the industry's process for handling these issues worked as intended."" The exchange declined to name the company where the trading error originated. Eric Hunsader, chief executive of Nanex, a market data company, said the problem appeared to be an algorithm that was trying to buy 30,000 shares in Kraft but did not want to skew the market by buying them all at once. ""The trades were spread out by milliseconds and look to have executed at 11 different trading venues,"" Mr Hunsader said. Ms Rosenfeld decided last year to separate Kraft into a US grocery business, which would maintain its name, and an international snacks business to be called Mondelez, which she would lead. Kraft said last June that both companies would be listed on the Nasdaq, dealing a blow to the NYSE. The move surprised some after glitches occurred during the opening minutes of trading for Facebook but Kraft said it was confident in Nasdaq and that it had been drawn to the exchange's liquidity and cost effectiveness.","Nasdaq suffered its second high-profile embarrassment in six months .

"If the crowds under Paris' Eiffel Tower get you down, try Shenzhen in China. It may not have the history of the French construction, but at least the coffee will be cheaper. Or you could head to Berlin. Or to Las Vegas. Or several other locales with their own ""Eiffel Towers."" The replication of tourist attractions has been gaining traction in recent years. Most recently, a Spanish company has been employed to replicate Egypt's ancient pharaonic tombs. Opening to the public later this month about half a mile from the original tomb in Luxor's Valley of the Kings, the replica will be located outside the house of Howard Carter, the expedition leader who disinterred the pharaoh almost a century ago. The reconstruction is a response to the threat posed by the hundreds of thousands of tourists traipsing through the real relic every year. Changes in temperature and humidity caused by their presence in the burial chamber have caused the striking plaster-painted murals on the walls to begin crumbling away. Tut's new tomb . The solution was for the Madrid-based company Factum Arte to create replicas of King Tut's and the other pharaonic tombs, including Seti I and Nefertari, as a philanthropic exercise granted permission by Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities in 2009. The firm used minutely detailed, hi-tech techniques honed on reproductions over the past decade, including copies of the pharaoh Thutmose III's tomb in 2003 and, more recently, of Leonardo's painting ""The Last Supper"" and Caravaggio's ""Inspiration of St. Matthew."" The replication of King Tut's and the other royal tombs represents the company's most ambitious project to date, as well as being the most detailed large-scale facsimile project ever undertaken, Factum Arte says. More: World's most beautiful bank buildings . Special 3D scanning systems were developed for the job, allowing the burial chamber to be measured at 100 million points every square meter. The resulting 3D relief of the tomb was then reproduced on casts that were finished by hand. ""Is it exactly the same as viewing the real tomb? No. But what you can do is exceedingly high,"" Adam Lowe, Factum Arte's director, told CNN. ""You can 'rematerialize' the quality of the original at a normal viewing distance, so the experience is visually identical to standing in the tomb. ""It's not an exercise in faking but [partly about] revealing the condition of the original to allow it to be monitored."" It's estimated that 500,000 visitors a year will visit the replica relics, the resulting funds going in part towards preserving Egypt's real heritage sites. Cool copy cats . Copying an ancient monument has an obvious appeal. You get to keep the original version, as well as all the tourists -- and their revenue -- threatening to destroy it. That same motivation lay behind making giant copies of the Altamira and Lascaux Caves in Spain and France, respectively, when exposure to the elements, and awestruck visitors' breath, threatened to turn the vast galleries of prehistoric paintings they contain into mold. The motive for replicating other tourist attractions around the world, however, seems less concerned with their heritage value. If you think the Eiffel Tower is intimately associated with Paris, for example, you may be surprised to find more or less life-size versions of it in Las Vegas, Berlin, India, China (two, actually -- in Hangzhou and Shenzhen) and Fez, Morocco. More: 14 great literary hotels . The Taj Mahal, one of India's great tourist sights, is no longer one of just India's great tourist sights. A full-sized replica of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's monument to his beloved third wife has sat outside the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, since 2008. India has taken revenge, of a sort -- it's planning an Angkor Wat for the banks of the Ganges. Michelangelo's ""Davids"" When it comes to art, anatomically accurate copies of Michelangelo's ""David"" expose themselves everywhere from the Philippines to the U.S. state of Kentucky and Montevideo, Uruguay. In China, the Xerox of replicating countries, you can even take home your own fairly convincing Mona Lisa or Van Gogh from the Dafen oil painting village, a neighborhood of Shenzhen famed for its fakes. China, moreover, has recreated entire foreign locales with tourist appeal, such as London Thames Town, in Shanghai, and Hallstatt, an ""Austrian"" mountain village in that famous yodeling province of Guangdong. What, you can only ask, is next -- a Chinese Belgium or New Zealand? And would anybody go? Facsimile tourism -- as good as the real thing?

"Rejoice, single travelers. Traveling alone during the Christmas holidays can be less gloomy -- provided you take the advice of Keisuke Jinushi. Earlier this year, Keisuke, a 28-year-old freelance Japanese photographer and writer, gained Internet fame with a set of curious Instagram photos capturing him in various settings with his ""girlfriend."" The images depicted a young lady feeding Keisuke and even lovingly wiping ketchup from his face. The twist? ""She"" was actually Keisuke. All the photos were single-handedly shot by the unattached Keisuke, with no girlfriend or anyone else involved. How -- and why -- he did it . Keisuke started blogging about how to create fake couples photos two years ago. He calls the practice the ""hitori date"" or ""one-man date."" In an early post he wrote: ""Photos (one takes) while traveling alone may make one feel lonely and sad when you look at them. So I recommend the 'hitori date photo' technique. Looking at these photos makes me feel blissful."" Anxious to uncover the secrets of his bizarre success, CNN tracked down Keisuke. In the process, we found an engaging spirit who may just be the most amusing and honest blogger in Japan. CNN: Where did the idea for the ""one-man date"" photos come from? Keisuke Jinushi: Sometimes I go to cafes on my own, just to kill time. When I look around, I see couples spoon-feeding each other. I then have a strong feeling -- I want this too! In order to have that, I needed a girlfriend, but I didn't have one. I was distressed. The platform (Daily Portal) where I started my blog gathers lots of writers who write on their interests.

"Mohamed Morsi was sworn in Saturday as Egypt's first democratically-elected president, taking the helm of a deeply divided nation that is economically strapped and lacks a working government. The historic ceremony took place amid tight security before the Supreme Constitutional Court and was overseen by Egypt's military rulers who have been in control of the country since Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year during a popular revolution. ""Today, the Egyptian people established a new life for complete freedom, for a true democracy,"" Morsi said after taking the oath. ""I swear by almighty God that I will uphold the republican system and respect the constitution of the law and look after the interests of the people,"" he said. Shortly after the swearing-in, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he gave his first speech as president. He praised the country's military, but indicated that their control of Egypt's legislative powers would return to civilian hands. ""The (Supreme Council of the Armed Forces) adhered to its pledge to not go beyond of the will of the people. And the elected institutions will come back to take their role, and the great Egyptian army will to go their job to protect the boundaries and security of the country,"" he said, delineating the army's role. SCAF, which assumed legislative powers after they dissolved parliament after a court ruling, continues to wield that power even after Morsi's swearing-in. It will retain those powers until a new parliament is sworn in near the end of the year. ""We have fulfilled our obligations and the pledge that we took before God and the people. We now have a president who was elected in free elections. Egypt is witnessing a new democratic process,"" the head of the SCAF,  Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, said at a military ceremony for Morsi Saturday. It is time to put the past behind us and learn from its lessons, he said, before presenting the president with a shield of the army. ""I accept the transfer of power from Field Marshal Tantawi,"" Morsi said. Egyptians, all Arabs, and the world were witnessing ""how authority is transferred from the armed forces to the will of the people to the elected civilian authority,"" Morsi said. The president also addressed the crisis in Syria. He signaled that Egypt would play a role in resolving that conflict. ""The bloodbath in Syria must be stopped,"" he said. ""We'll spare no effort in the immediate future to work toward this goal."" Morsi's theme in his recent appearances has been one of respect for democracy and the people. ""Today we start a new chapter in the history of Egypt. We turn an old page of an ugly era,"" he said. He added, """"I will not betray my country. With the will of God I will fulfill your ambitions."" Egypt's electoral commission declared Morsi the president-elect Sunday after a runoff with Ahmed Shafik, a former air force general who served as Mubarak's last prime minister. Morsi had been the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, but he resigned from the party shortly after he was elected president. Just days before the election, a high court ruled that Egypt's parliament was unconstitutional. Some of Morsi's supporters are pushing for a confrontation with the generals, who dissolved the parliament after the ruling. Additionally, the military rulers named a defense council to oversee national security and foreign policies while also declaring it would maintain control of all military affairs. World leaders, meanwhile, will likely be watching what Morsi does next. During the speech Friday, he said he would work to free the blind Egyptian cleric serving a life sentence in the United States for a conspiracy conviction related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He said he wanted to work to free political prisoners, which he said included Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman. ""Their rights will be on my shoulders and I won't spare effort"" to free them, he said. Morsi is a study in contrasts: a strict Islamist educated in Southern California who vowed during his campaign to stand for women's rights yet argued for banning them from the presidency. During the historic campaign, Morsi said he would support democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won. But he has also called Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers."" Morsi focused his campaign on appealing to the broadest possible audience after a slogan  associated with his campaign, ""Islam is the solution,"" sparked concerns that he could introduce a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy. During the campaign, he said he had no such plans. His party seeks ""an executive branch that represents the people's true will and implements their public interests,"" Morsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Asked whether he would maintain Egypt's 1979 accord with Israel, Morsi said, ""Yes, of course I will. I will respect it provided the other side keep it up and respect it.""","Military council says it is time to leave the past behind and learn lessons from it .

He said the incident took place more than two weeks ago, after several rebels and government troops were killed in a battle in western Homs. Al Sayed said when he saw the video, he told his friend to take it off the Internet because the act was so perverse. ""This was an isolated incident. (His) actions do not represent the FSA. His actions only represent himself,"" al Sayed said. ""This is not just a normal person who sits home. He has had two brothers killed.

Homs came under weeks of relentless attacks by government forces, including indiscriminate shelling on civilian areas. But the government has repeatedly denied attacking civilians, saying Syrian forces were targeting armed gangs and foreign terrorists bent on destabilizing the government. Regardless of the horrors suffered in Homs, the atrocious act in the video is inexcusable, Human Rights Watch said.

"(CNN)They might be over 65, but these former burlesque dancers haven't lost the charisma that made them so desirable in their heyday. Whether it's a seductive, sensual pose or something more fun and playful, it's clear they aren't afraid to be bold in front of the camera. ""I really enjoyed being around those women,"" said photographer Marie Baronnet, who documented them in her book ""Legends: The Living Art of Risque."" ""I found that they had a real knowledge of life but also of this work. They were very self-sufficient."" All of the women featured in Baronnet's book used to dance in burlesque theaters, enticing the audience with a strip show. But burlesque is about more than just skin. ""Burlesque is interesting because it's a space where women of all kinds, physically speaking, can actually go onstage,"" Baronnet said. ""They have to have personality and rhythm, they have to know how to dance, and they have to also be an artist because they have to do all those costumes and create a choreography."" Burlesque was also empowering for many of the women, especially Americans who performed before the sexual revolution of the 1960s. ""Striptease for them was a passport to discover their own country and to travel abroad. ... They would have agents, they would get contracts,"" Baronnet said. Over time, however, burlesque theaters lost their popularity in the United States as strip clubs became more prominent. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""The '80s were really the era where all the glamour kind of disappeared and what the audience wanted was more flesh always,"" Baronnet said. ""All of those women always described in the interview how it was difficult to transition between the '70s and the '80s, where the glamour was no longer there and the bosses of the clubs were asking them to get rid of the costumes and actually show more."" ""And those women arrived at an age where they were 40, 45 sometimes 50 years old. They were still very beautiful, but it was also an age issue where they saw that maybe they should stop and start to do something else. Also, the money was not the same. They used to make a lot of money, and suddenly it wasn't that good."" Baronnet became interested in burlesque during a trip to Las Vegas in 2011, where she met legendary dancer Dixie Evans. She later photographed an annual burlesque festival in the city. Through the contacts she made there, she reached out to former burlesque dancers across the country and asked if she could come to their homes and photograph them. ""The idea was to go to them and not to do something in a neutral place, because I wanted to feel the atmosphere of where they live,"" Baronnet said. All of the women in the book are at least 65 years old, and some are even in their 90s. ""We would put on the costumes and makeup, we'd do the hair and the lights, and then suddenly they would just know how to move,"" Baronnet said. ""And they like that. I think there is a part of them where they are very exhibitionist. They like to show off and just dance and move and seduce men."" The poses were a collaborative effort, but Baronnet had a certain vision, too. ""I didn't want to do something that was too close (to what) they were used to doing for so many years -- and that men photographers especially ask -- which is to be like a pinup like the typical Bettie Page picture,"" Baronnet said. ""Sometimes they would give that, and I would always kind of like twist it and say, 'Let's try something else, because this has been seen over and over again.' "" Although burlesque isn't dead -- it's even enjoying a bit of a renaissance today -- these women represent a bygone era, and Baronnet gives them the spotlight one more time. ""They witnessed a time that completely disappeared, and they mastered the art of striptease in a very special way, and they never really were recognized for that,"" she said. Marie Baronnet is a French photographer based in Los Angeles. Her book ""Legends: The Living Art of Risque"" can be purchased through Idea Books.

"Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy signed a decree putting into effect his country's newly approved constitution, the state-run Egynews reported Wednesday. His signature came after Egyptian voters approved the Islamist-backed constitution by what an election official said Tuesday was a nearly 2 to 1 ratio. Read more: Egyptians approve new constitution, unofficial results show . During the two rounds of voting, more than 10 million, or 63.8%, voted in favor, and more than 6 million, or 36.2%, voted against, Judge Samr Abou El Maaty, head of the High Election Commission, told reporters. The referendum passed with 56.6% of the vote in the first round on December 15, when more liberal provinces voted. In the second round of voting, on December 22, people cast ballots in 17 provinces largely loyal to Morsy and his ruling party -- which backed the constitution. There was a 32.9% turnout, El Maaty said. Nearly 303,400 votes were excluded because of voting irregularities. Controversy among Egypt's society and institutions had accompanied the draft constitution since its inception. Read more: Egypt's VP resigns amid vote over draft constitution . Critics said it was passed too quickly. Liberals, Christians and other minority opposition groups said they felt excluded from the Constituent Assembly that drafted it and that the wording did not include their voices. They had sought a new assembly. Opposition members said the charter uses vague language and will not protect the rights Egyptians fought for in last year's revolution, which ousted former President Hosni Mubarak. Supporters of the constitution herald what they say is its protection of personal rights, especially its provisions on the handling of detainees in the judicial system, which made capricious use of its powers under the former government. The international rights group Human Rights Watch said the constitution ""protects some rights but undermines others."" It ""fails to end military trials of civilians or to protect freedom of expression and religion."" Read more: Protests turn violent in Egypt ahead of vote on constitution . The rocky road to the referendum began when judges threatened to shut the assembly tasked with drafting the constitution. Morsy issued an edict in late November declaring his decisions immune from judicial review until the holding of the constitutional referendum. He also sacked the head of the judiciary, many of whose members had remained loyal to Mubarak. The Islamist president's opposition saw the moves as a grab for dictatorial powers and poured into the streets, converting Tahrir Square in central Cairo back into the center of public discontent it had been during the uprising that brought down Mubarak. In response, Morsy dropped his decree, but the situation remained tense. Violence raged, producing incidents that have raised the ire of international human rights groups, though these were not systematic, as was the case under the former government. Read more: Morsy supporters accused of beating, detaining opponents . The outcome of the election is important to the stability of volatile North Africa and the Middle East -- where Egypt is a key player. The U.S. State Department acknowledged divisions within Egypt and said there was a need for a broader consensus behind its new democratic rules.

"(CNN)I did not know Kayla Mueller, the American aid worker and ISIS hostage whose death was confirmed by her family this week. But like many people who read her letter to her family, I wish I had. And in some ways I feel I have. In my two decades working in the humanitarian field responding to conflict, I have met some incredibly brave individuals who poured themselves into the work they did to build up the societies in which they were working. But at the same time, I have watched our ability to enter into places of need begin to disappear. One by one I have seen cities I love crumble. Daily life becomes intolerable. But the most painful thing has been watching our physical space and mobile access to do humanitarian and conflict mitigation shrink. Long gone are the days when the Red Cross, a press badge or the U.N. flag were perceived as neutral. The targeting of aid workers is not new. And it is not limited to the Middle East or ISIS strongholds -- it first came to international attention in Somalia in the late 1990s, and became of true global note in the early 2000s in Iraq and Afghanistan as the blurred lines between civilian, military, aid workers, journalists, security actors and intelligence created a justification for extremist and terror groups to pursue anyone. In other words, we cannot find our way in. When we do, we are seen as one of the aggressors or potential spies. We are seen as a commodity to embarrass Western countries by exploiting the media to shape public opinion. We are, in short, targets. Despite growing attention over the problem, little has been done to change this reality. Instead, the response has been that the decades-long practice of civil society groups not having weapons on their premises or traveling in armored vehicles was reversed. More and more, civilian and military cooperation has been the only way to enter conflict zones, and security is now a necessary component to most organizations' budgets. I do not know an aid worker, a war reporter or a conflict mediator who has not lost a friend in the past decade. Mueller's death reminds many of us of those selfless individuals we've encountered who worked, and were killed, while carrying out their humanitarian missions. I often remember my dear friend Margaret Hassan, a woman I worked closely with in Baghdad in 2003, who was kidnapped and killed in 2004. When I remember Fern Holland and Salwa Oumashi, dear friends of mine who shared my passion for women's rights in the southern governorates of Iraq, I don't remember the gunmen that killed them. When I think of Fern and Salwa, I remember women who were so courageous that they took on the Sadrists to create women's centers in southern Iraq.  And I remember Marla Ruzicka, who traveled in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq to advocate for innocent victims of conflict. As I meet with the families of those who have been lost, I also experience a deep sadness, and survivor's guilt that I should have done more, too. When I spoke with Fern Holland's sister after she was brutally killed in Iraq, I was sure she would have anger in her heart and be seeking to have someone to blame. I could not have been further from the truth. Instead, she had lots of questions, all centered on wanting to support and know the women Fern believed so passionately in. Kayla Mueller lived my worst fear. Over and over, from Afghanistan to Iraq to Libya, my colleagues and I have agreed that death was far better than being kidnapped. We've even discussed how we might get cyanide pills. We were ready to sacrifice our lives. Yet it was unbearable to think of making a choice that would affect our loved ones. Those who work in conflict know very well what other people call us. Some call us emergency junkies. Some say we are ambulance chasers. Some say we have such meaningless lives, that we seek meaning through this work. We have savior complexes. Perhaps there is truth in these labels. But the one thing I have in common with all my friends who work in conflict areas is idealism. We believe in the power of one individual to make change. I did not know Kayla. I do not know her family. But I hope that her family is hearing the same message I shared with Fern Holland's sister. With the friends and family of Marla Ruzicka and Margaret Hassan. I hope they know beyond a shadow of a doubt she was loved by the people she served. That in addition to the entire global community, the vast majority of Palestinians and Syrians are mourning her death as one of their own. Most importantly, I hope the world knows none of those labels I mentioned describe her. She was not a naive idealist. She was part of a greater change and a rise in collective consciousness that will eventually lead to a global shift toward a better world. She will be remembered by those to which she fought to give a voice. She is an inspiration for many of us to continue our work -- to fight for access and demand for humanitarian space and conflict resolution. She is a true heroine.","American aid worker and ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller was reported killed .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Despite huge advances, China's military suffers from ""serious weaknesses"" that could limit its ability ""to fight and win future wars,"" a congressional study released this week suggests. The 184-page report sponsored by the U.S. Congress-mandated U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and prepared by the Rand Corporation, says the People's Liberation Army has made rapid progress in a short time. However, weaknesses in its organizational structure  -- including corruption among its ranks -- and in its combat capabilities mean it faces serious challenges. ""These shortcomings could limit its ability to successfully conduct the information-centric, integrated joint operations Chinese military strategists see as required to fight and win future wars,"" the report said. Shortcomings in its combat capability include logistical weaknesses. In particular, the report says that China lacks the ""amphibious lift"" -- the ability to transport enough forces and military assets -- for an outright invasion of Taiwan. China's navy has not fully mastered anti-submarine warfare, the report said, adding that it is experiencing problems integrating complex modern weaponry with existing equipment. The report said it also lacks the necessary trained personnel to operate this weaponry. Its air force, meanwhile, is grappling with limited numbers of special-mission aircraft and a fleet that comprises multiple generations of planes. China's Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The 2.3-million-strong PLA is ""riddled"" with corruption, the report said, because of a major lack of external oversight --- the only civilian in the chain of command is President Xi Jinping. Xu Caihou, a top retired general, recently confessed to taking bribes and it's widely believed that promotions and positions can be bought. And among lower ranks, reports of officers selling military housing and using military plates to avoid speed limits, highway tolls and parking restrictions are widespread. The report also said that low pay, and a lack of realistic training exercises -- exercises are seen as failures if the PLA loses -- present further challenges, as do the skills of its recruits. Most are still drawn from rural areas with limited education although there is a push to recruit more college graduates. Moreover, China's ""one-child"" policy, which has created the ""little emperor"" phenomenon of spoiled children produces recruits who ""may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline,"" the report added. But the PLA is well aware of its shortcomings, the report said, with military publications and Chinese sources suggesting that  ""there is still a large gap between China and developed countries' militaries, especially the United States."" The report concludes that U.S. military planners need to understand China's incomplete military transformation so they can ensure the U.S. and its allies can deter China from using force or the threat of force to resolve disputes with its neighbors.","Despite huge advances, China's military suffers from ""serious weaknesses""

"(CNN)Not too long ago, the question was what states would be among the first to allow same-sex marriages. But since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2013 ruling invalidating part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, same-sex marriage rights have surged forward nationwide. In some cases, such as in Illinois, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York, lawmakers opened the doors voluntarily. In others -- most recently Alabama -- it's been state or federal judges forcing the toehold long sought by gay rights advocates and bitterly contested by those who argue marriage is an institution reserved solely for one man and one woman. As the dominoes fall in favor of same-sex marriages, the question now seems to be which state will be the last to allow such unions? That's assuming, of course, that the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't get there first by this June, when it is expected to issue its ruling on such bans in four states this spring. Here's the situation in the 13 states that currently ban same-sex marriages, including eight in which court rulings in favor of allowing same-sex marriage are under review: . The state's constitutional ban on gay marriage, passed in 2004, was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a U.S. District Court judge. Local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision, but the state Supreme Court blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case. A decision could come soon. Georgia is one of just three states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same-sex marriage. The others are North Dakota and Nebraska. However, lawsuits are pending to overturn the state's 2004 ban. The state's ban is being challenged in state court, where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional, and in federal court, where a U.S. District Court judge took the rare step, for a federal judge, of backing such a ban. The ban remains in place pending Louisiana's appeal of the state court ruling. On the federal level, a ruling is pending out of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which heard arguments in the case in January. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the state's constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no ""legitimate purpose."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later overturned the ruling, reinstating gay marriage bans in Kentucky and four other states. The Kentucky ban is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case scheduled for arguments in April and a decision by June. A U.S. District Court judge ruled last year that the state's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, resulting in the issuance of more than 300 marriage licenses. That ended when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a stay. The court later reinstated Michigan's ban in the same ruling that reinstated Kentucky's ban. Its fate will be decided by the Supreme Court decision due by June. A state court judge ruled in November that Missouri's 2004 constitutional ban on gay marriage was illegal. Attorney General Chris Koster appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court. But that court has indicated that it will not rule on the case until after the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Just a few days after that state court ruling, a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state's marriage ban, but that decision has been stayed pending appeals. While the state ban is in effect, officials in the St. Louis area have issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples. A U.S. District Court judge granted an injunction last year against the state's same-sex marriage ban, describing it as unconstitutional. The judge, however, postponed his ruling from going into effect to give the state time to appeal. A federal appeals court heard arguments in the case in January. In the meantime, the same-sex marriage ban is still in effect. A decade ago, a federal court ruled than an amendment banning same-sex marriages was unconstitutional. But the decision was short-lived. An appeals court reinstated the ban. Rights groups have filed legal challenges. Same-sex couples are challenging the state's ban in U.S. District Court, but a federal judge issued a ruling on January 20 delaying the proceedings until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules. U.S. District Court Judge Karen Schreier struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban in January, but blocked enforcement pending an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The state's ban was struck down in January 2014 by a federal judge who said it serves ""no legitimate governmental purpose."" But, as in many other states, enforcement was delayed pending appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard the case last month and a ruling is pending. A federal appeals court judge upheld a ban last year on same-sex marriages in  the state. That decision is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case expected to be finalized this summer. In November 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the state's ban. That decision also will be part of the U.S. Supreme Court case.","Rulings in favor of allowing same-sex marriage are under review in eight of the 13 states .

"(CNN)Two Al Jazeera journalists  walked out of an Egyptian prison Friday after more than 400 days behind bars. A Cairo court granted bail to Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed pending a retrial on charges that they supported the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Their colleague Peter Greste, who was convicted with them, was freed about two weeks ago and deported to his native Australia. Fahmy, a dual citizen of Egypt and Canada, posted about U.S. $ 33,000 in bail. Mohamed, an Egyptian citizen, was not required to pay but is barred from leaving the country before the retrial on February 23. ""Baher is home and with his family,"" said his wife, Jihan Rashed. Their employer applauded the decision to grant them bail Thursday, but said it was not enough. ""Bail is a small step in the right direction, and allows Baher and Mohamed to spend time with their families after 411 days apart,"" Al Jazeera  said. ""The focus, though, is still on the court reaching the correct verdict at the next hearing by dismissing this absurd case and releasing both these fine journalists unconditionally."" The three were arrested in Egypt in December 2013, accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and broadcasting footage that portrayed the regime falsely with the intention of bringing it down. They have consistently denied the charges or any ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, saying they were only doing their jobs. Last year, all three were convicted on charges that included conspiring with the Brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to seven years in prison and Mohamed to 10 years. The three appealed their convictions. In January, Egypt's highest court granted them a retrial. Rights groups have held that they were pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the small Middle Eastern country that sponsors Al Jazeera. Many have seen Qatar as a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. At the time of their arrest, Egypt was mired in political turmoil after the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood-backed government. After his ouster, the military, which had staged the coup, declared the longstanding political group a terrorist organization. In a letter last year, Greste said authorities burst into a hotel room they were using while others rushed Mohamed's home. Egypt is the sixth-leading jailer of journalists in the world, according to a tally conducted in December by the nonpartisan Committee to Protect Journalists. Greste was released as part of a new Egyptian law allowing the President to deport defendants. Defense lawyers also asked Egypt to deport Fahmy, a former CNN producer. Fahmy said that an Egyptian official told him he would have to renounce his Egyptian citizenship first, which he had initially rejected. ""Then I got a call from a leading official in the country, and they told me: 'Mohamed, nationality is not a piece of paper, but it is in the heart,"" he said. ""And you can visit Egypt as a tourist and apply for the citizenship again.' "" Fahmy said he surrendered his citizenship reluctantly.","Their retrial resumes February 23 .

"(CNN)Darfur has a long, dark history filled with horrors. But these nightmares aren't all in the far past, according to Human Rights Watch. Citing 130 interviews with locals, the advocacy group said this week that in October, Sudanese soldiers raped more than 200 women and girls over a 36-hour period in the north Darfur town of Tabit. ""Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that during (the) attacks, government soldiers went house-to-house in Tabit, searching houses, looting property, severely beating residents, and raping women and girls,"" the report stated. ""On the two nights, soldiers forced many of the men to outdoor locations on the outskirts of the town, leaving the women and children especially vulnerable."" The advocacy group said that civilians were the only ones affected and that it had ""no evidence of any rebel force in the town immediately prior to or during the attacks."" The United Nations and African Union have a force in Darfur, but according to Human Rights Watch, the Sudanese government has ""prevented (them) from carrying out a credible investigation."" ""Immediately after they entered the room they said: 'You killed our man. We are going to show you true hell,' "" a woman in her 40s recalled of an attack on her and her three daughters, two of whom were less than 11 years old, Human Rights Watch reported. ""Then they started beating us. They raped my three daughters and me. Some of them were holding the girl down while another one was raping her. They did it one by one."" Yusuf Kurdufani, a Sudanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, dismissed the report as ""an attempt to reproduce an issue long closed after the world was convinced about the incredibility and illogicality of the claims of mass rape."" According to the official Sudanese News Agency, Kurdufani said mass rapes ""go contrary to the logic of things and also contradict ... the customs and traditions of the local population."" ""He argued that by making such allegations, the rebel movements wanted to create an impression that the situation was still unstable in the region,"" the SUNA report added. ""The spokesman reaffirmed that the allegations of mass rape in Tabit is a file that has been closed."" Yet not everyone in the international community buys Sudan's story, at least without a credible outside investigation. ""To this day, the government of Sudan has shamefully denied the UN the ability to properly investigate this incident, despite this (U.N. Security) Council's mandate to do precisely that,"" said Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The United Nations itself said two months ago that its team had found no evidence supporting the claims, though the ultimate findings are ""inconclusive and require further investigation."" Violence in Darfur -- an arid region in western Sudan -- began raging in the early 2000s, with then-U.N. envoy Tom Eric Vraalsen at one point calling the humanitarian crisis there ""one of the worst in the world."" The United Nations has estimated about 300,000 people have been killed and another 2.7 million wounded in the unrest. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is charged by the International Criminal Court with multiple counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. But al-Bashir hasn't agreed to stand trial, with his information minister at one point dismissing the ICC as a ""white man's tribunal."" There have been seemingly positive developments in the region in recent years, like South Sudan declaring independence after a peace agreement and subsequent referendum.  In Darfur in 2013, a splinter group from the Justice and Equality Movement -- the largest Darfurian rebel group -- signed a peace deal with the Sudanese government, and countries pledged $3.7 billion to reconstruct and develop the war-torn area. Yet the violence never really went away. In December, Under-Secretary-General for U.N. Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous briefed the Security Council about increased fighting, ""deadly"" internal conflicts and an alarming rise of crime in Darfur. ""This insecurity as well as the persistent restrictions imposed by government forces, armed movements and militia groups continued to challenge the ability of the (UN/AU) mission to implement its mandate, particularly as regards the protection of civilians,"" Ladsous said.","Human Rights Watch: Mass rapes occurred over a 36-hour period last October .

"(CNN)Embattled NBC News anchor Brian Williams may have some more explaining to do. On May 3, 2011, just two days after the daring U.S. Navy SEAL Team 6 raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, Williams said on his NBC News show, ""Now, people might be hearing about SEAL Team 6. I happen to have the great honor of flying into Baghdad with them at the start of the war."" With this statement Williams asserted that he was embedded with one of the most covert units in the U.S. military and flew with the SEALs into Iraq in March 2003 as the war there began. When asked about this claim, a Special Operations Command spokesman Ken McGraw told CNN: ""We do not embed journalists with that unit or any other unit that conducts counterterrorism missions. Bottom line -- no."" Could Williams have simply hitched a ride into Iraq with SEAL Team 6 outside of the formal embedding process? This seems quite unlikely. A SEAL officer told CNN, ""That early in the conflict, there were only missions taking place, not bouncing between outstations."" Williams was suspended this week for six months without pay as anchor of ""NBC Nightly News"" after it emerged that he had embellished the tale of a helicopter ride in Iraq, claiming incorrectly to have been on a chopper that was hit by rocket fire. NBC is conducting a fact-checking investigation of Williams' statements. The Huffington Post first reported that there were questions about Williams' statements about the SEALs. William has made further claims about his purportedly tight relationship with the men of SEAL Team 6, saying on the ""Late Show With David Letterman"" in January 2013, ""About six weeks after the Bin Laden raid, I got a white envelope and in it was a thank-you note, unsigned. And in it was a piece of the fuselage of the blown-up Black Hawk in that courtyard. Sent to me by one of my friends."" The SEAL officer says this seems unlikely given that ""there's no connection between the guys that went in early ('03) and the guys at A-bad,"" an abbreviation for the city of Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the bin Laden raid was carried out. Also, why SEAL Team 6 would want to thank Williams after the bin Laden raid is inexplicable as he had nothing to do with any element of it. In the course of reporting the book ""Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad,"" I interviewed dozens of the key officials who played a role in finding bin Laden or planned or executed the raid that killed him. None of them mentioned Williams as having any role in any of this. Two of the key players I interviewed for the book had been given mementos by SEAL Team 6. One was Leon Panetta, the CIA director who oversaw the successful hunt for bin Laden. And the other was Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the former commander of Joint Special Operations Command that oversees SEAL Team 6, who was presented with an American flag that members of the unit had taken on the bin Laden mission. But what makes Williams claim that he was given a piece of the helicopter that went down at the compound in Abbottabad where bin Laden was living even more implausible is what happened the night of the raid. Members of SEAL Team 6 were flying in ""stealth"" helicopters that radar can't detect. One of those helicopters crashed at bin Laden's compound in the first minute or so of the raid. After the helicopter crashed, the SEALs killed both of bin Laden's bodyguards, his son and bin Laden. They then went around the compound picking up bin Laden's computer hard drives and documents. What else has NBC News dug up on Williams? All of this took about 30 minutes. By now there was great anxiety that Pakistani army units or others unknown would arrive at the scene, and there might be a firefight. The SEALs decided to leave as soon as possible. The SEALs set explosives on the downed helicopter to blow it up so that its stealth technology would not fall into the wrong hands. They detonated a massive charge inside the downed helicopter and immediately departed the scene. If Williams' story is true, then during all this intense drama one of the SEALs took the time to pick up a piece of the damaged helicopter fuselage that he would later send to his favorite news anchor. Three weeks after the raid, the helicopter tail, which had survived the crash, was returned to the United States by Pakistan. It's also implausible that a SEAL Team 6 member would have then acquired a piece of this tail fuselage to send to Williams. How Williams' Iraq story changed . CNN asked NBC News to comment on Williams and the SEALs, but the network is not publicly discussing the issue while it conducts its investigation of a number of claims he has made that also relate to his coverage of the Iraq War as well as of Hurricane Katrina. Williams also has not been commenting. In the news business there is a sardonic phrase about stories that don't quite pass the smell test. They are called ""a story too good to check."" Unfortunately, for Williams his SEAL Team 6 stories, among others, that may have been ""too good to check,"" are now being checked.","Brian Williams said he traveled with SEAL Team 6, got memento from Osama bin Laden raid .

"(CNN)  -- More than 200,000 children were spanked or paddled in U.S. schools during the past school year, human rights groups reported Wednesday. Schools in 21 states can use corporal punishment. ""Every public school needs effective methods of discipline, but beating kids teaches violence, and it doesn't stop bad behavior,"" wrote Alice Farmer, the author of a joint report from Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Corporal punishment discourages learning, fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it."" Corporal punishment in schools remains legal in 21 U.S. states and is used frequently in 13: Missouri, Kentucky, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Florida, according to data received from the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education and cited in the report. The highest percentage of students receiving corporal punishment was in Mississippi, with 7.5 percent of students. The highest number was in Texas, with 48,197 students. ""When you talk to local school officials, they point to the fact that it's quick and it's effective -- and that's true,"" Farmer said. ""It doesn't take much time to administer corporal punishment, and you don't have to hire someone to run a detention or an after-school program."" But she said, ""We need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong."" In addition, corporal punishment can be linked to poverty and lack of resources. For instance, the report said, ""Teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics."" Overall, 223,190 students received corporal punishment in 2006-07, according to the Department of Education statistics. That number is down from 342,038 students in 2000-01 as more and more districts abolished corporal punishment.  Watch how one Texas family feels about corporal punishment » . The punishment is disproportionately applied to black students, according to the organizations. During the 2006-07 school year, for instance, black students made up 17.1 percent of the nationwide student population but 35.6 percent of those paddled at schools. Black girls were paddled at twice the rate of their white counterparts in the 13 states using corporal punishment most frequently. And although boys are punished more often than girls, the report found that African-American students in general are 1.4 times more likely to receive corporal punishment. In addition, special education students with mental or physical disabilities were more likely to receive corporal punishment, according to the ACLU and Human Rights Watch. Evangelical leader James Dobson's influential Focus on the Family group is among those stopping short of calling for a full ban on paddling in schools. ""Corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels, and I do not recommend its application,"" Dobson said on the organization's Web site. ""It can be useful for elementary students, especially with amateur clowns (as opposed to hard-core troublemakers). For this reason, I am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word. We're now down to a precious few. Let's not go any further in that direction."" Andrea Cancellare said her then-13-year-old son was paddled -- or ""swatted"" -- three years ago for flicking rubber bands in class, despite the fact she had written a letter directing school officials in Alpine, Texas, not to use corporal punishment against him. School officials told her they could not find the letter when she complained. When she approached the principal and superintendent, Cancellare said, they told her that ""most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment. It gets the kids back in class. It doesn't disrupt instruction. It's like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems."" Alpine Independent School District Superintendent Jose Cervantes said that both the principal and superintendent have taken other jobs, but for the past several years, the district has had a clear policy allowing parents to sign a waiver form and opt out of corporal punishment. ""It works on some, and it doesn't work on others,"" Cervantes said. ""If you're one of the individuals that it does work on, yes, it will become a deterrent."" Cancellare disagrees. ""I don't think it's the school's place to make decisions like that,"" she said. ""I'm not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either, but I feel like if somebody makes that decision, it should be the parent."" Most states typically leave it up to individual districts whether to use corporal punishment, and some of the nation's largest school districts -- among them Houston and Dallas, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; Atlanta, Georgia; and Mobile County, Alabama -- have banned the practice, according to the report.

"More ""Breaking Bad"" yo? The series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN's Ashleigh Banfield Thursday. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, ""Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say ... you know."" He left the rest up to viewers' imaginations. In response to questions about whether the character could show up in a movie or anywhere else ever again, Cranston said: ""Never say never."" Whoa. He may have been teasing, but that remark revived hopes for countless fans who still are mourning the loss of the character and the acclaimed series. The show literally went out with a bang in September 2013 and there was even a mock funeral held for the character in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the series was set and filmed. Cranston has remained busy since the series ended, most recently starring in the summer film ""Godzilla.""

"(CNN)""You can sleep when you're dead,"" I've told myself while answering work email in the middle of the night. To combat the previous night's loss of sleep, I'd go to bed at 8 p.m. the next night, only to find myself wide awake at 1 a.m. The ping-pong of sleeplessness leaves me disoriented and cranky. I wore my crazy work hours like a badge. ""I worked 60 hours last week,"" I'd say tiredly, but with a secret glee that this must mean that I was the best at what I was doing. My disregard for a healthy work/life balance showed my dedication and loyalty to work. This imbalance fed others in my life: How could I possibly go to the gym? I have work to do. I don't know how to fall asleep naturally. I'll have a drink or two before bed to ""help"" me fall asleep. Since I didn't shop for groceries on Sunday because I slept all day, on Tuesday, I had to order takeout. A year and a half ago, I returned from my second long-term assignment in India and felt pretty burnt out. With the help of my boss, I found a new role within my company. This was a role that allowed me to develop a healthy balance between doing good work and living a good life. So I started leaving work at 5 p.m. I worked from home on some days. I filled my free time with dozens of new hobbies. But I still wasn't getting regular and consistent sleep. I'd seen the news reports that said insomnia can hinder weight loss. But I still held on to those late nights, which were now filled with knitting and ""Law & Order"" reruns instead of work. ""How could I do it all if one-third of my day was spent sleeping?"" I wondered. Fast forward to our Fit Nation kickoff weekend. Paul Kriegler, corporate dietitian for Lifetime Fitness, led a nutrition workshop for our Fit Nation team. When the discussion of sleep came up, I listened even more intently as he explained the havoc that sleeplessness can wreak on our bodies, our blood sugars and our metabolism. I left that weekend determined to tackle my insomnia head on. I decided on three simple behaviors that I could change immediately: . 1. Do not drink alcohol at home . I used this as a crutch to get to sleep for many years. But while that drink might knock you out, you're not getting restful REM sleep and a few short hours later, you're right back where you started: awake! 2. Set a consistent bedtime . I decided to go to bed at 10:30 every night, including the weekends. The first few days were weird, but by the third night, my body was used to winding itself down around 9 p.m. 3. No screens an hour before bedtime and no cell phone in the bedroom . I spend most of my days planted in front of a computer. If I'm not working, I'm surfing the Internet or watching a movie online. My eyes and brain are constantly stimulated. Unplugging an hour before bed allows me to have a conversation with my boyfriend without distractions. I read a few chapters in a good book or I knit a few more rows on my latest sock project. It's been nice having this time for reflection and to quiet my mind right before bed. Banishing the phone from the bedroom means if I roll over in the middle of the night, I simply wait for myself to fall back asleep instead of reaching for the phone and scrolling through Instagram. I'm at the end of the third week and I have to tell you, I'm now sleeping through the night! I feel energized and excited to start the day. I've got energy for workouts and cooking. I feel great. And I look forward to bedtime each night. Sweet dreams at last.","Erica Moore, 35, says she gained weight because she worked too much and slept too little .

"Former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice has won his appeal of his indefinite suspension by the NFL for violating its domestic violence policy, the players union said Friday. ""The suspension has been vacated,"" George Atallah, the assistant executive director of external affairs for the players' union, said. Rice issued a written statement thanking his supporters, ""most importantly, my wife Janay."" ""I made an inexcusable mistake and accept full responsibility for my actions,"" Rice said, referring to two disturbing videos that show him knocking out his now-wife, Janay Rice, on an elevator in a casino in Atlantic City on February 15. ""I am thankful that there was a proper appeals process in place to address this issue."" He said he will continue to work hard to improve himself and learn from his mistakes. Former U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, a neutral arbitrator, presided over Rice's appeal hearing in New York earlier this month. Her decision means Rice is immediately able to play but any team will have to consider the consequences of signing someone whose domestic-violence case has been so public. Judge: Second suspension was 'arbitrary' In September, hours after the Ravens cut Rice, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell lengthened Rice's suspension from two games to an indefinite period. ""Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary. I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice,"" Jones wrote in her decision. She said the case wasn't about the number of games that Rice was suspended but the need for Goodell to be ""fair and consistent"" in its discipline. ""Following the release of the inside-the-elevator video, which prompted a new round of criticism, the league suspended Rice indefinitely. Now, the league argues that Commissioner Goodell was justified in imposing the second discipline because Rice had misled him and because the video demonstrated a level of violence that he had not understood. ""I have found that Rice did not mislead the commissioner. Moreover, any failure on the part of the League to understand the level of violence was not due to Rice's description of the event, but to the inadequacy of words to convey the seriousness of domestic violence. That the league did not realize the severity of the conduct without a visual record also speaks to their admitted failure in the past to sanction this type of conduct more severely."" League: We respect decision . In August, after outrage over Rice's initial two-game suspension, Goodell announced a new league policy for domestic violence and other assaults. First-time offenders would be suspended at least six games and a second offense would draw a lifetime ban. But he didn't alter Rice's punishment at that time. Provisions of the initial suspension -- which include counseling, not getting in legal trouble again and not getting in trouble with the NFL again -- still stand, she wrote. The two-game suspension would have ended in September. A spokesman for the NFL, Greg Aiello, said the league respects the decision. It is questionable that Rice will return to the field this season. ""If a team wanted to sign him and put him on the field that could happen but we're not expecting that to occur any time soon,"" CNN's Rachel Nichols said. ""If you're a team that needs a running back, are you going to sign Ray Rice knowing the backlash against him, knowing how people in the public feel about it?"" Still, winning is the most important thing in the NFL, she said, and there is a possibility Rice could get a new contract if a new team thought he could help it win games. The NFL said the league is working to implement a new personal conduct policy in the wake of the ruling. ""Judge Jones' ruling underscores the urgency of our work to develop and implement a clear, fair and comprehensive new personal conduct policy,"" said Brian McCarthy, the NFL vice president of communications. ""We expect this policy to be completed and announced in the weeks ahead. Our focus is on consistently enforcing an improved policy going forward."" Janay Rice speaks . TMZ Sports obtained two videos from the footage taken from surveillance cameras of the altercation with Janay Rice in Atlantic City. It posted the first one, which showed Rice dragging Janay Rice -- limp and face down -- out of the elevator, shortly after the incident. The in-elevator video showing the violent punch was put online September 8, the same day Rice was released and suspended. In a first-person piece published on ESPN.com, Janay Rice said her husband understands violence is unacceptable. ""Ray told the truth and has fully accepted responsibility for his actions, which allowed us to work together at improving ourselves and get to the better place we are today,"" she said. She admitted she has a hard time being called a victim. ""I know there are so many different opinions out there about me -- that I'm weak, that I'm making excuses and covering up abuse -- and that some people question my motives for staying with Ray,"" she wrote. ""However, I'm a strong woman and I come from a strong family."" The Rices also were interview by NBC, portions of which will be aired Monday and Tuesday. Janay Rice told the network that she was furious at first but knew that the relationship -- she was his fiancee at the time -- wasn't over. Rice's future not with Ravens . Rice, 27, is currently a free agent.  He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection in eight seasons and played on the Baltimore Ravens' Super Bowl championship team in 2012 season. ""We are aware of the ruling. Our owner has already stated that we will not resign him,"" the Ravens said in a statement. In March, a grand jury indicted Ray Rice on a charge of third-degree aggravated assault, and a simple assault charge against Janay Rice was dropped. The couple were married the next day. Ray Rice pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and applied to a program for first-time offenders that could clear him of charges in one year. Terry O'Neill, the president of the National Organization of Women, said the NFL needs for two things to happen: For Goodell to resign and for the league to examine thoroughly how it handles domestic violence cases. Another women's rights group, UltraViolet, said the case is another failure of the NFL to take domestic violence seriously. ""The problem here is the NFL's long history of sweeping abuse under the rug,"" co-founder Nita Chaudhary said.","Rice's wife tells NBC she was angry but knew she would stay with the player .
Rice says he made ""inexcusable mistake""

"(CNN)Conservationists are racing to try to save more than 170 whales stranded on a remote beach on New Zealand's South Island. Twenty-four of the 198 pilot whales stuck on the beach have already died, New Zealand's Department of Conservation said Friday. The department's staff, helped by 140 volunteers, were planning to try to refloat the giant mammals as the tide rose Friday evening, it said. The whales are stuck on Farewell Spit, a thin claw of land that reaches out into the sea from the northern tip of the South Island. The spit forms the top of Golden Bay, which is known as a stranding hotspot because of its protruding coastline, gently sloping beaches and system of currents. The Department of Conservation advised the public not to try to come and help the efforts to save the whales. ""Refloating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job, so it's important we have the right people on the ground tonight trying to get these whales back to safety,"" said Andrew Lamason, the department's services manager for Golden Bay. But if the efforts are unsuccessful, help may be needed Saturday to keep the whales cool and wet until the next high tide, authorities said. Surrounded by oceans rich in marine life, New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates for sea mammals in the world. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","Twenty-four of the 198 pilot whales stranded on Farewell Spit have already died .

"(CNN)Manchester United's Louis van Gaal and Sunderland's Gus Poyet were the latest managers to criticize the heavy Premier League schedule during the festive period but while the duo lamented their teams playing four games in 13 days, fans in England and around the world continue to enjoy the action on offer. The Premier League is, after all, the only major football league not to shut down over the holidays. Some supporters had more reason to cheer than others, and on that note, here's a look at the winners and losers in the Premier League during its busiest time of the season. Winners . Manchester City: One of the standout results over the Christmas period had to be defending champion Manchester City slumping to a 2-2 draw with Burnley -- at home and after holding a 2-0 second-half lead. But that was the lone blemish for Manuel Pellegrini's men, despite nearly squandering another two-goal advantage at home to Sunderland on New Year's Day. City collected 10 of 12 points, scoring 11 goals in the process without talismanic striker Sergio Aguero. City was also without the services of the perhaps equally influential Vincent Kompany in the heart of the defense. Once eight points behind Chelsea, City and the Londoners are now level atop the table. Tottenham: Harry Kane proved to be a hurricane that stormed past Chelsea on Thursday. He scored twice, assisted on another and won a penalty in the stunning 5-3 victory over a team that had previously had Tottenham's number. With fellow strikers Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor continuing to misfire, his emergence has come at the right time for Tottenham. Kane, Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen make for an impressive attacking trio. Tottenham -- like City -- earned three wins and a draw to climb to fifth, only two points behind Southampton in the race for the final Champions League spot in England. Southampton: A freefall down the table, some would have said, was inevitable for the Saints after they lost five straight games heading into the Christmas rush. Yet Southampton turned it around in a hurry, gathering 10 points. It beat the struggling duo of Everton and Crystal Palace prior to drawing Chelsea and downing Arsenal. Sure the referee might have helped Southampton against Chelsea -- not awarding a seemingly clear penalty to the visitor -- but Southampton bossed proceedings against Arsenal. For all the talk this season of striker Graziano Pelle and midfielder Dusan Tadic, don't forget the work of fullbacks Ryan Bertrand and Nathaniel Clyne. Hull City: Winless in 10 games, Hull manager Steve Bruce was hoping for respite on Boxing Day against Sunderland. When Adam Johnson scored for the Black Cats in the first minute, though, it seemed like more bad luck was on the way for Hull. Hull, however, rallied for a 3-1 win and better form followed. After somehow losing to Leicester 1-0 -- hitting the post twice and firing 19 shots -- the Tigers eased past Everton 2-0 to rise to 15th. Burnley: How could a team that amassed a mere two points in four games be a 'winner,' you ask? Well, Burnley, seemingly doomed for relegation in October, showed plenty of grit even with a thin squad -- manager Sean Dyche named the same starting XI in all four games. The lack of rotation cost Dyche on Thursday, since he had to make three injury enforced subs within 40 minutes, but Burnley still rallied three times to draw Newcastle away 3-3. As if coming back against City wasn't enough. The two losses were narrow defeats to Spurs and Liverpool. If Eibar is a sentimental favorite in La Liga, Burnely -- now a point off safety -- is the Premier League equivalent. Losers . Everton: The honeymoon period is over for Roberto Martinez. Adored by the Everton fans last season -- enjoying success with a more attractive style than David Moyes' methodical approach -- Martinez's team lost all four games. It scored in only one of them. Lingering near a Champions League place early in the season, Everton now finds itself a mere four points above the relegation zone. West Bromwich Albion: Moyes' former assistant at Everton, Alan Irvine, didn't last long in his first stint as manager, getting fired after the sagging Baggies lost 2-0 to Stoke. But here's good news for the West Brom faithful: Tony Pulis is on the way. Pulis has never been relegated as a manager and is the reigning manager of the season in the Premier League, working wonders at Crystal Palace before leaving the Eagles on the eve of the current campaign. Crystal Palace: Irvine wasn't the first manager to go in the Premier League this season. That 'honor' went to Neil Warnock at Palace following a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton on Boxing Day. Warnock's second stint in charge at Selhurst Park started well enough but the team has won once since late September. Warnock said publicly that Palace needed strikers and it's not difficult to see why with a return of 20 goals. In the last seven, Palace has netted twice. Former Palace midfielder Alan Pardew is set to take over from Warnock. Aston Villa: When Aston Villa won three of its four first league games this season, relegation troubles appeared to be an afterthought. And despite Villa still being five points above the bottom three, it's hard to imagine its fans content. Palace's dearth in front of goal is nothing compared to Villa, which has scored 11 times in 20 games. In three draws and a loss in the past fortnight, the Birmingham-based club found the back of the net once. Chelsea: The festive period began perfectly for Chelsea. Playing at one of the toughest grounds in England, the Blues beat Stoke 2-0. Then came another 2-0 win, against a then in-form West Ham. Chelsea looked unstoppable. But slip-ups ensued at Southampton and Tottenham, with Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho not happy with the referee on both occasions. A Mourinho team has always won the league when it has led at the end of a year, but Chelsea's dip has given Manchester City hope.","Chelsea dropped five points in its last two games during the festive period .
But Manchester City prospered in the Premier League, taking 10 of 12 points .
Other teams to excel included Harry Kane's Tottenham and Southampton .
Everton, Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion all struggled, though ."
"(CNN)Night had just fallen when heavily armed Belgian commandos approached a residence on the Rue des Collines in Verviers, a sleepy town in eastern Belgium. They knew the three men inside -- all suspected to be hardened Belgian ISIS veterans who had returned from fighting in Syria -- were likely to be armed and dangerous because they had put them under 24-hour surveillance for several weeks, according to a senior Belgian counterterrorism official. Wiretaps of phone conversations and listening devices indicated the cell members -- who had been under observation for just under two months and were all from in and around the Molenbeek district of Brussels -- were in the final stages of preparing a major terrorist attack in Belgium, the official told CNN. Two suspected members of the cell had taken up lodging in the residence. Belgian security services had learned they were using the building as a safe house to store automatic weapons and chemicals to make explosives. The trigger for the arrests was the arrival at the safe house of a third ISIS veteran suspected of being the quartermaster of the plot, tasked with providing the cell logistical support and providing it with equipment and supplies. Belgian security services wanted to arrest all three together, according to the official, and simultaneously make other arrests of suspects across Belgium. They believed the cell had as many as 10 members. What happened next around 5:45 p.m. January 15 was the biggest firefight Belgian commandos have faced since World War II, captured for the world to see on a home movie shot by one of the town's residents. Toxic mix that makes Belgium fertile ground for terrorism . After the commandos broke into the safe house, the two ISIS fighters who had taken up lodging in the building grabbed Kalashnikovs, returned automatic fire and lobbed grenades, using urban warfare skills honed in Syria, according to the official. But Belgian commandos soon shot them both dead and took the suspected quartermaster of the plot into custody after he jumped out of a window. Inside, Belgian police discovered automatic weapons and chemicals necessary to make the high explosive TATP, an explosive many times more powerful than that used by the Boston bombers. They also discovered police uniforms, suggesting the plotters hoped to gain access to sensitive sites in Belgium, according to the senior Belgian counterterrorism official. A GoPro camera was also recovered, suggesting the cell might have been planning to film the attacks for propaganda.  Belgian police made 13 arrests that night. Within hours, Belgian officials announced they had thwarted a major imminent terrorist attack by fighters who had returned from Syria. Belgian authorities publicly stated the cell's target was believed to be police officers and police stations. Belgian security services had listened to conversations in which the cell members discussed killing police, according to the senior Belgian counterterrorism official. But the official told CNN investigators believe the group planned a much more ambitious and spectacular attack with police just being a ""bonus target."" The official said that investigators do not yet know the cell's main target or targets but are hopeful they will find out. Brussels houses the headquarters of the European Union's institutions and NATO. Belgian authorities later identified the two dead gunmen as Sofiane Amghar and Khalid Ben Larbi and the alleged quartermaster of the plot as Marouane El Bali. El Bali was charged with ""participation in a terrorist organization, possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack and prohibited possession of weapons."" The senior Belgian counterterrorism official said El Bali was ""like a machine"" in furnishing the cell with the supplies they needed to carry out the attack. When Belgian commandos moved in, he was still searching for an ice machine so the TATP the group was poised to make could be cooled and transported, according to the official. ""TATP is very unstable and would explode otherwise,"" they said. El Bali's lawyer, Didier De Quévy, told CNN his client denied having anything to do with terrorism and that El Bali was in the apartment in Verviers to bring a pair of shoes to his friend. He said El Bali jumped out of the window because the apartment was on fire. The Belgian official told CNN El Bali has refused to talk to investigators. El Bali and two others charged with terrorist offenses in the plot remain in custody. A 33-year-old Algerian extradited to Belgium after being arrested in Greece was also charged with terrorism offenses in relation to the plot. The senior counterterrorism official told CNN the Algerian had connections to the cell in Belgium. The two dead gunmen and El Bali were all in communication by phone with a suspected Belgian ISIS operative named Abelhamid Abaaoud, a 27-year-old Belgian-Moroccan from Molenbeek. Belgian investigators believed he was the ringleader of the cell and the ""link person"" to the senior leadership of ISIS in Syria, according to the senior Belgian counterterrorism official.  For security reasons, the cell members had an elaborate system to make the phone calls and used coded language. The Algerian extradited to Belgium also had links to Abaaoud according to the official. In the weeks before the plot was thwarted, Belgian counterterrorism agencies traced the calls to a cell phone in Greece that they believed was being used by Abaaoud, according to the official. Other intelligence gathering indicated Abaaoud was linked to several senior ISIS operatives in Syria. Belgian investigators believe ISIS senior leadership directed the cell to launch the attack in Belgium, according to the official. The Belgians brought in U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, to try to locate the cell phone in Greece, but neither the Americans nor Greek police were able to locate Abaaoud, according to the official. On Thursday, ISIS claimed in a new issue of its English online language magazine Dabiq that Abaaoud had safely returned to Syria and posted several pictures of him. One picture taken at some point in 2014 in Syria featured Abaaoud standing next to what ISIS claimed were the two gunmen killed in the Verviers siege. They identified them as ""Abuz-Zubayr al-Baljīkī (Khālid), and Abū Khālid al-Baljīkī (Sufyān)."" The Belgian counterterrorism official confirmed to CNN the photograph did indeed feature the men killed in the raid last month: Khalid Ben Larbi and Sofiane Amghar. In a purported Q&A with Dabiq magazine, Abaaoud claimed he had traveled to Belgium with the two gunmen. Belgian investigators are skeptical of that claim and have no evidence to suggest he was able to reach Belgium. But the senior Belgian counterterrorism official said the trail for Abaaoud has gone cold, and it is possible he was able to return to Syria from Greece. ""I was able to leave and come to Shām despite being chased after by so many intelligence agencies. My name and picture were all over the news yet I was able to stay in their homeland, plan operations against them, and leave safely when doing so became necessary,"" Abaaoud claimed in the Q&A according to ISIS. Abaaoud is believed to have joined ISIS in Syria in early 2014 after traveling from Belgium, according to Guy Van Vlierden, the editor of ""emmejihad,"" a blog on Belgian foreign fighters. At some point, his younger 13-year-old brother joined him there becoming the youngest Belgian jihadi in Syria. According to Vlierden, Abaaoud developed ties to a Libyan ISIS brigade called Al-Battar. In Syria, Abaaoud became known by the fighting names Abou Omar al Soussi and Abu Omar al Belgiki. After joining ISIS, Abaaoud posted several videos of himself on the front lines. In one of them, he can be heard saying ""it's not fun seeing blood spilled, but it gives me pleasure from time to time to see blood of the disbelievers run because we grew up watching the blood of Muslims being spilled in the whole world on TV."" In March 2014, the video and photo files on one of Abaaoud's cell phones was obtained by the journalist Etienne Huver from sources in a Syrian refugee camp on the Turkish border. In a report Huver filed for the Belgian news channel RTBF,  Abaaoud is seen driving a car dragging the corpses of Free Syria army fighters. In Dabiq magazine, Abaaoud acknowledged that ""a brother had taken video footage of some of us before a battle, but his camera got lost and was later sold by a murtadd (a lapsed Muslim) to a Western journalist."" Abaaoud's family in Belgium, after hearing nothing from Abaaoud after he traveled to Syria, received word in October he had been killed in fighting, they revealed in interviews with the Belgian media. Belgian counterterrorism officials believe he faked his own death so he could travel more easily to Europe to coordinate the plot. Western intelligence agencies believe the Belgium plot indicates ISIS is pivoting toward attacking the West, according to a senior European counterterrorism official. Intelligence suggests the group is seeking to send back European recruits to target the European countries involved in airstrikes against it, according to the official. The UK, France, Holland, Denmark and Belgium are carrying out strikes against ISIS positions in Iraq. More than 750 European extremists have returned to Europe after joining jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, according to official estimates. The Belgian official said Belgium was facing an unprecedented terrorist threat with significant concern returning fighters from Syria or ISIS-inspired lone wolves could be plotting attacks. Last week, Sen. James Risch, a Republican from Idaho and a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that intelligence suggested ISIS was ""moving beyond the aspirational"" when it came to plotting attacks against Europe and the U.S. homeland.","Belgian counterterrorism official tells CNN how they thwarted an ISIS cell .

"(CNN)Last week, I was among 14 American Muslims who met with President Barack Obama at the White House, where I delivered a handmade Valentine's Day card from two California sisters, Sabrina and Saniya. Sabrina, who is 10, told the President that she likes how he's running the country, and that she plans to be an engineer or a basketball player when she grows up. She also wrote that she was worried about kids being mean to her because of her Muslim faith and asked for the President's help amid the growing crisis of anti-Muslim hate. This week, my heart sank as I read every parent's worst nightmare in the news: Three bright-eyed young Americans had been brutally slain in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Deah Shaddy Barakat; his new wife, Yusor Abu-Salha; and her sister Razan Abu-Salha were charitable, optimistic and promising individuals who were determined to make the world a better place, but whose lives were viciously ripped away. As the facts unfold, many indications lead us to believe that this is likely a hate crime. Yusor Abu-Salha's father has repeatedly stated that his daughter told the family that the neighbor didn't like them because of the way they looked. The accused killer's social media posts frequently attacked religion. And the manner of death: bullets to the head. Sadly, this incident is not an isolated tragedy. Hate crimes and anti-Muslim bigotry have been escalating at an alarming rate, causing fear among families and communities of heinous attacks exactly like the one we witnessed in North Carolina. In the last few months, we have seen public figures engage in rhetoric that has only added fuel to the fire of anti-Muslim hate and bigotry. Just a few weeks ago, Texas state Rep. Molly White posted on her Facebook page about an upcoming Texas Muslim Capitol Day where students get to engage with elected leaders. In her post, White indicates that she left ""instructions to staff to ask representatives from the Muslim community to renounce Islamic terrorist groups and publicly announce allegiance to America"" when they visit her office. A few months before, White posted that ""Muslims cannot be trusted no matter how peaceful they appear."" Earlier, in January, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal warned Americans of fabricated ""no-go zones"" in the United States where non-Muslims are not allowed to go, and insisted that immigration by Muslims should be viewed as an ""invasion,"" clearly not grasping the fact that Muslims have been a part of America since their forced migration on slave ships. And it gets worse. Since the release of the movie ""American Sniper,"" we have seen ugly and threatening messages on social media. One Twitter user said the film ""makes me wanna go shoot some (expletive) Arabs."" Another Twitter user suggested that people look up the list of mosques and Islamic schools in the United States (he provided them a link to a community website that compiles the names and locations of these institutions) and then attack them with guns and other heavy ammunition pictured in his tweet. Hate-filled rhetoric and threats of violence have popped up in every facet of our society. As a Muslim, it is difficult to go about my life without my faith being attacked on social media, on mainstream cable news and in my community. At last week's meeting, I asked the President to host a summit to examine discrimination directed at people of faith in America. While Obama announced Friday that the FBI has begun an inquiry into Tuesday's horrific killings in North Carolina, now, more than ever, we need the President and Attorney General Holder to speak from the podium and personally address the larger issue of anti-Muslim bigotry. Furthermore, it is critical for Holder, our nation's chief law enforcement officer, to direct and complete a rigorous federal investigation on the attack and make it clear that violence against anyone based on how they look or how they pray will not be tolerated. In fact, 150 organizations have signed onto a letter asking Holder for such an investigation. As Americans, we want all our children to grow up with the same opportunities. We want all our families to be able to practice our faiths and be part of communities that celebrate and welcome diversity. We want to keep our communities safe from acts of violence. Today, Muslim, Arab, Sikh and South Asian-American parents are hugging their children a little tighter, feeling helpless to protect them from others who hate them simply because of how they look or the way they pray. As we carry the torch for Deah, Yusor and Razan and remember the great things they accomplished in their beautiful lives, let us also honor their memory by ensuring that young children such as Sabrina and Saniya are not targets of future hate crimes. Let us assure tomorrow's rising stars that they can grow up in a world where they don't have to fear their fellow Americans. Let us create a nation where Sabrina doesn't feel the need to ask her President to protect her from hate.","Farhana Khera: Hate crimes and anti-Muslim bigotry have been escalating at alarming rate .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Before Adam Walsh, Etan Patz and Madeleine McCann, before the first Amber Alert, before a young face stared back from the side of a milk carton, there was Danny. Danny Barter was 4 when he vanished in 1959 while on a family camping trip. Danny Barter vanished in 1959. He was on a family camping trip to Alabama's Perdido Bay. He was playing with his dad one minute, gone the next. ""Just like that,"" recalled his brother Mike Barter. Danny was 4 years old. Last weekend, his loved ones returned to the campsite and to the scene of the presumed stranger abduction. They came to remember Danny and to rededicate a half-century mission to find him. Even with the passage of time, their faith has not wavered. ""We've never doubted that he's ... out there,"" Mike Barter said. ""Until they prove otherwise, we hope one day we will be reunited."" Their hope has been bolstered by investigators with the FBI and the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office, which reopened the case last year after hearing of a recent conversation. ""A lead was sparked when someone was sitting in a public area talking about what happened,"" FBI spokeswoman Joyce Riggs wrote in an e-mail to the media. As cold case cops know, a wisp of a lead can turn into a big break, a fact FBI Special Agent Angela Tobon believes can solve the Daniel Barter mystery. ""Even if [people] think it's insignificant, it's probably not,"" Tobon said. ""Each little piece of the puzzle may not mean something, but when you put it all together, you get the big picture."" Danny was the third youngest of Paul and Maxine Barter's seven children. He had brown hair and big brown eyes. ""He's such a very pretty and sweet child,"" his mom told the Mobile Register in an article published June 21, 1959. ""I can understand why someone would want to take him, because he's such a pretty child."" Three days earlier, Danny, his parents and his siblings were enjoying a family outing near the Gulf shore. Danny and his dad had just returned from getting some drinks at a store. Tents were pitched. Fishing poles were prepared. And then someone noticed that Danny was gone. ""I had first believed that despite Danny's fear of water, he had wandered into the water and drowned,"" Maxine Barter told the Mobile Register. ""But not now. I believe he probably walked up the road, and someone picked him up."" The search was extensive and immediate. Hundreds combed the land and the waters, looking for Danny. Bloodhounds were given his scent and dispatched to follow it. Alligators were killed and cut open. But there was no trace of Danny, then or now. For his parents and the police, the sickening conclusion was quickly reached: He was stolen by a human predator. Danny's mom could not fathom that the kidnapper would bring harm to her boy. ""I hope now that someone did take Danny, because I know if anyone wanted him bad enough to kidnap him, they would take good care of him,"" she said. Fifty years later, the family longs for closure. Paul and Maxine Barter are both deceased, but their children carry on the decades-long pursuit to know the truth. On dannybarter.com, a Web site dedicated to finding answers, the family posted this plea to the public: . ""We strongly believe that someone out there knows what happened to Danny and possibly knows him as another identity. We hope to find him safe and sound."" The FBI is also seeking information on Danny Barter. It has published two photographs of him on its Web site. One shows the smiling child, taken in the months before Danny was abducted. The other picture is age-progressed, depicting what Danny would look like today at 54. If you have any information on the Danny Barter case, go to dannybarter.com or contact the FBI, your local police or the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office in Alabama.","FBI says it has a new lead in a 50-year-old cold case .

"(CNN)Let ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" play on: Nostalgia for the 1970s heavily influenced spring's most coveted fashion trends, and industry insiders expect to see the era linger in this year's fall-winter collections at New York Fashion Week, which started Thursday. Waists are high and layers are long, with extended tunics paired over slim dress shapes like fluid pants (often with a slight flare) and long skirts. ""It's a slimmer silhouette -- much more concise and much more grown-up,"" said Lizzy Bowring, who identifies the key trends to emerge from the global runways for fashion forecaster WGSN. ""It isn't a granola look, as one might say."" Bowring foresees the baby doll dress to become a key item but anticipates the overriding trend to be masculinity with strong elements of bespoke tailoring in a sleeker, slimmer silhouette. In line with this tailored look, expect emphasis on the waist with a made-to-measure jacket and relaxed pant combo, flaps on lower pockets or patent belts that nip in the waist. The belted waist lends itself well into a slight military aesthetic, with a focus on uniformity and utility. Because of this, the color palette skews toward olive, forest greens and navy. But that's not the only color story this year: There's soft, pure neutrals and cosmetic tones like camel and chalky whites that are juxtaposed with warm, rich tones like cognac, saffron and blood orange. The Pantone Color Institute's top 10 colors for fall 2015 paint a similar picture, with offerings like cadmium orange, dried herb, stormy weather and marsala, which was recently named color of the year. ""The fall 2015 palette is rooted in multifaceted, androgynous colors that can be worn to portray effortless sophistication across men's and women's fashion; it is the first time we are seeing a truly unisex color palette,"" said Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director of the institute. And while the 1970s reign supreme, Bowring wonders whether things won't hark back even further to a time of ""historical romanticism,"" as she calls it, with high, intricately laced necklines, empire-waisted gowns and tapestry prints.","New York Fashion Week runs from Thursday through February 19 .

"(CNN)While the professional game of golf gears up for 2015 in rude health, at grassroots level the sport finds itself in the rough. With more prize money on offer for the stars than ever before -- 97 players won over $1 million on the PGA Tour last year -- and lucrative sponsorship deals, golf can rest safe in the knowledge that the future is bright for those competing at its top end. At the opposite end of the spectrum, however, the sport stands at a crossroads, with recent years having brought about a major slump in popularity in its traditional heartlands of the U.S. and the UK and Ireland. As golf continues to hemorrhage players, the steps it chooses to take next could prove crucial in turning its fortunes around. Some 400,000 people reportedly left the sport in the past year in the U.S., although the National Golf Foundation (NGF) states: ""The numbers quoted don't reconcile with NGF data and they're not something that we reported or would report."" NGF results do show that the sport in the U.S. has lost five million players in the last decade, with 20% of the existing 25 million golfers poised to quit in the next few years. To compound that depressing statistic, the number of newcomers to the game in the U.S. fell by 20% last year, while according to Sport England, the amount of 16-25-year-olds playing the game regularly almost halved in England between 2009-10 and 2012-13. Whether it is courses closing, merchandise sales falling or job losses on the rise, golf is being hit hard at grassroots level for its failure to attract new faces and keep hold of older ones. Below par . But why are numbers falling and is a re-brand of sorts needed to rectify the decline? As with any pastime or hobby, time and money are two key factors, as the game's greatest player, Jack Nicklaus, acknowledges. ""I'd like to play a game that can take place in three hours, I'd quite like to play a game that I can get some reasonable gratification out of very quickly and something that is not going to cost me an arm and a leg,"" Nicklaus told CNN. The 18-time major champion's words reflect the mood of the wider public, many of whom are still struggling from the effects of the economic downturn and live in a world that offers an ever-increasing number of cheaper and less time-consuming alternatives. To put it bluntly, the traditional concept of 18-hole golf is struggling to find its place in modern day lives. Meanwhile, as would-be golfers continue to turn elsewhere to get their fix, the younger generation -- the very future of the sport -- have more distractions than ever in a world where technology holds sway. ""It's Twitter, cell phones, video games -- these are the activities that kids are involved in,"" former player-turned-commentator Brandel Chamblee tells CNN. ""Mum and dad are working, and kids are playing video games. That doesn't leave a whole load of time or people to populate these golf courses."" And its due to problems like these that, in 2014, more courses closed than opened in the U.S. for the eighth straight year. Head in the sand? For all its problems, though, golf can no longer be accused of complacency and being stuck in its ways -- it is, at least, sitting up and taking notice. Ben Sharpe, CEO of golf equipment manufacturer, TaylorMade is keen to tackle the problem head on. ""As an industry we can't put our head into the sand, we have to evolve and continually modernize,"" Sharpe told CNN. ""What we want to do is get golf clubs in people's hands and get them hitting golf balls."" A variety of fresh ideas and innovative alternatives to the traditional game have also been formulated in recent years in an attempt to reinvigorate the sport. Step out onto a golf course today and you could well see 15-inch holes instead of their smaller ancestors -- you would not be dreaming were you to come across golfers kicking a football around rather than hitting a golf ball with a club. ""A lot of people are getting involved and loving FootGolf,"" president of the Federation for International FootGolf, Mike O'Connor, told CNN in April. ""It catches such a large demographic because it's such a low skill level to be able to play. You've just got to be able to kick a ball."" For FootGolf, also read the likes of Speedgolf and Golf Xtreme, while Hack Golf, an initiative aimed at crowdsourcing ideas to improve the game, is another example of how the sport is thinking outside the box. But perhaps more important than such alternatives which, let it be said, are starting to have some impact, golf is beginning to understand it needs to redefine the way it has traditionally approached getting people to play the game. Many potential players can be put off before they have even picked up a club by the length of time it takes to make their way around a course. Yet those that run golf are keen to get across the message that the 18-hole game is only one side to a multifaceted sport. ""What it means to play golf doesn't just need to be measured on how many rounds you've played,"" PGA CEO Pete Bevacqua told CNN. ""Did you have a golf lesson? Did you go to hit practice shots at a practice range? Did you play three holes with your wife, your spouse or your children? These are all golf experiences. ""Playing 18 holes with three friends on a beautiful golf course is the ultimate, but you can't always do that. And we'd rather see people just have a golf experience to get into the game. And once you get interested, the magic, the charm of the game, will keep you interested."" A 'smarter' approach . It is this type of change in attitude that was behind the PGA's decision to shift the focus for its Junior League Golf program to that of the enjoyment of recreation and playing with others, rather than an obsession with all-out competition. ""Golf is getting smarter and they're looking at the interests of kids and no longer assuming that golf can attract these kids with its traditional interests and traditional allurements,"" Chamblee says. Golf's world No. 1 Rory McIlroy is in agreement, having called for a faster version of the game that will appeal to kids earlier this month. Given his global status, McIlroy is in the perfect position to have a positive influence on future generations of players -- something he is more than aware of having taken on an ambassador role with PGA Junior League Golf. ""You've seen how iconic players in the game have affected people and some people transcend the game of golf which is really what we need,"" TaylorMade's Sharpe says. ""We had a good spell with Tiger Woods during the 1990s and 2000s and Rory is positioned to be another person who can do that."" With McIlroy taking his game to the next level in 2014 -- winning his third and fourth majors at the age of just 25 -- golf looks set to profit in 2015 as the Northern Irishman attempts to consolidate his spot as the sport's primary superstar. Such dominance can only be of good for the grassroots game, and those tasked with increasing its popularity are confident enough in the work being done that they are refusing to hit the panic button just yet. ""We're realistic -- there's challenges, there's troubles, like there have always been,"" Bevacqua says. ""They're different, but golf's resilient and will get through this if we're smart, and I think the industry is smart."" Sharpe also remains optimistic about golf's fortunes in the coming years, pointing to the growth of the game globally. ""There is still a very high participation around the world and it is growing in parts of the world,"" Sharpe says. ""So I think we should be quietly confident that golf is going to be in a good spot going forward.""","Golf suffering a decline in popularity in its traditional heartlands of the U.S. and UK .

"Beijing, China (CNN)The son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan has been released after being jailed for six months in China for drug offenses. Jaycee Chan was detained in August last year after he tested positive for marijuana and police found more than 100 grams of the drug in his Beijing apartment. His management company, Mstones, said he was released early Friday morning and will hold a press conference on Saturday. ""He will make a formal public apology and give a full explanation,"" the online statement said. A Beijing court sentenced him in January but took into account the time he already spent in jail since last summer. Chan pleaded guilty to ""hosting others to take drugs,"" was also fined 2,000 yuan ($320), announced the Dongcheng District People's Court. The Hong Kong native was arrested along with a Taiwanese actor, amid a government crackdown on celebrity drug offenders. Although he did not attend the trial, Jackie Chan -- who has starred in Hollywood blockbusters like ""Rush Hour"" and was named an anti-drugs ambassador in China in 2009 -- had expressed anger and disappointment in his son in media interviews. ""I failed to discipline him -- now the state is helping me discipline him and make him get rid all the bad habits,"" the elder Chan, 60, told the state-run Xinhua news agency last December, while denying his son had received special treatment in jail. The younger Chan's case has put a spotlight on the Chinese capital's intensifying anti-drugs campaign. By mid-November, the authorities had detained almost 10,000 people for using drugs, nearly double the previous year's figure. Announcing the numbers, a top anti-narcotics official in Beijing emphasized the government's ""zero-tolerance"" stance on celebrity offenders due to the impact of their behavior on the youth. Last August, dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with Beijing authorities, banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to fire any artists who break the law.

"(CNN)Liverpool must prepare for life without one its greatest ever players after captain Steven Gerrard confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the 2014-2015 season. ""This has been the toughest decision of my life and one which both me and my family have agonized over for a good deal of time,"" Gerrard, who has played 695 times for Liverpool, told the club's website. ""I am making the announcement now so that the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future."" Gerrard will continue playing football -- but not in the English Premier League -- and Italian journalist Gianluca di Marzio has reported that U.S. club LA Galaxy are interested in signing the Liverpool midfielder. ""I'm going to carry on playing and although I can't confirm at this stage where that will be, I can say it will be somewhere that means I won't be playing for a competing club and will not therefore be lining up against Liverpool -- that is something I could never contemplate."" Tributes from fellow professionals have poured in. Liverpool teammate Kolo Toure told CNN: ""It has been an honor and it is still an honor for me to play with this amazing man. He is a top professional and a true legend."" Former teammates for both club and country also took to Twitter to praise the midfielder. Michael Owen said: ""Hard for the Steven Gerrard news to sink in. Amazing servant to Liverpool, arguably the best of all time,"" while Jamie Carragher tweeted: ""Sad day for Lfc & English football with the Gerrard news. I think its the right decision all things considered."" The 34-year-old made his first-team debut for the Reds in November 1998 and has scored 180 goals to date in all competitions. Gerrard, who also represented England 114 times before retiring in July, won eight trophies with the club including two FA Cups, three League Cups and the UEFA Cup in 2001. His greatest achievement came in 2005 when he captained Liverpool to victory in the Champions League final against AC Milan in Istanbul. Gerrard won the Man of the Match award as Rafa Benitez's side overturned a three-goal deficit to eventually win a dramatic match in a penalty shoot-out. It was Gerrard's looping headed goal early in the second half that sparked Liverpool's remarkable recovery. However, his long-cherished desire to win the Premier League never materialized -- Liverpool came close in 2009 finishing second to Manchester United and last season Brendan Rodgers' side were pipped to the post by Manchester City. Even more distressingly Gerrard's mistake in the 2-0 home defeat by Chelsea near the end of the season gifted the visitors their first goal -- an error opposition supporters continue to remind the Liverpool captain about in a song during games. A 19th League title in his final season, and a first for the club in a quarter of century, looks improbable -- the Merseysiders are currently in eighth place in the table, 17 points off top spot. Gerrard reasserted his commitment to the team for the rest of the season and hasn't ruled out a return to Anfield in the future. ""It is a very special place to be part of. It is my sincere hope and wish that one day I can return to serve Liverpool again, in whatever capacity best helps the club,"" he said. Gerrard also paid tribute to Rodgers, the owners, his teammates and backroom staff, but reserved his most heartfelt thanks to the club's loyal supporters. ""My final message is for the people who make Liverpool Football Club the greatest in the world -- the supporters. ""It has been a privilege to represent you, as a player and as captain. I have cherished every second of it and it is my sincere wish to finish this season and my Liverpool career on a high.""","Steven Gerrard to leave Liverpool at end of 2014-2015 season .

"(CNN)Al Qaeda militants freed six of their fighters from a southern Yemeni prison during an attack on the facility Friday, just one day after the group took over a military camp in the same province, security officials said. These attacks by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has long clashed with Yemen's military, happened in the Arab nation's Shabwa province, more than 100 miles to the east of the capital, which has been in political strife for weeks after minority Houthi rebels took over. Also Friday, at least three more nations announced they were temporarily closing their embassies in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa because of deteriorating security conditions, including neighboring Saudi Arabia. Three of the six militants freed in Friday's prison attack in Shabwa had been sentenced to death, provincial security officials said. Information about casualties, and details about how the attack transpired, weren't immediately available. A day earlier, AQAP took over a military camp at the Sabwa town of Baihan, about 110 miles east of Sanaa, after two hours of clashes with government troops, three local security officials said. This gave AQAP control of all of the camp's weaponry, the officials said. Before the clashes ended, the camp's commander called on tribal fighters to intervene. When those fighters arrived, a ceasefire was called so that the tribal fighters could help evacuate Yemeni troops -- including dozens of injured -- from the camp, a tribal leader said. Saudi Arabia, Germany and Italy said Friday they were suspending their embassy operations in Sanaa -- joining the United States and other nations that made similar moves earlier in the week. Saudi Arabia evacuated its staff because of deteriorating security conditions following a recent takeover of the Yemeni capital by Houthi rebels, the Saudi Foreign Ministry and two Yemeni Foreign Ministry officials said. One of the Yemeni officials said the Saudi evacuations happened Thursday. German Embassy officials left Yemen on Friday morning, Germany's Foreign Ministry said on Twitter. Italy's decision follows ""recent events in the country and the progressively deteriorating security conditions,"" a post by Italy's Foreign Ministry reads. The United States, along with Britain and France, said this week that they moved staffers out of their embassies because of instability in Yemen, after Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament and placed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi under house arrest last month. The Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country -- are now the preeminent power in Sanaa. But different groups there have resisted the Houthis' attempted takeover of national government institutions, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement. AQAP, a Sunni Muslim terror group, vowed to attack Houthi loyalists nationwide last year. The United States has had a long relationship with Yemen's leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants. It's not clear what the Houthis' takeover of Sanaa means for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, but the drone program there still appears to be active. A U,S. drone strike killed senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in Shabwa province on January 31. CNN's Alexander Felton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Three of six freed AQAP prisoners were facing death penalty .

"A 34-year-old man being sought in a woman's death has been arrested in connection with the killings of two homeless men who were shot three days apart while both were sleeping on sidewalks, Atlanta police said Friday. Aeman Lovel Presley was in custody, but police weren't providing further details about his arrest, said Sgt. Greg Lyon. Presley, of Atlanta, also was wanted by police in Decatur, Georgia, in the fatal shooting Saturday night of a 44-year-old woman whose body was found behind an office building, according to police and CNN affiliate WSB. An arrest warrant for Presley was issued in the Decatur case, Decatur police Sgt. Jennifer Ross said Friday. ""We are actively working with multiple agencies at this time and cannot provide any further information that may jeopardize ongoing investigations,"" Ross said. Karen Pearce, a hair stylist in Marietta, was shot shortly after she left a restaurant in downtown Decatur, the affiliate reported. True Salon, where Pearce worked, said on its Facebook page Friday that ""while we are relieved to hear that a suspect is in custody, we are still trying to comprehend this senseless act of violence that took a very special person from our lives."" Presley or his attorneys couldn't be immediately reached for comment Friday. Atlanta police called the shootings of homeless men ""sinister"" because whoever pulled the trigger wasn't expecting to gain from the victims monetarily. ""A lot of our shootings involve robbery. A lot of our shootings involve someone making good on an old debt or some kind of revenge factor,"" Atlanta police Detective David Quinn told reporters earlier this week. ""I don't know why someone would shoot two defenseless men."" The shootings happened during Thanksgiving week, within three days of each other. Three days, 3 miles apart . In the homeless men case, the first shooting took place November 23. Dorian Jenkins, 42, was fatally shot five times as he slept, wrapped in a blanket, on a sidewalk in downtown Atlanta. Less than three days later, Tommy Mims, 64, didn't show up as normal at a recycling center where he took cans and other scrap metals to sell. Mims, known locally as ""Can Man"" was found dead under a bridge where he usually slept. His body, also wrapped in a blanket, had seven gunshot wounds. He was killed less than three miles from Jenkins. ""They never came out of the sleep they were already in,"" Quinn said. ""They weren't fleeing, running. They were asleep when they took these rounds."" Telling details . Police say evidence links the killings of the homeless men. The rounds used in both shootings are fairly distinctive: .45-caliber bullets that, according to Quinn, haven't been made since 2010. They were fired from revolvers, either a Taurus ""Judge"" or a Smith & Wesson ""Governor."" That reveals another troubling fact. ""These guns have a capacity of five or six rounds,"" Quinn said. But Mims, the second victim, had been shot seven times. ""Someone had to reload the gun in order to get seven rounds in him.""","A man held in killing of two Atlanta homeless men is linked to third case .

"Janay Rice, wife of suspended NFL player Ray Rice, slammed the media Tuesday but stood by her husband. A day after his team fired him and the league suspended him for knocking her out during a fight, the football player's wife called the situation a nightmare. ""To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing,"" she wrote in an Instagram post. ""To take something away from the man I love that he has worked his ass off for all his life just to gain ratings is a horrific (sic)."" The Baltimore Ravens released Ray Rice on Monday after a video surfaced showing him punching his then-fiancee and dragging her limp body out of an Atlantic City casino elevator. He was originally suspended for two games over the February fight, a punishment that many considered too lenient. Rice was just weeks away from returning to the gridiron when the new video surfaced, spurring swift responses from the Ravens and the NFL that sent his professional football career grinding to halt. On Tuesday, his wife said she now feels like she's mourning the death of her closest friend. ""No one knows the pain that the media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family,"" she wrote. But she said her family will ""continue to grow & show the world what real love is."" ""THIS IS OUR LIFE!"" she wrote. ""What don't you all get."" Later Tuesday, Janay Rice defended her husband to ESPN. ""I love my husband. I support him,"" Janay Rice said, according to the network. ""I want people to respect our privacy in this family matter."" In response to texts sent to him on Tuesday, Ray Rice texted CNN sports journalist Rachel Nichols: ""I'm just holding strong for my wife and kid that's all I can do right now."" Criticism over NFL's response . The video posted by TMZ this week shows the couple inside the casino elevator. He punches her. She lunges at him. He hits her again, and she falls to the floor. In March, a grand jury indicted Ray Rice on a charge of third-degree aggravated assault, and a simple assault charge against Janay Rice was dropped. The couple were married the next day. Ray Rice pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and applied to a program for first-time offenders that could clear him of charges in as little as one year. The Ravens had stood by him throughout the fallout. And NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is coming under intense criticism for the way he's handled the case. Both the league and the team changed their tune swiftly after the video was released. To the disbelief of many, the NFL said it hadn't seen the surveillance footage of inside the elevator until TMZ Sports published it. Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti apologized to fans Tuesday. He said the team had tried to get surveillance video from the casino, police and prosecutors, but all three refused and the team eventually decided to wait until court proceedings ended before pursuing with its investigation. ""Seeing that video changed everything. We should have seen it earlier. We should have pursued our own investigation more vigorously,"" he said in a letter posted on the team's website. ""We didn't and we were wrong."" Goodell, in his first televised comments since suspending Rice, told CBS News that he came into the office Monday and was told about the new video. The league ""assumed that there was a video"" of what occurred in the elevator and the NFL asked for it, he said, but league officials were ""never granted that opportunity"" to see it. A new tape? There's no sound in the video posted by TMZ this week. However, The Associated Press reported Tuesday that the news organization has viewed a longer, ""higher-quality"" video with audio given to it by an anonymous source that shows the couple yelling obscenities at each other in the elevator. In the video AP viewed, she spits on him, and he punches her, the story said. ""Rice made no attempt to cover up the incident,"" the AP reported. After Janay Rice collapses, Ray Rice appears to pull her out of the elevator and is met by hotel staff, according to the AP. One of the staffers can be heard saying, ""She's drunk, right?"" and then, ""No cops."" Past comments on the case . In May, the couple spoke to reporters about the case in a press conference publicized by the team. ""I do deeply regret the role that I played in the incident that night,"" Janay Rice said. ""I love Ray, and I know that he will continue to prove himself to not only you all, but the community, and I know he will gain your respect back in due time,"" she said. Ray Rice said he was sorry to the Ravens owner, general manager and head coach. ""I also want to apologize to my fans, to the kids, everyone who's affected by the situation me and my wife are in,"" he said. One person he didn't apologize to that day? His wife. At a press conference in July, Ray Rice said his actions were ""inexcusable"" and that the two were in counseling.","Ray Rice texts CNN: 'I'm just holding strong for my wife and kid'

"Rick Santorum finished the Iowa Republican caucuses 34 votes ahead of Mitt Romney, but results from several precincts are missing and the full actual results may never be known, according to a final certified tally released Thursday by the Iowa GOP. The new numbers show 29,839 votes for Santorum and 29,805 votes for Romney, according to the party. The initial returns from Iowa gave Romney a razor-thin eight-vote margin of victory over Santorum, reinforcing the former Massachusetts governor's frontrunner status and giving him a major momentum boost heading into the New Hampshire primaries. Romney went on to win New Hampshire easily, seemingly making him the first non-incumbent Republican in modern history to win the first two contests of the cycle. Now history is being rewritten, casting a shadow over the first-in-the-nation caucuses and potentially shaking up the GOP race two days before the critical South Carolina primary. Santorum said on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" that the victory, while delayed, was sweet. ""We feel very, very good that we not only won, but that we .... pulled off a huge upset,"" the former Pennsylvania senator said in the interview to be broadcast later Thursday. Romney called Santorum after the revised result came out, according to both campaigns. However, they differed on whether Romney called to concede, as claimed by Santorum spokesman Hogan Gidley. A top Romney staffer disputed that any concession occurred, while campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said: ""Gov. Romney called Sen. Santorum to congratulate him on the Iowa results."" In the CNN interview, Santorum said he got an e-mail before 5 a.m. Thursday informing him of his 34-vote victory in the certified results. He also said his margin of victory would be higher if uncertified results from other precincts were included. ""Either way you tally it, we were successful.  And we feel very good about that,"" Santorum said, adding his campaign is working to ""continue that momentum and take it here to South Carolina now and off to Florida."" Eventually, he said, the Republican presidential race will narrow to a lone conservative contender against the more moderate Romney. Asked if he was disappointed that the Iowa results took so long to certify, possibly denying him momentum in last week's New Hampshire primary, Santorum said: ""I don't blame Iowa."" ""If you think about it, it moved from eight votes to 34.  Usually in an election, that kind of change is insignificant,"" he said. Gidley earlier told CNN that the revised result was ""exciting because the narrative for a long time has been that Mitt Romney was 2-0."" ""That's not the narrative anymore,"" Gidley said. ""There have been two states, two different victors."" Romney's eight-vote win was seen as ""a huge victory,"" Gidley said.  ""By that standard, I guess 34 votes is just about a landslide in Iowa."" While Santorum had a slight advantage in the certified tally, results from eight precincts were missing and will never be recovered -- a fact that leaves the question of who actually finished first in the caucuses unanswered. ""I congratulate Sen. Santorum and Gov. Romney on a hard-fought effort during the closest contest in caucus history,"" Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn said in a written statement.  ""Our goal throughout the certification process was to most accurately reflect and report how Iowans voted."" Romney said in a written statement Thursday morning that the new results show a ""virtual tie"" between the two candidates. ""The results from Iowa caucus night revealed a virtual tie,"" Romney said.  ""I would like to thank the Iowa Republican Party for their careful attention to the caucus process, and we once again recognize Rick Santorum for his strong performance in the state."" ""The Iowa caucuses, with record turnout, were a great start to defeating President Obama in Iowa and elsewhere in the general election,"" Romney added. One week after Iowa's January 3 caucuses, Romney won the New Hampshire primary with nearly 40% of primary votes. In that contest, Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, finished in fifth place with 9%. The South Carolina primary is scheduled for Saturday.  The Palmetto State has picked the winner of every GOP nomination fight since 1980.  Romney currently appears to be clinging to a dwindling lead there over former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. A Republican debate will be held Thursday night in Charleston, South Carolina. ""The bottom line is, it's really going to make a boost to our campaign today and remind people just that we've been able to tackle and take on Mitt Romney head-on,"" Gidley said. ""We are the alternative to him, and we plan on taking this into South Carolina and beyond and showing folks that we've got the message and the messenger that can beat the guy who's just writing checks, trying to buy a state."" Gidley said he can ""understand how the Romney campaign is out there trying to marginalize the victory. I can understand he doesn't want that narrative out there, but it's a big win for our campaign and we're really excited about it."" CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley said she doesn't believe the Iowa development will change the big picture for the prospective nominees. ""I think it does give Rick Santorum bragging rights,"" she said. ""Any time you can grab the headlines, that's a good thing.""

"Almost a year to the day after an off-road motorcyclist found the remains of a California family who had vanished from their home in 2010, authorities announced Friday they had arrested the man they believe is responsible for the deaths. Charles ""Chase"" Merritt is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Joseph and Summer McStay and their two small boys, San Bernardino County, California, District Attorney Michael Ramos told reporters at a news conference. Merritt, 57, was arrested Wednesday without incident in Chatsworth, California, Detective Chris Fisher said. Police say they believe the family died of ""blunt force trauma"" inside their home north of San Diego, but they declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive. Merritt, who was a business partner of Joseph McStay's, appeared in court Friday but his arraignment was postponed until Wednesday. No bail was set. In an earlier interview with CNN, Merritt said he received a phone call from Joseph McStay the night they disappeared, but didn't answer it because he was busy and tired. ""There are hundreds of scenarios,"" he told CNN at the time. ""I have gone over all of them in my head. Of course I regret not picking up the phone."" Friday, McStay's brother, Michael McStay, choked back tears in thanking investigators for their work on the case. ""You have no idea what this means,"" he said. 5 questions about the McStay case . Police who searched their home days after the family disappeared found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room, along with the family's two dogs. There were no signs of a struggle. Despite finding the family's SUV in San Ysidro, California -- where it had been towed from the Mexican border -- and video surveillance that showed a family matching the description of the McStays crossing the border, authorities had no clue what happened to them until the discovery of their bodies on November 11, 2013. A motorcyclist passing through the area found the remains in two shallow graves not far from Interstate 15 in San Bernardino County, more than 100 miles from the family's home north of San Diego. Authorities identified the remains using dental records. At the time, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said the killings appeared to be ""extremely orchestrated"" and carried out by more than one person. But after reviewing 4,500 pages of investigative records, executing 60 search warrants and conducting 200 interviews, investigators zeroed in on Merritt, concluding he had acted alone in killing the family in their own home, San Bernardino authorities said. He declined to say what specifically led them to that conclusion. Fisher did, however, say there was no evidence the family had traveled to Mexico after their disappearance, calling the border video ""unrelated"" to the case. ""We don't think it's them,"" he said. Ramos said he has not yet decided whether he will seek the death penalty in what he called a ""cold and callous murder of an entire family."" The disappearance of the McStays . Joseph McStay's mother credited investigators for their strength and determination to solve the case. ""I need justice from the law and the courts and to get to talk to the judge,"" she said. ""And most of all, justice upstairs for my lovely family.""","Charles ""Chase"" Merritt appears in court .

"Before he went missing, Johnathan Croom had developed an obsession with the movie ""Into the Wild,"" in which a young man leaves society to go live off the land. Unfortunately, both stories had tragic endings. The body of 18-year-old Croom turned up in rural Oregon on Monday, authorities say. It was 1,000 feet from his abandoned car, which officers found last week. They suspect no foul play and are investigating the death as a suicide, said Dwes Hutson, public information officer for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. ""John made us feel like he was OK, but he was really hurting inside,"" his father, David Croom, said Tuesday. ""It's really important that we pay real close attention to what our kids are saying and that we remind them that we love them, because there are influences in the world that tell them otherwise. ""John is loved by many. I appreciate all the help and what everyone has done. My instincts told me this could happen. I'm trying to be strong for my community."" In the movie based on Jon Krakauer's 1996 nonfiction book, a young man by the name of Chris McCandless disappears from society. Over the past six months, David Croom said, his son had shown a growing interest in the movie and possibly wanted to emulate McCandless' actions. ""He's been watching the movie a lot,"" Croom said before his son's body was found. ""Maybe he said, 'I want to do it.' That's our theory, because he kept talking about the movie."" Johnathan's green Honda CRV was found on a lonely road in the quiet country town of Riddle, Oregon, on Wednesday, two days after he was supposed to start college at Mesa Community College. ""We still don't know what happened,"" Croom said, ""but he was lost in the wild. He got in over his head, and things didn't go well."" He was last seen at a friend's home in Seattle, where he'd been visiting. His father assumed he was driving back to Arizona through Washington and Oregon before he went missing. The teen has been a main topic of conversation in Riddle, a logging and ranching community of about 1,300 with no traditional grocery store and no movie theater. People had been searching their property for him, said one resident, a longtime rancher who asked that he not be identified. ""There's nothing that makes sense,"" he said. What happened to him does not seem to square with what happened in the movie. Riddle is dozens of miles from the nearest wilderness area, residents say. ""It's 2½ miles from the major interstate; it's right in town in Riddle,"" Huston said of where Croom's car was found. ""There are houses and people, and it's well-populated, so if he wanted to do an 'Into the Wild,' it wasn't the appropriate place."" Krakauer's account of McCandless' life has taken on an almost cult status among countless free spirits who dream of shedding the trappings of modern life and living off the land. ""There were similarities,"" Croom said of his son's disappearance. In the book, McCandless cut off communication with his parents and traveled to Alaska, where he lived in a school bus before dying of starvation. Like McCandless, Johnathan Croom apparently traveled with very few belongings: perhaps a small backpack and his phone, his father said. Left behind in the Honda was the teen's ID card, plus a sweatshirt, blanket and jug of water, things someone might need to survive in the wilderness. Johnathan Croom's camping experience was limited at best, his father said, not much more than camping once or twice. Several reports describing travelers with an apparent interest in McCandless and the abandoned ""Magic Bus"" parked near Healy, Alaska, outside Denali National Park, have surfaced recently. In May, a police helicopter reportedly rescued three German men who had hiked into the wilderness looking for the bus. An Oklahoma teen inspired by the movie reportedly went missing in Oregon in March after telling his parents he wanted to ""live in the wild."" In 2010, a Swiss woman reportedly drowned in an Alaska river during her trek to visit the famous bus.","Law enforcement official says death is being investigated as a suicide .

"London, England (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's one-time media adviser said a 2002 intelligence document that claimed Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was not ""sexed up"" to exaggerate the case for war. Alastair Campbell was testifying Tuesday at the Iraq war inquiry, an independent set of hearings looking into the decisions that led up to the 2003 invasion and governed Britain's involvement in the war. The former spin doctor testified that his former boss was determined to disarm Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. But he said Blair had never been in a ""rush to war"" and that he regarded military action only as a last resort. The intelligence document in question came out in September 2002 and detailed the threat posed by Iraq. It is most famous for saying that Iraq could ""deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so."" The document came as Blair was finding fewer and fewer chances for a diplomatic solution on Iraq, and he had to convince the British public of the threat Saddam posed. Presenting the intelligence dossier to Parliament and the public was a way of engaging them in his decision-making, Campbell said. Campbell said he worked on the dossier with John Scarlett, the former head of MI6, the British foreign intelligence agency. Scarlett testified at the inquiry last month that it was he who wrote the dossier. ""At no time did I ever ask him to beef up (or) override any of the judgments that he had,"" Campbell said. ""At no point did anybody from the prime minister down say to anybody in the intelligence services, 'Look, you've got to sort of tailor it to fit this argument, that argument."" British media quickly highlighted the 45-minute claim; it filled the headlines of British newspapers the next day. But less than a year later, after coalition forces had entered Iraq, the media began to question it. In May 2003, a BBC report accused the government, and Campbell in particular, of pushing for the dossier to be ""sexed up"" to exaggerate the Iraqi threat. Campbell testified that it was intelligence officials who had the final say over any claims made in the dossier, and that Scarlett ""had the single pen"" for writing it. Testifying about the dossier last month, Scarlett said, ""There was absolutely no conscious intention to manipulate the language or to obfuscate or to create a misunderstanding as to what they might refer to."" Campbell also said he never pushed for changes to the intelligence claims. Of his numerous e-mails with Scarlett, Campbell said ""not a single word of them at any time sought to question, override, rewrite -- let alone the ghastly ""sexed up"" phrase -- the intelligence assessments in any way, at any time, on any level."" Campbell blamed the media for latching onto a single phrase and then discrediting the entire dossier once the phrase was unproven. He said the 45-minute claim ""was not that big a point"" within the overall document. ""I still defend every single word of the dossier, I defend every single part of the process,"" Campbell said. The 45-minute claim was not the only part of the dossier that inquiry members questioned Tuesday. They asked Campbell about the claim that the assessed intelligence has established ""beyond doubt"" that Saddam had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons despite United Nations resolutions. Blair's former spokesman said ""nobody"" at the time was saying Saddam did not have those weapons and that he did not pose a threat. But he also admitted such strong language may not have been necessary. ""Would it have been that weakened had those two words not been there? Probably not,"" Campbell said. In the first hour of his testimony, Campbell stressed that Blair sought disarmament of Saddam before any military action. He said Blair ""tried exhaustively to go down the diplomatic route,"" believing that conflict was not inevitable. ""Would someone like Tony Blair, from the day he went into politics, think that somebody like Saddam Hussein should be got rid of? Yes, he would. Was that the policy he was pursuing the whole way through? No,"" Campbell told the inquiry. ""He was trying to, through the (United Nations), lead the British government in the direction of pursuing a policy that would lead ultimately to disarmament of Saddam Hussein,"" Campbell said of Blair. Blair said in an interview last month that he would have removed Saddam even without evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The inquiry, which began hearings in late November, is the most thorough investigation yet into the decisions that led up to the war. It cannot find anyone criminally responsible, and it cannot even apportion blame, but inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict and identify lessons learned from Britain's involvement. Prime Minister Gordon Brown promised last year that the committee would have access to the full range of information about the war and the lead-up to it, including secret documents. Inquiry Chairman John Chilcot has said Blair will be called to testify, and Blair has said he will appear. Britain has held four other hearings about the Iraq war. But because all were held before the end of 2004 -- so close to the start of the war -- they were hampered by limited information, political analysts have said. The current inquiry has the greatest potential to tell the ""full story"" of the decisions leading up to war, analyst Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN in November.","Alistair Campbell managed the British government's case for war in Iraq .

"(CNN) --  A state-run Chinese newspaper expressed relief Monday that senior Japanese officials had dismissed the country's air force chief after he denied Japan's aggression before and during World War II. General Toshio Tamogami . Gen. Toshio Tamogami lost his job as chief of staff for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force, the Ministry of Defense said, after saying in an essay that ""it is certainly a false accusation to say that our country was an aggressor nation."" Japanese troops invaded China in 1937 and were widely accused of gross human rights abuses, including raping tens of thousands of girls and women and killing several hundred thousand others in what has come to be called ""The Rape of Nanking."" Imperial Japan also invaded several other Asian nations, leading to the death and misery for an untold number. Two former Japanese prime ministers have apologized for Japanese aggression before and during World War II. Yet China has long accused of elements within Japan of trying to whitewash the Japanese atrocities committed before and during World War II. ""The denial of the aggression history by Toshio Tamogami comes in as an element of disharmony,"" the state-run China Daily said a commentary Monday. ""Yet, as long as the Japanese government has a right attitude to this question, the smooth development of ties between the two neighbors will not be derailed by such discordant notes."" Tamogami's essay, published late last week, also stirred controversy in South Korea. Japan controlled Korea from 1910 to 1945. Its military is accused of forcing roughly 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, to serve as sex slaves -- they were known euphemistically as ""comfort women"" -- for soldiers in the Imperial Army. The South Korean foreign ministry criticized Tamogami's commentary in a statement published by Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. ""His claim is distorting history,"" the statement said. ""International friendly relations are based on repentance for past wrongdoings and learning a lesson from history,"" Tamogami's essay won first prize in a competition called the ""True Perspective of Modern and Contemporary History."" Several Japanese leaders have apologized in recent years for past Japanese aggression. In 2005, then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi apologized for his country's role in World War II on the 60th anniversary of the war's end. He vowed Japan would never again take ""the path to war."" Japan agreed to surrender on August 15, 1945, after U.S. planes dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The formal surrender was signed September 2. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama also expressed Tokyo's deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the damage and suffering it inflicted on its Asian neighbors. And in 2001, Koizumi apologized for Japanese treatment of Koreans during its occupation of the Korean peninsula during the first half of the 20th century. In a statement, Koizumi acknowledged the ""enormous damage"" inflicted by Japan's military ""by colonization and invasion"" during the conflict. ""We must take this historical fact of such very sincerely, and I would like to express keen remorse and heartfelt apologies,"" Koizumi said. ""I would like to also express our deep condolences to the victims inside and outside of Japan during World War II."" At the height of the conflict, much of southeast Asia, China and the Pacific islands were in Japanese hands.","Chief of Japan's air force dismissed for saying Japan was not aggressor in WWII .

"Nine months after synthetic marijuana destroyed a large portion of her brain, Emily Bauer did something her parents feared they'd never see: She went back to high school. Excited, nervous and terrified, the sophomore rolled through the hallways of Cy-Fair High School in Cypress, Texas, last week. Despite the familiar surroundings, Emily is living in a new world. She can't read or write. She is relearning basic addition and subtraction. A rotating cast of aides help Emily get through her school day. They wheel her from class to class, assist her in the restroom, help her eat, read class material to her and take notes for her, as she is partially blind. She attends school for half the day and goes to therapy in the afternoon. Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana . And the 17-year-old has a message for anyone who wants to try fake weed. ""The high is great, but in the long run, it isn't good,"" she said, describing her experience smoking synthetic weed. ""It's no fun to be stuck in a wheelchair, to have to go to therapy or (possibly) die."" But she prefers to focus on the stuff she can do, like getting a perfect score on her first world history quiz. For the fiery-haired student, simply being back at school is epic. Less than a year ago, in December 2012, Emily was on life support after several strokes left her paralyzed, blind and largely unaware of her surroundings. Her family has no doubt the drug that landed her in the hospital was synthetic marijuana. Her parents first believed she had only tried it a couple times. But they recently learned the extent of her use -- Emily told them she smoked it daily for the two weeks before she went to the hospital. Best known by the street names ""Spice"" or ""K2,"" fake weed is an herbal mixture sprayed with chemicals intended to create a high similar to smoking marijuana, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Advertised as a ""legal"" alternative to weed, it's often sold as incense or potpourri and in most states, it's anything but legal. Emily's stepfather, Tommy Bryant, told CNN last year that doctors diagnosed his daughter with vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. The vessels going into Emily's brain were constricting, limiting blood and oxygen flow. Emily is far from alone in her scary experience. Last week, three people in Colorado may have died after smoking the drug, according to state health officials. The Colorado Department of Public Health launched an investigation after 75 people were hospitalized in late August after using the substance. CNN first wrote about Emily in February, after learning about her story through iReport. A lot of people were quick to say then that marijuana should be legalized so drugs like these aren't on the market. Others  pointed out after the Colorado news that marijuana is legal in that state. Emily's stepfather, who has been in her life since she was born, is not interested in the debate. ""My focus is trying to get rid of this one bad product and not trying to substitute with anything else,"" said Bryant. Bryant and his family started an organization called Synthetic Awareness For Emily to educate families, as well as teachers and doctors, about the dangers and warning signs of synthetic marijuana use. He said his goal isn't to scare students -- he just wants them to be aware that this stuff is out there. ""I'm trying to get the kids to realize that one bad decision could lead to a lifetime of pain,"" Bryant said. ""Not just for them, but for their loved ones."" It's been a slow recovery. After months in the hospital, Emily's family had to operate a lift in their home to move Emily from the bed or from the chair. Now Emily can stand up and shift herself, so it's easier for her parents to transfer her on their own, her mother Tonya Bauer said. She can't walk, but she's been taking physical steps at therapy sessions. Special equipment supports her body so she can focus on moving her feet. Watch Emily learning to walk . Emily has difficulty lifting the front of her foot, also known as ""foot drop."" Her feet point straight down when she stands up, which puts her knees and hips out of alignment. The family has opted for a tendon-lengthening surgery in the near future. Her mother hopes the surgery will mean Emily will be able to walk again one day. As Emily recovers, she and her family try to find joy in doing small things. They go out to movies and ice cream here and there, and they even took Emily to a Drake concert a few weeks ago. Seeing Emily sing along and be a teenager again, along with watching the handicap bus whisk her off to school last week, are signs that Emily is feeling more like herself, said her parents. And here's more evidence: During her telephone interview with CNN, she sounded just like a typical 17-year-old girl. ""Our goal is to get Emily independent again so she can live on her own one day,"" said her mother. ""Having her go back to school has really made us see that this is possible.""","Emily Bauer nearly died after her family says she smoked synthetic marijuana .

"Dr. Mehmet Oz has been under fire recently for promoting weight loss products on TV's ""The Dr. Oz Show"" that aren't backed by a lot of scientific evidence. Now a study supporting one of those products, diet pills made with green coffee bean extract, has been withdrawn by its lead researchers. ""The sponsors of the study cannot assure the validity of the data so we, Joe Vinson and Bryan Burnham, are retracting the paper,"" the pair of scientists posted online. The small study, published in 2012 in the journal Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy, found that the main ingredient in green coffee beans helped human participants lose, on average, 18 pounds over 22 weeks. It was funded by Applied Food Sciences Inc. This year, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint (PDF) against the company, saying it paid researchers in India to conduct a trial on Green Coffee Antioxidant. The FTC says the study's unnamed lead investigator ""repeatedly: (1) altered the weights and other key measurements of the subjects; (2) changed the length of the trial; and (3) confused which subjects took either the placebo or GCA at various points during the trial."" In the complaint, the FTC says that Applied Food Sciences asked Vinson and Burnham to write up the India researcher's study results for publication but that the pair of scientists never reviewed the raw data, despite noting several discrepancies in the data sets they received. ""We retracted the paper because of an error in one of (the) data points on the BMI graph and because, as the FTC pointed out to us, there was inadequate disclosure of diet restrictions on the subjects and inadequate disclosure of the blinding procedures for the supplements given the subjects,"" Vinson and Burnham said in a joint statement Thursday. The researchers added that while they did not have the raw data collections, they did seek clarification from the India researcher on how the study was conducted and ""at no time did we suspect the data provided were fraudulent."" ""Applied Food Sciences knew or should have known that this botched study didn't prove anything,"" Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said after the company settled with the FTC in September. ""In publicizing the results, it helped fuel the green coffee phenomenon."" The FTC says Oz also played a role in promoting the diet pills. Oz was grilled by a Senate panel in June over the weight loss products being publicized on his show. ""In prior seasons, we covered Green Coffee Extract and its potential as a useful tool for weight loss,"" the show posted on its website this week. ""Recently the authors of the peer reviewed research paper on which our coverage had been partially based formally retracted their study. While this sometimes happens in scientific research, it indicates that further study is needed regarding any potential benefits of Green Coffee Extract.""","Small study says green coffee bean extract aids weight loss .

"In Illinois, African-Americans make up 15% of the population -- but account for 58% of the marijuana-possession arrests, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In Alabama, African-Americans make up less than 25% of the population -- but 60% of the marijuana-possession arrests, the ACLU says. And in Minnesota 31% of people arrested for marijuana possession are black, while African-Americans make up just 5% of the state's population, the organization adds. Those are just some of the statistics put forth by the ACLU in a new report that the organization says shows wide racial disparities in marijuana arrest rates nationwide. Using numbers it says come from FBI/Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data statistics and U.S. Census Data, the ACLU report tracks marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It concludes that the nationwide rate of marijuana-possession arrests for blacks is nearly four times greater than for whites, when arrest totals are compared with proportions of the population. And the ACLU says the findings show racial disparities in marijuana arrests have grown significantly over the past 10 years. Counting both juvenile and adult arrests, rates for whites have remained steady at about 192 arrests per 100,000 people. But the arrest rate for blacks rose from 537 per 100,000 in 2001 to 716 per 100,000 in 2010, according to the report, meaning that proportionately, blacks are 3.7 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana. DEA: Suburban mom by day, pot grower by night . According to the ACLU, the racial disparity may still be greater. The FBI/Uniform Crime Reporting Program arrest data does not distinguish between white and Latino arrests because it does not identify Latinos as a distinct racial group, meaning Latinos arrested for marijuana possession are counted with whites. Increasing arrest rates don't correlate to marijuana usage rates by race, according to data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2001-2012 cited in the ACLU report. Among 18-25 year olds -- a group with higher arrest rates than other age groups, according to the report -- more whites than blacks said they used marijuana in surveys every year between 2001 and 2010. In 2010, for example, 27.6% of African-Americans ages 18-25 and 33.4% of whites in the same age group said they had used marijuana in the previous 12 months. Joseph Occhipinti, executive director of the National Police Defense Foundation, says despite the numbers, the disparity in arrest rates isn't racially motivated. Occhipinti, who hadn't read the ACLU report but was familiar with it, said location and police intelligence were the main factors in marijuana arrests. ""Whenever we talk about drug enforcement, it's predicated by intelligence and reports of activity,"" he says, ""not race or ethnic group."" Occhipinti continues, ""These days police have close scrutiny, and the words 'racial profiling' scare most cops. They just want to do their jobs."" But Ezekiel Edwards, director of the ACLU Criminal Law Reform Project and one of the primary authors of the new report, argues that racial disparity in marijuana arrests only cause more problems for people of color. ""The aggressive policing of marijuana is time-consuming, costly, racially biased, and doesn't work,"" says Edwards. ""These arrests have a significant detrimental impact on people's lives, as well as on the communities in which they live."" The ACLU study estimates that combined, U.S. states spent over $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws in 2010, and there was one marijuana arrest every 37 seconds. According to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, ""Marijuana is a harmful drug and its use should be prevented and treated -- not promoted."" But Robert MacCoun, professor of public policy and law at the University of California at Berkeley, says arrests don't prevent marijuana use. ""These arrests rarely result in prosecution, and there is no basis for believing this is a deterrent,"" he told CNN. ""It's hard to see the purpose being served. The only use I can see is putting certain people, and in this case young black men, on notice. When you look at the statistical pattern, it's hard not to see this as racial profiling.""","The ACLU cites what it says are wide disparities in arrest rates for marijuana possession .

"At least 30 Palestinian youths were injured Friday in clashes in East Jerusalem, Palestinian medics said, as security was stepped up across the city amid concern that heightened tensions could flare into new violence. The latest clashes came hours after hospital officials confirmed that a second Israeli had died from injuries suffered when a Palestinian drove a van into pedestrians at a rail station in eastern Jerusalem on Wednesday. Friday's unrest broke out in the Shuafat Palestinian refugee camp in East Jerusalem, where the van driver lived, as well as in other neighborhoods, sources said. Smoke rose in the camp as Palestinian youths threw rocks, set off firecrackers and set tires afire, while Israeli security forces responded with rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas. Palestinian medical sources said they had treated injuries caused by rubber bullets hitting the head and body, as well as many cases of tear gas inhalation. Fierce clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian youths erupted in the same area Wednesday after news that the Palestinian van driver had been shot dead by police. He was identified by Israeli authorities as a member of the Islamist Hamas movement, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. A representative for Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center did not give details about the second van attack victim. But the Times of Israel said he was a 17-year-old student who had suffered serious head injuries. An Israeli border police officer also died and 12 other people were injured in the attack. No motive for the attack was immediately released, but Hamas supported the hitting of the Jerusalem pedestrians in a text message to the news media: ""Hamas blesses the action. What is happening in Jerusalem is pushing us to prepare for war."" Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld called the incident ""a terrorist attack."" Barricades near Old City . Against a backdrop of days of unrest over the Temple Mount, or Haram al-Sharif, Israeli police set up barricades early Friday at the Damascus Gate entrance to the Old City. But some restrictions were eased ahead of Friday prayers, with Israeli forces allowing men over age 35 and all women to enter the site to worship. Israeli police on Wednesday clashed with Palestinian youths at the holy site, leaving more than 15 people injured, according to paramedics with the Red Crescent. It was just the latest round of unrest there since activist Rabbi Yehuda Glick was shot and gravely wounded last week after championing more Jewish rights at the site, where Jews can now gather but not pray. Israeli police shot and killed a suspect in Glick's shooting. Soldiers injured in attack by vehicle . A second attack on pedestrians Wednesday in the West Bank injured three Israeli soldiers, who were taken to the Hadassah hospital. All three are in moderate condition, said Dr. Asher Salmon, the hospital's deputy head. A Palestinian turned himself in to Israeli authorities Thursday to say he was responsible for that incident, the Israeli military said. Though the motives weren't immediately clear, the incidents were the latest in a series of vehicles striking pedestrians in Israel and the West Bank as the long-taut tensions between Israelis and Palestinians worsened in recent months, agitated in part by killings and a seven-week Israeli-Gaza conflict earlier this year. On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. Palestinian state news reported that a 5-year-old girl died on October 19 after an Israeli settler deliberately ran over her as she returned home from kindergarten near a village to the north of Ramallah in the West Bank. Recent tension at the holy site . Some of the recent tension centers on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif and Glick, who has argued that Jews must have a place of worship there. Such a Jewish prayer right is a sensitive issue for Muslims, who suspect a plan to expel them from the site. Glick's October 29 shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in Jerusalem and prompted Israeli authorities to close the holy site for one day -- a move that a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called a ""declaration of war."" A spokesman for the military wing of Hamas said Wednesday that the site's al-Aqsa Mosque ""is the detonator needed to ignite a volcano in the face of the cowardly and treacherous occupier."" ""We salute the heroes of the mujahideen of Hamas,"" Abu Abiada said in a message posted on the military wing's website. Since Muslims began construction at the site in the seventh century, Haram al-Sharif, now controlled by an Islamic trust, has been an almost constant source of tension between Muslims and Jews. Jordan controlled the site for a time until 1967, when Israel seized eastern Jerusalem. Sacred events . With its golden dome overlooking Jerusalem, the site is said to have hosted sacred events in the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple Mount contains Mount Moriah, where Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch, is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under God's orders -- before an angel intervened. Later, Israeli King Solomon constructed the first Jewish temple on the mount, including the Holy of Holies, a room that kept the Ark of the Covenant. At the foot of the Temple Mount, the 62-foot-tall Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, stands. Once supporting the courtyard of the ancient temple, Jews gather there now to hold religious services, to pray or to slip notes into its cracks. For Muslims, the Noble Sanctuary contains one of the most sacred sites in Islam: the al-Aqsa Mosque. Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed was carried on a flying steed from Mecca to the site during his miraculous Night Journey, said Muqtedar Khan, an expert on Islam and politics at the University of Delaware. Gaza bombings . Meanwhile, in Gaza, several houses belonging to leaders of the Palestinian Fatah faction in Gaza have been the targets of bombings and were damaged, the Palestinian Authority said Friday. The explosions took place as Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah was due to visit Gaza, but the Palestinian government said that the trip had been postponed until further notice.","Palestinian medics: At least 30 Palestinian youths hurt in clashes in East Jerusalem .

"China is literally choking on itself. It uses as much coal as the rest of the world combined. The Beijing smog in January was so thick it could be seen clearly in space. And, most shockingly, China's bad air is said to kill nearly 700,000 people a year. To fight China's catastrophic air pollution, China's eco-warriors need to know where it's coming from. And big gains are being made on that front. After intense online public pressure last year, more than 80 cities in China have started to monitor and publish real-time data on the dangerous air pollutant PM 2.5. PM 2.5s are particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, small enough to penetrate and lodge deep into the lungs. Chinese environmentalist Ma Jun says the new rollout of PM 2.5 readings in China is the direct result of online people power. ""At the beginning of 2011, when the government revised its air quality standards, it stated in the first draft that PM 2.5 would not be monitored or disclosed,"" Ma said. ""And then people made such an outcry over the Internet, especially through the microblogs. Eventually, the government changed its policy by the end of the year."" Ma's book ""China's Water Crisis"" has been compared to Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring,"" the 1962 publication which exposed the effects of pesticides on the environment and since been named one of the top 25 science books of all time. A former journalist, Ma has become one of China's leading environmental watchdogs. It's his personal and professional mission to bring better air to the people of China. To do just that, he's using social technology as a force for change. Ma and his team at the Beijing-based non-profit Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) have launched a social media mapping program to name and shame China's biggest polluters. Called ""Take a picture to locate a polluter,"" the mission of the project is clear. Chinese netizens send pictures of suspected polluters to Ma and his team via the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo. IPE then fact-checks and uploads the data to its online map. IPE monitors 15,000 enterprises which are on a ""State Monitored Enterprises"" list published by the government. Ma says these enterprises are responsible for 65% of China's water and air pollution. With the help of Weibo users, IPE has now located nearly 4,000 of those enterprises on its digital map. ""The next step is a call for total transparency and the disclosure of all these major polluters in China so they will all be shown on a digital map,"" Ma said. Social protest in China has forced the government's hand to offer better air quality monitoring. Social mapping has expanded access to pollution data in a user-friendly way. But can social technology ultimately help clear the haze in China? Barbara Finamore, head of the Natural Resources Defense Council's China program in Beijing, helps the government develop its own blueprint for sustainability. She calls China's social activism an opportunity for Beijing. ""The rising tide of public outrage is an opportunity for the new leadership of China to get serious about pollution control, to strengthen the standards, to tighten enforcement, and to really establish a strong rule of law -- using the power of the public."" Christine Loh, the under secretary for the environment in Hong Kong, agrees that social media is an environmental game-changer: ""It's not good enough just to say, 'Hey, things are bad and here's the data.' So I think it's going to lead to a very fundamental change."" ""It forces people to be much better educated about pollution. And secondly, it will have an impact on the speed of change in government policies,"" Loh added. China's eco-warriors have said repeatedly the biggest hurdle to change is not a lack of money or even technology. China has the cash and the leadership in sustainable technology to roll out tools to green the country. The biggest challenge is the lack of motivation -- the lack of a strong enforcement of rules and regulations that should come from successful environmental lawsuits and litigation. Ma says his social tools will change that, forcing China's worst offenders to be accountable for their environmental practices. ""Their color (on the map) is going to change if they break the rules and regulations,"" says Ma. ""With that, we hope to break the protection by the local government for those polluters and also help people collect the evidence so they can file a lawsuit in a far easier way."" So give them the data. Have them argue about the benefits for change. And take a deep breath.","Chinese environmentalist enlists social media to fight pollution .

"A former U.S. soldier has been arrested and charged with illegally using a weapon on behalf of an al Qaeda-affiliated group in Syria. Eric Harroun, 30, of Phoenix was arrested Tuesday night by the FBI at a hotel near Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.  A Justice Department official tells CNN that FBI agents questioned Harroun at the hotel, then took him into custody. Harroun appeared Thursday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, and was charged in connection with his alleged use of a rocket-propelled grenade in Syria. The law used to charge him states, ""Any national of the United States who, without lawful authority, uses or threatens, attempts, or conspires to use a weapon of mass destruction outside of the U.S. shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or if death results, may be punished by death."" Harroun served with the U.S. Army from 2000 to 2003. He is not charged with targeting U.S. troops in Iraq. The organization he allegedly fought with, al-Nusra Front, is one of several aliases used by the al Qaeda in Iraq terrorist organization. The organization claims responsibility for nearly 600 terrorist attacks in Syria, the Justice Department said. An FBI affidavit says Harroun crossed into Syria in January 2013 and fought against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. He posted photos and videos of himself on the Internet handling RPGs and other weapons, it said. The Pentagon declined to comment on Harroun's arrest. However, ""It's always a concern when terrorist networks in that part of the world and elsewhere seek to recruit Americans, whether they're in the military or not,"" spokesman George Little told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""I don't think this is a widespread phenomenon, and most of our people in this country -- and certainly most men and women in the military -- would not consider joining a terrorist network,"" Little added.

"Last month, President Obama announced a new initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which aims to improve the life chances of young black men. It's an important effort designed to help one of American society's most vulnerable populations. Young black men are disproportionately likely to drop out of school, experience unemployment and come into contact with the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Experts disagree about the root causes of these problems, but few doubt that something needs to be done. One of the interventions Obama highlighted is called Becoming a Man, a Chicago-based program that aims to reduce teenagers' violent behavior by teaching them ""social-cognitive skills,"" such as self-control, conflict resolution and the ability to more accurately read the emotions and intentions of others. Many aggressive adolescents have short fuses, and they are quick to lash out at others unnecessarily. The program's hope is that by strengthening teenagers' self-control, they will become better at tamping down angry impulses and thinking through situations before acting. (Full disclosure: I am a member of a team of scientists, headed by researchers at the University of Chicago, who are evaluating Becoming a Man.) Intervening to help young black males develop better social-cognitive skills is important, but if the President's initiative is to be successful, transformations are needed in our social institutions as well. One of the most significant contributors to the difficulties that many black teenagers have is that those who have been convicted of crimes typically penetrate more deeply into the justice system than offenders from other ethnic groups. Black teenagers are not just more likely to be arrested, they also are more likely to be locked up, even when convicted of the same crimes as others.  Racial disparities are especially pronounced when it comes to punishment for relatively minor offenses, such as drug possession. For example, black juveniles are nearly twice as likely as their white peers to be locked up for a drug offense.  As a result of mandatory sentencing laws, courts don't have much discretion when it comes to sentencing people convicted of serious violent crimes, which makes sentencing less racially biased in these instances. Incarcerating a young black man seriously impedes his chances of making a successful life. Spending time in jail or prison disrupts schooling, which makes it hard to get a decent job. The unemployment that often follows release from incarceration has rippling effects, contributing to high rates of single parenthood (unemployed men are less likely to marry) and family instability in the black community (divorce rates are higher in families with unemployed fathers), increasing the likelihood that one generation's difficulties will be passed on to the next. It's a vicious cycle that needs to be broken. One way of breaking it is to stop locking people up who have broken the law but who don't present a genuine danger to the community. For several years, I co-directed one of the largest studies ever conducted of juvenile felons. We monitored more than 1,300 teenagers (all but about 200 of them males) who had been arrested for very serious crimes—like armed robbery or aggravated assault—in Philadelphia and Phoenix. We followed the sample for seven years, as they transitioned from adolescence into young adulthood. Our study reflected what many other studies of juvenile offenders have shown: Only about 10% of the youths we tracked continued their criminal ways beyond their early 20s. Crime is a young man's business—it requires the stamina, short-sightedness and recklessness of youth. What led the other 90% to stop offending? Mainly, it's just growing up and developing better self-control, largely due to the maturation of parts of the brain that are still developing in late adolescence. Incarceration had no impact on recidivism. After leaving prison and returning to the community, offenders who had been locked up were just as likely to commit another crime as were individuals who hadn't been incarcerated and who were put on probation and treated in the community. This has important economic implications for cities and states on tight budgets. Incarceration costs about four times as much as probation. Every time we unnecessarily lock someone up, we are wasting dollars that could be more profitably invested in education and crime prevention, or, at the very least, returned to taxpayers. Incarceration is problematic enough. Trying juveniles as adults—also disproportionately more common among black males—makes matters even worse. Juvenile offenders who are released from an adult jail or prison are more likely to commit another serious crime, and to do so sooner, than ones who had been sent to a juvenile facility. It's not hard to understand why: Adult prisons are schools for crime, where juveniles spend time with seasoned criminals. They are also scary places, where younger inmates are frequently assaulted and traumatized, which also makes them more likely to re-offend after being released. The irony, then, is that while programs like Becoming a Man can help black teenage boys succeed in school and stay out of trouble, treating those who break the law as if they already are men has just the opposite effect. If My Brother's Keeper is going to succeed, we can't just focus on ""fixing"" young black men. We need to fix the justice system, too.","Laurence Steinberg: Obama initiative to improve life chances of young black men is a start .

"Goat cafes, rabbit cafes, even loneliness-curing Moomin cafes. The world of the weird cafe has moved on from cats. And yet, while some of these obscure cafes grab headlines for a few days and then vanish, cat cafes have proliferated around the world, to become if not the most novel, certainly the most enduring craze when it comes to themed coffee houses. German philosopher Albert Schweitzer reportedly once said: ""The only escape from the miseries of life is music and cats."" And so it would appear. Started in Taiwan a dozen or so years ago with a cafe called Cat Flower Garden, the concept was most enthusiastically embraced in Japan where today there are more cat cafes than anywhere else in the world -- around 150 at the last count. Now the rest of the world is cat-ching on. In April the United States saw it's first feline coffee house open in New York, albeit only temporarily, London recently opened its first too and a number of major European cities now also offer purr-fect coffee breaks. Australia is soon to join the fray as well. ""My partner and I went to Japan 18 months ago -- going to a cat cafe was an amazing experience and we decided to open our own in Melbourne,"" says Anita Loughran, owner of Cat Cafe Melbourne, which will open in July 2014. ""It's a place where animal and cat lovers can mingle, socialize and be comfortable in a quiet environment that reflects their interests."" Cat cafe 101 . For the uninitiated a cat cafe doesn't sound too complicated. It's a regular cafe that happens to have cats walking, or lying, around. But there are nuances that distinguish this kind of cafe from others. You often need to book before you arrive, because a) the cats are liable to walk out as you walk in, and b) the ratio of people to cats needs to be controlled. ""We now have a booking system, because 20,000 people wanted to come into a 30-seat cafe all at the same time,"" says Lauren Pears, founder of Dinah's Cat Emporium in London. Her website says the cafe is fully booked until October 2014. Sanitation and health issues also need to be considered, and have put some people off. ""Who wants cat hair everywhere? That would gross me out,"" says Diana Mullin, a non-customer from Vancouver. But Loughran says there's nothing to worry about: ""As the cats are completely separate from the cafe, this is not an issue. And if people still have their concerns they should actually visit a cat cafe first. We would not be able to open if we weren't super hygienic."" Most cafes also have a look-but-don't-grab policy, to minimize catty stress and potential clawing of customers. Feline good . After all, the idea is that these cafes provide an almost therapeutic area to chill, as Café Neko owner Takako Ishimitsu in Vienna says. Though she advises any mother visiting the cafe check her pram before leaving: some of the cats can inadvertently turn stowaway, having sought out the warm softness of a baby carrier. Thomas Leidner, owner of the Cafe Katzentempel in Munich, says: ""The popularity of these cafes is probably due to the fact that many people are not allowed, or are disinclined to have pets in the city, yet they occasionally feel the need for closeness to an animal. ""Life today is busy and hectic, so offering an oasis of calm, where you can relax over a drink and enjoy (vegan) snacks, is important to us."" Pears agrees. ""I think a lot of our patrons just enjoy coming to play with them. We also find they tend to make conversation with other patrons. The cafe has a nice community feel to it."" ""What could be better than a black Americano, a good book, and a cat curled up beside you (even better if it's on your lap)?"" says Sandi from the UK, one of the trend's enthusiastic fans. ""Bliss! The only issue I have is struggling to leave."" And so the cat cafe continues to spread across the globe. Look out in the future for KitTea, due to open in San Francisco later this year, and Purringtons Cat Lounge in Oregon hoping to invite people in for a cup before the end of 2014.

"(CNN)It's a well driven path for the motoring male: as middle age approaches, thoughts turn to acquiring a shiny sports car as wives, female friends and relatives shake their heads with despair. Anyone who's ever been lured by the siren call of a powerful engine can take comfort in the fact that, though they may be consumed by automotive obsession, they have nothing on the Schlumpf brothers. Fritz and Hans Schlumpf made a fortune in textiles during the last century. When it came to spending it, Fritz's thoughts naturally turned to the sumptuous style and classic panache of the Bugatti sports car. Not just one Bugatti, not even two, but 122 of them, amassed in secret alongside hundreds of other rare and expensive cars in their textile mill warehouses between 1957 and 1976. The secret didn't last and the collection is now housed in what could well be the world's most fascinating car museum. The museum lies in the French provincial town of Mulhouse, a three-hour ride from Paris by France's fast TGV trains -- or, if it was possible to drive the full 480 kilometers at the car's top speed, just over an hour in a Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport. Known as the Cite de l'Automobile, or the French National Automobile Museumâ€”Schlumpf Collection, it's certainly the biggest Bugatti collection in the world. Among the vehicles is the absolute must-see of the Mulhouse collection: Bugatti founder Ettore Bugatti's personal car, the fabulous 1929 Type 41 Royale Coupe Napoleon. This imposing 6.4-meter, 3-ton black and blue chauffeur coupe has a massive 14.7-liter engine that produced 300 horsepower and could propel the car to 200 kilometers an hour (124 mph). It has an equally imposing value -- somewhere north of $15 million, based on past sales of other Bugatti Royales. Bugatti's challenge to Mercedes-Benz and Rolls-Royce . Ettore's son, Jean, who was killed in 1939 at the age of 30 while testing a Bugatti race car, designed the Napoleon, while the silver elephant mascot that graces its long bonnet was sculpted by Ettore's younger brother Rembrandt. Italian-born Ettore conceived the Royale as a vehicle that would supplant Rolls-Royce and Mercedes-Benz as the choice of European royalty. His dream foundered when the Great Depression killed the market for super-expensive luxury limousines. In the end only six Royales were built by Bugatti between 1929 and 1933 -- hence their astronomical value today. The museum has two examples, the Coupe Napoleon and the Limousine Park Ward, plus a 1990 replica known as the Royale Esders. Of the other four Royales, one is with the Volkswagen group -- which now owns the Bugatti brand, a couple are with U.S. museums and one is in private hands. A 1988 replica of the Coupe Napoleon sits in the Sinsheim Auto Museum in Germany. While Cite de l'Automobile is known as a Bugatti heaven, it caters to other interests. The current collection of 430-plus vehicles includes early French examples of the horseless carriage (Panhard-Levassor and De Dion-Bouton) through to early high-end limousines such as Isotta-Fraschini and Hispano-Suiza and classic prewar sports coupes such as the Alfa Romeo 8C 2900A Pinin Farina Berlinetta. An oddity is the 1942 Paul Arzens-designed aluminum and Plexiglass bubble car known as ""The Egg."" The postwar sports car lineup includes Ferrari, Maserati, Porsche, Gordini and an exceptional 1955 gullwing Mercedes-Benz 300 SL that was one of Fritz Schlumpf's drive cars. A section of the Mulhouse collection is devoted to a full grid of F1 racing cars, including the rear-engine Bugatti 251 racer that made its debut at the 1956 French Grand Prix. Naturally, there's also a modern Bugatti Veyron, housed in its own room. Secret treasure trove . Still, pride of place goes to the Royale Coupe Napoleon, which Ettore Bugatti used as his personal car until the family's financial difficulties forced his daughter L'Ebe to sell it in 1963. The ultimate buyers were the Schlumpf brothers. Just how the Schlumpfs acquired their massive collection of Bugattis and other cars is a story of obsession, deception and loss that puts ordinary midlife crises to shame. Using money from their textile business, former Bugatti racer Fritz snapped up every model of the car that came on the market, including in 1963 a 30-car collection from the U.S. auto enthusiast John Shakespeare that included a second Royale. By the late 1960s, Fritz decided he would put his secret treasure trove on public display. Over the next decade he began restoring and preparing the vehicles for showing. Then economic circumstances turned against the Schlumpfs as the European textile business began to decline in the face of cheaper Asian products. Having spent so much of their revenues on motoring masterpieces, their business began to falter. Encumbered by debt, the Schlumpf brothers sought exile in Switzerland, where they remained until they died -- Hans in 1989, followed by Fritz in 1992. The Schlumpfs' workers put the vehicles on show between 1977-79, until the French government made the collection a listed monument, ensuring it wouldn't be broken up or taken abroad. A consortium that included the local municipal authority was created to run the collection and in 1982 the museum officially opened. By court order, the words ""Schlumpf Collection"" were added to its name in 1989, in honor of the men whose hunger for horsepower may never be surpassed.

"Dr. Ben Carson's path to the White House begins by walking away from Fox News. On Friday, amid media reports about Carson's preparations to possibly run for president, Carson and Fox confirmed that his relationship with the cable news channel had been severed. From now on, when Carson appears on Fox, it'll be as a newsmaking guest, not as a paid contributor. Carson, formerly a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, signed up with Fox back in October 2013. Earlier that year, he had garnered attention for speeches at the National Prayer Breakfast, the Conservative Political Action Conference and elsewhere. While contributing to Fox programs, he openly flirted with the possibility of a presidential run in 2016. In September, he told the radio host Hugh Hewitt that the chances of a run were ""reasonably good,"" but that he was waiting for a ""few more months."" It's been a couple of months, at least. Earlier this week, The Washington Times (which publishes columns by Carson) reported that a flattering documentary about him, titled ""A Breath of Fresh Air: A New Prescription for America,"" is set to air this weekend in local markets across the country. ""A production company run by conservative personality Armstrong Williams filmed the documentary and is paying for the airtime,"" The Times reported. ""Mr. Williams is also Mr. Carson's business manager."" Soon after the hourlong ad telecasts were reported, Fox said Carson was no longer a contributor. Fox took similar action with two contributors, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, in the run-up to the 2012 election. Carson said in a statement Friday evening that ""at this time, no decision has been made to run for president."" ""However, recognizing the possibility, Fox News felt I needed complete independence to fully examine my options,"" he said. ""My departure has been thoroughly amicable and is in the best interest for both Fox News and myself."" Fox's own website quoted a GOP strategist, Tyler Harber, as saying, ""The man's running. He's been running for two years.""","Conservative parts ways with Fox News .

"For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the G20 summit in Australia didn't prove to be a very amicable occasion. Putin has found himself on the receiving end of a series of sharp verbal jabs from some of his fellow world leaders. The reason? Russia's interference in Ukraine. One of the bluntest rebukes came from Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. ""I guess I'll shake your hand,"" Harper told Putin on Saturday, according to aides of the Canadian leader. But he then quickly warned Putin, ""You need to get out of Ukraine."" U.S. President Barack Obama also voiced criticism of Moscow, saying in a speech that Russian aggression against Ukraine ""is a threat to the world."" Amid the strong words, the Russian government denied reports that Putin was going to leave the summit early. He departed on Sunday toward the end of the summit. He attended the final lunch, French news agency Agence France-Presse reported. Putin praised discussions as ""constructive,"" AFP said. Criticism over Crimea, MH17 . The pressure on Putin continued Sunday, with Obama and the leaders of Japan and Australia issuing a statement expressing opposition to ""Russia's purported annexation of Crimea and its actions to destabilize eastern Ukraine."" Western countries and the Ukrainian government in Kiev accuse Moscow of sending troops and military equipment into eastern Ukraine to help pro-Russian separatists fighting against government forces. Russian officials have persistently denied their military is involved. The statement also called for the prosecution of those responsible for downing Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine. The MH17 disaster, in which a passenger jet carrying 298 people was shot down over eastern Ukraine, is a particularly sensitive subject in Australia. The country lost 38 of its citizens and residents in the crash. Dutch say recovery of MH17 wreckage begins in eastern Ukraine . Cool reception . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had promised ahead of the G20 summit to confront Putin over the disaster and demand that Russia ""fully cooperate with the criminal investigation"" to find out who shot down the plane. Putin's standing in Australia was made clear by his reception when he arrived in the country Friday. The Russian leader stepped off his flight from Moscow to be greeted by Australia's deputy defense secretary, a junior minister in Abbott's cabinet. Standing nearby was a much bigger political personage, Australian Attorney-General George Brandis. But Brandis made no attempt to greet Putin. Not long afterward, however, Brandis was filmed enthusiastically welcoming German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping. When Abbott and Putin met at the event, they shook hands, exchanged a few words and smiled. Abbott said Sunday that he has ""some differences"" with the Russian government, but that he was happy to treat Putin ""with respect and courtesy"" as a guest in Australia. 'Ice Cold War' Meanwhile, the Saturday edition of a local newspaper, The Courier Mail, displayed a giant front page graphic of a Russian bear, complete with fur hat, matching up against a boxing kangaroo, above the headline ""Ice Cold War."" Inside, splashed across two pages, was quote after quote from Abbott, reportedly revealing details of his 20-minute conversation with Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Beijing earlier in the week. Abbott said he told Putin that he should stop trying to ""recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the Soviet Union,"" and he accused Russia of stepping up its aggression, which was part of a ""regrettable pattern."" Adding an extra edge to the atmosphere, Moscow deployed four naval warships near Australia in the lead-up to the G20 meetings, the semiofficial Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. One of the ships, the Varyag, was once named ""Red Ukraine."" The news agency said it was not uncommon for Russian warships to accompany the country's leaders on foreign trips. Warnings from West . The Ukraine crisis has led to a broader souring of relations between Russia and the West. Tensions inched up between Moscow and Washington this week following Russia's announcement Wednesday that it plans to send long-range bombers on flights to the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. government says no present security concerns warrant such maneuvers. British Prime Minister David Cameron warned Russia on Friday to change course over Ukraine. Otherwise, he said, ""The relationship that Britain has with Russia, that the European Union has with Russia, the relationship that I hope Australia has with Russia, will be very different."" Putin and Cameron met face-to-face in Brisbane on Saturday, and the Ukraine crisis ""dominated the conversation,"" according to a statement from the Kremlin. ""David Cameron expressed his views on the current state of affairs in the southeast of Ukraine, while Vladimir Putin provided extensive clarifications,"" the Russian statement explained diplomatically. Putin met with several other Western leaders, including Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. Obama said at a news conference Sunday that his interactions with Putin had been ""businesslike and blunt."" If Putin continues down the same path on Ukraine, Russia will continue to be isolated, Obama said. ""It is not our preference to see Russia isolated the way it is,"" he said. Putin blasts sanctions . The United States and European countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its involvement in Ukraine. Putin criticized those measures in comments Thursday to the Russian news agency TASS, saying they undermine ""the whole system of international economic relations."" ""They run counter to the very principle of G20 activities, and not only the activities of the G20 and its principles, they run counter to international law, because sanctions may be introduced only through the United Nations and its Security Council,"" Putin said. The G20's job is actually to focus on financial and economic matters. Ukraine is not officially on the agenda, but it has loomed large over the gathering, overshadowing Australia's plans for the meetings. Abbott tried to get the tough talk with Putin out of the way earlier in the week at APEC, in an attempt to keep the G20 focused on economic growth, said Michael Kofman, a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center. Australia ""did not want the summit ruined by the Russia issue,"" Kofman told CNN. ""But quite the opposite happened.""","Obama says his dealings with the Russian President were ""businesslike and blunt""

"(CNN) -- An Illinois man is suing the Vatican and Pope Benedict XVI for allegedly covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a Catholic school in Wisconsin. The lawsuit demands the Vatican release the names of thousands of Catholic priests that the suit says have ""credible allegations of sexual misconduct"" against them. The alleged victim, who is now an adult, says he was molested by Father Lawrence Murphy while a student at St. John's School for the Deaf, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""The defendant, [the] Holy See, has known about the widespread problem of childhood sexual abuse committed by its clergy for centuries, but has covered up that abuse and thereby perpetuated the abuse,"" the suit says. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, declined to comment on the case. Pope Benedict XVI was named as a defendant because he has the ultimate authority to remove priests and because of his involvement in reviewing sex abuse cases when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the suit says. ""There are a number of priests, brothers, and agents who defendant continued in ministry after defendant knew or suspected that those agents had molested children,"" the suit says. Suit alleges U.S., Mexican cardinals covered up abuse . Peter Isely, a director with the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), estimated the Vatican is investigating 4,000 cases of sex abuse by church employees. The lawsuit aims to change church policies and practices that conceal sex offenders, Isely said. ""It's going to protect children, we hope, around the world,"" he said, ""This is a historic day and hopefully this is going to result in historic changes."" Arthur Budzinski, a deaf man who said he was sexually assaulted and raped by Murphy, stood with Isely at a news conference Thursday. He said the priest ""may have stolen our bodies,"" but higher clerics such as cardinals, archbishops and the pope ""stole our voices."" He made his comments in sign language and his daughter, Gigi, interpreted his words. The now-deceased Murphy is believed to have molested up to 200 boys, Isely said . The lawsuit said the church ""knew that there was a high probability that these clerics would sexually molest more children, but sought to protect itself from scandal, sought to keep its income stream going, at the peril of children."" Murphy, it says, was a ""top fundraiser and recruiter"" for the church and the ""Holy See wanted to retain Murphy's services."" The same Minnesota law firm representing the Illinois plaintiff also filed suit Wednesday on behalf of a Mexican resident who says he was sexually abused by a priest. The suit alleges Catholic officials in Los Angeles, California, aided and abetted the abuse by moving the priest to different dioceses as allegations piled up against him. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Priest, now deceased, is believed to have molested up to 200 boys, victims advocate says .

"(CNN) -- One of the most successful hostage rescues of the modern era took place on July 4, 1976, when Israeli commandos stormed Entebbe Airport in Uganda to rescue dozens of Israeli hostages held there by a Palestinian terrorist group. In key ways the raid on Entebbe differed from the raid on Saturday in Yemen to free Luke Somers, the American photojournalist held hostage by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and that resulted in Somers' death. Jonathan Netanyahu (the older brother of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu) led the Entebbe raid. An officer who read Machiavelli to relax and an intense Israeli patriot, Netanyahu paid close attention to the smallest details of any operation he commanded. At the time of the Entebbe raid it was virtually unthinkable that a force would fly more than seven hours from Israel to Uganda to launch a rescue operation. Adding to the element of surprise, the Israeli commandos who landed at Entebbe airport wore Ugandan uniforms and the lead assault element drove the same type of Mercedes that was then driven by Ugandan generals. It took only a few minutes between the first Israeli transport plane landing at Entebbe and the commandos securing the hostages, but Netanyahu was mortally wounded in the assault. The seven terrorists and dozens of Ugandan soldiers were killed in the raid, as well as three hostages. 102 hostages were freed, by any measure a great success. Adm. Bill McRaven, the commander of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, published a book almost two decades ago, Spec Ops: Case Studies in Special Operations Warfare, which is regarded as the bible for how to best understand and plan special operations. For the book, McRaven interviewed the key participants in a number of Special Operations raids such as the Entebbe operation. After a careful examination of a number of raids McRaven identified some key principles that had made these operations a success: Speed, purpose and, of course, the critical element of surprise. -- Speed meant that ""relative superiority"" over the enemy needed to be achieved in the first few minutes of the attack, as it was at Entebbe, and that the entire mission should be completed in around half an hour. -- Purpose meant both that the operation was well understood by each of the soldiers involved -- ""release the hostages"" at Entebbe -- and that the soldiers were completely committed to the mission. -- Surprise meant catching the enemy entirely off guard, as had happened at Entebbe. With these principles in mind it's clear that the operation on Saturday in Yemen conducted by members of SEAL Team Six to free Somers lacked the crucial element of surprise, in particular, because two weeks ago a SEAL team had raided another location in Yemen in an unsuccessful bid to locate Somers, an operation that received widespread media coverage. On Saturday Somers was being held in a compound in southern Yemen by well-armed militants, which made a surprise approach difficult. The militants may have been alerted to the operation by a barking dog when American forces were still 100 yards away. Another account suggests that one of the militants was relieving himself outside and spotted the SEAL team and alerted his colleagues. Alerted to the SEALs' approach the hostage takers mortally wounded Somers and Pierre Korkie, a South African teacher, who they had also captured. Achieving the element of surprise was made particularly difficult by the failure of the previous Special Operations attempt. On November 25, U.S. Special Operations forces along with a Yemeni counterterrorism unit successfully freed eight foreign hostages in a raid on a location in Yemen where Somers was believed to be held. Unlike Saturday's operation, this raid did have the element of surprise, but it suffered from a lack of up-to-date intelligence. The militants had reportedly moved Somers to a new location days before the raid. This surely prepared the militants holding Somers for the possibility of another U.S. raid to free him. American Special Operations Forces have a mixed record when it comes to the tricky task of rescuing hostages held by well-armed terrorists. In July, a Special Operations team conducted a raid in the Syrian city of Raqqa in an attempt to free James Foley, a 40-year-old American journalist held by ISIS, as well as other westerners captured by the group. The Special Operations team flew modified Black Hawk helicopters deep into ISIS-held territory and according to American officials killed a ""good number"" of militants, but the western hostages had been recently moved. In another failed rescue attempt, Linda Norgrove, a 36-year-old British aid worker in Afghanistan, was killed when American commandos tried to free her from her Taliban captors on October 8, 2010. American forces arrived in helicopters in a remote area of eastern Afghanistan, but because of the remote location they lacked much of the element of surprise. In the ensuing firefight, a SEAL threw a fragmentation grenade killing Norgrove. The SEAL was later disciplined for throwing the grenade. U.S. Special Operations Forces have also successfully freed American hostages, particularly when they had up to date intelligence and maintained the element of surprise. On January 25, 2012, members of SEAL Team Six parachuted into Somalia and hiked two miles to a compound where Somali pirates held Jessica Buchanan, a 32 year-old American aid worker, and Poul Thisted her 60-year-old Danish co-worker. They surprised the pirates and freed Buchanan and Thisted. There's also the well-known case of the rescue of Capt. Richard Phillips whose ship the Alabama Maersk was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. Three U.S. Navy SEAL sharpshooters on a U.S. warship tracking the Alabama Maersk fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall, killing them all. The SEALs were able to generate surprise through astonishing sniping skills married to technology -- night vision scopes allowed them to shoot and kill the pirates in a matter of seconds and free Capt. Phillips unharmed. In another successful mission on September 7, 2005, the Army's Delta Force rescued Roy Hallums, an American contractor who was kidnapped in Baghdad in 2004 by armed men from a local kidnapping ring demanding a $12 million ransom. The Delta Force operators were pointed to the house where Hallums was held because of good intelligence from an Iraqi detainee and when they dropped onto the house from helicopters they found that the kidnappers had fled. Successful Special Operations missions require good intelligence and the element of surprise. Hostage rescues are particularly tough as they require not only reaching the target undetected, but also doing the operation in a manner that ensures the hostages' safety. Even the brilliant operation to release the hostages at Entebbe airport resulted in the deaths of three of the hostages. Some of the successful recent hostage rescues such as the operations that freed Buchanan and Thisted, Phillips, and Hallums were operations to free hostages held by criminal groups rather than by terrorists. As terrorist groups like al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS frequently engage in hostage taking, American special operators may increasingly find themselves confronting enemies who are better armed and trained and more willing to threaten the lives of hostages than is the case of ordinary criminal groups.","Raid to free American photojournalist Luke Somers resulted in his death .

"Knoxville, Tennessee (CNN)President Barack Obama's ambitious proposal to give millions of Americans more affordable access to a community college education and what he called a ""ticket to the middle class"" is unlikely to become law any time soon. His plan is to partner with states and fund the first two years of community college for Americans ""willing to work for it."" The White House will work to push this plan through Congress ""in the next few weeks,"" Obama promised. But with a roughly $60 billion price tag over the next 10 years, the proposal may have little chance of getting through the wall of Republican deficit hawks that now control both houses of Congress. Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, both Republican senators from Tennessee, joined Obama on Air Force One and at the community college during Obama's speech, but neither want Obama's plan to become federal law. That's despite the fact that Obama called his proposal bipartisan, noting that similar policies have been implemented by Tennessee's Republican governor and Chicago's Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Asked whether he would support Obama's proposal, Corker said ""Oh no, no, no, no, no,"" instead urging other states to take the president's initiative, and do something similar themselves rather than create ""a whole new bureaucratic federal program."" Sen. Alexander, chairman of the Senate's education committee and the former education secretary, echoed that in a statement on Friday saying states should follow Tennessee's lead. Obama's proposal, dubbed America's College Promise, wouldn't be the first broad-sweeping proposition that didn't get far in Washington, but --aided by a presidential push -- could still make inroads throughout the country by way of state and local initiatives. ""It's not necessarily all about bills and funding,"" said Maine's Sen. Angus King who serves on the Senate Budget Committee. ""Sometimes it's about the bully pulpit and raising the profile of an issue."" King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, pointed to the President's previous ambitious proposal for universal early childhood education in 2013. It hasn't produced results on Capitol Hill, but has spurred attempts to provide Pre-K education in King's state of Maine. And while Congress hasn't raised the federal minimum wage since Obama called for an increase during last year's State of the Union, dozens of states and municipalities have since passed laws to create a higher minimum wage on their own. ""Setting the national agenda is an important part of what the presidency is,"" King said. King said Obama is ""definitely in the target zone"" with his proposal, but said there would be a challenge to find the $60 billion, which he called ""a big number."" While he supports Obama's idea, King said he wouldn't endorse the proposal outright until he reviews the plan's funding mechanism, which remains a massive question mark. And King was thrilled to learn that Obama committed in his speech to working with Alexander on a bill King cosponsored that would shrink the size of the federal student aid application form, which has more than a hundred questions -- something college affordability advocates have pushed for in recent years. Federal funding for state programs . Obama's proposal would give states a huge break -- with the federal government picking up three-quarters of the cost of waiving community college tuition for the first two years, and leaving states to fund the rest. ""States would have to do their part too. For those willing to do the work and for states and local communities who want to be a part of it, it could be a game changer,"" Obama said. Emphasizing that there are ""no free rides in America,"" free tuition would be contingent on students getting good grades, enrolling at part-time and following through on earning their degree. Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters on Air Force One recognized that the $60 billion plan was a ""significant investment."" ""But it's one the president believes is worthwhile because we need to make sure that America's young people are getting the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy,"" Schultz said. The proposal and potential effects . Obama modeled the proposal on a Tennessee program started under Republican Gov. Bill Haslam a year ago. ""Why not just build on something that works?"" Obama said at Pellissippi State Community College on Friday. Haslam launched the Tennessee Promise, a program that covers the cost of tuition and fees of a certificate or degree at any of the state's community colleges after students already kick in whatever financial aid they can get. But higher education experts stress that the Tennessee program doesn't make a community college education ""free"" since students incur many other costs to attend college -- from living expenses to lost wages. Lauren Asher, President of The Institute for College Access & Success, said Obama's plan is different (and, she said, better) since it would waive tuition costs and let students use federal aid, like Pell Grants for the neediest students, go toward expenses other than tuition. And Obama's focus on community colleges was also a welcome message, just one of the many steps the administration has taken to address college access and affordability, Asher said. ""The President is rightly calling attention to the importance and value of community colleges and of education and training after high school,"" Asher said. ""What the President is proposing has the potential to help low-income students. Nicholas Wyman, CEO of the Institute for Workplace Skills and Innovation, a consulting firm, called Obama's focus on community colleges and skills-driven, vocational training a much-needed step to boost the U.S. economy. The number of job openings could halve the unemployment rate, but a massive gap between the skills of prospective employees and those in demand is holding the economy back. And by elevating community colleges, Obama is helping to destigmatize what many view as bottom-rung institutions. ""Companies want to employ people with strong academics, but they also want to employ people with strong workplace skills. A lot of the community colleges offer that and unfortunately a lot of the four year colleges don't,"" Wyman said. ""This is an opportunity to move the community college system into the 21st century."" Obama also hit on a note that is a focus of Wyman's consulting firm, addressing the need to connect community colleges and employers who could benefit from the neatly-tailored skills of a community college graduate. And even if Obama's proposal flops in Washington, Wyman, who has travelled around the country, asserted that states are ""hungry for reforms."" ""There's a lot of states who would look at this and often as you know states don't like being told what to do,"" Wyman said, and maybe they'll now take the initiative themselves.","Obama's plan would waive the first two years of community college tuition in states that pitch in 25% of costs .
That would still leave the federal government with $60 billion over 10 years .
Even though it's not likely to get through Congress, the proposal could still spur action at the state and local level ."
"With Adolf Hitler's WWII Bavarian mountain retreat set to undergo a multi-million dollar makeover, travel to the onetime lairs and luxury retreats of tyrants is in the spotlight. Many monuments built by megalomaniacs are open to the public. From Tito's nuclear bunker to Stalin's summer house to Mussolini's villa, autocrat hideouts have become tourist attractions. Does visiting places associated with ruthless dictatorships serve as a useful history lesson? Or is it a disservice to the memories of those who suffered under brutal regimes? It can be uncomfortable posing for pictures at places where the darkest events of the Third Reich were carried out. Yet the preservation of such sites also serves as an important reminder of historic atrocities. All of these places are easy enough to get to. Whether you actually want to go is another question ... Adolf Hitler: Eagle's Nest, Bavaria . This mountain retreat near the town of Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps was originally a place where Hitler could receive visiting dignitaries. The chalet is reached via a 124-meter elevator drilled into the mountain. On the same mountain, a backup Nazi command base -- the Berghof -- was destroyed by Allied bombing. The Eagle's Nest (Kehlsteinhaus, in German), however, is still open as a restaurant and information center -- and a $22.5 million upgrade has recently been announced.

He wanted the property, about 55 kilometers from central Paris, to top the Palace of Versailles -- which had hated royal associations.

"It may now be Albania's liveliest neighborhood, but a little over two decades ago it wasn't even on the map. A tight-knit grid of nightspots and restaurants in the middle of capital city Tirana, the district has become an emblem of Albania's slow lurch away from economic ruin. New bars appear almost daily and at weekends streets and sidewalks are packed with locals and tourists looking for a big night out. Few places, if any, have undergone such a dramatic facelift. At the end of the '80s Albania, under the totalitarian regime of Enver Hoxha, was one of the planet's most isolated states. No one was allowed to travel outside the country and thousands were held in secret gulags. Beards were banned, as were the religions they were thought to represent. The Block ('Ish-Blloku' in Albanian) was Hoxha's refuge. Armed guards stood on every street corner and ordinary citizens were kept out. On most maps the Block was unmarked. ""If you could compare it, Albania was like North Korea is today,"" says Enno Bozdo, Tirana's deputy mayor. Rainbow revolution . At the center of it all sat Hoxha's private villa, a squarish, peach-colored mansion surrounded by palm-lined gardens and fountains. The Block was a silent stronghold of Albania's elite. But when the regime were routed in 1992 elections, the Block sprang into life as Tirana's mayor urged inhabitants to grab the first paint pot they could find and soak the city's gray walls in color. Around the Block, entire towers now display the bright greens, purples and pinks of this rainbow revolution. At street level too, the neighborhood is almost unrecognizable. Dozens of cafes, bars and restaurants have made it Tirana's premier nightspot. Everywhere there are references to the West -- especially the U.S., whose brand of free-market capitalism Albania has adopted with varying degrees of success. One example is Duff, a diner inspired by Homer Simpson's drink of choice, where Yankees caps and varsity pennants line the walls and skinny-jeaned Tiranans play table football. After living in Connecticut for three years, owner Ledion Ilo wanted to return to Albania and build something from scratch. The Block was his perfect opportunity. ""This was all different,"" he says. ""It was all gardens, you couldn't go in. It was Albania's internal border."" Ilo and his brother built everything, from chairs and tables to a giant screen for sports made from dust sheets and wooden pallets. On big nights tables are booked in advance, even for drinks. Duff just ran its first beer pong tournament: 28 teams competed. Elsewhere there are open-plan outdoor clubs where foreigners dance to thumping house music until the early hours. There are coffee shops where the staff call themselves baristas and care a little too much about coffee beans. Almost all of The Block's venue's names are in English, a detail that irks some locals. ""English is a way to look trendy,"" says Rudina Hoxha, a journalist. ""Youngsters say phrases like, 'it's nice to be in love' and 'you're sexy' in English. It's a bit stupid. We seem to prefer the Western world more than our own country at times."" Others gripe that The Block's meteoric change has gentrified it beyond the means of most locals. Rents in the city are usually pegged at about $250 per month. In the Block it's twice that. Drinks are still pretty cheap by Western standards at about $1.50 for a local beer, and dinner in most places costs roughly 600 Albanian lek, or $6. In a city where the average monthly salary is around $450, however, it's enough to price most out of the neighborhood. That's partially because Albania's huge diaspora, many of whom fled when communism gave way to rampant crime and corruption in the early '90s, has begun to return. Kris is an 19-year-old American whose family returned to Tirana from Michigan last year. Pristine beaches . ""I like it here,"" she says. ""People here are used to drinking a bit more so they don't really go over the limit. It's strange that The Block is where all the communist leaders lived -- it's a little ironic."" Foreigners, too, are beginning to erase Albania's well-worn ""best-kept-secret"" label. In 2007 a shade more than a million people visited the country. By 2011 that had climbed to more than 2.7 million. Tourism now accounts for 11% of Albania's GDP thanks partially to its stunning, mountain-studded landscapes and pristine beaches. The country is also one of Europe's sunniest. ""We wanted to see Albania because not many people back home know anything,"" says Alexei, a French backpacker cycling to Istanbul through the Balkans. ""Here we can still discover. It's great: the people are young and nice."" Bozdo is glad that today's generation, local or not, knows little of The Block's past and its former denizens. ""It's impossible to understand what that regime was like without living in it anyway,"" he says. Some aspects of The Block's regeneration give him cause for concern -- notably Hoxha's old villa, which is scheduled to open as a museum this year. ""Unfortunately there has been a surge in the myth of the dictator recently,"" he adds. ""It could be fancy to have the villa used to tell people what happened here before the '90s, but you run the risk of making it a cult and keeping that myth alive.""

"The cost of fighting climate change will only climb if industrialized nations don't take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations' panel on the matter warned Sunday in its wrap-up report. In its ""synthesis report,"" the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the hundreds of authors involved in the study were even more certain than before that the planet is warming and humans are the cause. ""If left unchecked, climate change will increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,"" the report said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters that action must come soon. ""Leaders must act. Time is not on our side,"" he said. The report said there are solutions to keeping the rise in temperatures from crossing a 2-degree Celsius increase, the goal of many governments. ""It is technically feasible to transition to a low-carbon economy,"" said Youba Sokona, the co-chairman of IPCC Working Group III. ""But what is lacking are appropriate policies and institutions. The longer we wait to take action, the more it will cost to adapt and mitigate climate change."" Previously the group has said that about half of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age has been produced since 1990. On the current path, global average temperatures could go up anywhere from 3.7 to 4.8 degrees C (6.7 to 8.6 F) over pre-industrial levels by 2100. According to the IPCC, to stay below a 2-degree C increase, greenhouse gas emissions need to fall as much as 70% around the world by 2050 and to zero by 2100. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the report is ""another canary in the coal mine"" and added that ""ambitious, decisive and immediate action"" is needed. ""We have that opportunity, and the choice is in our hands,"" R. K. Pachauri, chairman of the group, said in the report. John Coleman, a weather forecaster and a founder of the Weather Channel, said climate change is ""not happening."" ""There is no significant man-made global warming now. There hasn't been any in the past, and there's no reason to expect any in the future,"" Coleman told CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Coleman said governments pay scientists to study the issue and researchers reach expected conclusions in order to continue to receive funding. Therefore the large percentage of climate scientists who agree there is climate change is a ""manipulated figure,"" he said. ""They don't have any choice,"" added Coleman, who said he is a skeptic, not a denier. ""If you're going to get the money, you have got to support their position."" But David Kenny, CEO of the Weather Channel, said Coleman's opinion is at odds with the channel's stance, which he said has been ""unwavering"" since 2007.  The Weather Channel's statement says that the Earth is indeed warming and cites ""strong evidence that the majority of the warming over the past century is a result of human activities."" Weather Channel distances itself from a founder . ""The science is really clear, and I don't like our brand being associated with something that's not scientifically based,"" Kenny told ""Reliable Sources,"" adding that Coleman hasn't been associated with the channel in decades. The chief scientist at the United Kingdom's Met Office said the IPCC report gives governments the science to help make policy decisions. Julia Slingo added that supercomputing will also advance the science. ""By doing this we can provide a solid evidence base to ensure UK investment decisions, and our future prosperity, remain resilient to future climate risk,"" she said in a written statement. The report didn't estimate a price for global changes. ""The Synthesis Report finds that mitigation cost estimates vary, but that global economic growth would not be strongly affected,"" it said. Ban said it is a myth that fixing climate change will be expensive. Inaction will have large financial and societal costs, he said. He pointed to renewable energy and increased efficiency as two ways to address the issue. The IPCC said the report is based on 30,000 scientific papers studied by about 830 authors and 2,000 reviewers. The reports from the IPCC are aimed at guiding world leaders as the United Nations attempts to work out a new treaty to limit emissions. Paris will host the next major international climate summit, scheduled to start November 30, 2015. Previous rounds of talks have been strained by disputes between the biggest emitters -- China, the United States and European countries -- and poorer countries whose populations could see the worst impacts first.","U.N.

"(CNN)What does one buy a woman who's worth an estimated $500 million and reportedly owns a sixth of the planet's land surface? Tip -- make it something equine related. Given her well-known love of horses, it's perhaps fitting -- some might say unimaginative -- that the majority of gifts presented to Queen Elizabeth II from world leaders last year revolved her favorite four-legged animals. Dog lovers look away now -- Her Majesty's iconic pet corgis didn't even get a look in. Included in the 2014 list of gifts was a mounted sculpture of a white horse from France's President Francois Hollande; a bronze sculpture of a horse's head from the Emir of Qatar; and another bronze statuette of the famous Irish thoroughbred, Arkle from the President of Ireland, Michael Higgins, along with a book of the same name. A dressage crop from the governor general of Canada, David Johnston, and a boot scraper from Felsted School in the east of England can also be put to good use at Her Majesty's stud farm on the royal Sandringham Estate. Among the more peculiar gifts given to the Queen was a miniature seven-inch throne from the ""Game of Thrones"" TV series, during a visit to Northern Ireland in June. However, it's far from the most outlandish present bestowed upon the monarch. During her 62-year-long reign, the Queen has received a jaguar from Brazil, two giant turtles from the Seychelles, an elephant from Cameroon, and several horses -- most notably a beloved black mare called ""Burmese"" from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Indeed, the Queen rode ""Burmese"" at the traditional Trooping the Color parade for 18 consecutive years, and in 2005 unveiled a bronze statue of herself atop the horse outside the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Canada. But what happens to the many gifts Her Majesty receives throughout the year that aren't to her taste? Live animals are donated to London Zoo, perishable items such as food and flowers are given to local hospices, and all other presents which don't go on display in the royal residencies are stored at the Royal Archive at Windsor Castle, a Clarence House spokesperson told CNN. Some items are even loaned to galleries, such as a Maori canoe given by the New Zealand government which is now on display at the British Museum. When it comes to royal presents, the Queen's great-grandson Prince George recorded the largest haul in 2014. During a tour of Australia and New Zealand with his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the toddler received a surfboard, skateboard, possum skin cloak, and more soft toys than other children would get in a lifetime of Christmases. Fittingly, the previous year Prince George also received a teddy wearing the same silk jacket as those worn by the Queen's jockeys, from promotional group Great British Racing. Will the young prince also inherit a love of horse racing passed down through the centuries? Indeed, legend has it Queen Victoria became so excited while watching a race at Ascot one time, that she broke the window of the Royal Box in a rush to see the finish. Queen Elizabeth II was more contained than her great great grandmother -- though still visibly delighted -- when her own horse ""Estimate"" won Britain's prestigious Gold Cup race in 2013. So what would one buy for the horse racing-mad monarch, that hasn't been bought before? ""The ultimate gift would be a 'nomination' to Galileo or Frankel, the two most expensive stallions in the world,"" said Nick Attenborough from Great British Racing, of the chance to mate a mare with some of the most prized stallions on the planet. ""A mare mating with Frankel, including a live foal guarantee, would cost someone £125,000 ($187,000)."" At that price, it's a gift fit for a Queen. Feature: Queen's horseman tames... zebra?

"Beijing (CNN)In a historic climate change deal, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced both countries will curb their greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades. Under the agreement, the United States would cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26% to 28% before 2025. China would peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and will also aim to get 20% of its energy from zero-carbon emission sources by the same year. ""As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change,"" Obama said Wednesday in a joint news conference with Xi. The announcement marks the first time China has agreed to peak its carbon emissions, according to the White House. Xi is calling for ""an energy revolution"" that would include broad economic reforms addressing air pollution. Obama, who was in Beijing for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, said he hopes the deal will spur other nations to tackle climate change. ""We hope to encourage all major economies to be ambitious -- all countries, developing and developed -- to work across some of the old divides, so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement next year,"" Obama said. Xi said both sides were committed to working toward the goals before the U.N. Climate Conference in Paris next year. Colorful summit ends with rare news conference . The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions said the joint announcement is ""an extremely hopeful sign"" and will help get other countries on board. ""For too long it's been too easy for both the United States and China to hide behind one another,"" said the center's president, Bob Perciasepe. ""People on both sides pointed to weak action abroad to delay action at home. This announcement hopefully puts those excuses behind us. We'll only avert the worst risks of climate change by acting together."" The announcement could put climate change back on the G20 agenda, said researcher David Holmes of Monash University in Australia. ""The announcement may mean climate will have to be higher on the G20 agenda despite host nation Australia trying to keep it off altogether,"" Holmes said. ""As an economic meeting, it cannot afford to ignore the restructuring of energy markets and productive capacity that will be needed to accommodate these very ambitious cuts."" The goals laid out by Obama and Xi were not as ambitious as some hoped, said Lo Sze Ping, CEO of the World Wildlife Fund Beijing. But ""what's important is that both these two large emitters are taking the responsibility to act and work together to resolve the problem, not the numbers or targets themselves,"" he said. U.S.-China relations: Can teens succeed where presidents have failed? The White House said the ultimate target is to ""achieve deep economy-wide reductions on the order of 80% by 2050."" A senior Obama administration official said the goals are ""ambitious and achievable"" -- but U.S. domestic politics could be a challenge. The official said ""leading climate deniers"" in the Republican party might try to stop the initiative. The official hinted that Obama could act alone if necessary. ""Congress may try to stop us, but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have,"" the official said. ""This is really the crusade of a narrow group of people who are politically motivated and have made this a cause celebre, but we believe we will be successful."" The Obama administration hopes to sell the plan back home by touting the anticipated savings on energy costs. The plan offers initiatives and incentives to develop more solar and wind power in both countries, the official said. ""Consumers and businesses will save literally billions of dollars,"" a senior administration official said. But the Senate's top Republican said the climate change deal will hurt the U.S. economy. ""Our economy can't take the President's ideological war on coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell said in a statement. ""This unrealistic plan, that the President would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs."" 24 hours with President Obama in China . China has agreed to provide another 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other zero emission generation capacity by 2030. That amount of zero-emission output exceeds all the coal-fired power plants that exist in China today and is close to total current electricity generation capacity in the United States. A senior Obama administration official said that historically, the United States and China have often been seen as antagonists, so the climate change deal ""should send a powerful message,"" and ""will usher in a new day, where the U.S. and China can work as partners."" During Obama's visit to Beijing, the Chinese government closed factories and gave employees time off to reduce car traffic and emissions in Beijing. The reduction of smog and the appearance of blue skies was noted by media throughout the APEC summit. Top Senate Republicans slam climate deal . As well as the historic climate change deal, Obama and Xi also agreed on the importance of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, cybersecurity, strengthening military relations and increasing trade. ""China is firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Xi said. Both sides also agreed to an extension of the validity of short- term business and tourist visas from one to 10 years, and of student visas from one year to five years. ""This arrangement will facilitate the travel of millions of U.S. and Chinese citizens, furthering the trade, cultural, and people-to-people ties that form the foundation of our bilateral relationship,"" the White House said. CNN's Matt Hoye reported from Beijing; Holly Yan reported from Atlanta. CNN's Hilary Whiteman, Dana Bash and Katie Hunt contributed to this report.","Under the deal, the U.S. will cut carbon emissions by more than 25% by 2025 .

"When assuming office, every government official must take an oath to abide by and uphold our Constitution. Since 2010, I have made that my mission in Congress. Unfortunately, the Obama administration is not upholding nor abiding by the Constitution -- in fact, this administration is going to great lengths to continually violate it. Its most recent transgression involves the use of domestic drones. These small drones are to be used as a crime fighting tool for law enforcement officials. But is unwarranted and constant surveillance by an aerial eye of Big Government the answer? In a memorandum issued by President Barack Obama's secretary of the Air Force, the stated purpose of these drones is ""balancing ... obtaining intelligence information ... and protecting individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution."" However, flying over our homes, farms, ranches and businesses and spying on us while we conduct our everyday lives is not an example of protecting our rights. It is an example of violating them. The domestic use of drones to spy on Americans clearly violates the Fourth Amendment and limits our rights to personal privacy. I do not want a drone hovering over my house, taking photos of whether I separate my recyclables from my garbage. Poll: Don't use drones for speeding tickets . When I have friends over for a barbecue, the government drone is not on the invitation list. I do not want a drone monitoring where I go, what I do and for how long I do whatever it is that I'm doing. I do not want a nanny state watching over my every move. We should not be treated like criminals or terrorists while we are simply conducting our everyday lives. We should not have our rights infringed upon by unwarranted police-state tactics. I have introduced legislation into the Senate that restates the Constitution. This bill protects individual privacy against unwarranted governmental intrusion through the use of these drones. The Preserving Freedom from Unwarranted Surveillance Act of 2012 will protect Americans' personal privacy by forcing the government to honor our Fourth Amendment rights. I want to make it clear that I am not arguing against the use of technology. But like other tools used to collect information in law enforcement, a warrant needs to be issued to use drones domestically. The police force should have the power to collect intelligence; however, I believe they must go through a judge and request a warrant to do so. The judicial branch must have some authority over drones, as they do with other law enforcement tools. My bill will restate the Fourth Amendment and protect American's privacy by forcing police officials to obtain a warrant before using domestic drones. There are some exceptions within this bill, such as the patrol of our national borders, when immediate action is needed to prevent ""imminent danger to life,"" and when we are under a high risk of a terrorist attack. Otherwise, the government must have probable cause that led them to ask for a warrant before the use of drones is permitted. If the warrant is not obtained, this act would allow any person to sue the government. This act also specifies that no evidence obtained or collected in violation of this act can be admissible as evidence in a criminal, civil or regulatory action. Allowing domestic drones to act as spies for the government is a complete violation of our basic right to personal privacy. Unrestricted drone surveillance conjures up images reminiscent of Orwell's ""1984"" -- a totalitarian police-state. According to the Fourth Amendment, ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."" I am sure our police force had good intentions with their suggested drone policies, but do they understand the consequences? Do they realize that they are allowing the government to act as the eye in the sky? By infringing upon our rights and watching over our every move, the government is not going to protect us, but they will push us one more step closer to completely losing our Fourth Amendment rights. My bill will protect individual privacy against governmental intrusion by these drones and establish a balance by requiring judicial action and allowing protection in court. I am confident that my colleagues in the Senate will agree with this bill. Each and every one of us took the same oath to abide by and uphold our Constitution.

"Pierre Korkie, the South African man who was killed during a U.S. Special Operations Forces raid in Yemen on Friday, was a ""respected teacher"" who served the poor, according to videos made by his widow before his death. In the videos, posted by the nongovernmental organization Gift of the Givers, Yolande Korkie pleaded for the release of her husband. He was an ""innocent man, a respected teacher,"" she said in one.

"So, Mark Zuckerberg apparently speaks Mandarin. The Facebook founder posted a video this week of himself participating in a 30-minute question-and-answer session, mostly in Chinese, at Beijing's Tsinghua University. And online writers -- especially the tech bloggers -- just freaking love this story. General reaction: Like OMG! Zuck speaks another language?! ""The crowd gasped and applauded as soon as he started speaking, and the good vibes appeared to last throughout the chat,"" wrote Marcus Wohlsen at Wired. ""Out of nowhere, Mark Zuckerberg now speaks Mandarin,"" declared BuzzFeed. ""Mark Zuckerberg just did a Q&A. In Chinese. In China. And slayed the crowd,"" wrote Greg Baumann, editor in chief of the Silicon Valley Business Journal. The underlying assumption in all of this coverage is that it is insanely surprising that the kid genius CEO of a $204 billion company can maneuver in a non-English language. Particularly a difficult one like Mandarin, which he speaks, according to Foreign Policy's Isaac Stone Fish, ""like an articulate 7-year-old with a mouth full of marbles."" This shouldn't be surprising. Zuckerberg is a smart guy. He's known to take on yearly self-improvement challenges (2010, Mandarin; 2011, eat only animals he personally killed; 2013, meet someone new each day, according to Bloomberg Businessweek). His wife, Priscilla Chan, is Chinese-American, and he said he's been learning Mandarin partly to be able to better communicate with some of his in-laws. Plus, China. It's home to the world's largest population of Internet users (632 million). And it blocks Facebook. A little ""charm offensive"" couldn't hurt. Then just think about the situation in reverse: Would anyone be shocked if the head of a foreign tech company -- try LG, Samsung, Sony or, in China, Lenovo -- showed up for a public speaking engagement in America and (gasp!!) spoke English? Of course not. We'd eye-roll if they didn't. That's because we Americans expect everyone to speak our language -- and rarely make the attempt to communicate in foreign tongues. Only a quarter of Americans can hold a conversation in a second language, according to a 2001 Gallup poll. Compare that with about half of Europeans. And in Africa, while it's tough to find comparative figures, it's common to meet people who speak, two or three or five languages, since there are as many as 2,000 languages spoken on the continent. So perhaps Zuck's somewhat passable second-language skills shouldn't be surprising, but they are. And I think a closer examination of why that's the case reveals quite a bit about language and how it plays a role (and doesn't) in modern America. There are easy explanations for America's relative monolingualism. Unlike Europe, where a long road trip can land you in another country with another official language, the United States has historically been relatively isolated from other tongues. When immigrants bring foreign languages to our towns and cities, we generally haven't met them in the middle. We've demanded they learn English. And pronto. Plus, when English speakers travel abroad, we tend to expect the world to cater to us. A couple years ago, I stayed at a Western chain hotel in Seoul, South Korea. The concierge gave me a business card that said something like, ""I'm lost, take me back to the hotel at this address"" on it in Korean. The idea was that I'd hand the card to a taxi driver and he or she would zip me back to the safety of a hotel with English-speaking staff. Like I was a lost puppy with a business-card collar. No need to learn a thing. These expectations help explain why Zuckerberg's Chinese is both so surprising and so easy to poke fun at. His Mandarin presentation plays both into and against the stereotypes of the Idiot American Abroad. We don't expect anyone who grew up in the United States -- especially those whose parents grew up in America, too -- to be able to speak a foreign language, or we don't expect them to do it well. That makes it fun for writers such as Gwynn Guilford and Nikhil Sonnad, at Quartz, to say that the Facebook CEO ""showed a plucky disregard for the tones that Mandarin has -- one tonal slip-up had him saying that Facebook boasts eleven mobile users instead of 1 billion -- and his enunciation was roughly on par with the clarity possible when someone's stepping on your face."" But it also makes it easy to be impressed by Zuck. Put me in the latter camp. Zuckerberg, who comes across, at times, in his verbal English communications as a semi-sophisticated robot, at best, is doing something language coaches will tell you is a must: He's trying. He put himself out there in a big way -- he took a risk -- and that's the only way he'll be able to improve. I applaud that effort. And I think it's representative of where we as Americans, in general, stand as language learners. We're kinda awkward. But we should keep at it. We'll have to in order to stay relevant -- both in global business and at home. There were 37 million Spanish speakers in the United States in 2013 -- up from only 10 million in 1980, according to Pew. Some are bilingual, but some likely speak comfortably only in Spanish. I think there's a fear in English-only America that everyone will have to learn Spanish to function in certain parts of the country. We should expect that English will continue to be the linguistic glue of America -- that it will bind us together. But needing to learn Spanish, and other languages, to better and more fully explore the country and globe should seem exciting, not threatening. Learning a second language opens up new worlds, new neural pathways -- even new personalities. It's something we all should embrace, a la Zuckerberg. We may sound goofy. But it's far better than giving up.","Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, shows off his Mandarin skills .

"(CNN)Earlier this month, a 32-year old male gamer was found dead at a Taiwanese Internet cafe following a non-stop three-day gaming session. This followed the death of another male gamer who died in Taipei at the start of the year following a five-day gaming binge. While these cases are extremely rare, it does beg the question of why gaming can lead to such excessive behavior. I have spent nearly three decades studying videogame addiction and there are many studies published in both the medical and psychological literature showing that very excessive gaming can lead to a variety of health problems that range from repetitive strain injuries and obesity, through to auditory and visual hallucinations and addiction. I have to stress that there is lots of scientific research showing the many educational and therapeutic benefits of playing but there is definitely a small minority of gamers that develop problems as a result of gaming overuse. But what is it that makes gaming so compulsive and addictive for the small minority? For me, addiction boils down to constant reinforcement, or put more simply, being constantly rewarded while playing the game. Gaming rewards can be physiological (such as feeling ""high"" or getting a ""buzz"" while playing or beating your personal high score), psychological (such as feeling you have complete control in a specific situation or knowing that your strategic play helped you win), social (such as being congratulated by fellow gamers when doing something well in the game) and, in some cases, financial (such as winning a gaming tournament). Most of these rewards are -- at least to some extent -- unpredictable. Not knowing when the next reward will come keeps some players in the game. In short, they carry on gaming even though they may not have received an immediate reward. They simply hope that another reward is ""just around the corner"" and keep on playing. Added to this is the shift over the last decade from standalone console gaming to massively multiplayer online games where games never end and gamers have to compete and/or collaborate with other gamers in real time (instead of being able to pause the game and come back and play from the point at which the player left it). Many excessive gamers report that they hate logging off and leaving such games. They don't like it as they don't know what is going on in the game when they are not online. The last five years has seen large increase in the number of scientific studies on problematic gaming. In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the  fifth edition of the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders""(DSM-5). For the first time, the DSM-5 included ""internet gaming disorder"" (IGD) as a psychological condition that warrants future research. Throughout my research career I have argued that although all addictions have particular and idiosyncratic characteristics, they share more commonalities than differences such as total preoccupation, mood modification, cravings, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, conflict with work, education and other people, and loss of control. These similarities likely reflect a common etiology of addictive behavior. So when does a healthy enthusiasm turn into an addiction? At the simplest level, healthy enthusiasms add to life and addictions take away from it. But how much is too much? This is difficult to answer as I know many gamers who play many hours every day without any detrimental effects. The DSM-5 lists nine criteria for IGD. If any gamer endorses five or more of the following criteria they would likely be diagnosed as having IGD: (1) preoccupation with internet games; (2) withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away; (3) the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in internet gaming, (4) unsuccessful attempts to control participation in internet gaming; (5) loss of interest in hobbies and entertainment as a result of, and with the exception of, internet gaming; (6) continued excessive use of internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems; (7) deception of family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of internet gaming; (8) use of the internet gaming to escape or relieve a negative mood;  and (9) loss of a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of participation in internet games. The good news is that only a small minority of gamers suffer form IGD. Most online games are fun and exciting to play. But like any activity that is taken to excess, in a minority of cases the activity can become addictive. Any activity if done for days on end could lead to severe health problems and even death -- and gaming is no exception. Instead of demonizing games, we need to educate gamers about the potential dangers of very excessive use.","Earlier this month a man was found dead in a Taiwan cafe after a three-day gaming binge .

"""Luke loves Yemen and wants the best future for Yemenis."" That's what The Yemen Times, an English-language newspaper in the country, wrote about American photographer Luke Somers earlier this week, after the al Qaeda militants who were holding Somers hostage threatened his life in a videotape. The sentiment that Somers was deeply dedicated to Yemen was shared by his own family members and friends. Somers was killed in Yemen on Friday during an attempted rescue mission by U.S. Navy SEALs. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States  was ""certain"" that one of the militants shot Somers and South African hostage Pierre Korkie as the rescuers moved in. President Barack Obama issued a statement on Saturday morning condemning the killing. Secretary of State John Kerry called it ""a reminder of the brutality of the terrorists."" Al Qaeda, Kerry said in a statement, ""knows how to hate, they know how to murder, and now they have robbed a family of an idealistic young photojournalist who went to Yemen to practice his calling and document the lives of ordinary Yemenis."" Dedicated to Yemen . Somers was 33. He was born in the United Kingdom but was an American citizen. Like many journalists of his generation, he traveled to the Middle East to tell the stories of the region's strife and the people affected by it. His friends said the Arab Spring uprising in 2011 was a motivator. Also like many of his colleagues, Somers freelanced, taking photographs that were licensed and published by news outlets like Al Jazeera and the BBC. Tik Root, who said he crossed paths with Somers while freelancing in Yemen, said Somers ""was really dedicated to Yemen and he spent over two years there continuously, telling the stories and documenting the people that he met."" ""He really, truly seemed to enjoy it,"" Root said in an interview on CNN's ""New Day Saturday."" One of the sites where his photos could be licensed has hundreds of his photos of political meetings and protests, interspersed with more ordinary scenes from the Yemeni capital, Sana'a. Somers was taken hostage in September 2013. A November raid by special forces freed eight other hostages, but not Somers. The militants subsequently issued demands and a threat to kill him. That's what triggered the editorial in The Yemen Times, where he had also worked, and the calls for Somers' release from many others, including his mother, Paula, and brother Jordan. ""He's a good person and he's only been trying to do good things for the Yemeni population,"" Jordan Somers said in a video message. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen echoed that feeling in a statement after his death was confirmed. ""Yemen has lost a friend today,"" the statement read. The Committee to Protect Journalists said that Somers was ""the third American freelance journalist to die this year while being held captive, after James Foley and Steven Sotloff were murdered in Syria."" The organization also pointed out that the ""raid is at least the third to be launched by U.S. special forces in an attempt to rescue American journalists held hostage in Syria and Yemen. All of the raids failed to rescue the journalists."" Professor: Smart, thoughtful, sensitive . Somers graduated from Beloit College in southern Wisconsin in 2008. The following year, he edited a book of nature stories written by Tamarack Song, director of the Teaching Drum Outdoor School in Three Lakes, Wisconsin. Song described Somers as ""extremely intelligent"" with a ""restless spirit"" and an ""inquisitive reporter's eye."" ""He had skills as a writer and skills as a photographer, but these were just tools,"" Song said. ""If there was another tool that would have worked, he would have used it."" A professor who taught Somers in two classes at Beloit said he was smart, thoughtful and sensitive. ""He was well-liked on our campus,"" Shawn Gillen said. ""He made friends with students from around the world. Beloit has a significant international student population and Luke grew close to them beyond polite introductions."" Somers was a good writer and had the driving curiosity of an excellent journalist, Gillen said.","Former professor says Somers was good writer, very curious .

"Scores of police officers have been killed during attacks in Nasarawa state in central Nigeria, the Nigerian Police High Command said Thursday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Opinion: Nigeria is a sinking ship, but we must not desert it . In apparently unrelated incidents on Tuesday, two Nigerian soldiers were killed farther northeast, in the city of Bama in Borno state, during coordinated attacks on multiple targets by more than 100 Boko Haram militants armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft weapons mounted on vehicles, said Joint Task Force spokesman Lt. Col. Sagir Musa. On Wednesday, President Goodluck Jonathan said that dozens of people had been killed in Tuesday's attack, according to a statement from his adviser, Reuben Abati. At least 13 suspected militants were also killed during the attacks, police said. Musa said Boko Haram launched the attacks early Tuesday on a military barracks, a police division station, a magistrate courthouse and a health center. The militants also attacked a prison, freeing scores of inmates. Abati, speaking Wednesday, said, ""President Jonathan believes that the continuation of such callous and wanton attacks on innocent Nigerians, government facilities and security formations flies in the face of ongoing efforts to establish a workable framework for dialogue and the peaceful resolution of security challenges in northern Nigeria."" He added that the government's consideration of dialogue with the militants ""should not be seen as a weakening of its resolve and determination to use all the forces at its disposal to crush all brazen affronts to the powers and sovereignty of the Nigerian nation."" Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege,"" has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria, according to Human Rights Watch.","There is no immediate claim of responsibility for the deaths in central Nigeria .
Officials say two soldiers died in attacks Tuesday; President Jonathan says dozens died .

"(CNN)Long distance trails inspire contradictory tales of solitude and camaraderie, deserted river beds and mountain plateaus, pleasure and pain. The idea of covering thousands of miles on foot is itself barely believable. Perhaps that's what makes these adventures so memorable. Cheryl Strayed's memoir of her 1,000-mile trek along the U.S. Pacific Crest Trail was so enthralling it made it to Hollywood. ""Wild,"" a film based on her account and starring Reese Witherspoon, was one of the most talked about releases at the end of 2014, with Witherspoon even nominated for a best actress award at the 2015 Golden Globes. If you'd like a piece of that action, or simply crave dehydrated food, days without washing and multiple, life-threatening encounters, then here are 10 other epic hikes ripe for big screen treatment. Who would play you? The Appalachian (United States) Distance: 3,510 kilometers (2,180 miles) The Appalachian is the grand dame of long-distance trails. One third of North America's holy hiking trinity, the Triple Crown -- the others being the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails -- it's the most iconic, famed for its ""thru hikers"" who attempt to complete it in a single season. Its 5 million steps follow the Appalachian Mountains from Mount Springer, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine. The range was once a natural border to the 13 colonies held by powerful Native American tribes like the Iroquois and Cherokee, before independence gave rise to westward expansion. Among the highlights: the idyllic, overgrown tracks through Great Smokey Mountains National Park in North Carolina, North America's most diverse forest. More information at: Appalachiantrail.org . The South West Coast Path (UK) Distance: 1,016 kilometers (630 miles) The UK's longest National Trail is a stroll in the park compared to some of the other walks on our list, but what it lacks in longevity it makes up for in history. This dramatic coastal route from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole Harbour in Dorset, takes hikers around the tip of Cornwall, crisscrossing two World Heritage Sites including the famed Jurassic Coast. Nicknamed for its 240-million-year-old rocks, these prehistoric cliffs feature spectacular formations like Durdle Door and Ladram Bay. And while it may be shorter you'll still have to climb a total of 114,931 feet (35,031 meters or four times the height of Everest) to finish it. More information: Southwestcoastpath.com . Te Araroa (New Zealand) Distance: 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) With a backdrop straight out of Middle Earth -- glacial ridges, windswept headlands, shires -- New Zealand's landscape doesn't disappoint. Te Araroa (Maori for ""The long pathway"") covers most of it; all the way from Cape Regina in the North to Bluff on the southern tip. ""Tramping"" the length of it, as the Kiwis would say, from the gentle bays of Queen Charlotte to the volcanic Mount Tongariro, takes about three months. Still, even at a fast pace you could be overtaken be overtaken. Ultramarathon runner Jezz Bragg completed it in a fantastical time of 53 days. More information: Teararoa.org.nz . Continental Divide Trail (United States) Distance: 4,990 kilometers (3,100 miles) The third and longest installment of The Triple Crown is really a director's cut -- loved by serious trail enthusiasts but not for everyone. Spanning 3,100 miles from Mexico to Canada along the Rocky Mountain spine of North America, it takes hikers across some arduous but spectacular terrain including the Red Desert dunes of Wyoming and the heights of Grays Peak (14,270 feet/4,350 meters) in Colorado. The standout feature is Triple Divide Peak in Montana, where the rain runs three ways to the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Arctic via Hudson Bay. Only 150 people attempt to thru-hike the trail each year. The youngest to complete it was 13-year-old Reed Gjonnes. More information: Continentaldividetrail.org . Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker Historical Trail (Sudan-Uganda) Distance: 805 kilometers (500 miles) Trail blazers have recaptured the spirit of discovery with this historic route, which retraces the expedition of Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker's -- the first Europeans to set eyes on Lake Albert and name it after Queen Victoria's late husband -- to that great African lake, 150 years ago. Starting near Juba, in South Sudan, the greater part runs through Uganda to Baker's View, over Lake Albert, and takes in natural wonders like Murchison Falls, which break the Nile with a 141-foot (43 meter) drop as it flows to Lake Victoria. More info: Thebakertrail.com . Oregon Desert Trail (United States) Distance: 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) The Oregon High Desert is a thrilling, stark arena in which to test your mettle. The route is a moveable feast of shorter trails, historic wagon roads and swathes of wilderness to pioneer as you desire, or ""bushwhack,"" as hiking enthusiasts call it. Not for the inexperienced, the isolation and scarcity of water over long sections pose a serious challenge, requiring significant backup resources. But it's not all desolation. There's a quiet beauty to the landscape, which blooms wherever there's moisture. The truly remote, red-rock Owyhee Canyonlands seem to crumble away as you wander through. More information: Onda.org . Grand Italian Trail, Sentiero Italia (Italy) Distance: 6,166 kilometers (3,830 miles) There are ""Great"" trails and even ""Greater"" trails. The Sentiero is best described as ""Grand."" It's an indulgent, convalescent tour traversing the entire Alpine arc before shimmying down the Apennine chain to Sicily and finally drifting west across the Tyrrhenian to Sardinia and Santa Teresa Gallura -- site of the ancient city of Tibula. The route was forged in 1995 by the first Walk Italy event and gives not so much a taste but a full five courses of La Dolce Vita: from the majestic Dolomites, via rich Tuscan vineyards, to the jaw-dropping splendor of the Amalfi Coast. With such varied terrain and the sheer distances involved a thru-hike takes considerable planning and roughly eight months to complete. More information: Traildino.com . Great Himalayan Trail (Nepal) Distance: 1,700 kilometers (1,056 miles) In a word: ambitious. Still being put together, when finished, this 4,500 kilometer (2,796 mile) skyscraping traverse will be the longest and highest mountain trail in the world, crossing the entire Himalaya range from Kashmir to Tibet, via India, Nepal and Bhutan. Nepal's section is the most complete and it alone offers one of the great trekking challenges. It's split into Low and High routes that run near parallel, beginning either side of Kanchenjunga Base Camp and ending on the Tibetan border in Humla. For high culture, the low route (still averaging 2,000 meters in height) passes through remote Nepali villages dotted along the hills and valleys. Only those with mountaineering experience should attempt the high route -- it peaks at a breathless 6,146 meters (20,164 feet). More information: Thegreathimalayatrail.org . Hokkaido Nature Trail (Japan) Distance: 4,585 kilometers (2,849 miles) Japan is something of a distance-walking paradise, home to five of the world's 10 longest trails. At 2,849 miles and growing, this is the longest and last of them all, exploring the glaciers, forests and steaming, volcanic mountains of Hokkaido. Japan's northernmost island is roughly the size of Austria, with short balmy summers and long, cold winters. A complete tour takes seven months and is best divided by either side of winter. More information: Walkjapan.com . Trans Panama Trail (Panama) Distance: 800 kilometers (497 miles) Anyone who has hiked in the tropics will testify to the difficult conditions. Sweaty, dense jungles, swarms of mosquitoes and numerous other bloodsucking creatures await and that's before you even begin this 500-mile journey. But the rewards are greater for those challenges. This cross-Panama route takes hikers from the border in Colombia to Costa Rica, and promises encounters with remote indigenous tribes like the Kuna and Embera. Hikers have a chance to canoe backwaters banked with lush rainforest and explore paths carved by conquistadors 600 years ago. Half complete in 2009, the whole route has now been mapped by Rick Morales, who himself completed it in just more than three months.

"(CNN)She couldn't read and she couldn't write. She was remarkably bad at public speaking. Yet mention the name ""Laika"" to any Russian of a certain age, and their eyes will light up with patriotic fervor. Laika was, of course, a dog. Or to be precise, the first dog to be sent into orbit. ""There was this whole propaganda industry built around Laika and her canine comrades,"" says Damon Murray, editor of the new book Soviet Space Dogs. ""Pictures of the dogs appeared on children's books, posters, toys, stamps, matchboxes, postcards, all over. It was a real cult thing."" Dogs or monkeys? Murray's book draws together a collection of ephemera from the period, providing a window into the eccentric world of pop art from the USSR. The Americans used monkeys for space exploration. In the early decades of the Russian space project, however, it was decided that dogs would be preferable. ""Initially they found it simply easier,"" says Murray. ""There were plenty of dogs around. Russian scientists took strays off the streets and trained them. It was found that monkeys were harder to train, even if they were closer to humans in their genetic make-up. ""Towards the end of the space program, the Russians moved over to monkeys as well. But it's the dogs that are remembered as heroes."" How a mongrel dog became a Soviet icon . The way that this came about owes as much to serendipity as it does to the Soviet propaganda machine. When Laika, a stray mongrel plucked from obscurity, was launched into space on 3 November 1957, the Russian scientists had given no thought to her re-entry. It was simply accepted that she would die in space. This, however, provoked an unexpected outcry from the Europeans. ""Dog lovers across the world were up in arms about it,"" Murray says. ""Western countries saw it as a dog being exploited. To get around this issue, the Soviets canonized her, making her a hero who had sacrificed herself for the greater good of her country."" The birth of a canine hero . The Soviet artists were drafted in, and soon depictions of the space-going dog gazing nobly towards the horizon were ubiquitous. The fact that she was from low-born origins only compounded the appeal of the myth: Laika might not have been human, but she was cast as a genuine proletarian hero. To this day, the images of the Soviet space dogs have lost none of their aesthetic impact. ""It's a weird combination of ideology and dogs,"" says Murray. ""The images have a very nostalgic quality. At the same time, there's this tragic edge because the dogs came from nothing and were eaten up by the Soviet space machine."" Photos that make you question reality . Battersea Power Station and the renovation debate . Astonishing sculptures made from nothing but plain paper .","A new book provides an insight into the bizarre world of Soviet space dogs .

"Hundreds of Boko Haram militants attacked an Air Force base and a military checkpoint in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri early Monday, according to government officials. Loud explosions were heard between 3 and 4 a.m. and several ambulances were seen leaving the base. The number of casualties is unknown. The governor of Borno state has imposed a strict 24-hour curfew forcing citizens to remain indoors and all air traffic in the state has been halted. Borno is one of three embattled states in northeastern Nigeria that have been under a state of emergency since May as the region is the hotbed for Boko Haram Islamists trying to impose a strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law. Last week Human Rights Watch said Boko Haram has abducted scores of women and girls and used children as young as 13 in their campaign of violence.

"(CNN) -- From the moment I stepped onto the tarmac in New Delhi two weeks ago, I was struck yet again by the sheer breadth of India's diversity -- ethnic, religious, cultural, geographic. It is what makes India a remarkable country, home to the world's largest democracy. Earlier this year, some 550 million citizens went to the polls to cast their vote, in the largest election the world has ever seen. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington, D.C., for the first time as the leader of India, he will bring with him the aspirations and concerns of 1.2 billion people. The task before him and President Obama will be to reaffirm the strategic partnership between our two nations -- a partnership that relies not only on government ties but also on steadily expanding relations between our business communities, civil society groups and cultural institutions. The U.S. and India form what President Obama has called the ""defining partnership of the 21st century."" But this partnership can only reach its full potential if it is given the kind of attention and commitment it deserves. So what tone will President Obama set when he first sits down with the new Prime Minister? I will venture to suggest a few key points: . For the sake of peace and prosperity not only in Asia but also globally, India and the U.S. must work together across a range of economic, political, environmental, and security issues. We must recognize, however, that we will not always agree on every issue. That is the nature of a deep and close bilateral relationship. Indeed, over the past year, there have been bouts of distrust, uncertainty and perceived drift, but I am convinced that both leaders have every intention of establishing a positive tone during Mr. Modi's visit. Over the past decade, the two countries have made rapid strides towards strengthening the relationship without headline-grabbing developments (the exception being the 2008 civil nuclear cooperation agreement). This is not a bad thing. Significant progress has resulted from ""small"" steps in people-to-people exchanges, scientific collaboration, and educational exchanges that have accreted over time. For a first meeting between leaders of two great, and often noisy, democracies, it will be important for both sides to engage in the mutual setting of expectations. Mr. Modi comes to office with a set of ambitious plans for India In an era of considerable turmoil in various regions of the world, India can be a major force for stability. Democratic states with a well-established rule of law and adherence to international norms, as President Obama recently invoked before the U.N. General Assembly, are the best guarantors of regional stability and prosperity. President Obama's rebalance to Asia does not come at the expense of trans-Atlantic relations (more important than ever in light of current events on the eastern border of NATO). Similarly, we should welcome the Prime Minister's engagement with traditional U.S. allies in Asia, including South Korea, Japan and Australia, and emerging partners such as Vietnam, as part of his ""look east and act east"" policy. As President Obama underscored this past week at the U.N., the world faces a stark threat in ISIL and must come together to counter extremism wherever it takes root. Mr. Modi's visit to the 9/11 Memorial on Saturday reflects the shared suffering of our two countries at the hands of terrorists. Since the devastating Mumbai attacks of 2008, our cooperation against terror has grown exponentially. Washington should continue to expand its information sharing and other counterterrorism exchanges with India. The President should also encourage the negotiation of a new Defense Framework Agreement with India, to replace one that is expiring in 2015. Our defense cooperation is increasingly robust, featuring major naval exercises, military exchanges and high-level consultations. These should continue, as should the trend of Washington permitting higher levels of sensitive technology to be released to Indian defense forces. Domestically, Mr. Modi's biggest challenge is returning India to the level of economic growth that is necessary to provide opportunity for the nation's fast-growing, youthful workforce. An important part of this effort will require a focus on improving the trade and investment climate, for example, by following through on India's commitments to the World Trade Organization. He has been very clear that he wants to expand the Indian economy by improving trade numbers and attracting more foreign investment. And, with his ""Make in India"" campaign officially launched just days before his U.S. trip, he has already signaled his commitment to turn India into a global manufacturing hub -- including by addressing the daunting regulatory challenges that investors, both foreign and domestic, face. This is an encouraging sign. India and the United States share the objective to build a strong manufacturing base and create jobs. This should be an area of cooperation between our countries, not a point of conflict. Both India and the United States must commit to rebuilding mutual trust and focus on moving our partnership forward. The world has too much to gain for these two great democracies to do otherwise.","Madeleine Albright: Visit of India PM Modi a chance for he and Obama to reaffirm trust .

"(CNN)Could clues that police found in a hideaway outside Paris lead investigators to the lone remaining suspect in last week's terror attacks? Investigators discovered ISIS flags, automatic weapons, detonators and cash in an apartment, France's RTL Radio reported Sunday, citing authorities. They say the apartment had been rented by Amedi Coulibaly, who was killed during a police rescue operation to end his siege at a kosher grocery store in Paris, where authorities say he killed four hostages on Friday. But police say his partner -- and alleged co-conspirator -- Hayat Boumeddiene -- is still on the run. The last place authorities spotted her was somewhere near Turkey's border with Syria. And forensics teams have been examining the apartment in the Paris suburb of Gentilly to determine whether Boumeddiene, 26, might have stayed there before her escape, RTL reported. Coulibaly had rented the apartment from January 4 to January 11, police said, according to  RTL. Police began looking into the apartment after the Thursday slaying of a policewoman in the Paris district of Montrouge, the station reported. Coulibaly was also behind that attack, authorities say. And the car in which he allegedly fled the crime scene was ditched in Arcueil, near the hideout, RTL said. After abandoning the car, Coulibaly boarded a train, police told RTL. The details about the hideout came as millions gathered at a massive rally Sunday in France, where world leaders, dignitaries and everyday citizens alike joined ""unity rallies"" in defiance of the terror rampage. Up to 3.7 million people marched throughout France Sunday, the spokesman for the country's mission to the United Nations said, describing it as the largest mobilization in his nation's history. Beyond France's borders, demonstrators showed their support with rallies around the world. At the Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, audience members gave the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association a standing ovation when he referenced the attacks, vowing to stand against ""anyone who would repress free speech anywhere from North Korea to Paris."" As he received a lifetime achievement award, actor George Clooney described Sunday's demonstrations and their rallying cry. ""Today was an extraordinary day,"" he said. ""There were millions of people that marched -- not just in Paris, but around the world. And they were Christians and Jews and Muslims. They were leaders of countries all over the world. And they didn't march in protest. They marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear. We won't do it. So, je suis Charlie."" In Paris, police said no incidents had been reported despite the record number of people involved in the march there. France remained on high alert as authorities pieced together who was behind last week's attacks -- and warned of the threat of more violence. French law enforcement officers have been told to erase their social media presence and carry weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells have been activated in the country, a police source said. The source told CNN that the cells were activated in the past 24 hours. And it's not just French police that are concerned. Officials in the New York City Police Department and other law enforcement personnel across the United States responded to a  threat from ISIS after someone re-released a September 2014 message that tells followers to  ""rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians,"" specifically naming the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. According to an NYPD memo obtained by CNN, department employees were told to ""remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol,"" especially in light of the attacks in France last week. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the United States. Meanwhile, French investigators continued efforts to delve into the attackers' backgrounds and track down Boumeddiene, the lone remaining suspect wanted in the terrorism rampage that left 17 people dead in three days last week. The clues from his apparent hideaway aren't the only information authorities have about Coulibaly. A video circulating on jihadist websites shows him pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Weapons including a rifle serve as a backdrop for the video, and an ISIS flag is prominently displayed during portions of the video. Coulibaly identifies himself as ""Abou Bassir AbdAllah al-Irfiqi"" and a ""soldier of the Caliphate,"" while warning the West, ""You attack the Caliph, you attack ISIS, we attack you. You can't attack and not get back anything in return.​""  It's unclear when all the video was shot. ""The U.S. intelligence community is aware of the video and is reviewing it to determine its authenticity,"" said Brian Hale, spokesman for the U.S. director of national intelligence, James Clapper. According to a source, Coulibaly made several phone calls about targeting police officers in France. Long before they stormed into the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine last week and killed 12 people, French authorities were watching Said and Cherif Kouachi. But despite red flags, authorities lost interest in them, L'Express magazine reported. Tipped off by U.S. intelligence agencies that Said Kouachi may have traveled to Yemen, France placed him under surveillance in November 2011 but terminated the scrutiny last year when it deemed him no longer dangerous, according to L'Express national security reporter Eric Pelletier, who said he talked to multiple French officials. The surveillance of his brother Cherif terminated at the end of 2013 when his phone calls suggested he had disengaged from violent extremism and was focused on counterfeiting clothing and shoes. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, responding to a reported claim of responsibility by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the Charlie Hebdo attack, told CNN there was no ""credible information"" on who sponsored the violence. And U.S. officials Sunday said American authorities don't have evidence yet directly linking al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to ordering the attack. But they're assuming that Said Kouachi met American terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki at some point in Yemen and received orders from AQAP to carry out an attack, a U.S. official told CNN. The official said Kouachi's motivation for waiting so long to launch the attack was not clear. The Kouachi brothers were killed Friday in a shootout with French security forces outside of Paris. And investigators are still trying to track down their ties that may have helped them before last week's rampage. On Sunday, a spokeswoman for Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in Paris said Farid Benyettou, a well-known spiritual leader believed to have radicalized Cherif Kouachi, had been working as a nurse trainee at the hospital until last Friday. Meanwhile, an incendiary device was hurled at a German newspaper that reprinted the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. No one was in the building at the time of the attack early Sunday. The arson attack at the Hamburger Morgenpost occurred about 2 a.m., the newspaper said on its website. The device was thrown into the archive section of the building, setting it on fire. It's unclear whether the arson attack is connected to the Charlie Hebdo attack. The German paper reprinted Charlie Hebdo cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed after the attack on the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. The Anonymous hacking collective has vowed to retaliate for the Charlie Hebdo attack. ""We intend to take revenge in their name, we are going to survey your activities on the net, we are going to shut down your accounts on all social networks,"" a video from the group said Friday. In online forums Sunday, they said they claimed to have blocked at least one jihadist website. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Faith Karimi and Radina Gigova reported from Atlanta, while journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa. CNN's Ray Sanchez, Gloria Borger, Barbara Starr, Nic Robertson, Al Goodman, Tim Lister, Margot Haddad, Dominique Dodley, Lorenzo Ferrigno, Laurie Segall and Evan Perez and translator Eric King contributed to this report.","George Clooney's Golden Globes speech describes Paris demonstration as ""extraordinary""

"In yet another gruesome attack in Nigeria, suspected Boko Haram militants torched houses in a Nigerian village and killed at least 23 people, a local governor said Wednesday. Gov. Kashim Shettima, the leader of Nigeria's Borno state, told reporters that he personally saw more than 23 bodies buried in the village of Konduga after an attack Tuesday night. ""I do not know what to call those barbarians that did this,"" Shettima said. ""We cannot call them Muslims, because Islam does not do this."" Boko Haram is an Islamist militant group that has waged a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, trying to impose their strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law. Borno has been particularly hard hit and is one of three states in the region that's been under a state of emergency since May due to the bloodshed. On January 26, for instance, the state's police commissioner said that Boko Haram militants opened fire on a village market and burned homes in the village of Kawuri. At least 45 people died and another 26 were injured in this attack, which happened as suspected militants on all-terrain vehicles shot at people while traders were closing shop for the day, according to  Borno state police commissioner Lawan Tanko. 45 killed in Nigeria market attack .","The governor of Nigeria's Borno state says Boko Haram militants attacked a village .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Let's hear it for ""the man of the moment, the man of the millennium."" That man is Narendra Modi, and those are the words with which an Australian public servant introduced India's Prime Minister in Brisbane on Sunday. ""Modi, Modi, Modi,"" chanted the crowd. The adulation didn't end there. The next day, Modi was in Sydney, delivering a speech to an audience of 16,000 at the Allphones Arena. ""You're a rock star!"" shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in India and around the world. And so it was that #Rockstar and #ModiInAustralia began trending on Twitter. Tuesday: new city, new audience. Modi pitched up at the Australian Parliament in Canberra. He spoke in English this time, highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between India and Australia -- almost as if to suggest India was a better trading partner than China. ""Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. ... India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities,"" Modi declared. Is India really the one-stop answer? And is Modi really the man of the millennium? The hype seems to be reaching dangerous levels. There's no denying that Modi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad. Rightfully so. Here, finally, is an Indian leader who says the things Indians have been yearning to hear. He talks about faster growth, creating jobs, about a smartphone in every hand, a toilet in every home, clean streets, leaner and more transparent government. And boy, can he talk. In Hindi, in Gujarati, in English, Modi seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear. In that sense he is indeed a rock star, riffing on his key anthems at every big speech. But can he deliver the runaway platinum sales Indians now seem to expect? We're beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked. Earlier this month, at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, top industrialist Anand Mahindra told CNN that Modi's ""honeymoon period is over."" When CNN spoke with Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms, saying ""people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate"" the cumulative effect of the government's smaller steps. And then there are the questions of Modi himself. At the inauguration of a hospital in Mumbai last month, Modi made a speech, played out live on many Indian TV channels. Curiously, one bit was ignored by the Indian press. Speaking of the Hindu god Ganesha -- who is depicted as having an elephant's head -- Modi claimed that Ganesha's half-man, half-elephant body was evidence that ancient Indian doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery. Seriously? The Indian TV anchor and journalist Karan Thapar was one of the few to raise an eyebrow. ""He believes in digital India, wants to import bullet trains and 'Make in India' state-of-the-art (defense) weaponry,"" Thapar wrote. ""These are 21st-century ambitions. How does all of that sit alongside this belief in unverified mythology?"" He added, ""The silence of the media is deeply disturbing. It feels as though it's been deliberately blanked out by everyone."" I doubt there's a larger media conspiracy only to portray Modi positively. But the media do need to take a step back and question the rock-star levels of adulation. Modi has gotten India dreaming. Who knows, those dreams may even be realized one day. But in Modi's seven months as Prime Minister so far, rhetoric and big plans aside, nothing has really changed. For hundreds of millions of poor Indians, it is still the same India. Basic infrastructure is still subpar; there are no social safety nets on health care or pensions; India is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work. And that's the tip of an enormous iceberg. India could take decades to change. We all need to remember that. So do Modi's fans.","Narendra Modi, India's Prime Minister, continues to draw praise for his speeches .

"Skydiver Jarrett Martin is a stark reminder of what can go wrong in extreme sports. The Dubai-based young American is also a powerful advertisement for putting safety first when you tackle a stunt laced with potentially fatal risks. Martin wasn't even out of his teens when the sport with which he was obsessed almost killed him. Yet, he came back from the brink to chalk up a world first -- and secure a job at the busiest sky diving center in the Middle East. The 24-year-old is a familiar figure at Skydive Dubai, where he is one of just two qualified master parachute riggers in the United Arab Emirates. Earlier this year, Martin achieved even more notoriety when he completed 11 so-called BASE jumps -- from a fixed structure or cliff -- in four days in the Norwegian fjords. Leaving his wheelchair at the summit of a 3,000-foot (914 meters) peak, he pushed himself off and became the first disabled person to successfully make such a jump unassisted. By rights the Seattle-born sportsman shouldn't be here at all. At 18, a jump stunt went wrong and left him fighting for his life with a broken back, a torn aorta, battered lungs and kidneys, and paralyzed from the chest down. Martin emerged from his coma and had a question for the doctors who saved him. ""'When can I start skydiving again', I asked,"" he recalls. Inspirational journey . Most people would have quit and considered their luck at surviving. Yet, not only did Martin dive out of a plane six months later, he became one of just two disabled people in the world to complete a BASE jump. Then, in March of this year, he was taken on by Skydive Dubai, impressed by his skills when he competed for the United States in an accuracy skydive event over Dubai. Martin acknowledges his wheelchair makes some rookie skydive customers nervous, but his journey is nothing short of inspirational. He says: ""It is good for them to see me as anything is a possibility. ""The paralysis I have isn't that common. You either survive or you don't. ""Half my body survived and half didn't. That's why I'm in a wheelchair. But what you do afterward speaks a lot. A lot of people get paralyzed and they just let themselves go and get reclusive."" Martin was a veteran of 2,800 jumps when he broke his body during a speed-flying attempt in Hawaii, where he worked for a skydive business. A hybrid of paragliding and BASE jumping, it involved leaping from a cliff. ""I was trying new things and things didn't quite go to plan and my parachute collapsed. I fell a couple of hundred feet and broke my back and damaged a lot of my insides. ""You have this wing that's laid out behind you. I was going to run and the parachute would inflate and I was going to start gliding down the mountainside. ""Once I was airborne I was going to try to get enough altitude so I could release that parachute and open up a secondary parachute. ""In the midst of all the action and with a new special harness I had built, I was flying for about 10 seconds and that parachute prematurely released and I didn't have enough altitude to deploy my secondary chute."" Triple checks . Martin pauses as he recalls the moment. ""I should have been dead. Miraculously I survived. ""The doctors did a good job of putting me back together. It takes a while to get healthy enough to even get out of bed let alone get in an airplane, but thankfully within six months I was."" Martin took a year to fully rehabilitate. He studied air traffic control, but struggled to get a job, so then decided to head to Florida in order to become a master parachute rigger. ""I was responsible for my equipment that day in Hawaii and it has made me a very detail orientated person today. Not only do I double check everything, I triple check and ask opinions of other qualified people,"" he says. These days Martin is among just a dozen wheelchair skydivers in the world and remains part of the U.S. parachuting team that competed over Dubai. ""When I got hurt I thought I would never get to go to Dubai and check out all the cool things there. So to be in Dubai right now is really a dream come true,"" says Martin, who still manages 200 jumps a year. ""I never thought it would be possible to work here in my condition but you put your mind to it and anything can happen. It took that accident almost to realize how much passion I have for the job I do now. ""My grandfather and my father were skydivers. I've been around it all my life, so even with something as dramatic as getting paralyzed, that's not going to slow me down. ""If there's a will there's a way. I've found the way and it's awesome to continue doing what I love.""","Jarrett Martin was paralyzed at the age of 18 by a stunt jump that went wrong .
Now 24, Martin is back in the skies, working as a skydiving instructor in Dubai .
""You put your mind to it and anything can happen,"" says Martin ."
"Jerusalem (CNN)A Jerusalem synagogue turned from peaceful sanctuary to house of horrors within moments Tuesday when two Palestinian cousins wielding a gun and butcher knives attacked during morning prayers -- a terror attack that Israel's leader characterized as ""blood libel"" fanned by Palestinian leaders. Even as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said he was ""glad"" but insisted it ""is not enough."" Addressing reporters Tuesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for national unity against ""those human animals who committed this massacre"" and against those -- singling out Hamas, the Islamic movement and the Palestinian Authority -- who he claims ""disseminate libels against the state of Israel."" ""There are those who wish to uproot us from the capital, from our land,"" he said, referring to Jerusalem. ""They will not be successful... We have to unify forces."" Netanyahu spoke hours after the latest act of violence to afflict the region, this time at a synagogue in West Jerusalem's Har Nof area. Experts: No third intifada yet -- but little hope, either . Photos taken inside the Jewish house of worship, and released by Israeli officials, painted a grim scene -- from lifeless bodies sprawled on a floor to a shattered pair of glasses to blood seemingly everywhere, drenching holy books, prayer shawls and walls. Three dual U.S.-Israeli citizens and a British-Israeli citizen died in the attack before police shot and killed the two assailants. The terror attack -- the deadliest in Jerusalem since a man with an automatic weapon killed eight seminary students in March 2008 -- came at a particularly tense time in that city and the region at large. It follows a series of recent deadly stabbings and vehicle incidents that, while not the large-scale suicide bombings that defined last decade's second intifada or the rocket attacks from Gaza earlier this year, have left Jerusalem on edge. Netanyahu blasts 'incitement' by Palestinian leaders . The answer to what's next came quickly, as Israeli authorities moved into the slain attackers' East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber to demolish their homes on Netanyahu's order. The Palestinians' official WAFA news agency reported 13 people were arrested, including an al-Aqsa Mosque guard. Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat -- whose city is about two-thirds Jewish and one-third Arab -- said the attack were incited by Hamas and terror organizations who use ""rumor and misfacts"" about Palestinians are treated in the city. Mark Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman, said that authorities were also beefing up security around Jerusalem. ""The goal is to make sure that there are not copycat attacks,"" Regev said. The war of words between the two sides, meanwhile, continued. ""(Abbas) does not send out terrorists, he doesn't directly encourage acts of terror, and this is good,"" the Netanyahu said, echoing an assessment by an Israeli security chief. ""On the other hand, the incitement of the Palestinian Authority -- and he heads the Palestinian Authority -- and even some things he says ... encourage terrorism, in terms of incitement (of) tensions that run high."" There was no such equivocation about Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza. It's been at odds with Israel and also with Abbas' Fatah movement, which controls the West Bank. Hamas did not claim responsibility for the synagogue attack, though it didn't back away from it either. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for the group, instead linked the attack to the discovery Sunday of an Palestinian bus driver hanged in his bus not far from where Tuesday's attack occurred. (For his part, Netanyahu said that claims the bus driver was killed were lies and that his death was ruled a suicide.) Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad predicted to Al Jazeera International that ""there will be more revolution in Jerusalem, and more uprising."" ""Hamas in general supports action against the occupation,"" Hamad said. ""Hamas supports any military action against the occupation anywhere it can be carried out."" Four rabbis killed . The latest example of such an action came at 7 a.m. Tuesday, when two Palestinian men entered a synagogue in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood, where about 30 worshipers in prayer shawls and phylacteries were doing their morning prayers. ""They began attacking worshipers, stabbing them before opening fire,"" Israel's foreign ministry said. Who were the victims? The four killed were all rabbis: Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 58;  Aryeh Kupinsky, 43; Moshe Twersky, 59; and Kalman Levine, 55. Goldberg was a dual British-Israeli citizen, and the other three were U.S.-Israeli citizens -- which is why the FBI is investigating the attack, according to a U.S. law enforcement official. ""When four great men, wonderful men, wise in Torah study, are slaughtered while praying in public, there is no public grieving greater than that,"" said a rabbi who eulogized the men later Tuesday, before their burial. Eight others were wounded, including three who were seriously hurt and a policeman who was critically wounded, according to the foreign ministry. Are you there? Share images, if you can safely . Officials overseas such as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond strongly condemned the killings, and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro called them ""a barbaric new low in the sad and outrageous history of such attacks."" ""Tragically, this is not the first loss of life that we have seen in recent months,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said after condemning ""in the strongest terms"" attacks he said were ""a tragedy"" for Israel and the United States. ""Too many Israelis have died, too many Palestinians have died. And at this difficult time, I think it's important for both Palestinians and Israelis to work together to lower tensions and reject violence."" While no group claimed responsibility for the attack, Israeli officials say the attackers came from East Jerusalem, where Palestinians can move more freely about the city than those living in Gaza, who must pass through stringent checkpoints. Obama condemns 'horrific' Jerusalem terror attack . Ma'an, a Palestinian news agency, identified the two men as Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin, Udayy. Whether their actions were part of a coordinated campaign or a spontaneous reprisal, Tuesday's attack raises the specter of yet more violence against civilians. The latest wave began earlier this year with the kidnapping of three Israeli teens, who were later found dead. Reprisal attacks, rocket fire and retaliatory airstrikes followed that incident, with more than 2,000 Palestinians and 67 Israelis reportedly killed after weeks of heavy fighting. Much of the most recent unrest has been centered around Jerusalem. That includes the discovery of the body of Palestinian bus driver Yousuf al-Ramouni on Sunday, the same day an Israeli was stabbed with a screwdriver near central Jerusalem. Last week, a 20-year-old was stabbed and killed in Tel Aviv, and three people were stabbed -- one fatally -- near the entrance to a settlement in the West Bank, the same spot where the three Israeli teens were kidnapped. CNN's Greg Botelho and Ralph Ellis reported and wrote from Atlanta, while CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Jerusalem. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Michael Schwartz, Kareem Khadder, Jethro Mullen, Rachel Kitchen, Shimon Prokupecz, Jason Hanna and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.","Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemns the attack .

"First came word of a woman stabbed. Then screams. Then gunshots. But the full story of Thursday's gruesome beheading at an Oklahoma food processing plant -- especially why it happened -- is still waiting to be told. One day later, there are tears for Colleen Hufford, the 54-year-old woman whose head was severed. There are prayers for 43-year-old Traci Johnson, who is in stable condition at a nearby hospital for treatment of ""numerous wounds,"" according to police. And there are questions about 30-year-old Alton Alexander Nolen, the man who authorities say attacked them both and might have gone after more people if not for the company's CEO, also an off-duty reserve sheriff's deputy, who confronted and shot him twice. Answers may come from Nolen himself. As of 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), he was ""coming out of a sedation"" at a hospital and investigators planned ""to attempt to begin interviewing him as soon as he was coherent enough to understand what was going on,"" according to Sgt. Jeremy Lewis of the Moore Police Department. Here's what they do know: . The attack happened very soon after Nolen learned he'd lost his job. Nolen had been incarcerated until March 2013, for possession of a controlled substance, escaping confinement and resisting an officer. And he had been trying to convert co-workers to Islam. Lewis also said there may be other information about Nolen's past, that he could not reveal, that might help explain the incident, and that the FBI had been called in to dig deeper into Nolen's background. ""Once we started investigating this initially, and started finding some of the things that he had been involved in, some of the things that he had been saying, we immediately contacted the FBI and got them involved,"" Lewis told CNN's Erin Burnett. CEO/reserve sheriff's deputy stops attack . The large, rectangular Vaughan Foods processing plant looks like many others from the outside: a no-frills design, nondescript front entrance and loading bays out back. But Friday, there was nothing normal about it. Police cars were everywhere, and uniformed officers walked the property. Some citizens stood outside watching, putting their arms around each other and trying to make sense of the horror the day before. Some of this drama could be heard in a 911 call released Friday by the city of Moore. It starts with a man yelling out, ""Shut the doors,"" before calmly turning his attention to a 911 dispatcher. ""We have someone attacking someone in the building,"" he says. The initial violence happened near the Vaughan Foods plant's main entrance, but didn't stop there. According to a 911 call, the suspect went through the front office, to the shipping office, then over to a customer service office. Did he know who he was attacking? Not according to Lewis, who said the suspect used a knife -- which, otherwise, would be used in the processing of produce at the plant -- to randomly inflict bloodshed. ""He wasn't targeting anyone, wasn't going specifically after them,"" the police spokesman said. ""It appears they were just in his way as he came in."" The onslaught's end could be heard on the 911 call, when the caller's steady voice was interrupted. ""Can you hear this in the background?"" he tells the dispatcher. ""And that, that's a gunshot."" Three shots rang out in total, according to the caller. There's no indication that the suspect, Nolen, was armed with anything other than a knife. Of course, no one knew that at the time: They only knew that someone had entered their workplace, beheaded one woman, then attacked another. Mark Vaughan -- who besides being his company's CEO has been a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office since June 2010 -- ""didn't hesitate"" after learning that there was a killer on the loose, Sheriff John Whetsel said in a statement. Instead, he confronted and twice shot Nolen, who is now hospitalized in stable condition. ""Without regard to himself or his safety,"" Whetsel said, ""yesterday Mark Vaughan became a 'HERO' while doing the job he was sworn to do -- protecting others."" Beheading raises questions, but officials say no terror link . The idea that a man who's been trying to convert others to Islam ends up beheading someone is alarming enough, but perhaps even more given what has been happening in the Middle East. The Islamist extremist group ISIS has made a name for its itself using such tactics, going so far as to record the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as British aid worker David Haines. And they've threatened more to come, especially if the United States and its allies continue to launch airstrikes at the group in Iraq and Syria. This has spurred concerns that ISIS sympathizers may similarly lash out against innocents in the West. That said, it's not known if Nolen's religion had anything, at all, to do with what happened Thursday. The FBI and other investigators, of course, could eventually find some sort of link or tie Nolen to others. But that hasn't happened yet. As of Friday, all U.S. law enforcement officials said was that there are no indications linking the Moore attack to terrorism. A spokesman for Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, Alex Weintz, noted the governor had blocked Nolen from receiving parole in 2012, but said she ""believes we need to let law enforcement do their job and not to jump to any conclusions before the conclusion of the investigation.""","Oklahoma governor warns against ""jumping to conclusions""

"(CNN) -- For one of the farthest, coldest places in the solar system, Pluto sure stirs a lot of hot emotions right here on Earth. This montage of images taken by Voyager shows, from left to right, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter. It was three years ago Monday that the International Astronomical Union demoted Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, a decision that made jaws drop around the world. An outcry followed, textbooks had to be rewritten, long-held beliefs were shattered, and many people felt our cosmic neighborhood just didn't seem the same with eight -- instead of nine --planets in the solar system. Today, debate still rages over how to classify the little celestial body, along with others orbiting the sun, but the IAU stands by its definition. ""I think that most of the astronomical community has come to terms with the fact that we now know that the solar system has a continuous distribution of objects from very large down to very small,"" said Lars Lindberg Christensen, a spokesman for the IAU. ""We now know that what we call the different objects has to necessarily change with time."" Don't tell that to Plutophiles still seething about the decision. Some are even taking action. Earlier this year, the Illinois Senate adopted a resolution declaring that Pluto was ""unfairly downgraded"" and restoring ""full planetary status"" to the celestial body as it ""passes overhead through Illinois' night skies."" It also designated March 13, 2009, as ""Pluto Day"" in honor of the date that its discovery was announced in 1930. (In case you are wondering why the state is so passionate about Pluto: Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet-now-dwarf-planet, was born in Illinois.) Meanwhile, New Mexico's House of Representatives proclaimed February 18, 2009, as ""Pluto is a Planet in New Mexico Day"" and praised Tombaugh, who worked in the state for decades and died there in 1997. Passionate about Pluto . Don't live in those states and want to make your voice heard? You can order ""Plutophile"" bumper stickers to proclaim your firm support for Pluto, print out a Pluto Fan Club card -- which allows you to declare, ""In my heart, Pluto will always be a planet"" -- or sign an online petition. Christensen said 90 percent of the critical e-mails and letters the IAU received after its decision in 2006 came from North America. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium and author of ""The Pluto Files,"" believes there are two reasons why Americans are so engaged in the issue. ""Disney's dog Pluto was sketched the same year the cosmic object was discovered. And Pluto was discovered by an American. So here you have a recipe for Americans falling in love with a planet that really is just a tiny ice ball,"" Tyson told Time magazine. Still, astronomers are divided about the best way to classify Pluto.  See photos of other planets and find out what makes them stand out » . At the heart of the matter lies the question: What makes a planet in the solar system? According to the IAU's definition, it must orbit the sun, it must be big enough for gravity to crush it into a nearly round shape, and it must clear the neighborhood around its orbit. In other words, it must be dominant enough to clear away objects in its orbital space, according to NASA. This last point is what proved to be Pluto's demise as a planet: There are other competing objects in its orbit. Crowded solar system? Some scientists say that part of the definition doesn't make sense. ""It's kind of like, I'm going to tell you what your car is on the basis of how the traffic around you is behaving,"" said Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute. The more logical way to classify planets is the geophysical definition, which simply states that planets are round objects that orbit the sun, Sykes argues. The objects must still be big enough so that gravity crushes them into a ball. ""The problem with the geophysical definition is we might have a couple of dozen planets in the solar system as more are discovered in the distant reaches,"" Sykes said. He believes the International Astronomical Union's definition won't stick around after NASA spacecraft reach Pluto and Ceres, a Texas-size asteroid in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter that is now also classified as a dwarf planet. ""I think [the IAU's definition] is going to collapse by 2015 when the Dawn mission gets to Ceres and the New Horizons mission gets to Pluto because we're not going to see irregular-shaped, impact crater-filled, boring surfaces. We're going to see dynamic worlds,"" Sykes said. The IAU's decision also came under fire because only 4 percent of its scientists participated in the vote that reclassified Pluto. But Christensen said the IAU was following its statutes and bylaws and has passed other resolutions in a similar way. The subject of Pluto didn't come up at the IAU's general assembly earlier this month in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Christensen added. Sykes countered that astronomers wanted to discuss the issue, just as they have at other recent major meetings, but the IAU didn't allow there to be any sessions on planet classification. ""I think the IAU did a terrible disservice to science, because it gives the public the impression that science is done by votes,"" Sykes said. ""And that's not the way science is done at all.""","International Astronomical Union demoted Pluto to a dwarf planet three years ago .

"Some corporations have religious rights, a deeply divided Supreme Court decided Monday in ruling that certain for-profit companies cannot be required to pay for specific types of contraceptives for their employees. The 5-4 decision on ideological lines ended the high court's term with a legal and political setback for a controversial part of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. It also set off a frenzied partisan debate over religious and reproductive rights that will continue through the November congressional elections and beyond. All five conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents ruled in favor of closely held for-profit businesses -- those with at least 50% of stock held by five or fewer people, such as family-owned businesses -- in which the owners have clear religious beliefs. Contraceptives or abortion? Both corporations involved in Monday's rulng -- Conestoga Wood Specialties of Pennsylvania and Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based arts-and-crafts retail giant -- emphasize their conscientious desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace. They argued the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, violates the First Amendment and other federal laws protecting religious freedom because it requires them to provide coverage for contraceptives like the ""morning-after pill,"" which the companies consider tantamount to abortion. ""The companies in the cases before us are closely held corporations, each owned and controlled by members of a single family, and no one has disputed the sincerity of their religious beliefs,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. The four liberal justices appointed by Democratic presidents, including the high court's three women, opposed the ruling as a possible gateway to further religious-based challenges that limit individual choice and rights. What the decision means . ""Into a minefield"" In dissent Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the court had ""ventured into a minefield,"" adding it would disadvantage those employees ""who do not share their employer's religious beliefs."" The practical result will likely be an administrative fix by the Obama administration that subsidizes the contraceptives at issue, said CNN political analyst Gloria Borger. ""So in terms of a real gap in medical coverage for these women, should they want it, I think what you are going to see is the government sort of picking up where Hobby Lobby would leave off,"" Borger said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest signaled as much, telling reporters the Obama administration will work with Congress to ensure women affected by the ruling will continue to have coverage for contraceptives. Obama believes that women ""should make personal health care decisions for themselves, rather than their bosses deciding for them,"" Earnest said, adding that ""today's decision jeopardizes the health of women who are employed by these companies."" The decision comes two years after the justices narrowly preserved the health care reforms known as Obamacare and its key funding provision in another politically charged ruling. This time, the issue revolved around a 1994 federal law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which Alito's opinion said prevents the government from ""taking any action that substantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action constitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest."" Alito wrote that the court's conservative majority rejected the argument by the Department of Health and Human Services that ""the owners of the companies forfeited all RFRA protection when they decided to organize their businesses as corporations rather than sole proprietorships or general partnerships."" ""The plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs,"" he wrote. Opinion: It's GOP vs. Democrats . Complex mix . Monday's case presented a complex mix of legal, regulatory, and constitutional concerns-- over such hot-button issues as faith, abortion, corporate power, executive agency discretion, and congressional intent. The political stakes were large, especially for the future effectiveness of the health law  itself, which marked its fourth anniversary this spring. The botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website, was another political flashpoint along with other issues that many Republicans say proves the law is unworkable. They have made Obamacare a key campaign issue in their fight to take control of the Senate while retaining their House majority. ""Today's decision is a victory for religious freedom and another defeat for an administration that has repeatedly crossed constitutional lines in pursuit of"" big government, said House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. ""The President's health care law remains an unworkable mess and a drag on our economy."" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who heads the Democratic National Committee, framed the ruling as a campaign issue for November. ""It is no surprise that Republicans have sided against women on this issue as they have consistently opposed a woman's right to make her own health care decisions,"" she said, calling the ruling a ""dangerous precedent."" Barbara Green, a founder of Hobby Lobby, called the ruling ""a victory, not just for our family business, but for all who seek to live out their faith."" However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the decision ""jeopardizes women's access to essential health care,""  adding that ""your boss should never be able to make your health care decisions for you."" Read the ruling (.PDF) Contraception mandate . The section of law in dispute requires some for-profit employers to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay. A number of companies equate some of the covered drugs, such as the so-called morning-after pill, as causing abortion. The specific question presented was whether these companies can refuse, on the sincere claim it would violate their owners' long-established moral beliefs. Supporters of the law fear the high court setback on the contraception mandate now will lead to other healthcare challenges on religion grounds, such as do-not-resuscitate orders and vaccine coverage. More broadly, many worry giving corporations religious freedom rights could affect laws on employment, safety, and civil rights. The abortion link . The Hahn family, owners of Conestoga, and the Green family, owners of Hobby Lobby, said some of the mandated contraception prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman's womb, which the plaintiffs equate with abortion. That includes Plan B contraception, which some have called the ""morning after"" pill, and intrauterine devices or IUDs used by an estimated 2 million American women. Monday's decision comes two years after the justices allowed the law's ""individual mandate"" to go into effect. That provision requires most Americans to get health insurance or pay a financial penalty. It is seen as the key funding mechanism to ensure near-universal health coverage. Under the Affordable Care Act, financial penalties of up to $100 per day, per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage. Hobby Lobby, which has about 13,000 workers, estimates the penalty could cost it $475 million a year. The church-state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated between the Obama administration and various outside groups. Under the changes, churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate. Other nonprofit, religiously affiliated groups, such as church-run hospitals, parochial schools and charities must either offer coverage or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement. Lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts. The cases are Burwell (Sebelius) v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (13-354); and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Burwell (Sebelius) (13-356). A Mennonite family's fight over Obamacare reaches Supreme Court . 5 questions: Supreme Court and Obamacare on contraception .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Denmark is the world's most content nation, according to a new study on global wellbeing, but the good news is, despite the credit crunch and rising fuel and food prices, all of us are getting happier. Researchers at the University of Michigan said Denmark's prosperity, stability and democratic government placed the country at the top of the rankings, with Colombia, Canada, Puerto Rico and Iceland all in the top 10. The United States -- the world's richest nation -- ranked 16th among 97 countries, while Britain was placed 21st. Zimbabwe, with its soaring inflation and continuing political crisis, unsurprisingly ranked 97th. ""I strongly suspect there is a strong correlation between peace and happiness,"" said Ronald Inglehart, a political scientist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. ""There is also a correlation between democracy and peace. Democracies are less likely to fight each other than non-democracies."" Almost all the countries at the bottom of the list struggle with legacies of authoritarian rule and widespread poverty, the survey found. Moldova and Armenia -- with long histories of repressive government -- trumped Iraq for misery, which placed seven in the U.S.-funded research. Respondents were asked two questions to gauge their happiness: . Researchers say that compared to a similar survey 20 years ago, everyone is a lot happier.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- With at least five people dead and massive expanses of land and roads under water, Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency Monday in the 17 counties hardest hit by flooding from severe weather. Atlanta firefighter Stephen Webb carries a dog to safety Monday at the Peachtree Park Apartments. Gov. Sonny Perdue's announcement followed three deaths in north Georgia's Douglas County, one death in Gwinnett County and another in Carroll County, where a 2-year-old child was ripped from her father's arms by fierce floodwaters while he struggled to hold on to bushes, officials said. Those counties, near Atlanta, were among the 17 included in the state-of-emergency declaration . About 100 miles north of Atlanta, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, one person was swept into rushing water and is presumed drowned, said Jeremy Heidt, a spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in Nashville. Three missing children in Douglas County, west of Atlanta, were found, but their mother was one of the flood's fatalities, said Dena Brummer, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. ""We're in rescue-and-recovery mode,"" said Wes Tallon, spokesman for fire and emergency management services in Douglas County. ""It has not stopped raining, and another line of thunderstorms is coming.""  Watch flooding one CNN.com staffer recorded » . Until just a few months ago, the area was gripped by drought.  Watch what caused the torrential rain » . Several storms moving northeast from the Gulf of Mexico brought the downpours, which forecasters expected to continue through Monday night. Rains were expected to taper off by Tuesday morning but scattered showers were expected for the next couple of days. Just west of Atlanta, some areas have received about 22 inches of rain since last week, CNN meteorologists reported. About 12 of those inches fell in a 12-hour period from Sunday night to Monday morning. After Georgia creeks and rivers burst, swollen by days of rain, residents struggled to escape. In Cobb County's Austell, two rescuers paddled their way through rising flood waters searching for stranded victims, video from CNN affiliate WXIA showed. The pair on the inflatable, yellow raft ushered a stranded woman to a section of black-tarred street that was not under water. Nearby, three men pushed their valuables in a kayak as they waded through the shoulder-high muddy waters. Another two men floated on what looked like air mattresses linked together by rope.

Near Marietta northwest of Atlanta, a flooded bridge blocked the only road out of a residential area surrounded by a national park and the Chattahoochee River. Two buses picked up elementary school children Monday morning, but flooding prevented them from picking up older students later, and the buses couldn't return with the first batch in the afternoon, said iReporter Pritam Jaipuriar, who lives there. See Pritam Jaipuriar's iReport . Some elementary students used a walking trail -- the only other path out of the area -- to return home. Some parents arranged for friends beyond the bridge to pick their children up from school and keep them for the day. ""My first-grader son is staying with a friend of mine,"" said Jaipuriar, who was unable to go to work Monday. Some ground-level apartments in the area were flooded, but his unit was fine, he said. Unable to drive for supplies, some residents walked the path to a store a few miles away and returned with bags of groceries, said iReporter Jeff Cofer, who also lives there. See Jeff Cofer's iReport . Near northwest Atlanta's Vinings area, floodwaters encroached upon multimillion-dollar houses. Rescue personnel rode in boats over flooded streets Monday night, going home to home to pick up residents and take them away. Water levels were high enough at one home that the people there stood on a roof to await rescuers, a fire and rescue official said. On Monday morning, a couple inches of water had entered the Villa Rica, Georgia, home of iReporter Walid Zeid, damaging suitcases and other things that were on the floor. Water from a flooded lake lifted his boat to the roof of his boathouse, crushing the boat's canopy, Zeid's iReport video showed.

Two of the Georgia fatalities involved people trying to drive through floodwater. A vehicle with one man in it was swept off a road in Douglas County, and a car carrying a woman was swept off a road in Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County, east of Atlanta, Brummer said. Seydi Burciaga, 39, was driving to her Lawrenceville home from work when flash flooding trapped her in her vehicle, Gwinnett County police said. She called 911 and police tried to locate her, but Burciaga could not tell them exactly where she was. Floodwater moved her car about 500 feet after she was swept off the roadway, and her attempts to guide rescuers to her by mentioning landmarks were unsuccessful, police said. By the time rescuers found her minivan, she was dead, police said. In Tennessee, the presumed drowning victim was forced into a culvert, or underground storm water drain, about 6 p.m. Sunday, Chattanooga Fire Department spokesman Bruce Garner told CNN. Sylvester Kitchens Jr., 46, was with a friend, Albert Miller, when the two decided to swim in a large, flooded ditch, Garner said. He said a Miller family member told him that ""basically it was a bet."" Both managed to grab onto a chain link fence while being buffeted by the strong current, Garner said. A neighbor threw a garden hose for them to grab onto, and Kitchens reached for it but was unable to hold on. Miller clung to the fence for about 20 minutes and was eventually rescued by firefighters, Garner said.

"(CNN) -- The wife of the president of Oral Roberts University is denying allegations of improper behavior, saying the claims ""sicken"" her. Richard Roberts and wife Lindsay appear on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" last week. Lindsay Roberts, in a statement on the university's Web site, said the allegations against her ""sicken me to my soul. ... I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply."" The suit, filed earlier this month, has drawn international attention to the private Christian school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, founded by evangelist Oral Roberts, father of university President Richard Roberts. The new allegations come in an amended version of the wrongful termination suit filed by three former professors, who say they lost their jobs after reporting that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. The amended lawsuit, filed Friday, also alleges that the university gave a ""convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students"" while the man acted as a ""mentor."" The lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school. The school denies both accusations in a statement on its Web site. The new allegations involving Lindsay Roberts come in a section titled ""Scandal Vulnerability Assessment."" It says that photos show her and an underage male smoking at the president's residence and that she ""spent the night in the ORU guest house with an underage male on nine separate occasions."" It also references 29 photos it says show her and an underage male alone in her car, time-stamped after midnight, despite a citywide 10 p.m. curfew for minors not with their parents. The suit does not allege sexual behavior. The suit says Richard Roberts ""sought approval from stakeholders for moving the underage male into the family residence,"" and ""a longtime maintenance employee was summarily fired so that the same underage male companion could have his position."" In her statement, Lindsay Roberts denied all the allegations against her in the lawsuit. ""The part that grieves me the most is that these accusations are being brought forth in so many areas and being seen and heard through the media when the parties suing have continued to say they don't even know if these allegations are true,"" she said. ""I believe it's grossly unfair to allow such speculation to be used against me and attached to a lawsuit in which I am not even named as a party."" Other allegations in the amended version of the lawsuit are in a section accusing the ORU board of negligence. It says that this past summer, the Board of Regents allowed the president and the school ""to give a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to the students of the university."" The man had previously ""confessed to crimes"" in courts in Tulsa and the surrounding area and was convicted, the suit says. ""In one of these convictions, this 'Mentor' for ORU students -- reportedly hired at the direct personal instruction, and under the direct supervision of President Richard Roberts -- confessed to the facts regarding exposing himself to a 15-year-old boy in a school locker room,"" the suit says. It also says three days after the initial lawsuit was filed on October 2, the board allowed ORU and Roberts to fire the school's financial comptroller after 26 years of service. Within hours, ""voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence,"" according to witnesses, the suit says. Beyond the online posting, university officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday by CNN. The suit was filed by John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker, who accuse Richard and Lindsay Roberts of treating school funds like their own bank account, using them for home renovations, expensive vacations and clothes -- allegations the Robertses and the school have previously denied. After complaining to the school's Board of Regents about university spending, two of the professors were fired from their jobs and the third was thrown into conditions ""so intolerable"" that he had no choice but to resign, the lawsuit says. One of the firings, the suit says, was also in retaliation for the plaintiff refusing to drop a sexual harassment complaint that one of his subordinates made against an associate provost, who is named as a defendant. The suit calls for actual damages ""in excess of $10,000"" and punitive damages also ""in excess of $10,000"" for each plaintiff, as well as attorneys' fees, court costs, ""and any further relief that the court deems just an equitable."" In an interview last week on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" before the latest allegations were added to the suit, Richard Roberts called it ""the most unusual thing I've ever witnessed in my life."" Asked whether someone is out to get him, he responded, ""It sure seems that way."" Lindsay Roberts called the allegations ""preposterous."" The three plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit, meanwhile, accuse school officials of making libelous public remarks about them in an effort to discredit the lawsuit. Last week, before the amended suit was filed, the board vowed to hire an auditor to look into ""allegations made in regards to Oral Roberts University and certain members of the administration,"" board Chairman George Pearsons said in an October 7 statement posted on the ORU Web site. ""The Oral Roberts University Board of Regents is committed to operating the institution in accordance with all ethical, legal and moral standards.""

"A grand jury in Ohio has decided not to indict police officers in the August shooting death of a 22-year-old man carrying an air rifle at a Walmart store in Beavercreek, Ohio. ""The grand jury listened to all the evidence, voted on it and decided that the police officers were justified in their use of force that day,"" prosecutor Mark Piepmeier said on Wednesday. In a statement, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the U.S. Justice Department will review the shooting of Cincinnati resident John Crawford III. ""Now that the state criminal investigation has finished, it is an appropriate time for the United States Department of Justice to look into whether any federal laws were violated during this shooting,"" the statement said. Michael Wright, attorney representing Crawford's family, said the decision against indicting was ""incomprehensible."" ""It makes absolutely no sense that an unarmed 22-year-old man would be killed doing what any American citizen does every day: Shopping at a Walmart store,"" he said in a statement. ""The Crawford family is extremely disappointed, disgusted and confused. They are heartbroken that justice was not done in the tragic death of their only son."" The statement added, ""The Crawford family feels they have been victimized all over again and once again request that the U.S. Department of Justice conduct an independent investigation into the tragic death of John H. Crawford, lll."" Crawford was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Beavercreek on August 5 while carrying an air rifle through the store. Police responded to the scene after a witness called 911 and told dispatchers that Crawford was walking around with a rifle and ""waving it back and forth."" According to police, when officers arrived, Crawford did not comply with their commands to drop his weapon. He was shot twice, once in the elbow and once in the torso, Piepmeier said. Crawford died shortly after being transported to a nearby hospital. His death was ruled a homicide by gunshot wound to the torso, according to the local coroner's office. Piepmeier, who led the team of prosecutors that presented evidence to the Greene County grand jury, called Crawford's death ""a perfect storm of circumstances."" First, there was the fact that an unwrapped air rifle was left on top of its box inside of the store. Next, the fact that Crawford decided to pick it up and carry it with him. And the fact that the 911 caller, identified in police reports as Ronald Ritchie, noticed the weapon in Crawford's hand and called authorities. And finally, the fact that the gun bore such a strong resemblance to an actual automatic weapon. ""It is very hard to tell the difference,"" Piepmeier said. Prosecutors also showed surveillance video from inside the store, which had not been made public until Wednesday. In the video, Crawford can be seen picking the air rifle off a shelf and walking around the store with it before being confronted by police. The two police officers who were involved -- Sgt. David Darkow and Officer Sean Williams -- were placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting, but Darkow has returned to active duty, according to Beavercreek city attorney Stephen McHugh. Williams will be assigned to administrative desk duty until a federal review of the circumstances surrounding Crawford's death is complete, according to a statement. Wright said Walmart surveillance video and eyewitness accounts prove Williams ""shot and killed Mr. Crawford while his back was turned and without adequate warning."" Beavercreek City Manager Michael Cornell and Police Chief Dennis Evers have requested that the FBI review the case to determine whether there were civil rights violations, the statement said. ""The events of August 5th were tragic and we wish the outcome of that evening had been different,"" the statement says. The statement said Darkow and Williams ""did what they were trained to do to protect the public."" Piepmeier called the case one with ""no bad guys."" ""Mr. Crawford did not commit a crime that day,"" he said. The nine-member grand jury, which convened on Monday, heard from 18 witnesses. An indictment on charges of murder, reckless homicide or negligent homicide would have required seven votes, Piepmeier said. Vote counts from grand jury votes are not made public.","Ohio grand jury declines to indict police officers for fatally shooting man with air rifle .

"In a daring operation worthy of a movie, three men escaped from a Canadian jail by helicopter, prompting a massive manhunt, authorities said. The men escaped from a detention center Saturday night in Quebec City. ""A helicopter touched down briefly in the courtyard before taking off with the three prisoners,""  said Ann Mathieu, a spokeswoman for Quebec Provincial Police. ""We are talking closely with the detention center to figure out exactly how the escape transpired,"" Mathieu told CNN partner CBC. ""The priority ... is to find the helicopter."" A manhunt is under way for Yves Denis Yvon Lamontagne, 35,  Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49. The first two men were arrested in a drug bust in 2010 and were awaiting trial. Police found weapons, dozens of cars and a plane during the bust, it said. There was no information provided on the third suspect. It marks the second brazen jail escape in Canada in a little more than a year. In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away. It was a real ""James Bond moment,"" witness Francis Emond said about last year's escape from the facility in Saint-Jerome, northwest of Montreal. While spectacular, airborne escapes are not unprecedented. Albanian inmate Alket Rizaj broke out of a maximum security prison in Greece twice -- in 2006 and 2009. On both occasions, accomplices swooped in to the prison's courtyard on helicopters. Inmates then climbed aboard using rope ladders. Both times, Rizaj was recaptured. Last year, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic. But the plot was foiled when the prisoner was shot and the chopper was forced to land on the prison parking lot. In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican jail aboard a helicopter. The New Yorker's flight inspired the book ""The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan"" and the 1975 movie ""Breakout."" And in France, Pascal Payet escaped not once, not twice, but three times from French prisons. Each time, he was recaptured. Oklahoma jail shower escapees captured .

"(CNN) -- At 44-years-old Abhisit Vejjajiva is Thailand's youngest prime minister in more than 60 years. But perhaps more immediately significantly, he is the country's third prime minister in four months after a period of immense upheaval in Thailand. After just two days of taking office, Thai PM Abhisit Vejjajiva talked to CNN's Dan Rivers for Talk Asia. Thailand's recent political turmoil, which included national demonstrations and the forced closures of international airports, dates back to the 2006 coup that overthrew former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the former People's Power Party leader. In September, the Constitutional Court forced out his replacement Samak Sundaravej, finding that he had violated the constitution by appearing as a paid guest on a television cooking show. In turn he was replaced by Thaksin's brother-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat, who immediately found himself beset by opposition demonstrations that accused him of leading a proxy government for Thaksin. He too was thrown out by a Constitutional Court ruling. Abhisit was named as the new Prime Minister on December 15, and his biggest challenge will be to steady a country that until recently was known as one of the most region's most stable. A career politician, Abhisit was born in Newcastle in the north east of England to wealthy Thai-Chinese parents and attended Eton, one of the UK's top private schools before studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University. While highly critical of the corruption and cronyism in Thai politics, Abhisit's own route to power has not been as he may have wanted it. As leader of the Democrat Party since 2005, he failed to win either of the elections he contended. He was chosen by the Thai parliament to be Prime Minister during a special session. His selection was contingent on support of factions from the now banned PPP who changed allegiance, many of whom he had previously criticized. Abhisit now leads a coalition government with a small majority consisting of a number of parties and interests, leading political commentators to speculate about the length of his tenure in office, many suggesting more than a year in power would be a success. Countering accusations of inexperience, Abhisit can still boast 17 years of political practice, having become a parliamentarian at the age of 27. As well as being young and cosmopolitan, he has gained a reputation as being above the sleaze and corruption that has dogged many other Thai politicians, while he publicly opposed the bloodless military coup that removed Thaksin from office 2006. However critics have said that his policies are borrowed heavily from Thaksin and that his party's decision to boycott the snap election in 2006 led to the constitutional crisis and coup against Thaksin. Most of Abhisit's support comes from the educated middle classes and gaining support, or at least lessening the divisions between sections of Thai society is something he has been immediately faced with. ""He needs to send a clear signal of change that he is a leader who will reach out to all,"" said Bunranaj Smutharak, a spokesman for Abhisit's Democrat Party. ""We are confident the long turmoil over the past two years will be brought to an end by this change in government,"" he said. ""What we set out to do is reunite the country.""","Abhisit is Thailand's third Prime Minister in four months, youngest in 60 years .

"An international backlash against Russia's anti-gay propaganda law is gathering speed, from calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia to gay bars in Los Angeles planning ""vodka-dumping"" protests. A number of bars worldwide have also stopped serving Russian vodka to protest Russia's stance on homosexuality. Bars boycott Russian vodka over anti-gay laws . The furor follows concern sparked by the Russian Parliament's overwhelming support for a new law banning ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors."" Implemented last month, after President Vladimir Putin signed it into law, it bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it -- and has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. As Russia prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in the resort city of Sochi, there is also great concern about what the legislation will mean for gay athletes and visitors to the country. The debate was stirred up this week by St. Petersburg politician Vitaly Milonov, who implemented a local, earlier version of the propaganda law in his city. Amid word that Russia would not enforce the law during the Sochi Games, he said that all Russian laws should be enforced there, regardless of who is breaking them. ""If a law has been passed by parliament and signed by the president, the government has no right or powers to reverse it,"" Milonov told the Russian Interfax news agency. He repeated the comments when he spoke with CNN on Wednesday. To boycott, or not boycott? Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as ""a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia."" Under the guise of protecting children, it will infringe on people's rights to free expression and discriminate against Russia's LGBT community, it said, as the bill was being debated. The move should be set against a backdrop of increased attacks in Russia on members of the LGBT community and gay rights activists, it pointed out. There have been conflicting calls from gay rights activists over a suggested boycott of the Sochi Games. While some activists back a boycott, others argue that such a step would be counterproductive. U.S.-based company Outsports, which supports gay sport, is among those opposed to an Olympic boycott, saying critics should focus on putting pressure on Russia's government rather than denying athletes their chance to compete. ""Instead of walking away, LGBT athletes and their nations should march into Sochi holding their heads high,"" an article on the Outsports website said. The International Olympic Committee issued a statement Wednesday in response to the furor, saying the Russian government had given assurances that gay visitors would not be affected by the controversial law. ""The Games themselves should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, media and of course athletes. We would oppose in the strongest terms any move that would jeopardise this principle,"" it said. ""To that end, the IOC has received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games."" USA Track and Field, the U.S. national governing body for athletics, is treating the matter as a safety and security issue, spokeswoman Jill Geer told CNN. But, she said, the International Association of Athletics Federations has guaranteed it will not affect the athletes in any way. The IAAF has not yet responded to CNN's requests for comment. Opinion: Make Olympics in Russia the gayest ever . 'Dump Russian Vodka' campaign . In response to the recent moves in Russia, internationally syndicated U.S. sex columnist Dan Savage has started a ""Dump Russian Vodka"" campaign, asking bartenders and booze enthusiasts to boycott Russian vodka. Stolichnaya CEO Val Mendeleev sent an open letter last week condemning the recent laws and reaffirming the brand's commitment to the LGBT community. ""We fully support and endorse your objectives to fight against prejudice in Russia,"" Mendeleev wrote. ""In the past decade, (we have) been actively advocating in favor of freedom, tolerance and openness in society, standing very passionately on the side of the LGBT community and will continue to support any effective initiative in that direction."" A rainbow block of text boasting that the brand ""stands strong and proud with the global LGBT community against the attitude and actions of the Russian government"" now dominates the Stoli homepage. Mendeleev added that Stoli is made from Russian ingredients, but the brand is ""privately owned by SPI Group, headquartered in Luxembourg in the heart of Western Europe."" In another protest move, a petition was set up Friday on the White House's ""We the People"" website calling on U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to put Milonov and member of parliament Elena Mizulina on the ""visa ban list"" for their role in promoting anti-gay legislation. Mizulina was ""responsible for the federal law banning gay 'propaganda' to minors and for the law banning foreign adoptions of Russian orphans by gays and lesbians,"" the petition states. It had more than 5,500 signatures as of Thursday. Another White House petition, with a few hundred signatories, calls for a U.S. boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics ""due to discrimination by Pres. Putin against GLBT."" If either petition reaches a threshold of 100,000 signatures within 30 days, the Obama administration will review and respond to it.","USA Track and Field says the IAAF has guaranteed athletes won't be hit by the law .

"(CNN) -- Bomb squads Tuesday dismantled an unspecified number of devices at a high school near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, after a student opened fire at a school police officer, authorities said. Officers neutralized devices found at Socastee High School, said Sgt. Robert Kegler of the Horry County Police Department. Kegler did not indicate the number or nature of the devices. The school was evacuated during the incident. The devices were found several hours after the shooting, police said. The unidentified male student was in the office of Officer Erik Karney about 2 p.m. and opened fire with a handgun, police told CNN affiliate WMBF. Kegler did not know what the two were discussing at the time. Karney suffered minor injuries when the bullet struck a wall and shrapnel hit his face. The officer, who was later released from medical care, was able to detain the student, Kegler said. The student, whose age was not released, was detained by Horry County Police in connection with the incident. Kegler confirmed that investigators are also looking into a Twitter account containing suspicious posts. The campus and surrounding area were searched by bomb-detecting robots and a K-9 team Tuesday evening. The school will reopen Wednesday. Teal Britton, spokeswoman for Horry County Schools, confirmed to WMBF that metal detectors were not used on students entering the school Tuesday morning. That will change Wednesday morning, she said, adding that there will be at least two metal detectors at each entrance to the school.

"The death of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot last month by a Cleveland police officer who authorities say mistook the child's air gun for a real firearm, has been ruled a homicide, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday. The November 22 shooting outside a Cleveland recreation center is under investigation, and Tamir's family has filed a lawsuit against two officers and the city over his death. The homicide finding indicates that Tamir was killed by the police officer, rather than dying accidentally or by natural causes or by suicide. Medical examiners' homicide findings make no comment on whether the killing constitutes a crime. The cause of death was a ""gunshot wound of the torso with injuries of major vessel, intestines and pelvis,"" according to paperwork provided by Christopher Harris in the medical examiner's communications office. Cleveland cop who shot Rice slammed for 'immaturity' in past job . Rice was pointing a pellet gun at people outside the recreation center before he was shot, police say. A witness called 911 to say that a black male -- ""probably a juvenile"" -- was pointing ""a pistol"" at people, but added twice that the gun was ""probably"" fake. A dispatcher asked officers to respond, but it doesn't appear the dispatcher told them of the caller's suspicions that the gun was probably fake or that the person was probably a minor. Two officers arrived in a police car. Within two seconds of exiting the car, Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir, and the boy died the next day, police say. Tamir Rice's teen sister 'tackled' after his shooting, mom says . Police have said that Loehmann opened fire after Tamir reached for the gun in his waistband and that an orange tip indicating the gun was a toy had been removed. Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, has said she didn't allow her son to play with toy guns, and one of his friends gave the air gun to him. Loehmann, 26, and the car's driver, Officer Frank Garmback, 46, are on paid leave as the investigation is conducted.

"Pavel Petel was once an open, flamboyant bisexual man from Ukraine who built up a career as a model, performance artist and DJ in Russia. Photographs of him semi-naked while riding a horse and brandishing a gun are a feast for web surfers. But after he and his partner Sergey Ostrikov were attacked outside Moscow, and especially since a bill banning gay ""propaganda"" was passed in June, Petel has feared for his safety. He is losing business -- and blames that on the law and an increasingly less tolerant climate towards homosexuality. ""People in the regions are very aggressive towards gays. Sergey and I were lucky to be alive last year because some people wanted to kill us. My fear has been growing since then."" And recently, ""I was working on my video when I turned on the TV and saw video of one anchor of a Russian channel who said that you need to burn the gays' hearts,"" he told CNN. ""I had to continue to smile, perform, say 'hello sexy' but it was difficult. I started to be afraid. ""I'm dressed down now when I go on to the street and I'm afraid police could arrest me. They can implement the law against me. I know that I'm not safe. ""I'm afraid to do what I used to. I'll probably change. I'm scared to come to the streets now wearing wigs or heels. I've started to wear them much more rarely."" When he was growing up in the Soviet era, ""life was easier,"" he recalled. ""There was no pressure to make you chose who you are."" Indeed he doesn't even define himself as a gay man at all. ""I've never actually thought about myself being a gay or a straight or anything else. I still don't think about it and I didn't think about it in my childhood."" Russia insists the new law, which bans ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors,"" is intended to protect children. It bars discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. International rights groups have called the legislation highly discriminatory, as anti-gay attacks are on the rise in Russia and are sometimes perpetrated by the police themselves. There have been widespread calls for boycotts and protests -- including a vodka-dumping demonstration in Los Angeles -- casting a pall over the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The gay rights group, All Out, has delivered a petition with hundreds of thousands of signatures denouncing Russia's stance on gay rights. Petel, who lives in Moscow, said that although he believes the law is ""designed against people with non-traditional sexuality"" he does not support a boycott. ""I hear a lot now about boycotting the Olympics or vodka. It makes me laugh. Why? First of all, because we all know that no one will ever boycott Olympics for the sake of this because financial interests of the countries are more important than the freedom."" Such a move could cause a backlash against homosexuals, he fears. ""It may even be designed against the gay community of Russia to turn everyone against them. Because people will say that it's gays who sabotaged and boycotted the Olympics and people will just burn us with our hearts."" OPINION: Make Olympics in Russia ""the gayest ever"" Moscow, a city of more than 11 million people, has only a handful of gay night clubs, none of which would allow CNN's cameras inside. And on the street, few people are willing to be identified. Viktor Michaelson says most of Moscow's gay population has always lived in secret -- and that they now have even greater reason to embrace anonymity. The gay scene here is often referred to as a ghetto. Michaelson says: ""[Gay people] aren't imposed to stay in the ghetto but they feel more comfortable because they can be themselves."" Alexander Gudkov says outside the ghetto there's a clear rule -- don't ask, don't tell -- but that he wants more from life. ""It's very bad. I want to live in open life. And I want to live my life. It's not my choice, it's my life,"" Gudkov says. What does the future hold then for gays in Russia? Petel understands why acceptance in the country has come slowly, but says: ""Russia would benefit from appreciating gays the same way that Indians appreciate their cows. To me, gays are usually kind, talented, genial, creative and I feel sorry that they're leaving. It's not civilized. ""I think it will be back to normal again in 10 years but the new young generation should come to power and change the laws. Maybe we'll see the first Russian gay president in 10 years. Or maybe it will be a woman.""","Pavel Petel had built up a career as a model, performance artist and DJ in Russia .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is undoubtedly the greatest men's tennis players of the modern era -- if not of all time -- following his epic victory over Andy Roddick in Sunday's Wimbledon final. Reaching for the stars: Roger Federer ithe best tennis player the world has ever seen. His star had waned somewhat in the past year, losing his No. 1 world ranking to Rafael Nadal, but his breakthrough victory at the French Open last month saw him match Pete Sampras with 14 titles at major tournaments. With the injured Nadal absent at SW19, Federer rolled back time to march relentlessly into the final against Roddick, dropping just one set along the way as he reminded fans of the form that saw him top the rankings for a record 237 weeks. Then on Sunday, Federer overtook Sampras' mark with 15 grand slams -- with the American in attendance to view his record finally go. Federer still has some way to go before beating Sampras' all-time record of 286 weeks at the summit, but at the age of 27 he has plenty of time to take back his crown from Nadal, especially with the Spaniard's career seeming in the balance due to his chronic knee problems. The Swiss is already the ATP Tour's all-time earner, with more than $48 million in prize money. He holds the record for most money earned in one season, $10 million in 2007, and is also second on the list for his $8 million the year before. Sampras, in comparison, is second on the earnings list with $43 million up until his retirement in 2002 after a 14-year career. He won 64 ATP Tour titles, compared to Federer's 59, but both are a long way behind the record 109 achieved by Jimmy Connors, with Ivan Lendl next on 94 and John McEnroe third with 77. When it comes to Grand Slams, Sampras won 14 finals and lost four. Including Sunday, Federer has reached the most, appearing in 20. Lendl, who held the world record for 270 weeks at No. 1 before being usurped by Sampras, appeared in 19 finals but could only win eight. The great Bjorn Borg, who shares the record for most successive titles at Wimbledon with Federer -- who completed his quintet in 2007 - won 11 of his 16 Grand Slam finals. None of those illustrious names have been able to surpass the efforts of Australian legend Rod Laver, who is the only men's player to have won all four Grand Slams twice in the same year. He did it first as an amateur in 1962, and then again in the 1969 when he became the first -- and only -- player to achieve the feat in the open era. Federer became the first player to reach seven consecutive Wimbledon finals with his 50th win at the All England Club in his semi-final victory against Tommy Haas on Friday, but still trails Sampras' record of seven titles at SW19. His bid for a record sixth successive crown was thwarted in an epic final showdown last year with Nadal, who has transformed himself from a clay-court specialist into a fearsome all-round talent. Federer, by contrast, has taken a long time to adapt to clay. He did not reach the semi-finals at Roland Garros until his seventh appearance in Paris, then was beaten in the final by Nadal for the next three years. His triumph this year came after the Olympic champion suffered a surprise early exit, although he had earlier ended Nadal's 33-match winning streak on clay in the Madrid Open final. The anxiously-anticipated Paris win made him just the sixth player to complete the set of major titles, the third in the modern era and the first since Andre Agassi -- who added the final piece in his jigsaw with victory at the 1999 French Open. Federer shares the Open-era record for most U.S. Open victories with Sampras and Connors, having clinched his fifth crown in 2008 when he beat young pretender Andy Murray in the final. He has always been generous in his praise of Sampras, who never won at Roland Garros but triumphed twice at the Australian Open and holds the record for winning eight successive Grand Slam finals.  Sampras: Federer is the greatest. ""I think his success here at Wimbledon is amazing,"" Federer has said of Sampras. ""Winning it three times, coming back, winning it four more times and going for five, it's quite something. ""And he finished off with the U.S. Open victory, which was very special against his biggest rival Andre Agassi. I think that's what I'll remember most of him. ""I guess he had the best serve we've seen in tennis history, even though today we also have some good ones. He was also a smooth mover which he never really got credit for. There's many things that Pete did incredibly well."" Federer's career has been no less incredible, but he has claimed that he started out with no such lofty ambitions. ""I'm very proud of all the records I've achieved because I never thought I would be that successful as a kid,"" he said. ""I would have been happy winning a couple of tournaments and maybe collecting Wimbledon.""","Roger Federer has reached 20 Grand Slam finals the most by any male player .

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button might not be having his best year on the race track, but it's been another notable year for the Briton competing in triathlon events. What started out as a way of keeping in physical and mental shape for the rigors of Formula One has turned into serious hobby for the 2009 world champion, earning him -- at the age of 34 -- the distinction of being called the fittest man in the pit lane. In July, Button hosted his third annual charitable triathlon at Luton Hoo Estate in Bedfordshire, raising a ""huge amount"" for Cancer Research UK, and last month he finished 11th out of 1,675 competitors and second in his age group at an Ironman event in the Philippines. All of which makes Button -- who is seventh in the F1 drivers' championship with just one podium finish all season for his McLaren team -- one of the most famous amateur triathletes in the world. But how does he measure up against the very best professionals? Earlier this month, before he jetted off for this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix, Button was given the opportunity to find out when he was pitted against British triathlon stars Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee -- gold and bronze medalists at the London 2012 Olympics -- in a cycling, swimming and cognitive test. An afternoon of grueling activity was organized by the GSK Human Performance Lab (HPL) -- a multimillion-dollar sports science facility based in west London which specializes in physiology, nutrition, biochemistry and neuroscience. The center, set up by pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline, has forged partnerships with all three athletes and others including world No. 1 golfer Rory McIlroy. Button is a big fan. ""It's got everything that we need and it makes a big difference to us as drivers,"" Button told CNN. ""There is still so much to learn about the human body, nutrition and pushing yourself to the limit and getting the best out of yourself. In Formula One we love technology -- so this sort of thing is great."" Heat of battle . Button was paired off against 24-year-old Jonathan Brownlee in the cycling performance test in the HPL's Enviro Chamber, where the temperature was set to 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) and 70% humidity -- similar to conditions Button can expect in Singapore. Results showed that Button initially responded to the heat better, maintaining a lower core temperature despite having to work harder at the beginning of the test. But overall, Brownlee was the clear winner, producing more power throughout, a lower core temperature in the end and a lower heart rate from start to finish. Brownlee was encouraged by the results as he and his older brother look towards the Rio Olympics in 2016, where climatic conditions could be similarly sticky. ""One thing we've not been good at in the past is the heat,"" Brownlee said. ""So we're trying to use the HPL to create a strategy to cope -- whether that's drinking something beforehand or going somewhere hot beforehand."" In the swimming test against 26-year-old Alistair, Button displayed good technique, maintaining a high position in the water and matching Brownlee for distance covered in meters per second. But he used more energy, completing 40 strokes a minute -- each one covering 1.66 meters -- whereas Alistair averaged 37 strokes per minute, covering 1.80 meters each one. ""I'm miles away from those guys,"" Button conceded. ""They are so much fitter -- this is their job -- but it's good to see I'm doing the right sorts of things in terms of my training."" On the button . Button wasn't going to be outpaced in the cognition tests, though, and ended up trouncing his younger rivals in a series of tasks completed on a bespoke iPad app created by AXON Sports which assessed both reaction time and accuracy. In fact, Button was one of the quickest and most accurate athletes ever tested at the HPL with an average reaction time across eight tasks of 613 milliseconds and no errors. By comparison, the best average Brownlee time was 748 milliseconds set by Jonathan. It might be what you'd expect from a man who drives a car at speeds of up to 220 mph (350 kph) but Button was reassured. ""The reaction stuff is always interesting because, you know, I'm 34 years old and people say, 'Oh, I'm sure he's past his best,' "" he says. ""To be fair, Damon Hill (who won his only world title at 36) hadn't really started in Formula One when he was my age. So, to show that I still have good reactions, I think that is something that you can help with a bit of training anyway."" McLaren will be hoping that the partnership with HPL can pay dividends as cognitive training is officially rolled out for the pit crew next season. ""These guys are working 24/7 nigh on four days around the race,"" says Mark Langley, HPL's general manager. ""So anything you can do to get a little bit more efficiency and focus is good. ""It's about getting their nutrition, their sleep right so they can perform as well as the drivers can perform."" As for the remainder of this season, Button is clearly not expecting miracles. ""We are not going to challenge Mercedes for a win this year but we are making progress which is good to see ... we have direction,"" he said.

"Four months ago Narendra Modi emerged as the runaway winner of the world's biggest election in history. It was a surprising, overwhelming mandate for his Bharatiya Janata Party: no other Indian party had won a clear majority in parliament in three decades. Modi was the clear face of the party, the man millions of Indians believed could better their lives. But who is Narendra Modi? What makes him tick? How has he evolved in his first role on the national stage? And what is his vision for India's foreign policy? Modi has has not done any media interviews since becoming PM. Until now. CNN's Fareed Zakaria conducted the network's exclusive interview. As part of the CNN team that was there at the PM's residence at 7 Race Course Road, I got to spend a bit of time observing India's new, enigmatic, all-powerful leader. A lot has been written about Modi in the last year. What hasn't gotten enough press -- a result of the lack of access -- is what PM Modi is like up close. Here are some thoughts about what I found interesting. Modi's lighter side . Modi has a reputation -- at least in the press -- of being a serious man, an intimidating presence. Having never met him before, I was struck by his lighter side. Modi had a natural, easy sense of humor, the likes of which I've rarely seen when producing interviews with world leaders. When we were setting up for the interview, I asked him to do an audio test for us. ""What should I say?"" I asked him to count to ten. ""You're testing my primary education as well today?"" The tension broke; both sides were laughing. Twenty minutes through the interview, we realized Modi's forehead had gotten shiny, perhaps because of the intense lighting. I stopped the interview, and asked our makeup artist to touch him up. ""My sweat is the product of sixty years of toil, my friends,"" Modi announced to the room. ""Sixty seconds of makeup isn't going to help me!"" Again, laughter all round. Modi was playing to the gallery. OPINION: Memo to Modi: How to reboot India . On foreign policy . There were serious moments as well. One of the things India-watchers asked when Modi was elected was how quickly he would adapt to the global stage. Modi, after all, had little experience in international diplomacy. I've previously written about how Modi has been quick off the block in engaging leaders of other countries. What struck me about Modi in person was how his foreign policy is rooted not in international relations theory, but in history. On China, Modi repeatedly referred to India's historical ties with China, and how the two countries had for centuries risen and fallen in sync. When asked if he was worried about China's growing assertiveness in territorial disputes in the East China and South China Seas, Modi said: ""India is different. It is a country of 1.25 billion people. We can't run our country if we get worried about every small thing."" ""At the same time we can't close our eyes to problems. We're not living in the 18th century. This is an era of partnership. Everyone will have to seek and extend help mutually. China is also a country with an ancient cultural heritage,"" he added. Modi pointed out how the world had changed since the 18th century. Back then, countries thought horizontally: they wanted to expand. Today, they think vertically, about building up their economies. Certainly, the suggestion Modi made was that he was thinking vertically -- and he was expecting his neighbors to do the same. OPINION: What India can learn from China . Right or left? Journalists often describe Modi as a politician of the right. He's pro-business, nationalist, talks about a leaner, smaller government, doesn't want to raise taxes. Indeed, he may be all of those things. But perhaps the left-or-right prism is a Western one, best applied to developed economies. Modi struck me as a populist. He candidly talked about growing up poor, about traveling around the country and learning about life from conversations with regular people. He defended India's policy on subsidies. For rich countries, subsidies are a political agenda, he said. ""For poor countries, subsidies are a matter of life or death."" Modi explained he was not going to budge on bringing in FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in retail (a change many economists have called for) because he believed in a different kind of FDI -- First Develop India. Work . At the start of our interview, Modi told us about his working life. He said he wakes up at 5 a.m. every morning -- a childhood routine --and often stays up working and reading until anywhere from 10pm to two in the morning. So, how does he unwind, asked Fareed. The answer surprised me. Modi used an analogy of a scientist obsessed with his laboratory; his passion keeps him in the lab all day and all night. That, Modi said, was how he felt about governance. ""Work gives me relaxation too ... I draw pleasure in governance, in doing new things and bringing people together. That pleasure is all I need from life."" Rhetoric . One thing I wasn't surprised by was Modi's rhetoric. Up close, his speech and rhetoric are as impressive as it had seemed to be on the campaign trail and on TV. He had clearly prepared thoroughly for questions he thought an international broadcaster might ask. He knew the right things to say--even off camera. But great rhetoric also means great expectations. It's too soon to judge Modi on results. For sure, CNN will be back later to ask and check if he has delivered.","CNN granted first interview with Narendra Modi since he became Indian PM .
