"By . Associated Press . A University of Connecticut music professor is under investigation for sexual misconduct and decades-old molestation involving children, including several boys who attended a camp for sick children. UConn officials said today they were cooperating with the investigations after professor Robert Miller, 66, was placed on paid leave last month . They also announced the creation of a special Board of Trustees committee to review the university's responses to the allegations against Mr Miller, of Mansfield. A University of Connecticut music professor is under investigation by police amid allegations of sexual misconduct and decades-old molestation involving children (UConn pictured) University employees were notified several times between 2006 and 2011 of allegations that Miller had sexual contact with children, but it wasn't until February of this year that school administrators were told of the claims, according to UConn officials and the state attorney general's office. It wasn't until June 21 that Miller was placed on paid administrative leave. It was also revealed today that the attorney general's office is seeking bids from a law firm to advise and represent UConn's Board of Trustees and that UConn has hired a private investigator. Miller was barred from the Storrs campus after being placed on leave, but he hasn't been charged with any crime at this moment in time. He did not return several phone messages left at his home by The Associated Press. Last month, a faculty member told a university official that a student alleged that Miller had sex with UConn students, visited freshmen dorms and provided drugs to students, according to the state attorney general's office. It's not clear when those alleged actions took place. Miller has worked at UConn for three decades and was head of the Music Department from 1999 to 2003. Miller has also been under investigation by Connecticut state police and authorities in Fairfax County, Va., following allegations that he molested five boys, who ranged in age from 10 to 13 years old, more than two decades ago, according to a state police search warrant affidavit for Miller's home that was obtained by the AP. State police say four of the boys claimed they were molested at Miller's home in 1992. The boys at the time were attending the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in Ashford, a camp that actor Paul Newman opened in 1988 for sick children. The alleged abuse happened when Miller, who was a counselor there from 1989 to 1992, took the children away from the camp on unsanctioned trips, authorities said. Allegations against Professor Robert Miller's date back to the 1960s and 1970s and continued to be reported several times between 2006 and 2011 (UConn campus pictured) State police said Fairfax County police are investigating allegations that Miller molested a 13-year-old boy while he was a teacher at the former Whittier Intermediate School near Falls Church in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Officer Eddy Azcarate, a spokesman for Fairfax County police, confirmed that his agency is investigating allegations involving the intermediate school student. All the allegations involve inappropriate touching. State police say the accusers at the camp allege that they stayed overnight at Miller's house several times and he often would make them take off their clothes, saying he had to check them for ticks and bruises. All the boys suffered from hemophilia, a bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally, state police said. Connecticut state police said they can't charge Miller in the child molestation investigation because the statute of limitations for the allegations has expired, but it hasn't expired for the Virginia allegations. State police are helping Fairfax County authorities with their investigation. UConn officials also are investigating the allegations involving university students. State police executed a search warrant at Miller's home on June 20 to take photos of the interior and exterior to try to corroborate a description of the house by one of the Connecticut accusers, who is a potential witness in the Virginia case, the search warrant affidavit said. The same day, UConn seized Miller's work computer, officials said. UConn President Susan Herbst said in a statement that university officials acted quickly after they first learned of the investigations of Miller earlier this year. 'Allegations involving crimes against children are both profoundly disturbing and heartbreaking,' Herbst said. 'Any accusation of sexual misconduct by faculty, staff, or students is among the gravest issues that any institution must face. It is clear that serious accusations have been made, questions that demand answers have been raised, and we will do all we can to find the truth and protect the vulnerable.' University officials released a timeline of events involving Miller saying that the School of Fine Arts received an email and letter in December 2011 claiming that Miller was a pedophile. State police say the accuser in Virginia sent the email and letter. UConn employees also were told several times between 2006 and 2011 about allegations involving Miller and children, the attorney general's office said. But it wasn't until Feb. 13, 2013, that an unnamed employee of the School of Fine Arts brought the letter to the attention of the new dean of the school. The next day, UConn officials told campus police and an assistant state attorney general based at UConn. Officials didn't have the information they needed to place Miller on leave until they received the state police search warrant affidavit last month, UConn spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said. UConn police formally opened an investigation on Feb. 18 and contacted a state prosecutor the next day, officials said. On June 27, senior university administrators met and agreed to recommend to Herbst that the school should conduct internal and personnel investigations into Miller, officials said. The investigations will center on when school employees learned of the allegations and how they responded to them. Senior staff met with Herbst on June 28, and she directed officials to begin the investigations, seek an outside investigator to assist in the probes and seek an outside law firm to review the university's actions and coordinate the investigations. The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp released a statement that didn't mention Miller by name but said it was aware of the investigation of a former staff member who was affiliated with the camp from 1989 to 1992, the same years Miller worked there. It declined further comment. State police say the parents of the boys who attended the camp and allege they were molested by Miller found out about the accusations and told camp officials, who then fired Miller. A mother of one of the boys told state police that she and the other boys' parents told camp officials about the allegations but didn't tell police at the time.","Robert Miller, 66, was the head of the Music Department from 1999 to 2003 .

"By . Associated Press . Police nationwide may be listening in on phone calls or reading text messages to find suspects thanks to a device called Stingray - but they're refusing to reveal details about its use. Law enforcement officials say Stingray, a suitcase-size device that pretends it's a cell tower, is useful for catching criminals, but that's about all they'll say. For example, they won't disclose details about contracts with the device's top manufacturer, Harris Corp., insisting they are protecting both police tactics and commercial secrets. The secrecy — at times imposed by non-disclosure agreements signed by police — is pitting obligations under private contracts against government transparency laws. Top-secret: The Florida-based Harris Corp manufactures Stingray devices, which police departments from coast to coast are said to be using to intercept phone calls and text messages . Even in states with strong open records laws, including Florida and Arizona, little is known about police use of Stingray and any rules governing it. A Stingray device tricks all cellphones in an area into electronically identifying themselves and transmitting data to police rather than the nearest phone company's tower. Because documents about Stingrays are regularly censored, it's not immediately clear what information the devices could capture, such as the contents of phone conversations and text messages, what they routinely do capture based on how they're configured or how often they might be used. In one of the rare court cases involving the device, the FBI acknowledged in 2011 that so-called cell site simulator technology affects innocent users in the area where it's operated, not just a suspect police are seeking. Earlier this month, journalist Beau Hodai and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona sued the Tucson Police Department, alleging in court documents that police didn't comply with the state's public-records law because they did not fully disclose Stingray-related records and allowed Harris Corp. to dictate what information could be made public. The Stingray has been credited with helping the FBI nab a tax fraud suspect nicknamed the Hacker, who was later identified as 29-year-old California man Daniel David Rigmaiden. Censored: . Police are not being forthcoming with information on the use of . Stingrays, regularly censoring documents about how the phone-tracking . technology is used or how much it costs taxpayers . Rigmaiden, of Santa Clara, was indicted in April 2010 for allegedly stealing the identities of hundreds of dead and living people and using the information to electronically file for $4million in fraudulent tax returns. It is believed the federal officials used a Stingray to locate the illusive computer wiz by linking Rigmaiden to a mobile-broadband card, which allows a computer to connect to the Internet through a cell phone network, the Wall Street Journal reported. The FBI later claimed that it obtained the appropriate court orders to track Rigmaiden's broadband card using an unspecified device, but the documents have remained sealed since his arrest in 2008. Phantom: A Stingray device tricks all cellphones in an area into electronically identifying themselves and transmitting data to police rather than the nearest phone company's cell tower . Revelations about surveillance programs run by the federal National Security Agency have driven a sustained debate since last summer on the balance between privacy and government intrusion. Classified NSA documents, leaked to news organizations, showed the NSA was collecting telephone records, emails and video chats of millions of Americans who were not suspected of crimes. That debate has extended to state and local governments. News organizations in California, Florida and Pennsylvania are among those that have been denied records about Stingrays or Stingray-like devices, including details of contracts that Harris has with government agencies. In a response to a records request from the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper about Florida's use of cell-tracking technology, the state's top police agency provided a four-page, heavily redacted document signed by a police investigator. The newspaper reported that the document referred to guidelines concerning the purchase of items and sought the department's agreement to the 'provisions/content of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.' The Desert Sun of Palm Springs made a similar request to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, which said it had to maintain secrecy even though the newspaper found information online about cell site simulators. And in Sacramento, the local sheriff's office told a TV station it would 'be inappropriate for us to comment about any agency that may be using the technology' in light of a Harris non-disclosure agreement. Many of the requests were part of an effort to investigate the devices by Gannett Co. Inc., which publishes USA Today and owns other newspapers and television stations around the country. 'I don't see how public agencies can make up an agreement with a private company that breaks state law,' said David Cuillier, the director of the University of Arizona's journalism school and a national expert on public-records laws. 'We can't have the commercial sector running our governments for us. These public agencies need to be forthright and transparent.' A representative for Melbourne, Florida-based Harris Corp. declined to comment or elaborate on how the company's agreements comport with open records laws. Court documents in Hodai's case show Harris' agreement required the Tucson city government not to 'discuss, publish, release or disclose any information' about its products without the company's written consent. The agreement also required the city to contact Harris when it receives public-records requests about a 'protected product,' like a Stingray, so that the company can 'challenge any such request in court.' The police department declined to comment on Hodai's lawsuit. He had sought Harris contracts and police emails about how the technology is used. Email records show a Harris contract manager advised a Tucson police sergeant on what records couldn't be released to the public; the manager relied on the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, which governs records of the executive branch of the federal government. Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the ACLU, said there's often a distinction in public-records laws to protect bona fide trade secrets — such as circuit board diagrams — as opposed to broader information like agency policies governing a Stingray's use or purchase agreements. He said police in Florida have declined to tell judges about the use of Stingrays because of non-disclosure agreements. A December 2013 investigation by USA Today found roughly 1 in 4 law enforcement agencies it surveyed had performed tower dumps, and slightly fewer owned a Stingray. But the report also said 36 additional agencies refused to provide details on their use, with most denying the newspaper's public-records requests.","Stingray is a suitcase-size device that tricks cell phones into sending data to police rather than to a tower .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Mark Prigg . It was one of the worst kept secrets in tech history thanks to a steady stream of leaked images and countless reports, but tonight Google finally unveiled its Nexus 5 handset. It is the first device to run the new Android 4.4 KitKat operating system and comes with a 4.95-inch screen, an 8MP camera on the back coupled with a 1.3MP camera on the front. The 4G-ready handset, made by LG, goes on sale on Google's official Play store from tomorrow and prices start at £299 ($349) for 16GB or £339 ($399) for 32GB. Carphone Warehouse is additionally offering the handset for £295 SIM free. Google announced its Nexus 5 handset, pictured, last week after months of leaked images and specifications. It was the first device to run the new Android 4.4 KitKat operating system. The 4G-ready handset starts at £299 for 16GB or £339 for 32GB . Screen: 4.95-inch screen . PPI: 445 . Operating system: Android 4.4 KitKat . Camera: 8MP front-facing, 1.3MP rear-facing . Storage: 16GB and 32GB . Memory: 2GB RAM . Price: £299 ($349) for 16GB and £339 ($399) for 32GB . It will go up against Apple’s iPhone 5S and Samsung’s Galaxy S4, and is described as a ‘high end’ handset by the search giant. 'Five years ago we launched the first Android, now the system is healthier than ever and very vibrant,' said Sundar Pichai, Google’s Android boss. The new handset will be available in black and white, and can be woken up simply by saying ‘OK Google’. The firm says its new Android software, called KitKat, has been redesigned to allow it to run on far more handsets that previous versions. KitKat is also designed to unify the different versions of Android available. The announcement comes almost a year to . the day since Google unveiled its hugely popular Nexus 4 device. The Nexus 4 sold out within hours of hitting the store, and again when the stocks were replenished, and it . is expected the new handset will be just as popular. Google's Nexus 5 comes with an ultra-high resolution screen that contains 1920 x 1080 pixels, giving the device a pixel-per-inch (PPI) rating of 445. This sits between Apple's 4-inch iPhone 5S screen with a PPI of 326, and the 469 PPI screen of the 4.7-inch HTC One. The Nexus 5, pictured, is powered by the latest high-speed, power-saving Snapdragon 800 chip from Qualcomm also seen in the Samsung Note III and Nokia's new Lumia 1520. According to tech journalist Mark Prigg, the handset 'feels like a truly high-end phone' Taking a leaf from Apple’s book, the Nexus 5 has undergone a dramatic weight loss since its last version - and is thinner, lighter and faster than any other Nexus. It feels like a truly high-end phone, and Google has spent a lot of time perfect not just how it works, but crucially how it feels. The touchscreen, buttons and casing are all a significant improvement, and at 130g, it’s incredibly light. Android has also got a big boost, and KitKat, the version running here, is excellent. It’s been tweaked, polished and improved far more than previous versions, and feel extremely snappy in use - with searches beginning instantly, and Google Now available with a simple left swipe. Overall, this is arguably the best Android handset on the market - and should see Google making inroads in the high end smartphone market where Apple has traditionally dominated. It’s not enough to persuade Apple owners to switch, but with the Nexus 5 Google has shown that it can keep Android owners wanting a true quality handset on board. Review by Mark Prigg in San Francisco . The Nexus 5 is powered by the latest high-speed, power-saving Snapdragon 800 chip from Qualcomm also seen in the Samsung Note III and Nokia's new Lumia 1520. It has 2GB of RAM and will be available with 16GB or 32GB of storage. 'How do we get Android to work for the next billion people - that’s our goal for the 2014,' said Pichai. 'We also wanted a more beautiful, immersive experience,’ he said. 'How do we change form a grid of applications to a smart experience.' The firm will integrate popular apps such as IMDB and OpenTable into . Android to allow users to use apps in search results. 'At the moment you . have a grid of applications, and click on what you want. 'Our vision is that every time you pick up your phone and glance at it, . you have the right information - and we’re taking our first steps in . that direction.' David Phelan, Mobile Technology Advisor . at Carphone Warehouse said: 'Google's own-brand phones are always a . talking point.' 'The Nexus 5 has been hotly anticipated and Google fans like Nexus because it shows . Android at its purest and most advanced: the latest Kit-Kat software . will be on this phone first. This phone is for early adopters, Google . fans and ‘power users’ who want a high-end phone at a keen price. 'Now Android is such a powerful force in mobile, we can expect the Nexus . 5 with its cutting-edge specs to beat even the success of the Nexus 4.' In . August, Google slashed the price of its Nexus 4 from £239 for the 8GB . down to £159, adding fuel to the predictions a new handset was on its . way. Leaked shots of the new handset made a brief appearance on the firm's Play store earlier this month, pictured left, shown alongside Google's current Nexus 7, centre, and Nexus 10, right. It had a price tag of $349, which matched what the Nexus 4 was sold at from launch . Google teamed up with Nestle last month to launch the next version of its Android operating system, called Android 4.4 KitKat. There . had been speculation that the latest version would be named Android Key . Lime Pie because each release begins with the letter of the alphabet . that follows the previous. To mark the announcement, the KitKat homepage was redesigned as a parody of Google software releases. It is the successor to Android Jelly Bean that launched on the new Nexus 7 in July. Google then updated all of the core apps that ship automatically with its Android software, including Gmail, Google+ and YouTube, earlier this week. The Nexus 5 forms part of Google's existing Nexus range that also includes the new Nexus 7 tablet, built by Asus. It . launched in July and has a 7-inch, 1980 x 1200 display. It . also has a 5MP rear-facing camera and a faster . 1.5Ghz processor compared to the first-generation Nexus 7 device.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Shrimpers fishing in the Gulf of Mexico accidentally netted a prehistoric looking goblin shark that is the rarest of all sharks ever to be seen by human eyes. The goblin shark nabbed off Key West, Florida which was 18-feet-long, pink, and has a long snout to conceal it pointy teeth from prey is the second ever of its kind to be seen in the Gulf. The goblin shark is known to live in the deep waters of Japan and a Gulf sighting is so rare that its the first in over 10 years. Scroll down for video . This rare 18-foot pink goblin shark was caught off the Florida Keys . SF Gate reports that the goblin sighting 10-years-ago was so exciting for researchers that a scientific paper was written. The crew of fisherman who made the latest catch had a net 2,000 feet under water and were shocked to find a massive pink shark among the shrimp they catch on a daily basis. The prehistoric looking creature sometimes called the 'living fossil' thrashed on the deck and had teeth so sharp that the fishermen were too afraid to pull out the tape measure and hold it up to the mysterious creature. 'I didn't even know what it was,' said fisherman Carl Moore to SF Gate. 'I didn't get the tape measure out because that thing's got some wicked teeth, they could do some damage.' Instead of keeping the shark to do research, Moore decided to snap a quick photo of the fish with his cell phone then release it back into the water. Moore showed a photo of the shark to his grandson who was thrilled with the discovery. 'My . 3-year-old grandson, he just loves sharks so I've been taking pictures . of every one we find, when I showed him this one he said, 'Wow, . Pappa!' Moore said. The . shark was netted on April 19th but it wasn't until yesterday that Moore . reported his catch to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric . Administration. Based on photographs researchers guessed that the shark was a female and at least 18-feet-long. 'This is great news,' said John Carlson, shark connoisseur at NOAA. 'This . is only the second confirmed sighting in the Gulf, the majority of . specimens are found off Japan or in the Indian Ocean and around South . Africa.' The shark, which was eventually thrown back into the water, is thought to be a female and measure out to 18 feet long . Scientists know so little about the fish that they can't even determine how old or how big it gets. However, scientists do know that deep underwater the color red appears black making the shark appear almost invisible to predators and prey. Researchers also believe that the shark's long snout is equipped with electrical sensors so that it can find prey even when it can't see or hear anything in the depths of the water. Perhaps the shark's most frightening feature is its jaw which snaps out like a Venus fly trap to catch nearby fish. Shark Blogger and University of Miami marine biologist David Schiffman didn't even believe that finding a goblin shark in the gulf was possible. 'At first I wasn't sure if it was even possible for this to happen, but then when the photos came through, it is undeniably a goblin shark. It's a shark ... that's pink! For Moore, the shark was a catch of a lifetime and he is happy that he threw the animal back in the water. 'That's my ocean out there and anything in it concerns me..I know the value of trying to preserve things,' Moore said.","The goblin shark is known to live in the deep waters of Japan and a Gulf sighting is so rare that its the first in over 10 years .

"By . Jason Groves . Fresh violence in Egypt and Libya does not mean the Arab Spring is over, David Cameron will say today. In a speech to the United Nations, the Prime Minister will express optimism about the changes in Middle Eastern governments despite warnings that  Islamic fanatics could take over. Mr Cameron is said to be impressed by the start made by Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, despite his background in the shadowy Muslim Brotherhood. Scroll down for video . Thoughts: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured yesterday in New York, will say today that fresh violence in Egypt and Libya does not mean the Arab Spring is over . ‘Of course everyone has concerns and worries as we see these elections take place and people who have got quite Islamist backgrounds get elected,’ said a source. ‘But the Prime Minister’s view is that we should judge people by what they do and Morsi has made an impressive start. The PM still thinks the Arab Spring is working.’ Following the UN session, Mr Cameron will make a high-risk appearance on David Letterman’s Late Show. The Prime Minister is hoping to use the prime time TV appearance to promote British business in America after the Olympics. But Letterman is famed for his biting wit – once asking Boris Johnson when he stopped cutting his own hair – and Mr Cameron is braced for questions about his aristocratic connections and his chief whip’s problems with the police. Mr Cameron knows all about the perils of talk shows. In 2006, he was asked by Jonathan Ross whether as a teenager he had sexual fantasies about Margaret Thatcher. Respect: Mr Cameron is said to be impressed by the start made by Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, despite his background in the Muslim Brotherhood . Today, he will tell Mr Morsi that he will send officials to Brussels to help Egypt cut through EU red tape that makes it difficult for frozen assets to be returned to their rightful owners. About £100million in property and assets is thought to be tied up in London. Cairo has accused the UK of foot-dragging over the issue. Not a penny has been returned to Egypt so far. Assets include a number of central London properties, including a £10million house near Harrods that is closely linked to former President Mubarak’s son Gamal. Hair-raising: Show host David Letterman (right) is famed for his biting wit - once asking London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) when he stopped cutting his own hair . In a further show of friendship, government sources last night said the Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards would be dispatched to Cairo this autumn to advise on cracking down on a militant uprising in Sinai. Mr Cameron is also expected to issue a strongly worded warning about the damage being caused to the UN by its failure to tackle the bloodshed in Syria. The Prime Minister will start tweeting next month – even though he has previously been rude about users of the blogging service. Using his new personal account, Mr Cameron will be able to launch party political attacks.

"By . Ashley Collman . Break-up blues: 16-year-old Ankita Lavender faked her own kidnapping Tuesday in an attempt to gain sympathy from her ex-boyfriend after their breakup . Some women treat a break-up with a pint of ice cream and a good cry, but one Florida teen decided to fake a kidnapping in order to 'play the sympathy card' with her ex. An Amber Alert was issued for 16-year-old Ankita Lavender Tuesday  night after she called her dad saying she had been taken by two men in a white truck. Lavender was found just three hours later following a massive search effort that cost the county thousands of dollars. While she initially continued with her abduction story, she eventually copped that it was all a ruse to get attention from the boyfriend who broke up with her two days prior. The hunt to find Lavender started at 7:20pm when she called her father telling him she had been taken by two men in a white truck near Ridaught and County Road 220 in Middlebrug, Florida. Lavender's mother then called 911 and relayed everything the girl was saying to dispatchers. The mother said she was at a park before the abduction. Her dad then gets on the phone, saying the truck stopped, he heard his daughter telling them to 'stop' and that she then hung up the phone. An Amber Alert was issued since she previously told her ex-boyfriend that she was being followed. Clay County Sheriff's Office Colonel Craig Aldrich says 40 investigators responded within the first two hours, leading a search on the ground and in the air. It was a driver who located Lavender three hours later, around 10:25pm, less than a mile from where she said she was grabbed. The driver says Lavender was laying on her back on the side of the road near the intersection of Henley and Carlotta roads. The driver then called 911 and Lavender was taken to Orange Park Medical Center to be examined. She initially complained about injuries, saying she had been thrown from the truck. But authorities say there were no visible signs of injuries and she later admitted it was all a hoax. She told authorities that she was sad and 'decided to play the sympathy card' by faking the kidnapping. Tweets from Lavender's account also show she hinted at the kidnapping days before she even broke up with her boyfriend. On April 23, four days before the break-up she wrote that she was going 'MIA for a while' and she followed that tweet the next day with one saying she 'finally [has] a plan'. The break-up allegedly happened on Sunday, April 27, the same day she tweeted: 'If I disappeared, it wouldn't even be a problem.' Scroll down for video . Evidence: Around the time of her break-up, Lavender posted a series of tweets, hinting at her plan . Now the sheriff's office is seeking to charge the minor for costing the county an estimated $5,000 - $6,000 for the search. 'My personal opinion is that she should be charged, but that's a matter for the state attorney's office,' Aldrich said. The district attorney could charge her with filing a false police report, which is a misdemeanor. If she is charged, it won't be released since she is a minor.","Florida teen Ankita Lavender went missing on Tuesday, two days after breaking up with her boyfriend .

"By . Katy Winter . A former chocolate addict has lost more than nine stone in weight after she took up martial arts and kicked excess sugar out of her diet. At her heaviest mother-of-one Kirsty Lynch, 41, weighed 21st 9lb and had to wear size 24 clothes after years of overeating. With her confidence at rock bottom in 2011, Ms Lynch, who is mother to 17-year-old Aaron, joined a kickboxing class in 2011, and soon saw the weight fall away. Former chocolate addict Kirsty lost more than nine stone in three years dropping from nearly 22st (right) to 9st (left) Kirsty admits that when she first began kickboxing she struggled with the physical demands - sometimes ending classes being sick . After two . months of training she had lost more than a stone and a half. As the months wore on, . she began training more and her efforts were rewarded recently when she checked the scales to see that she weighed 12st 8lb - a total weight loss of 9st 1lb. As . her confidence increased Kirsty also began taking part in competitions. In . December 2012 she became the English ladies champion in the 60kg-plus . novice category, an achievement she topped with victory in the Lordswood . tri-series competition in the same category in October 2013. Today she is a two-time champion kickboxer and hopes to soon qualify as an instructor. She said: 'I spent most of the first session gasping for breath or outside being sick. I was in such poor physical condition that it was a complete shock to the system. 'When I woke the next day, I could feel pain in muscles I never knew I had. But somewhere along the way, I had been completely hooked. I knew I would go back.' Kirsty gained weight while pregnant due to her cravings for chocolate and junk food, and then found herself in an unhappy cycle of dieting and comforting eating . Ms Lynch saw her weight creep up after giving birth to Aaron, her only child, seventeen years ago. She said: 'I’d been quite sporty at school and had really enjoyed playing hockey. Before falling pregnant I’d worn size 12 clothing. 'I got some very strong cravings. I couldn’t stop eating Cadbury or Galaxy chocolate, along with every type of biscuit imaginable, and helpings of strawberries and cream. I reasoned I was eating for two so I paid it no mind. Kirsty said: 'I used to live as if I was in Groundhog Day - every single day was the same, and I had nothing to look forward to. Now, my days are so exciting. I feel as if I’ve been given a new life.' 'I put on an awful lot of weight above what I was expecting with the pregnancy.' Following the birth, the cravings did not subside. She said: 'On the outside, I was a happy, cheerful person. But inside I was miserable. The more miserable I felt, the more I found comfort in food. 'I made a deadly mistake that food was my friend, rather than recognising it as the fuel for my unhappiness. To date Kirsty has lost over nine stone through her martial arts training and making changes to her diet . Kirsty with the trophies she has won kickboxing. She is already purple belt level and is working towards her black belt, which will enable her to become an instructor . 'I tried every fad diet under the sun - the cabbage diet, Weight Watchers, Atkins - but chocolate remained my downfall.' In late 2009, Ms Lynch was left in agony when she tore her ligaments in both knees while jogging with friends. Finally, in May 2011 a friend suggested she join her at a kickboxing class running near her home in Stone, Staffordshire. She said: 'I was nervous at first, but I loved the way everyone was so friendly in the class. It was not like the gym, where people often keep themselves to themselves. Breakfast: Bowl of Coco Pops and toast . Lunch: Chicken tikka sandwich . Dinner: Steak and Ale pie and chips . Snacks: Several chunky chocolate bars . Breakfast: Porridge and fruit . Lunch: Wholemeal pasta and tomato sauce . Dinner: Grilled chicken and vegetables . Snacks: Granola bars or fruit . 'Instead, there was a sense that everyone was in it together. It was a very eclectic bunch, motivated by a desire to ‘go hard or go home’. It was much more my kind of thing.' She also radically changed her diet as the physical exercise put her more in tune with her body’s nutritional requirements. While she was overweight, she typically ate a bowl of Coco Pops with toast for breakfast, followed by a chicken tikka sandwich for lunch and steak and ale pie with chips for dinner. She would snack on chunky chocolate bars throughout the day. Kristy, who now trains three times a week, has won numerous trophies and said martial arts has changed her life . Today, she typically eats porridge with fruit for breakfast, followed by wholemeal pasta with tomato and basil sauce for lunch, followed by chargrilled chicken with fresh vegetables for evening meal. She snacks at set intervals during the day, usually on granola bars or pieces of fruit. Kirsty has also encouraged her son to start kickboxing, is at purple belt level and is working towards her black belt, which will entitle her to become an instructor. She said: 'I used to live as if I was in Groundhog Day - every single day was the same, and I had nothing to look forward to. Now, my days are so exciting. I feel as if I’ve been given a new life. 'I have martial arts, and the people who helped me to discover it, to thank for that.'","Kirsty Lynch experienced huge cravings for chocolate when pregnant .

Georgie Robinson, landlady of the Wig and Pen in Truro, innocently sent off for a sign after 10ft tall white boards appeared in front of her pub. It was supposed to say 'The Wig & Pen is open for business.' But their solution took an unexpected turn after a printing error left the sign saying 'The Wig & Penis open for business' instead - much to the amusement of the regulars. Blooper: The sign left punters smirking after a missing space morphed the Wig and Pen pub into the Wig and Penis . Although the missing space - and its unintentional consequences - were noticed from the start, pub staff were so anxious to show they were still open that they put it up straight away. Speaking to MailOnline, Mrs Robinson, who runs the pub with her husband, said: 'It looked like the pub was not even there anymore - so . we got a sign done to let people know we hadn't closed. 'The first sign had to go back - and then the second one had this slight error. But we thought ""Sod it, we can't wait any longer."" And it was quite funny - at least it caught people's attention!'

"By . Chris Wheeler . Manchester United are going ahead with plans to table a £55million bid for Southampton stars Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw. Sportsmail understands that United have identified their  primary transfer targets and the strategy will not be affected by David Moyes’s departure or the search for his replacement. Talks to bring in England left back Shaw, 18, are at an advanced stage, with United confident of sealing a £30m deal. Twin targets: Manchester United propose to wrap up the signings of Luke Shaw (left) and Adam Lallana . On the move? Manchester United will offer a fee of £55m for the England duo . And they are offering another £25m for his Southampton team-mate Lallana, who has forced himself into World Cup contention after emerging as one of the most exciting English midfielders in the Premier League this season. The fee includes add-ons relating to the progress both players make for club and country, as well as a bonus payment to Championship club Bournemouth where Lallana, 25, started his youth career. It is believed United are on course to complete a double deal with Southampton before the World Cup. The deposed Premier League champions are keen to do their transfer business as early as possible and avoid a repeat of last summer when they chased high-profile targets Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc Fabregas, only to make a solitary signing in Marouane Fellaini. Top target: Cesc Fabregas (front) is wanted by the Old Trafford hierarchy . Barcelona midfielder Fabregas remains high on United’s hit-list and they are still confident of signing Paris Saint-Germain’s £60m-rated striker Edinson Cavani as part of a £200m rebuilding programme. Old Trafford chief Ed Woodward will also have to move quickly if he wants to install Louis van Gaal as Moyes’s successor before the World Cup.The Holland coach is a firm favourite for the job but will be occupied with international commitments from May 7. United’s interim boss Ryan Giggs has been put in charge for the final four games of the season and will try to restore the ethos that worked under  Sir Alex Ferguson. That even extends to his first Press conference, with Giggs changing it back to the same 9.30 time slot and venue favoured by Ferguson. Old times: Ryan Giggs (right) has moved them back to the same time and place as Sir Alex Ferguson . The United veteran will be assisted by his old team-mates Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville in his first game at home to Norwich tomorrow, and Butt admitted: ‘To be there together is a bit of a surreal thing. We walked in here together when we were 12. ‘I’m not 40 yet but Giggsy is, and myself and Scholes are nearly there. So for us and Phil to be there together is a very proud moment. Saturday is a massive occasion, not only for Ryan, but for the staff, the fans and the players because they know we’ve underachieved.’ Meanwhile, it has emerged Giggs tried to steer Moyes away from trouble even as the United manager’s doomed reign entered its final throes. Hard line: David Moyes fined Tom Cleverley, Ashley Young and Danny Welbeck for a late night out... but Giggs did not agree . The 40-year-old made a plea to the Scot to show leniency to Ashley Young, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley after they were photographed on a late night out in Manchester following United’s Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich. Moyes fined his three England players and ordered them to do extra training last week. Giggs knew the disciplinary action had gone down badly among the United players and tried to convince Moyes it was unwise. His plea went unheeded although it is unclear if the fines will remain in place now Giggs has been put in charge.","Manchester United will bid £30million for Southampton left back Luke Shaw .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Welcome to North Korea's first 'luxury' ski resort - which actually looks a little more like a prison camp than the slopes Verbier. The Masikryong ski resort, near Wonsan, opened for business earlier this year. Previously, it was home to a clear mountainside covered in lime trees. Now it is a sprawling 1,400-hectare resort - complete with several expansive eating areas, uncomfortable-looking ski lifts and, of course, screens showing pro-government propaganda. Scroll down for video . This picture shows North Korea's first ever ski resort - which opened for business earlier this year.

"By . Associated Press . Killer? Alice Uden, pictured, is on trial for allegedly killing her third husband Ronald Holtz in the mid-1970s . Jurors heard emotional testimony Friday from one of the sons of a Missouri woman on trial for allegedly shooting her husband in Wyoming almost 40 years ago. Todd Scott, 53, of Casper, testified that his mother, Alice Uden, of Chadwick, Missouri, told him in the 1970s she'd shot 25-year-old Ronald Holtz as he slept. His mother's words haunted him for years afterward, he said. 'I don't know why a mother would tell her children she killed somebody,' Scott said, tearing up. Scott said he later told police, employers - anyone who would listen - about what his mother had said to try to 'rip this demon out of me.' He then turned to his frail, 75-year-old mother seated in a wheelchair across the courtroom and said: 'I hate you.' The testimony of Scott and one of Uden's daughters bolstered prosecutors' argument that Holtz, Uden's third husband, was asleep when she shot him with a .22-caliber rifle in southeast Wyoming between Christmas Eve, 1974, and early February, 1975. Uden's attorneys argue she acted in self-defense and to protect her 2-year-old daughter. Investigators found Holtz's remains in an abandoned mine last summer. Last fall, authorities arrested Alice Uden and her fourth and current husband, Gerald Uden, 71, in Missouri. Gerald Uden subsequently pleaded guilty and is serving life in prison for killing his ex-wife and her two children in central Wyoming in 1980. Investigators haven't linked the two cases. Defense attorneys have asked Laramie County District Judge Steven Sharpe not to allow jurors to hear anything about Gerald Uden's case. As of Friday, Gerald Uden hadn't come up at Alice Uden's trial. Uden met Holtz when she was a nurse at a Veterans Administration hospital in Sheridan, and Holtz, who'd been a helicopter gunner in Vietnam, was a psychiatric patient. Uden's attorneys say Holtz became abusive soon after they married in September 1974, and Uden shot him in the back of the head when he was about to attack the little girl. On Thursday and again Friday, prosecutors called Uden's daughter, Theresa Twyford, 55, of Naples, Illinois, to testify. Twyford said Friday her mother once told her, too, she shot Holtz as he slept. The 'matter of fact' conversation happened in Illinois, she said, where Twyford was living at the time in the 1970s. Both she and her mother had been drinking, she said. On trial: Alice Uden, pictured, listens to the judge during jury selection  at the Laramie County District Court on Tuesday, April 29 2014 . 'I don't remember any drama. I don't remember, really, any reaction. It just was,' Twyford said. Her mother also once told her that Holtz, following a car wreck in Illinois, had beat and kicked her on the side of the road, Twyford testified. Scott testified that his conversation with his mother about Holtz's shooting happened as he was driving her home to Laramie from Buford, a remote town east of Laramie where Uden was a bartender. Both of them were drinking during the drive, he said. 'She just, out of the blue, told me how she got up one night, got a .22, and shot Ron in the head,' Scott said. He said his mother told him a friend helped her dispose of Holtz's body in an abandoned gold mine on the Remount Ranch. Investigators have not named any accessories in the case. The Remount Ranch is a small cattle outfit where Uden and her second husband, Donald Prunty, were caretakers in the early 1970s. Prunty died of natural causes in 1973. The Remount Ranch is famous as the place where author Mary O'Hara wrote the 1941 children's novel, 'My Friend Flicka.' The book mentions a mine shaft where animal carcasses from the ranch were dumped. Scott said he knew the mine his mother was talking about when she talked about disposing of Holtz's body because it was the same mine in the book. Walking out of the courtroom after testifying, Scott muttered to his mother: 'I hope it was all worth it.' Uden's attorney, Donald Miller, objected and Sharpe, who said he hadn't heard it, told the jury to disregard what Scott said.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Footballer Wayne Rooney is well-known for his fiery antics on and off the piich. And it seems his newest racehorse, Announcement, has been taken one too many tips from its owner. According to The Sun, Rooney has been forced to draft in help from an equine therapist to curb the filly's temper - after it broke a trainer's nose. Wayne Rooney, 28, with one of his retired horses, Switcharooney. The football star has sent his newest horse Annoucement to a horse behavioural expert after it lashed out and broke a trainer's nose . The 28-year-old striker employed Gary Witheford, an expert in dangerous and difficult horses, to try and calm the young racehorse down. Mr Witheford, 54, from Burbage, Wiltshire, told the paper Rooney's newest horse had 'pyschological issues'. He said: 'It would be an understatement to say she was highly strung. She has been really bad. 'Last week she even broke someone's nose.' Rooney, who recently retired two other horses, bought the three-year-old racehorse last month. He owns Announcement with his fellow Manchester United teammates Michael Carrick and Jonny Evans. Former teammate, and now Sunderland defender John O'Shea, also has a share. Gary Witheford, pictured with a grey stallion, is an expert in difficult and dangerous horses and said Announcement was 'highly strung' Pippy, pictured above, another of Rooney's horses, was forced to retire after a series of bad results - which included just one win . But stablehands found the young horse too hard to handle. They battled to get her into the stalls and she refused to stand still long enough to be saddled, the paper reports. Mr Witheford, who describes himself as having a 'unique insight into the psychology of the horse', used his own techniques to try and soothe the horse. The therapist uses his own bespoke techniques to deal with horses who have behavioural issues. Four-part share: Wayne Rooney, top left, Jonny Evans, top right, Michael Carrick, bottom left, and Gary O'Shea, bottom right, who all own a share in the fiesty young racehorse . Gary, 54, told the paper he was very pleased with the work he had done and said Announcement could be racing by mid-May. But the horse's problems are the latest setback for Rooney in his bumpy racehorse-owning career. Rooney and his wife Coleen's previous two horses, Pippy and Switcherooney, were retired in December after the pair managed just a single victory between them - a win by Pippy in August 2012 - in 23 starts. Horse fan Rooney, who has owned three other horses, enjoys a day at Chester races with his team mate, Danny Welbeck (right) Rooney with Paul Scholes, front left, Gary Neville, front right, and Rio Ferdinand, back right, at Chester races . It is not known how much Rooney paid for Announcement, but it is thought he invested £200,000 in his first few horses. He also had a third horse, Tomway, which he sold for £2,000. A source also told The Sun that Gary's bill for days of therapy is likely to be more than £1,000. But Announcement, who is being trained by Ian Williams, seems to be taking to the sport better than Rooney's other horses. Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, two of the four footballers which own the horse, training at Manchester United's ground in Carrington . Coleen Rooney at Ladies Day at Aintree Racecourt . She has already equalled Rooney's racing record by . winning only her second race at Thirsk, North Yorks. The horse also . finished fourth in her debut race at Kempton Park, Middlesex. It is believed the Rooneys paid a total of £40,000 a year to the Manor House Stables in . Cheshire for the horses to be trained and cared for. It is thought ex-teammate Michael Owen got the pair into the sport through the stables that he co-owns in Malpas, Cheshire. Owen founded Manor House Stables in 2007 and trainer Tom Dascombe joined two years later. The stables reported winnings of close to £700,000 for 2013 with over 50 victories in less than 12 months. Mr Dascombe also trains several horses owned by Michael Owen, under his company name Owen Promotions LTD.","Wayne Rooney bought Announcement last month with two teammates .

The vote will take place just after the May 22 European elections. Ukip is win the election - after consistently polling ahead of borth the Tories and Labour. This morning Mr Cameron was whether he laughed when Mr Farage was egged while campaigning on Thursday. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was pelted with an egg while on a visit to Nottingham . The PM suggested he had some sympathy becuase he had been attacked in the same way before. He said: 'I’ve been egged myself so I know. I was egged in Cornwall. Actually when an egg hits you, this is going to sound quite weedy, they hit you quite hard actually. I got one in the back. This was several years ago.' The PM then added: 'But it has solved the great riddle, what came first – the chicken or the egg? Because of course there was the big chicken story the day before.' The gag chided Mr Farage into an immediate response. He wrote on Twitter: 'If Cameron thinks I'm a chicken then no doubt he will challenge me to a TV debate and see if I refuse.' Mr Cameron's dig comes despite the Tories shying away from direct attacks on Ukip recently. The PM sparked controversy in 2006 after accusing Ukip supporters of being 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists'. The Newark by-election comes after the constituency's MP Mr Mercer stepped down on Tuesday. His decision came just days before he was due to be suspended from the Commons for six months for tabling a series of parliamentary questions for cash. He was caught in an undercover sting accepting £4,000 to put down the questions. Mr Mercer tabled five questions to government ministers and put down a parliamentary motion after being paid the cash as part of a contract he believed would earn him £24,000 a year. Parliamentary watchdog, the Commons Standards Committee, said Mr Mercer’s case was one of the worst cases in modern history. Mr Farage hit back at the jibe, insisting it was Mr Cameron who is 'chicken' Mr Cameron meets bricklayer Linette Pompey during a visit to the Parkgate development in Solihull . Launching the Tory campaign at a JCB construction vehicle plant in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, Mr Cameron took aim at his rivals: 'Frankly I don't need to discredit Ukip - they do a good enough job themselves. Their own leader admits they ""cannot change a thing in Brussels"". 'This is who we're up against: Labour - all short-term gimmicks and no long-term plan. Ukip - all talk and no delivery. 'The choice is clear: If you want a serious party with a credible long-term plan and a party that's delivering on that plan, then you only have one choice: you have got to vote Conservative.' Ahead of polls taking place in local councils across England, the Prime Minister said that the effects of recovery were being seen in all parts of the country. Mr Cameron launched the  Conservative European and local election campaign durnig a speech at JCB World Logistics Centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme . 'Britain is coming back,' he said. 'We came through the Great Recession together. We are building the Great British revival together. 'And all this didn't just happen. The economic pendulum didn't just swing our way. It's happening because of the people in this country who worked their hearts out, the businesses that hung on through the hard times and yes - it happened because this is a Government with a long-term economic plan to secure Britain's future. 'And we've got to be very clear. The Great British revival doesn't come with a life-time guarantee. The job is not done. If we want to keep making progress, keep creating jobs and securing this country's future, then we've got to carry on working through the plan. 'And coming up to these elections on May 22, this is what our message is all about. Conservatives are the ones with a long-term plan to secure Britain's future and we are delivering on that plan.' Mr Cameron sought to counter the growing appeal of Mr Farage's eurosceptic party by highlighting his own record of 'standing up' to Brussels by vetoing an EU treaty, cutting the budget and getting the UK out of the euro bailout scheme. The Tory plan for Europe had 'three words at its heart - Britain's national interest', he said. 'I have a track record of delivery - and believe me, whatever it takes, I will deliver this in-out referendum. Labour won't. Ukip can't. I will.'","Prime Minister makes joke at Ukip leader's expense during radio interview .

"By . Emily Crane . The teenager left scarred for life after he was speared through the head with a metal pole at a party has savaged two teenage girls who boasted about their link to his attacker. Liam Knight, 18, has branded two girls 'filth' and 'scum' after they boasted on social media that they invited the gatecrasher who impaled the rod in his head. He suffered lifelong brain injuries after a young man threw the almost 3m metal rod at him like a javelin at an 18th backyard birthday party at Forestville in Sydney's north in January last year. Road to recovery: Sydney teenager Liam Knight (pictured here at Downing Centre's District Court on Friday) was critically injured when he was pierced in the head by a metal rod at a party in January 2013 . The gatecrasher, 17, was found guilty on Friday but the two Sydney girls who invited him have not shown any remorse for Liam, the mother of the party's host Lisa Staples told the Daily Telegraph. Hours after the guilty verdict, the teenage girls posted a selfie on Instagram bragging that they were 'the girls that showed no remorse'. Filth and scum: The 18-year-old condemned the two girls, pictured here, for bragging about their link to his attacker . The photo reaped more than 100 likes from their friends and followers. 'I'd just like to point out that the two girls who invited the gatecrashers to the 18th where I was injured are absolute filth and the scum of the earth,' Liam, who now suffers from epilepsy and loss of motor function, wrote on Facebook. 'They are basically the reason I am disabled for the rest of my life and they think it is an absolute joke.' While Liam said he was angry at his attacker, he hated the two girls just as much. 'I hope you are happy with yourselves because you are the reason for the way I am today,' he said. Liam removed his hatred-filled post from Facebook last night. The girls, who cannot be named for legal reasons, apologised over the Instagram post after they were contacted by the Daily Telegraph yesterday. 'To the person who wrote the article and to everyone that read it, of course we are remorseful, what's occurred is a tragedy. There are many factors at play here. So please don't point the finger at us,'' one of the girls posted at online yesterday afternoon. Liam was at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court last Friday with his family to hear the verdicts of the two men accused of critically injuring him. Jimmy Angelo Tupou, 19, was cleared of any involvement. But Judge Ronald Solomon found the 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty. He will be sentenced in June. The 17-year-old arrived at the 18th birthday party at about 11pm before being told to leave because he wasn't invited, the court was told. He then climbed on the roof of a garden shed and began throwing building materials down into the crowd - among them was the metal rod that pierced Liam's skull. Family support: Liam was surrounded by his brothers and friends as he appeared in court on Friday to hear the verdict of his attackers . Liam was sedated by paramedics and firefighters were called in to cut the steel rod, before he was rushed to Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital. His mother Mary Knight told 60 Minutes last year that she couldn't believe Liam was still alive after seeing the CT scans of his head. 'When I saw the CT scan, I just couldn't believe it. Reality set in that it went right through his head â€” right through the brain,' she told the program. 'I'm thinking, how could he be alive?' Tough battle: Liam was left with brain damage, epilepsy and loss of motor function as a result of the attack last year .","Liam Knight suffered brain damage when he was pierced by a metal rod .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron has intervened in the UK’s biggest ever takeover, warning he is 'determined' to protect British jobs as US drugs giant Pfizer stepped up its bid for AstraZeneca. Viagra maker Pfizer said it hoped the new offer of £50 a share – up 7 per cent on a bid in January – would speed up a move towards a ‘combination’ between the two drugs firms, but UK-based AstraZeneca rejected the move. The Prime Minister revealed he had sought 'assurances' from Pfizer about protecting jobs, and insisted he would not allow an 'abject surrender' of a British firm. Viagra maker Pfizer stepped up its bid for British firm AstraZeneca, which employs more than 50,000 people around the world, including 6,700 in the UK . The proposed deal would is being driven by Pfizer’s desire to get its hands on Astra’s cancer unit, make cost savings and gain a foot in Britain to reduce its tax bills. Government sources point to George Osborne’s decision to cut corporation tax to 21 per cent this year – one of the lowest among leading economises – as one of the key reasons Pfizer wants to move some operations to the UK. In a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, Pfizer said it was committed to building Astra's planned research and development (R&D) hub in Cambridge and that 20 per cent of the combined company's research and development workforce will be in the UK. Mr Cameron spoke to AstraZeneca chairman, Leif Johansson, hot long after the firm rejected Pfizer's increased offer. Speaking at a Tory election campaign event in north Staffordshire, Mr Cameron said the Government had received 'robust' assurances from Pfizer. He said: 'My priority is absolutely clear - British jobs, British science, British inventiveness, British research and development. We are seeing a revival in those things and I want to see that go further. Downing Street revealed David Cameron has personally spoken to the head of AstraZeneca to highlight his 'determination' to protect British jobs . 'My job is to protect the United Kingdom's interests. I want to see great jobs in these industries here in Britain. 'That is why we have sought and received robust assurances from Pfizer were a deal to go ahead. 'But . it is not for us to endorse any deal, it is for us - the British . Government, the British Prime Minister - to fight hard for Britain's . interests and deliver Britain's interests. 'That is exactly what I will do. I will not make the mistakes of some previous governments. 'Outright . hostility, abject surrender - that's what you have seen in the past. What I am interested in is results for Britain and that's exactly what . you will see from our stance over this issue.' Officially the government does not have a . formal role in the deal, but Mr Osborne, Business Secretary Vince Cable . and Science Minister David Willetts have also been in regular contact with . the heads of both firms to press the need to protect British jobs and . skills. Chief executive Ian . Read said in the letter making the increased offer: ‘We believe the . industrial logic for a combination between Pfizer and AstraZeneca is . compelling.’ He said the deal would bring together ‘powerful and world-leading’ research expertise in key areas such as cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Mr Read said the takeover would create a ‘golden triangle’ of medical expertise in Oxford, Cambridge and London. Today Mr Willetts insisted he was pushing Pfizer in a 'very hard-nosed way' to protect jobs here. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is ultimately going to be a decision for AstraZeneca shareholders. 'We are pressing Pfizer in a very hard-nosed way. Their letter has a set of proposals for research and development and manufacturing in the UK that have moved a long way from where they were a week ago.' Us drugs giant Pfizer has cited Britain's lower tax regime for wanting to move operations to the UK . But Labour's shadow business secretary . Chuka Umunna warned Pfizer has a history for asset stripping in . previous takeovers., and this deal is being driven by wanting to take . advantage of lower tax rates in the UK. 'I've not spoken to anyone in the sector who has anything but grave reservations,' he told BBC Radio 4. Astra . employs more than 50,000 people around the world, including 6,700 in . the UK, but numbers are being reduced as it shifts its headquarters to . Cambridge, closing a research centre in Cheshire and offices in London. Pfizer . employs more than 70,000 people around the world, including 2,500 in . the UK, with 900 at its regional headquarters in Surrey. The . development came as Lord Heseltine, the former Tory Deputy Prime . Minister, voiced concern about the absence of a role for the government . in approving major takeovers. Lord Heseltine. former Tory Deputy Prime Minister, voiced concern that the government did not have power to intervene in big takeovers while Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the pharmaceutical sector has 'grave reservations' about the deal . The Conservative peer, who is an adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron on economic growth, said takeovers ‘could be very helpful’, but argued that Britain should do more to protect key national interests, such as the science base. He said ministers should have ‘reserve powers’ to protect British companies when crucial interests are at stake. ‘Foreign takeovers can often be hugely helpful and I have no doctrinal preoccupations - I've done enough takeovers of small businesses myself to know how valuable they can be,’ Lord Heseltine told the BBC. ‘But the important point is that every other advanced economy has mechanisms of some sort on a failsafe basis to scrutinise foreign takeovers and we're the only country that doesn't. ;I think that is a mistake and I think there are so many issues about the science base, about supply chains, about employment prospects that ought to be explored. ‘I don't see any way in which this can be adequately done unless the Government has reserve powers. ‘It's a question of where their headquarters are, where the decisions are taken, who determines what research is done and where, how much government money goes into supporting the science base within a co-operative arrangement, where the supply chains are going to be and what the motive is.’","US drugs giant makes new offer of £50 per share, up 7% on January bid .

"By . Dan Bloom . Few would argue Sir David Attenborough is one of the most trusted names in the BBC. But the 87-year-old has surprised his home town with a confession - that he 'cheated' in his school biology exam. Aged 17, the future broadcasting legend used his already impressive knowledge of the animal kingdom to work out which animal would be used in a dissection test. Popular: Sir David Attenborough has revealed he once 'cheated' in the equivalent of his A-levels . His class at Wyggeston Grammar School, Leicester, had been told they would be experimenting either on a rabbit, dogfish, crayfish, frog or earthworm. But because it was during the Second World War and people ate rabbits and dogfish, he knew he could count them out. Specimen: Sir David fished crayfish from a stream . Then he had a stroke of luck when a caretaker brought in a metal tin with the words 'zoology practical' unwisely written on the side. Sir David told the Leicester Mercury: 'When I got the chance I picked it up and shook it. It . rattled so I knew it was crayfish. 'I knew where I could get crayfish - . the stream at [nearby] Bradgate Park, so I headed there. I told all the other . boys.' They then fished crayfish out of the stream and practiced dissection on them to finesse their skills. The move clearly paid off. Not only did Sir David and his friends win distinctions in the exam - which was the equivalent of a modern A-level exam - but their teacher also said they were the most brilliant class he had ever had. Sir David made the confession as he revisited the park, a former Medieval deer hunting ground which is now run by a charitable trust. He was there to help the local Rotary Club launch an appeal to raise Â£150,000 to turn an old barn into a visitor centre. There was good reason for choosing the TV naturalist for the event - as Sir David's father was once the president of the Rotary Club of Leicester. He told the BBC: 'Bradgate is a very important part of my childhood... We came here as a family up onto those rocks, onto the tower, paddling in the stream. 'It was a vision of what the English countryside could be like and it's stayed with me forever.'","Broadcaster, 87, spoke of his time aged 17 at grammar school in Leicester .

"By . Steve Nolan . Two footballers have been charged with fraud as part of an ongoing police investigation into alleged match fixing. Michael Boateng and Hakeem Adelakun, both 22, were among seven members of an alleged betting syndicate arrested on suspicion of fixing games last month. They are accused of conspiring to defraud bookmakers by placing bets and then influencing the outcome of football matches. Michael Boateng, left, and Hakeem Adelakun, right, are the footballers charged with fraud in connection with match fixing allegations . The pair, who both play for Brighton-based Conference South team Whitehawk FC, were charged with conspiracy to defraud contrary to common law, the National Crime Agency confirmed today. Boateng, a defender who joined Whitehawk in the summer following spells with Newport County, Bristol Rovers and Sutton United, and Adelakun, who has previously played for Crystal Palace and Carshalton, were both bailed. They will appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court next week. An NCA spokesman said: 'The Crown Prosecution Serviceâ€™s Organised Crime Division found sufficient evidence and was satisfied it was in the public interest to authorise charges.' Boateng and Adelakun are the third and fourth men to be charged with the same offence following their arrests last week. Allegations: Former Bolton striker Delroy Facey, pictured, was reportedly one of the men arrested last week . Chann Sankaran, 33, and Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan, 43, appeared at Cannock Magistrates' Court and were remanded in custody. Three other men have been bailed pending further enquiries. The group were initially arrested following an investigation by the Telegraph newspaper. The maximum sentence the men could face is 10 years in prison.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Power giants who are hitting customers with price rises of around ten per cent are only paying 1.7 per cent more for the energy they’re selling. Figures from the energy regulator, Ofgem, show that the wholesale cost of energy has risen by just £10 per household in the past year to an average of £610. However, most bills are due to rise by more than £120 to almost £1,500. Dark times: Ofgem figures reveal that the average profit margin made by the energy firms has more than doubled in the past year from £45 to £95 per customer . The same Ofgem figures reveal that the average profit margin made by the energy firms has more than doubled in the past year from £45 to £95 per customer. The figures show an average annual energy bill of £1,320 in October. The average margin of £95 equates to 7.1 per cent for the six firms. The revelations leave suppliers open to allegations of profiteering as their bosses prepare to face a grilling today by MPs over price rises. Any suggestion that increases have been driven by a desire to cash in rather than an increase in costs will infuriate customers. Charities have predicted some 24,000 deaths as a result of medical problems made worse by living in cold conditions. Today a further study suggests eight in ten people will be rationing their energy use this winter. Energy costs are the top household worry for nine in ten consumers, ahead of the rising cost of food (75 per cent),  and petrol prices (66 per cent). The figures were collated by price comparison firm uSwitch.com, whose consumer spokesman, Ann Robinson, warned of an energy bills crisis. ‘This  winter we will be seeing even more going without adequate heating for fear of racking up a bill they cannot afford,’ she said. ‘The Government has got to get competition working as this is the only way we will get to see fairer pricing.’ Dangerous decisions: Charities have predicted some 24,000 deaths as a result of medical problems made worse by living in cold conditions . Ofgem is responsible for regulating the . energy market; ensuring there is strong competition and that customers . are not being ripped off. Mr Cameron has announced an investigation into whether there is effective competition in the energy market. Downing Street is thought to be looking at replacing Ofgem with a watchdog with more teeth. Yesterday, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman refused to give Ofgem a whole-hearted endorsement, raising questions about its future. Asked if the regulator was doing a good job, he would only say: ‘Ofgem has an important role.’ Labour’s energy spokesman, Caroline Flint, seized on the Big Six’s rising profit margins to accuse ministers of failing consumers. ‘If energy companies won’t treat their customers fairly, then people deserve tough action from the Government,’ she said. The left-leaning IPPR think tank said the profit margins taken by the energy suppliers are too high. Associate director, Will Straw, said: ‘Profits in other sectors like supermarkets are as low as 2 per cent.’ Chief executive of Energy UK, which speaks for the industry, Angela Knight, said firms have faced higher wholesale price rises than the ‘theoretical calculation set out by Ofgem’. Miss Knight said big increases in green taxes and the cost of government eco schemes were also responsible for price rises. Ofgem insisted that its figures were reliable. Experts at Which? say they have come up with measures that could slash £1.8billion from annual energy bills. The consumer group’s action plan includes halting the roll-out of smart meters and removing the cost of the Warm Home Discount, a system of grants for the poor, from energy bills. Which? also calls for the break-up of the energy market so the supply and sale of power are no longer controlled by the same small group of firms.","Figures from energy regulator Ofgem show the wholesale cost of energy has gone up by just £10 per household but bills are due to rise by more than £120 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Looking for the perfect partner using online dating sites can be like searching for a needle in a haystack. And while apps such as Tinder allow people to sift through potential dates by looks, a new app lets single people search for love by putting personality first. Twine Canvas claims to be the first ‘flirting and dating’ app where brains come before beauty. Scroll down for video . Brains before beauty: Twine Canvas claims to be the first ‘flirting and dating’ app where people choose whether they are attracted to someone based on their interests instead of their looks. If they are impressed by a person's 'canvas' of hobbies (pictured left) they can show their interest and if it is reciprocated, they can chat . Single users create a 'canvas' instead of using a photo of themselves, to entice would-be dates. The collage of images is designed to show their personality and interests. Essential data such as a person's age, location and sex is shown and lets people filter app users. Users can show their interest in someone's canvas and if it is reciprocated, they can start chatting. They can also see photos of each other at this point, to check there is physical attraction. The app’s developers claim the system lets people make ‘real connections’ instead of being seduced by looks alone. It matches people according to their personalities and interests in the first instance, and only lets them see what their would-be date looks like later on. California-based developer Spoonjuice, said the free iPhone app is ‘built to help you match with people based on interesting personalities, not just cute faces.’ Instead of choosing a photo to entice people to click on their dating profile, users create a ‘canvas’ of images reflecting their personality and interests, as well as filling in essential data such as their age and location. The pictures are not designed to give different views of a person’s appearance, but rather pick out activities such as favourite locations, meals and random items like Christmas trees or graffiti to pique the interest of the possible partners. The anti Tinder? Twine Canvas only lets users see photos of one another - and allows people to start chatting - once they like each other, based upon their canvas of interests (pictured left). The app also suggests questions to ask based on people's hobbies to get a conversation started (pictured right) They can then choose the gender, location and age of potential dates and browse through other nearby users’ collages. Like Tinder, where users either like or dislike a person’s appearance to decide whether someone can contact them or not, singletons of Twine Canvas can like someone’s canvas and can contact each other if the feeling is mutual. However, unlike Tinder Twine Canvas only lets users see photos of one another – and let people start chatting – once they like each other. The app’s developers claim the system lets people make ‘real connections’ instead of being seduced by looks alone. It also has an ‘ice breaker’ function to suggest questions to ask one another based upon mutual interests, such as ‘who is your favourite fashion designer?’ and ‘what’s the weather like in Palo Alto?’","Twine Canvas claims to be the first ‘flirting and dating’ app where brains come before beauty .

"By . Chris White In Los Angeles . Shelly Sterling is as racist as her husband Donald and their separation is a fake to save him from losing the LA Clippers. That's the shocking claim of long time ex-family friend Cheryl Bogart. According to Bogart, Shelly is Sterling’s ‘right-hand man,’ and runs his affairs ‘like a brothel.’ Earlier this week, Bogart and her brother, Phillip Scheid, revealed exclusively to MailOnline that Donald Sterling paraded around his mansions naked, threw around racist remarks to his kids and their friends, claimed Christians are stupid and beat his own son, . Twisted: Former family friend Cheryl Bogart claims that Shelly Sterling, seen here with Donald Sterling at a Los Angeles Police Awards Dinner in August 2011 is as racist, and that her separation from the Clippers owner is a fake . Explosive claim: Ms Bogart says Shelly is Sterling's 'right-hand man' and runs his affairs 'like a brothel' Explosive claim: Ms Bogart says Shelly is Sterling's 'right-hand man' and runs his affairs 'like a brothel' So far, Shelly has managed to ride on the wave of public sympathy. Former LA Clippers player Ron Harper even said: “The only bad part is I know how much his wife loves the team and mostly I feel sad for her.’ But Cheryl says that no one should have sympathy for Shelly; she’s just as bad as her husband. The 37-year-old Cheryl, who has known Shelly all her life, says: ‘She was very well aware of the racist issues. The fact that she’s saying she wasn’t is a lie. She’s Donald’s right hand man. They’ve been married 50 years. You don’t think she’s aware of this? 'It’s a joke. She’s a liar. I don’t know why the Clippers and manager are sticking up for her, I know Shelly. ‘She’s totally a racist. When you live with someone for that long, how can you not be aware? There are court documents saying she called someone a “black motherf*****r""' Court documents discovered by the Los Angeles Times name Shelly as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the couple by their former tenants, with one African American resident claiming that she called him a 'black motherf*****' during an argument. Establsihed pattern: According to the ex-friend, Sterling always comes back to his wife after his daliances, and the two of them then sue his paramours as it happened with V. Stiviano (right) Cheryl says the Clippers know that Shelly is a racist too. ‘She’s trying to come out of this whiter than white, but she’s as dirty as him. It doesn’t take a genius to work that out. ‘When they say they’ve been separated, that’s so ridiculous. The only times they’re separated is if one is at their Malibu home and the other in Beverly Hills. They’ve never been apart. ‘They’re making out like they’re separated and doing everything they can for the sake of the team and for themselves. They don’t have any plans for divorce, no way. ""After all the things that have happened to them, all the stuff she knows, all the secrets, you understand what I’m saying? There’s too much stuff they’ve done together and against people that could ever be made public. She will never divorce him. ‘One day she says my husband is racist, prejudice, and she doesn’t share those views, then the next she’s at a steakhouse with him saying: “No he’s not a racist.” That just shows her character. It’s black and white.’ Cheryl claims that Sterling even asked Cheryl’s mother, Terri, a top realtor in Beverly Hills, to lie for him during his lawsuit against mistress Alexandra Castro, whom he paid $500 a pop  to have sex with during from 1999 to 2002. Sterling had transferred title of a Rodeo Drive property to Castro and her mother, but he sued to get it back after Castro broke off their relationship. Cheryl, who’s writing a book on her experiences in Beverly Hills, says that the lying and suing mistresses is all part of the game for the Sterlings. Cheryl says: ‘Alexandra Castro was one of my mom’s really best friends, Donald Sterling asked my mother to lie and perjure herself for him. Donald told her that he could make her very rich and to remember this and put it in your pocket for another day. Shelly Sterling tried to warn Terri, pictured far right next to her son son Phillip and daughter Cheryl, about speaking to the press . To legally transfer the house into the names of Alexandra Castro and her mother  they needed a realtor. They did it through Terri. Donald Sterling gave the house to Alexandra, no money changed hands apart from fees to Terri. When Alexandra dumped Sterling, he tried to sue her and claim that she took the house from him. This was 2003 and it went to court. Sterling asked Terri to lie on his behalf and say that he didn’t give the house to Alexandra. She refused. He lost the case and ended up paying out to Alexandra. While it was Donald Sterling who sued Castro, Cheryl explains, it was Shelly who was instrumental in him suing her. He gets caught with his pants down, lavishes gifts on his mistresses, then goes running back to his wife telling tales, then they sue whoever it is. It’s happened with Castro and with V. Stiviano. ‘They love doing this, there’s a pattern. It's like she's running a brothel and she likes it. She knows her husband is doing these things with these women, then he'll come and complain to her, then she'll sue them. 'We only know about these two, but how many others do we not know about? There could have potentially been more, but it's been buried away. They’re really, really good at making things disappear.’ Earlier this week, Cheryl and her brother, Phillip Scheid, spoke about the devastation the Sterling family had caused to their own lives. In 2005, Cheryl was left in a wheelchair after she was drugged and fell out of a window at a party where Sterling’s son Scott was dealing drugs. Six years earlier, wayward Scott had blasted his former best friend Phillip, 34, in the back and legs 12 times with a shotgun. Scott eventually died of a drug overdose on New Year’s Day last year. Strong words: Cheryl claims that Shelly Sterling deserves no sympahy because she is just as racist as her husband, pictured here in 2011 next to boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr at a Clippers game . Bizarrely, even though the families have had their legal and personal battles, they’ve always remained entwined, with Cheryl’s mom Terri still speaking to Shelly. Cheryl says that the Sterlings have been controlling her family like ‘animals locked in a cage’ for the last twenty years. Shelly even spoke to Terri on the day that her children spoke out about their bitter experiences and tried to warn them against speaking to the press. ‘Shelly and mom talked this week. Mom had 16 reporters on her and she called Shelly, who said: “Why are they calling you? You’re not the NBA.” Shelly said she would take care of us in the future. This is just absurd. She just always promises things and it never happens. Deceit: Sterling allegedly asked Cheryl's mother to lie for him during his lawsuit against mistress Alexandra Castro (pictured right) ‘Mom asked her what she should do and Shelly said: “Now that is everything is out, don’t talk to the press, as they’ll investigate you.” She was trying to gag the family once again. I feel like we’ve had duct tape on our mouths, we all feel we don’t have to hide anymore. They’ve manipulated and controlled our family. ‘My mom was scared, every time she gets scared, she calls Shelly, which is the wrong thing to do. She still feels Shelly is her extended mother even though she’s done nothing for her. She’s like a wicked mother. She’s so much older than my mom, who looked up to her. ‘I’m not happy that my mom is contacting her. My mom has been manipulated by Shelly; she’s the master manipulator. She tries to make my mom feel good for the moment and, because she’s a really good person, she falls for it. She doesn’t know any other way. ‘Shelly’s so selfish and a liar. She’s been saying this stuff for years, that she’ll take care of us. She said she’d give me an apartment in Chinatown, why would you offer me this? She offered me the apartment building during the time I was suing her family for putting me in a wheelchair. I just thought it was so bizarre, it didn’t make any sense to offer this on the side. ‘We were scared. They had so much power, they made sure we kept our mouths shut, we were just like animals locked in a cage. I’m happy to be unlocked from all of this and now we can finally heal.’","Long time Sterling family friend Cheryl Bogart claims that Shelly Sterling is a secret racist who 100 percent knew about her husband’s views on blacks and shares his views .

Scroll down for video . Clear message: Backpacks emblazoned with 'FR Strong' have been sent to students at Franklin Regional High School, near Pittsburgh . Thoughtful: The car dealership that distributed the backpacks described them as a small gesture . Injured: Victim Brett Hurt, center, who suffered a bruised lung in the attack, was on the verge of tears as he used a wheelchair to navigate the hallways . Back: Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville re-opened to students on April 15 for a walk-through ahead of the resumption of classes . The car dealership described the backpacks as a small gesture, according to CBS Pittsburg. The horrific attack at the school on April 9 left 20 students and a security guard stabbed or slashed. One student almost died after one of the knives narrowly missed his heart. Two of the wounded students remain hospitalized. Suspect . Alex Hribal, 16, is being held in a juvenile facility but is charged as . an adult with aggravated assault and attempted homicide. Police have said he took the knives and attacked students at random as they arrived at school. Classes resumed on April 16 with some students . gathering beforehand on the football field to pray and to support one . another. After that, as day . broke and other students drove to school - or were driven on buses or by . their parents - they were greeted by well-wishers from a nearby church . who were holding signs of support saying things like ‘Courage’ and ‘It's . a new day’. Warning signs: Suspect Alex Hribal, 16, is led from his arraignment after he was charged with four counts of attempted murder as an adult. Authorities believe he threatened two students before carrying out the attack on April 16 . No motive has yet been provided by authorities in the April 6 attack that allegedly saw Hribal run through the school wielding two eight-inch kitchen knives . Terror: Twenty one students were injured in April 16's blood bath, as well as a security guard. The two students Hribald allegedly threatened were not injured . Evacuation: Students at Franklin Regional High School were evacuated after the stabbing. Karen Ingersoll said she has two children who graduated from the school and two daughters still attend it. ‘I think they were ready to go back,’ Ms Ingersoll said at the time, though she acknowledged there's more healing to come. ‘My . youngest can't sleep alone yet, she's still sleeping with her sister - . she was a witness to some of the attacks’, she said. On April 14, teachers met with a crisis intervention specialist . before spending the day at the school before the students returned. The following . day parents and students were invited to an open house where . they were able to tour the building, which had to be cleaned after the . bloody attack. Members of the community gathered at a park on the . Tuesday night for a prayer service. Students . at the middle and elementary schools, which share a campus with the . high school, returned to classes a day after the attack. Sophomore student Alex Hribal, 16, (pictured here in his high school yearbook) will be charged as an adult on several attempted murder charges . Transported: Hribal is driven away from a district magistrate in a Westmoreland County Sheriff's car after he was arraigned . Some returning students were nervous about reliving the frantic experience. Michael Spila, who was stabbed in the back, said he was concerned he might have flashbacks. 'Mentally, I'm still shocked from what happened,' he told WPXI. 'I . was kind of nervous because I was afraid I might start freaking out or . something because you don't know what would happen if you walked in and . had flashbacks. And luckily nothing happened.' Gracey . Evans, watched in horror as Hribal allegedly plunged a knife into the . back of her friend Brett Hurt while he bravely shielded her during the . stabbing spree. 'It was . different — but a good different,' the 17-year-old junior told NBC News . of returning to the scene of the attack. Ms Evans . and friends gathered around Mr Hurt and linked arms for a photograph. The . students waited for the 16-year-old, who suffered a bruised lung in the . attack, to arrive so they could go in together, showing him their . support.

Prayers: Ashlin (L) and Jude Burkhart, from Murrysville, hold candles during a prayer vigil for victims of the Franklin Regional High School stabbing rampage, at Calvary Lutheran Church in Murrysville, Pennsylvania on April 9, 2014 . Evans said Mr Hurt was on the verge of tears and had to use a wheelchair to navigate the halls. The students spoke with several teachers who were there when the early morning stabbing unfolded. They told the teens they were sorry about what happened and provided tissues and candles in all classrooms. 'It's hard for them,' Ms Evans said of the teachers, 'but harder for us.' Counselors and therapy dogs were on campus to help students through the day. Hribal is revealed to have written a note saying he couldn't wait to . see the 'helpless looks' on students' faces when they realise 'their . precious lives are going to be taken' and that he fought off students . who tried to stop him. 'No, I . am not dropping them (knives), my work is not done I have more people . to kill,' Hribal was overheard saying by Vice Principal Samuel King, . according to an affidavit. Police . say the note was found in Hribal's locker. They say it was dated . April 6, three days before the rampage at the school near Pittsburgh. Details . about the note are contained in the criminal complaint filed against . Hribal that increases the number of attempted homicide charges he faces . to 21, up from four. 'I . can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the . students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realise their . precious lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that is a . plebeian,' the note said.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Gripping new reality TV show Southern Charm wrapped its first season last Monday with a shocking baby bombshell, and millions of its eager viewers are waiting with baited breath for tonight's reunion episode, hoping some important questions will be answered. In a surprise twist at the end of last week's finale, it was revealed that Thomas Ravenel, 51, and his 22-year-old girlfriend Kathryn Dennis - who the last we knew had broken up - had actually welcomed their first child together, baby Kensington Calhourn Ravenel. In the last nine months since the cameras stopped rolling, a reconciliation clearly occurred between the troubled pair after they learned they were expecting, and they now appear to be thriving in a state of parental bliss, with Thomas posting gushing photos of his new daughter Kensington to his Facebook account. Doting dad: Thomas Ravenel, 51, (left), star of new reality TV show Southern Charm, proudly introduces his first child, baby Kensington, (right) on Facebook with the caption 'I'm raising a future captain of industry!' Since the cameras packed up and left, the couple began shacking up in Palm Beach, Florida after spending last summer in the Hamptons. Last week's finale introduced baby Kensington to its shocked viewers in the last minute of the episode, following straight after footage of Thomas dumping his philanderess girlfriend after she admitted to sleeping with his friend, Whitney. The . last scene of the finale, however, was tranquil and the parents looked entirely content. Normally lithe . Kathryn's baby weight added to the feeling that things settled down for . the duo as they entered into parenthood. Cute as a button: Little Kensington Calhoun Ravenel, now five weeks old, was born on March 24th, seen here in the first photo her father Thomas shared of her on Facebook . Surprise! Kathryn Dennis, 22, (right),  the new mother and much younger girlfriend of Thomas, swaps gleeful expressions with baby Kensington (left) Southern mini-belle: Little Kensington (pictured)'s arrival was a shock to viewers, who last saw her parents Thomas and Kathryn break up at the end of the first season's finale . But missing from the footage is any indication of what happened between the breakup and birth. Things didn't look good for young Kathryn when the finale opened with foppish Whitney finally confessing to Thomas that he had slept with his friend's then 21-year-old flame-haired girlfriend. Thomas forgave his chum but wanted Kathryn to come clean without his prodding. Hands on father: Thomas, who had previously experienced a false pregnancy alarm with Kathryn during an earlier episode, realized he wanted a baby 'for real' - and happily, he got his wish soon after . Vocal: 'Kensington is starting to make her needs known - I need ear plugs!' Thomas exclaimed during a recent interview . Missing mom: Bundle of joy: Kathryn shared this photo of her 'sweet pea' over the weekend during a flyby visit to New York with Thomas . 'We never had anything serious,' Kathryn said as she and Thomas got ready for Whitney's long anticipated July 4th soiree. The . rest of the gang managed to get through the party without scrapping . with outsider Kathryn, but it was when she and Thomas returned home that . tempers truly flared. After a heated argument, she admits to Thomas: 'I hooked up with Whitney.' New York moment: Thomas (front left) shared this snap of the cast of Southern Charm at a hip Meatpacking restaurant last week . New life: In last week's finale, the couple (pictured) appeared happy and relaxed as they settled into their new roles as parents . Darling: The adorable baby girl has one of her mother's family names, Calhoun, as a middle name in honor of ancestor John Calhoun, the seventh vice president . Devoted: One scene showed Thomas cradling his baby girl, with a monogrammed spit up cloth tossed over his shoulder . The secret was out and the couple broke up shortly after a July 4th party at Whitney's new apartment. Baby weight: Kathryn showed off a fuller figure following the birth of her first baby . But the show's vixen was harboring another secret that leaked a week before the finale aired, and was finally shown to the world last Monday. While the credits rolled, viewers were introduced to the baby girl they welcomed March 24th. Judging . from what was shown, Kathryn did not know she was pregnant when Thomas . dumped her, citing their 29 year age gap through his tears. She . fled his Charleston home barefoot, clutching a few possessions and her . laptop as her much older boyfriend chased her down for a last hug. Prior to the break-up, Thomas and Kathryn, made headlines for a previous pregnancy false alarm, which became a major story . arc in the first season. Kathryn's pregnancy . scare was all the more dramatic when it remained unclear if it was Thomas who was the . potential father or another of her conquests, fellow star and self-proclaimed rascally raconteur, . Shep Rose. Lucky for everyone, except perhaps the show's rabid fans, Kathryn did not end up being pregnant that time. While Thomas seemed extremely relieved when his gal pal's test came back negative, he told BravoTV's The Dish that he felt the opposite when he met his bouncing baby girl in March. 'I hooked up with Whitney': Tempers had flared . earlier in the finale episode when Thomas (left) finally got a tearful Kathryn (right) to admit she had . slept with Whitney, leading to a dramatic break up scene . Drama: She fled his house and ran to her Mercedes barefoot, clutching her laptop, after he delivered what seemed to be a final blow to their pairing . 'It's really a blessing,' he said. 'It's one of the greatest creations one could ever hope to be a part of!' In fact, it was the scare itself that showed Thomas just how much having a baby with Kathryn would mean to him. 'I'm . getting on in my age and I wanted a child,' he said. 'And after we had . wrapped up shooting in Charleston, we had both decided we wanted to have . a baby for real. We both love each other and care about each other.' Tears: Thomas came back inside, kept sobbing, and sat in a chair and the credits rolled. It seemed their relationship with done for good, as well as season one of Southern Charm . The new mom is doing well, too, Thomas said. 'She . has tremendous motherly instincts,' he said. 'She's been constantly . reading books about babies and doing her homework. She is all over her . new responsibilities. 'She has the energy and the mindset to make sure the baby is well taken care of. I've really grown to respect and admire her.' Fertile for ground for drama: Kathryn and Thomas in an earlier episode which showed the couple in a doctor's office as they anxiously awaited Kathryn's pregnancy test results - which turned out to be negative . So will the happy couple be getting married any time soon? 'We've been talking about it,' he said. 'Eventually I'd like to get married. All I can say is stay tuned.' For now, they're just focused on learning to be parents. 'Kensington . is starting to make her needs known - I need ear plugs,' he said. 'But . everyone's healthy and happy and we're just blessed.' Arrests: Thomas once served months in . prison on felony cocaine charges and recently pleaded guilty to a DUI. And this 2012 mugshot of Kathryn was . snapped after she was hauled in for underage alcohol possession . Despite not initially being a main cast member, Kathryn's presence on . the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama, . intrigue and southern seduction. When the local celebutante, political . scion and model was hauled into Berkeley County jail for underage . drinking and disorderly conduct in 2012, authorities snapped the sexy . mugshot of the century. For fans wondering how Kathryn got to . join the soapy series' main cast members in their drunken antics: the 5ft 11in redhead turned 21 by the time she showed up to heighten the . show's already impossibly high drama. Earlier times: Kathryn (right) caused a stir when she first made an appearance on the show as a minor character, and proceeded to turn Thomas' (right) life upside down . And Kathryn . may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate . developer turned felon Thomas, even with the 30-year age gap. Like Kathryn, Thomas also has a history of booze-fueled lawbreaking. He pleaded guilty just last March to driving drunk while summering in East Hampton, New York last July. The . former Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign chairman had his license . suspended for six months and was fined $1,400, according to the Post and . Courier. Tonight's reunion episode airs on Brave at 10pm.","Former South Carolina Treasurer Thomas Ravenel welcomed a baby girl with Kathryn Dennis on March 24th .

"By . James  Nye . A one-year-old boy has died in North Carolina after being viciously mauled by the family rottweiler in front of his five-year-old brother. Little Nyhiem Wilfong was attacked in his grandfather's yard on Monday in Caldwell County by the 100 pound dog named Kobe. Family members and animal control officers said that the dog was found still tied up when they arrived and they suspect that the two brothers had set the tragic chain of events off by trying to play with the dog. Scroll Down for Video . Tragedy: Nyhiem Wilfong died when the family rottweiler attacked him on Monday at his grandfather's home in North Carolina . Grandfather Ervin Patterson said that he first became aware of the mauling when he heard his five-year-old grandson scream for help. The two brothers were at their grandfather's home because their mom was out looking for a job. 'He said, ‘Papa the dog is on the baby.’ So I jumped up off the bed and ran up there to get him.  I called 911 and tried to do CPR but I couldn't do nothing else for him,' Ervin Patterson said to WSOCTV.com . After the attack, Nyhiem's family rushed him to the bathroom after dialing 911 and when paramedics arrived they said the toddler had serious injuries to his head and chest. Dangerous: Kobe the rottweiler is facing an uncertain fate after mauling one-year-old Nyhiem Wilfong to death on Monday . 'They went to the swing set and I just assumed that's where they were at because I was washing dishes,' said grandmother Shirley Patterson. Nyhiem's great-grandmother said that the last time anyone saw the brothers they were by a swing and not the dog. 'It could have been a territorial thing. Unfortunately, and I know his sounds crazy, the dog could have been playing with the child,' said Greg Greene with Caldwell County Animal Control. Kobe the rottweiler was taken to an animal control pound after the attack and has been quarantined. Distraught: Ervin Patterson revealed he tried everything to save his grandson on Monday . Patterson admitted he had only owned the dog for a few weeks and doesn't know now whether the dog will be destroyed. He said that he wanted to let other parents know never to take your eyes off your children. 'Just watch. Just watch. That's all I can say. Watch your babies. It was an accident that's all,' Ervin said to WSOCTV.com . Sheriff’s deputies said their investigation is still ongoing in this case.","Nyhiem Wilfong was with his brother, 5, in their grandfather's backyard when his rottweiler launched an attack .

But she is now looking forward to a double celebration as she prepares to graduate from high school this week. Grace Bush, 16, received her bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the Florida Atlantic University on Friday - a week before she graduated from high school . The teenager told CBS Miami: 'It's kind of weird that I graduated college before high school.' Grace, who says she would like to become chief justice of the United States, managed to complete the four-year degree in just three years with a 3.8 grade point average. She took advantage of her school's dual enrolment programme, which allows students to earn credit for degree courses while studying at school. Grace plays the flute in two orchestras during her free time and hopes to study for a master's degree after the summer before continuing on at law school. In May last year, MailOnline reported how a Georgia teenager who was homeless for most of her time at school credited hard work for being made valedictoria of her graduating class. Chelsea Fearce, from Clayton County, said: 'I just told myself to keep working, because the future will not be like this anymore.'

Grace plays the flute in two orchestras during her free time and hopes to study for a master's degree after the summer before continuing on at law school . Miss Fearce, who was 17 at the time, did so well at Charles Drew High School that she will start college as a junior in the fall. 'Worry about being a little hungry sometimes, go hungry sometimes. You just have to deal with it. You eat what you can, when you can,' the teenager, who achieved a 4.466 GPA, told WSBTV. And in June 2012, it was reported that David Boone had gone from sleeping on a park bench to one of Harvard's dorm rooms after he was accepted to the university.

"By . James  Nye . A 25-year-old Occupy Wall Street protester dubbed the 'queen of non-violence' was found guilty on Monday of assaulting a police officer during a demonstration two years ago and now faces up to seven years in prison. Student, Cecily McMillan, was charged with deliberately elbowing an officer in the eye as police cleared people out of the movement's home base, Zuccotti Park, at Occupy's six-month anniversary in March 2012. Dressed in court wearing a white dress and blazer she was was cuffed and led away as her supporters scream 'Shame! Shame! Shame!' as she was led out of the Manhattan court room. Sentenced: Cecily McMillan (L) and attorney Martin R Stolar are pictured together during a press conference before her appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York, New York on 07 April 2014 . Her defense team had claimed she was startled and knocked the officer accidentally after he groped her left breast from behind, leaving her bruised. McMillan, who has worked for years as an activist, was ordered held without bail following the three-week trial in Manhattan. She faces up to seven years in prison at her May 19 sentencing, although she could get probation. The jury, made up of 8 women and 4 men, convicted the 25-year-old of felony charges after deliberating for a little more than 2½ hours. McMillan was arrested along with scores of others on March 17, 2012. While thousands of people were arrested during Occupy protests in 2011 and 2012, most of those cases were dismissed, some were resolved out of court and just 67 have gone to trial. McMillan is one of 56 people to be convicted at trial, while another 11 people have been acquitted. Bovell suffered 'swelling and bruising and substantial pain to his left eye' as a result of the incident, according to court documents. The 25-year-old student activist, was arrested two years ago during the Occupy Wall Street movement for assaulting a police officer and was found guilty on Monday May, 5, 2014 . The city had evicted Occupy's Zuccotti Park encampment four months earlier, but activists gathered there in March 2012 to celebrate the six-month mark. Around 11:30 p.m., officers told people to leave so the park could be cleaned, adding that they could return afterward, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Shanda Strain said during opening remarks. She said McMillan screamed at police and refused to go, so an officer escorted her out with hands on the back of her shoulder. When he turned his head, she crouched, jumped up and hit his eye with her elbow, according to the prosecutor. 'Cecily McMillan thought she could get away with assaulting a police officer by shielding herself in the name of protest,' Strain said. Moment of arrest: This is the moment that Cecily McMillan was arrested on March 17, 2012 in Manhattan . But McMillan's defense says she left the park promptly when told to go and then was suddenly gripped from behind, unaware it was an officer touching her. Her supporters have said she later had a seizure or anxiety attack as police dragged her. 'She’s on her way out when somebody she doesn’t know grabs her by the right breast, yanks her up,' said attorney Martin Stolar. 'The next thing she knows, she’s down on the ground. 'Reacting to being grabbed by a stranger is not a crime,' said one of her lawyers, Rebecca Heinegg. Defense lawyer Martin Stolar told the Daily News on Monday the judge committed numerous errors during the trial and that McMillan would appeal.","An Occupy Wall Street activist was convicted on Monday of assaulting a police officer in Manhattan .

"Sharain Spruill revealed that her son's accused killer carried her daughter to her home claiming a white man was to blame . The 16-year-old boy is accused of assaulting Spruill's daughter and bashing her son to death . By . Daily Mail Reporters . A Virginia mother whose 8-year-old son was brutally murdered as he tried to protect his sister from being raped revealed on Monday more horrific details of the night she lost her brave boy. Sharain Spruill recounted the horrifying moment on May 1 when a 16-year-old boy carried her bloody daughter, 12, to her home claiming she and little Marty Cobb had been attacked by a white man. But it was that same boy, whose name has not been released, who's now been formally charged with strangling Marty and beating him to death, possibly with a brick. Mommy's hero: Sharain Spruill (left), whose daughter was allegedly raped and her son Marty Cobb (right) killed last week (shown here at a May 3 vigil) revealed Monday that the suspect initially told her that a white man was to blame for the attacks . The new details came Monday as Spruill addressed reporters and community members outside the Richmond house Marty once called home and described her daughter's horrified tears as she revealed the boy was dead. Family and friends say are hailing Martin as a hero, saying he tried to protect his big sister. 'As soon as he could talk, I told (him) he's the man of the house. That's what he did. He's a hero,' his mother told The Associated Press. 'I told him he's the man of the house.' His mother, sitting on the front steps of her home, said her son was a second grader and ""a mama's boy"" who didn't talk much to other people. His tiny stature masked a fighting spirit, she said. A few feet away in the front yard, a memorial carried that message, saying in part: ""A Real Hero Lived, Fought and Died Here."" The wooden sign was draped with the boy's parka, surrounded by stuffed animals and toys. His mother said her son had open-heart surgery when he was 3 months old and doctors said he wasn't going to make it. Neighbor Andrew Patillo, said the boy looked more like he was 4 or 5 years old. 'He had a big heart to be that small,' Patillo said. Tragic: Sharain Spruill, the mother of Martin Cobb, is surrounded by family during his prayer vigil on Saturday . Tribute: Diamonte Scott, six, stands with his grandmother Irene Giles during a prayer vigil on Saturday for Martin Cobb, the eight-year-old who was killed trying to defend his 12-year-old sister against a sexual assault .

The teenager, who is black, told her a white man had attacked the . girl. The girl also initially blamed a white man and said he had raped her. The boy appeared at an initial court hearing on Monday in which a judge deemed he would remain in custody. While he's currently being detained as a juvenile, he will likely be tried as an adult. Martin Cobb was reportedly hit in the head with a brick during the attack near their home on Thursday, neighbors told The Richmond Times Dispatch. Richmond . Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Mary E. Langer said she could not . confirm a brick was used but police told her Martin suffered severe head . trauma. The 12-year-old girl was taken to a hospital, but her injuries were not released by police. 'As far as I know, she's doing fine. She's doing better.

"By . Chris Paine . Childhood diabetes has spiraled out of control and experts fear it might be years until they catch up on just how rapidly the problem is spreading. New figures show instances of Type-2 diabetes in children and teenagers spiked a drastic 30 per cent between 2000 and 2009, and there are fears the problem has gotten a lot worse in the untracked period in the five years since. The complications arising from diabetes means those children affected face 'a lifetime burden', the study's author warned. Obesity is typically associated with childhood diabetes - which carries associated health risks such as heart attacks and organ failure . Experts fear the problem may have gotten even worse in the five years since the latest figures were tracked . New figures released today show that 0.46 in every 1,000 kids is affected by Type-2 - with more than 20,000 sufferers across the U.S. - while the cases of Type-1 diabetes is up 21 per cent to 167,000 children. The research was presented at a Pediatric Academic Societies conference in Vancouver by Dana Dabelea, from the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora, who authored the study. 'These increases are serious,' she said, according to USA Today. 'Every new case means a lifetime burden of difficult and costly treatment and higher risk of early, serious complications.' Nearly 10 per cent of the entire U.S. population - 25.8 million people - is affected by diabetes. Obesity expert David Ludwig, from the Boston Children's Hospital, says the gap in tracked data since 2009 has caused the industry concern that things are getting worse. 'We don't know what happened in the last five years,' he said. 'Most likely, things have gotten worse.' The spike in Type-2 diabetes among children is particularly concerning because it's traditionally referred to as 'adult-onset' diabetes and usually only affects people over the age of 40. And most children who do suffer from it are already obese, experts say, meaning they are facing an array of health problems including heart attacks and organ failure. TYPE-1 ('early-onset'): .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The second shooting in two days at a Georgia college Monday left a student with a life-threatening gunshot wound to the head and prompted authorities to pledge to bolster security at the school. A 21-year-old man was taken into custody and was being called a person of interest in Monday's shooting, Richmond County Sheriff's Sgt. Monica Belser said in a news release. The man has not been charged, Belser said, and police have not publicly identified him. Monday's shooting led to an hours-long lockdown of Paine's campus, about 140 miles east of Atlanta.

"By . Francesca Chambers . The percentage of Americans who say they don't have health insurance dropped to 13.4 percent in April, according to Gallup. The number of uninsured Americans has been steadily dropping since last fall, the polling company said, when a peak 18 percent of Americans said they did not have health care coverage. Gallup reports that number of Americans without health insurance decreased at a faster pace as the federally mandated deadline to purchase insurance arrived. Gallup reports that percent of Americans without health insurance dropped to 13.4 during the final month Americans could sign up for health care through the federal exchange . The number of uninsured Americans has been steadily dropping since last fall when a peak 18 percent of Americans said they did not have health care coverage . African-Americans saw the most dramatic increase in health care coverage between the close of 2013, when 20.9 percent told Gallup they did not have coverage and April. Then, only 13.8 percent of blacks polled told Gallup they did not have insurance. Hispanics continue to say they do not have health insurance at higher rates than other demographic groups. In April, 33.2 percent told Gallup they were uninsured. The percent of Hispanics and Americans making less than $36,000 a year who did not have coverage dropped by 5.5 percent in April, respectively. Gallup's numbers are consistent with a Health and Human Services report released last Thursday that showed Hispanic enrollment below what it could be and a high rate of enrollment among blacks. More than 8 million Americans have signed up for health care insurance through the state and federal exchanges, the report said. The Obama administration did not say how many people had signed up for health care, but the number surpasses a previous report of 8 million provided by the president two weeks earlier. The original deadline to purchase . healthcare insurance was March 31. The Obama administration has extended . deadlines multiple times to accommodate Americans having problems with . government's Obamacare sign-up site, healthcare.gov, and Americans with . pre-existing conditions moving out of the government's temporary . high-risk pools and into the general insurance marketplace. Gallup . took its survey of 14,700 Americans from April 1 - 30. The new deadline . for average Americans who had already started the sign up process to . get covered was April 15. Some of . the people Gallup polled who did not have insurance the first or second . week of April may have since finished applying for coverage, potentially . bringing the percent of Americans who do not have coverage down . further. Other Americans may be . waiting to get coverage until for the provision of Obamacare that . requires employers to cover full-time employees to kick in at the start . of 2015. 'On the other hand, it is likely that some newly insured Americans will . not pay their premiums and will rejoin the ranks of the uninsured,' Gallup notes. White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters last week that the White House did not have, 'hard, concrete' numbers on the number of people who had both signed up for Obamacare through the federal health exchange and made their first payment. A report issued last week by House Republicans estimated that one-third of those enrollees have not paid their premiums. The House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations report is based on information provided to the committee by 'all 160 insurance providers in the federally facilitated marketplace.' The White House disputes the Republican report has not provided evidence to the contrary. A House Republican report claims that one-third of Americans who signed up for Obamacare through the federal health exchange have not yet made their first payment on their plans .","Last fall a peak 18 percent of Americans told Gallup they did not have insurance .

"By . David Mccormack . Michael Alig, the notorious king of New York’s Club Kids in the late 1980s who went to prison for murdering his drug dealer in 1996 has been freed on conditional release. Alig, 48, whose life was portrayed by Macaulay Culkin in the 2003 movie Party Monster, was released from Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, NY on Monday after serving more than 17 years in prison. He was sentenced to first-degree manslaughter in 1997 for the murder and dismemberment of drug dealer Andre ‘Angel’ Melendez a year earlier. Scroll down for more . Michael Alig, the notorious king of New York’s Club Kids in the late 1980s who went to prison for murdering his drug dealer in 1996 has been freed on bail . Alig and his accomplice, Robert ‘Freeze’ Riggs, had pleaded guilty to the crime and were sentenced to 10-20 years in prison. Riggs was released in 2010. Originally from Indiana, Alig moved to New York in the early 1980s to attend Fordham University but later dropped out and became involved in the New York underground club scene as a promoter. Even before his conviction, Alig and his fellow Club Kids had grabbed national attention for their outrageous Manhattan dance parties that showcased sex, rampant drug use and over-the-top costumes. The story of Alig's rise and fall was first told in the 1999 book Disco Bloodbath written by his best friend and fellow Club Kid James St. James. Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig's life starred Macaulay Culkin as infamous NYC club promoter Michael Alig, right, and Seth Green as his friend James St. James . Drug dealer Andre 'Angel' Melendez was brutally murdered and his body dismembered by Alig and Robert Riggs . The book detailed St. James’ friendship with Alig and how it fell apart as Alig's drug addiction worsened and ended after the death of Melendez. It later became the basis for Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig’s life starring Culkin and Seth Green as St. James. Parole officers allegedly denied Alig parole in 2006 after watching the debauched movie. A cult hit, the film has helped maintain interest in Alig and despite nearly two decades behind bars he has 11.7K followers on Twitter and according to his blog 'he has had many offers of work, and even more requests for interviews and shows.' His social media accounts were maintained by a friend while Alig was inside, although he has tweeted several times since his release on Monday morning. ‘Just narrowly escaped being re-arrested for having my release filmed but we’re ok and in (sic) our way to nyc! #narrowescape,' he tweeted of his departure from prison. 'Happy to be free and so grateful for this second chance. Can’t wait 2C @JSJDarling at dinner. #frenemy.'

"By . Francesca Chambers . Massachusetts is giving up on its health exchange website. State officials have decided that it would be cheaper to abandon the state's Health Connector website than it would to fix it, reports The Boston Globe. The state is now looking at other ways to sign up its uninsured residents for healthcare ahead of the next open enrollment period that begins November 15. Massachusetts' Health Connector site was . created by CGI Federal - the same company that created the glitchy . federal Obamacare sign-up site healthcare.gov. Massachusetts state officials have decided it would be cheaper to abandon the state's Health Connector website than it would to fix it . Much like its federal counterpart, mahealthconnector.org, has not worked properly since it went live in October 2013. Many Massachusetts residents were unable to sign up for health care online, and instead had to fill out paper applications. As a result of the hiccups with its website, Massachusetts asked the federal government in early February to exempt it from the nationwide March 31 deadline to sign up for qualifying health care plans. It asked that the Obama administration give it until September 30, and at the very least, until June 30. 'We spent a lot of money. Some of it may be federal, but it’s all . taxpayer money however it’s collected. We spent a lot of money for . something that doesn’t work,' state senator Richard Moore, a Democrat, told Mass Live at the time. 'It’s a wonder we . don’t have as series of mental health crises because of people’s . frustration.' The Bay State's Health Connector board was supposed to meet later this week to decide whether it would get rid of Massachusetts' health exchange entirely and feed residents into the federal exchange, the Boston Herald reported on Friday. However, the state official tasked with overseeing the site said on Monday that Massachusetts would pursue a 'dual track' approach to providing its uninsured residents with healthcare. The state will first look into purchasing a customized version of the state health insurance platform sold by health information and technology company hCentive. If it is not able to get its own exchange up and running quick enough, it will feed enrollees into the federal health exchange. 'I’ve said all along that no option on the table would be perfect, and the dual track certainly has its benefits and its challenges,' said health care Sarah Iselin, an insurance industry executive who was hired on a temporary basis by Democratic Governor Deval Patrick in February to fix the site. 'It does, however, solve for two realities: we need a reliable website to help people during the next open enrollment period, and we need to be in a position to achieve a fully integrated system in 2015,' Iselin, who is scheduled to return to her job at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts this month, told The Boston Globe. On its website, hCentive boasts'reduced implimentation costs' and a 'shorter implimentation cycle' as part of its state exchange program. 'Our browser-based, user-configurable solutions are being adopted by different healthcare plans and organizations to enhance their processes and ensure compliance with healthcare reforms without significant cost or IT infrastructure,' the website says. It does not say on its site how much the program costs or what other states are using it. The Virginia-based company did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment. 'You can¿t help but admit it¿s a failure,' House Minority Leader Bradley Jones Jr., a Republican, said of Massachusetts' Health Connector website last week . Oregon became the first site to ditch it's health exchange and join healthcare.gov last month after spending $305 million to build and promote its Cover Oregon site. Massachusetts has spent at least $57 million on its site, Politico reports. The total amount of taxpayer money Massachusetts has spent on its failed health exchange site is not public. Members of the state's house passed legislation on Friday requiring Governor Patrick's office to disclose that information. It now awaits approval in the state senate. 'You can’t help but admit it’s a failure,' House Minority Leader Bradley Jones Jr., a Republican, said of the Health Connector website last week. 'It’s an abject failure that’s going to cost the taxpayers, whether it’s the commonwealth of Massachusetts or money from the feds or rate-payers, tens of millions of dollars that shoudn’t have happened.' The federal government spent $93.7 million on building Health Connector's botched sister site healthcare.gov. It is paying $121 million to fix it. Health Connector spokesman Jason Lefferts said he expected information on the cost of Massachusetts' site to be provided by the Patrick administration 'sooner than July.'","The state has decided not pour any more money into its Health Connector website .

Andrew Marrara died March 26, 2012. Marrara was first charged last June but charges have since been upgraded from assault to first-degree aggravated manslaughter, according to the Bergen Record. Mugging for the camera: Michael Marrara's real mug shot (left) came only months after a fake mug shot (right) takn at a party about seven months after his son Andrew died . He was a volunteer firefighter in Fort Lee before moving to Florida following his son’s death and has earned a living as an electrician since, according to his Facebook profile.

The infant’s death was originally blamed . on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). But authorities soon began . insisting it was a homicide, and evidence uncovered during the course of the investigation led prosecutors to upgrade the charges.

Marrara appears to have moved on with his life in the months and years since his son’s death – posting grinning pictures to Facebook even including a fake mug shot while donning a zoot suit. He even posted to Facebook a picture of a tattoo on his right arm of his dead son on Father’s Day. His parents also insisted to the Record last year he did not have any involvement in the baby’s death. ‘The truth will come out,’ said father Michael Marrara. Mother Katherine Marrara called her son ‘the most gentle, loving, tender father.’ Marrara and the child's mother have remained together in the time since, they are listed on Facebook as engaged. An attorney for Marrara argued Monday in court that a medical expert retained by the defense team concluded Andrew Marrara died from blood clots on the brain, according to the Record. He also claimed the child’s ribs were likely broken during his birth. Marrara remains free on a $250,000 bond.","Michael Marrara Jr. has been charged with first-degree aggravated manslaughter .

Police immediately uncovered signs a homicide had taken place and knew a person was inside the home, according to the station. 'We made a determination based on evidence found outside the residence that the residence could very well be connected to the body that was found. We had reason to believe that there was someone inside,' Clark added. Where it happened: Police believe Vernon Saunders killed his brother at the small red home on the right . Dragged to here: The older brother then dragged the corpse almost two miles down the road to this spot, investigators said . Vernon Saunders barricaded himself inside and a SWAT team was called in. He emerged three hours later and was arrested, according to WTVQ. Neighbors said Vernon Saunders, a carpenter and avid amateur photographer, lived in the rental home no more than three years and that they barely knew him. It is not clear if either man has a family. The accused killer is listed as single on his Facebook profile. Timothy Saunders’ body was sent to the coroner to determine the exact cause of death, cops said. Results should be available as early as Monday. His brother Vernon was charged with murder, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse - he is being held without bail.","Vernon Saunders is believed by police to have shot his brother dead before dragging his corpse down a road .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Republicans are poised to replicate the party's historic 2010 mid-term election victory in the House of Representatives, a new Pew poll finds. If the election were held today, Republicans would win the House again, the poll indicates. Pew reports that 47 percent of respondents would vote for the Republican candidate for Congress, whereas 43 percent would vote for the Democrat. By comparison, Republicans and Democrats were tied at 44 percent at this point in 2010 when Republicans won the majority, giving House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio the Speaker's gavel. The GOP trailed by two percentage points in Pew's poll when a wave of Republicans were elected in the 1994 mid-terms. If the election were held today, Republicans would keep control of the House, which is currently led by Rep. John Boehner of Ohio . House Speaker-designate John Boehner wipes away tears as he waits to receive the gavel from outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the first session of the 112th Congress, in this Jan. 5, 2011 file photo . Pew's poll, taken in conjunction with USA Today in late April, echos a Washington Post - ABC poll released last week that also found that Republican congressional candidates had the edge over Democrats. Republicans already hold a 33 seat advantage over Democrats in the 435 seat legislature. They are unlikely to lose the majority in the majority in November's election unless Democrats are able to change the momentum. 'This latest poll is yet another wake up call for House Democrats to what we already know – ObamaCare’s disastrous effects on people’s healthcare, President Obama's broken promises, and the economy’s dismal performance are all sinking them in 2014,' National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Andrew Clark told MailOnline in an email. 'Every vulnerable House Democrat should start re-assessing their support for ObamaCare and the White House’s failing economic agenda before the voters get their say in November.' Respondents to Pew's poll named the economy and healthcare as their top concerns. By a margin of 43 to 39 percent, people polled said they believed the policies being perused by GOP leadership would be more likely to strengthen the economy than those of Democrats. Democrats' lucky break could come in the form of Tea Party 'extremists' challenging Republican Party favorites, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, pictured here in October, argued on Meet the Press a few days before the poll was taken in April . Democrats' lucky break could come in the form of Tea Party 'extremists' challenging Republican Party favorites, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz argued on Meet the Press a few days before the polls were taken. 'You have the Republican Party who is strangled by the Tea Party,' she said. 'And we have countless . elections now that Democrats have won because the Republicans have . nominated extremists that their voters reject. And that's the advantage . we will have going into this election.' Each party's candidates will be determined by a series of primaries beginning this month. In 2010 the GOP took back the House, yet failed to gain control of the Senate after several Tea Party-backed candidates won their primaries but crashed and burned in the general election. Democrats carried the Senate in 2012, as well, as down ballot candidates benefited from President Barack Obama's re-election. Democrats have their own set of problems to worry about head of November's elections, including low turn out among demographic groups that helped propel President Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012. As Wasserman Schultz noted, her party's turnout efforts 'ran circles' around the GOP's efforts in 2008 and 2012. That was not the case during the last two mid-term elections, however. African-Americans, a solidly Democratic voting block, came out in proportionally lower numbers than white voters in the last . two midterm elections in all but a handful states. In the years President Obama . was elected, black voter participation was only slightly lower than . white voter participation. Furthermore, President Obama is not as popular as he was throughout his first-term and 2012 re-election. Both the Pew poll and the WaPo-ABC poll found that Obama's approval rating had sunk to an all-time low at just 44 percent. Wasserman Schultz refused to acknowledge the effect Obama's unpopularity could have on the upcoming elections, saying November would 'absolutely not' be a referendum on the president. 'These elections, particularly the . Senate elections, are referendums on the candidates running,' she said. The six official party committees have already raised more than $500 million dollars to spend on this year's races. That amount does not include money that will be spent by outside organizations. Including the money from those organization's, Democrats have a roughly 30 percent advantage over Republicans, The Huffington Post estimated in mid-April. Pew reports that 47 percent of Americans would vote for the Republican candidate for Congress and 43 percent would vote for the Democrat, if the election were held today .","In 1994 and 2010 Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in wave elections .

"By . Richard Marsden . It's a little over 30 years ago that Ozzy Osbourne bit the head off a bat in front of a live audience. Now it appears the little animals have had their revenge. They could have scuppered his plans to convert a historic barn on his £5million estate into a two-bedroom home. The former Black Sabbath singer’s representatives are understood to have met planning officers to discuss redevelopment of the 19th century building. The Osbornes are going batty because they cannot alter a barn where they live . But brown long-eared bats have been discovered in the building. Osbourne, now 65, bit the head off a bat while performing in America in 1982. He was said to be drunk. According to a variety of accounts he either thought the bat was a rubber replica – or dead. Osbourne, who was once accused of flirting with Satanism, later recalled that the bat was alive and managed to bite him, requiring him to be treated for rabies. A source close to the Osbournes said: ‘The irony isn’t lost on Ozzy that karma has finally caught up with him. ‘The bats’ natural habitat is prevented from being damaged by law. The survey stated that any work to convert the barn would affect the bats, so it could take years for Ozzy’s plans to be approved.’ Osbourne and his wife Sharon, 61, a former X Factor judge, have lived at the Buckinghamshire mansion for almost 20 years and have been granted permission for many changes during that time. Ozzy's place: You too can live in a place like this if you release a few rock songs, judge a singing talent show - and oh... bite a head off a bat . Robert Allen, the planning chairman at Chalfont St Giles Parish Council, which covers the area, said: ‘Bats could put the kibosh on the development or mean a lot of work in terms of mitigation measures. The creatures are not out of the ordinary in this area but any developments have to take them into account.’ Mr Allen said that previous planning applications by the Osbournes for their Grade II listed late Victorian home and outbuildings, which lie on a seven-acre estate, have been ‘pretty reasonable’ and received permission. They included adding a swimming pool, a conservatory and, last year, an extension to a lodge on the estate. The Osbournes are in Los Angeles while repairs to £300,000 of damage caused by the winter floods continue at the Buckinghamshire property.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . It has now been revealed that disgraced Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling even discriminated against white players. Clippers guard J.J. Redick claims Sterling showed signs of wavering on a sign and trade deal reached last summer with the Orlando Magic after the team owner was disappointed with another white player. Redick told USA Today about how his four-year, $27million contract nearly fell apart after already being initially agreed upon. Clutch shooter: Los Angeles Clippers guard J.J. Redick celebrates after hitting a three point shot during the second half in Game 7 of the playoff series against the Golden State Warriors . 'I’ve been told both ways: one, that he didn’t want to pay me because I was white, and that he didn’t want to pay me because I was a bench player,'”  the former Duke University star told the paper. 'I didn’t know until after the face. I just got a weird phone call from Doc (Rivers) on July 4, and I got off the phone and said to my wife, ‘Something’s going on.’ He’s like, ‘You better play for me (expletive).’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, that’s the plan. We figured this out two days ago, right? And then he just rambled a bit,' Redick continued. 'But he never really got into the nuts and bolts of what was happening. And then I got a call about 48 hours later from my agent, and he said, ‘We wanted to keep you out of it, but here’s what happened.’ Sterling is said to have reconsidered the price he was willing to pay for the sharpshooting Redick because he was still smarting from the $52million contract he handed center white Chris Kaman to average a pedestrian 11.8 points per game until being unceremoniously shipped out of town to the New Orleans Hornets in 2011. Redick still pushed for the deal to get down because he wanted to play for Rivers. 'I came here for Doc. I came Here for Chris (Paul) and Blake (Griffin),' Redick explained. 'I looked at this incredible opportunity for me on the basketball court, but also from a personal standpoint. He averaged a career-high 15.2 points per game on nearly 40 per cent three point shooting while playing an average of only 28 minutes off the bench during his first season in Los Angeles. Redick scored 20 points in the deciding game of the team's opening-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors. Victors: Clippers coach Doc Rivers (L) celebrates with players (front 2nd L) Blake Griffin (32), Darren Collison (2), J.J. Redick (4) and Chris Paul (30) at the end of their playoff series against the Warriors . 'I looked at this as there were great people in the organization, and it’s been backed up by that. I think you’ve seen that over the last week, regardless of one person’s opinion, you’ve seen that throughout the organization.” Sterling’s racist ranting recorded and leaked to multiple websites pissed Redick off, he said. 'In the days after, it was the first time in my life where I was conscientious of the fact that the people I was talking to were black or Asian or Mexican,' said the former All-American. 'I don’t look at people like that, so to hear those things come out of someone’s mouth, it pisses you off.' Rivers said employees on the team’s business side considered not working for the franchise after Sterling’s racist comments were exposed. The coach also said he met with team employees who were still upset and angry Friday morning, several days after Sterling was banned for life from the NBA. 'What I witnessed today, you realize this thing has touched a lot of people,' Rivers said hours later at the Clippers’ training complex in Playa Vista. 'The people that didn’t do anything are being harmed by this, and I wish we could find the right solution, and I don’t have it.' Rivers has been on the Clippers’ bench for less than a year, but the veteran NBA coach and player has emerged as the public face of the franchise during Sterling’s ouster. Rivers also is the Clippers’ senior vice president for basketball operations, giving him a voice in personnel decisions. Sterling acquired the coach from the Boston Celtics last June in a trade for a first-round pick in the 2015 draft, signing him to a contract paying him a reported $7 million per year. Banished: Donald Sterling has been barred for life from the NBA . Rivers won an NBA title in 2008 and reached two NBA finals during nine seasons as the Celtics’ coach. He coached just over four seasons with the Orlando Magic before taking over in Boston. He also had a 13-season playing career for four franchises, even playing one season for Sterling with the Clippers in 1991-92. Rivers refused to meet with Sterling shortly after the comments were made public, openly acknowledging his personal conflict about continuing with the club. He has been praised for his frankness and leadership during the crisis, but Rivers is reluctant to take credit. 'I don’t know if I’m doing a good job,' he said. 'I’m just doing my job. We didn’t know this was coming. Last time I met (with team employees) was before the season, and we talked about our goals as a group, being a championship team and a championship organization.' The Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors Saturday night to advance to the Western Conference Semi-Finals. Their next opponent is the Oklahoma City Thunder in a series that begins Monday.","J.J.

"By . Binky Felstead . Binky will launch her very own book Being Binky next week . Yes it's true; I'm releasing a book. Being Binky will reveal lots of tales from my childhood, teenage years and life in Chelsea - as well as my favourite beauty tips of course. I'm so excited for it to come out, and so this week I thought I'd show you all how to achieve my book cover look. Step One: Prep the Skin . As a Chelsea girl it's very important to me to have perfect blemish free skin so it's a necessary requirement to prep the skin before applying make-up. Start by cleansing the skin with Bioderma Sensibio H2O, followed by the Clarins BB Skin Perfecting Cream - this is a really nice base just before applying foundation. Then spritz some Caudalie Beauty Elixir onto the face â€“ this hydrating skin mist is perfect to use just before applying makeup. Step Two: Smokey-Shimmery Eyes . For this look I've gone for a bronze smoky eye. To stick with the elegant Chelsea look apply Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner with lots of Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara and a set of Eylure eyelashes. Then take the Clarins Eye Quartet Mineral Palette in Forest, starting with a nice light shimmer base on the lid. After this, create some depth in the eye by using a deep brown and a tiny bit of black in the crease of the lid. Step Three: Define the Brows . Use the Clarins Pro Palette Eyebrow Kit to define your brows. After applying the powder with an angled brush comb it through so the brows don't look too harsh. Binky recommends using an angled brush when applying colour to your eyebrows to avoid looking to harsh . Although Binky had a make-up artist at her shoot she says her cover look can easily be achieved at home . Step Four: Sun-Kissed Skin . Take a foundation brush and apply Guerlain Terracotta Skin Healthy Glow Foundation to the face. The foundation lasts for a long time girls so a little goes a long way for that flawless, natural look. Step Five: Killer Cheekbones . Use the Daniel Sandler Sculpt and Slim Contour Kit to contour the face and create killer cheekbones. Follow up by brushing DiorBlush in Miss Pink gently into the apples of the cheeks. To get a professional look use a brush to apply your lipstick and for a glamorous cover girl look for a big night out try a pair of false eyelashes . Binky says to create depth in the eye area apply a deep brown colour . Step Six: Perfect Pout . Last but not least are the lips. As I always say you never know when a kiss is coming so you're better off being prepared. For the perfect pinky pout swipe a layer of Guerlain Rouge Automatique in Cherry Blossom over the lips. For a better and more professional result use a brush to apply, moving it vertically along the lines of your lips for a more even finish. We're all human and we all make mistakes, so after applying your lipstick use a cotton bud to clean up any mistakes. To avoid the embarrassment of having lipstick on your teeth, you can put your index finger in your mouth and drag it out; this will catch up any lipstick that would have made a stain on your teeth. You can get all the products to create this look on escentual.com. Being Binky is out on Thursday 8th May - can't wait for all of you to read it!Until next time, stay gorgeous.Love Binky xxx .","Next week Binky Felstead will launch her first book .

"By . Richard Spillett . An ancient pear tree which could be cut down to make way for the controversial HS2 rail line is to have its DNA preserved so it can be 'cloned'. The 200-year-old specimen, near the village of Cubbington in Warwickshire, is said to be the second oldest pear tree in Britain. Parish councillor Peter Delow said: ‘What HS2 is proposing is that the tree will be cut down but, before that, they will take seeds and grafts to preserve its DNA. The tree is located near the picturesque village of Cubbington in Warwickshire and is one of the oldest in Britain . Local villagers said they would campaign for a tunnel to run under the tree . Nearby: The 200-year-old Cubbington pear tree is close to the proposed HS2 route (pictured). Villagers are hoping for a tunnel to be built beneath to tree and the surrounding woodland . ‘They originally planned to dig it up and relocate it but it’s a 200-year-old tree and they decided the chances of success were too small to warrant the expenditure.’ An HS2 spokesman said: 'We recognise the significance of the tree and will do all we can to ensure wild pear trees continue to be a feature of the countryside around Cubbington. 'Because the hollow lower trunk makes it impractical to move the tree, we instead plan to propagate the cuttings, collect seeds and replant the young trees in the surrounding area. 'The felled tree will be moved to a newly-created woodland next to South Cubbington Wood.' Villagers said they would continue to lobby MPs for a tunnel beneath the tree and the surrounding woodland. David Alderman, director of the Tree Register, said it is the largest wild pear recorded in Britain. Preparatory work on HS2 is set to start in 2016 ahead of building work in 2017. The first phase from London Euston to Birmingham will be completed by 2026, with an ‘accelerated’ section to Crewe finished the following year and the full route to Manchester and Leeds the North by 2030. HS2 bosses say they'll use cuttings and seeds from the tree to ensure its DNA is preserved . The HS2 scheme, which will see High Speed trains run between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, has sparked angry protests from those living on the route .","One of Britain's oldest pear trees on new train route is too old to move .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . The United States Geological Survey says the rate of earthquakes in Oklahoma has increased by about 50% since October 2013, significantly increasing the chance for a damaging quake in central Oklahoma. In a statement by the U.S. Geological Survey and Oklahoma Geological Survey, the agencies reported that 183 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater occurred from October 2013 through April 14. This compares with an average of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger earthquakes per year from 1978 to 2008. A senior adviser from the USGS says he hopes the new advisory will become a crucial consideration in earthquake preparedness for residents, schools and businesses in the central Oklahoma area. Warning: Oklahamo residents are being told to brace for an earthquake. This map shows all Oklahoma earthquakes magnitude-3 and greater since 1978 . The United States Geological Survey says the number of earthquakes in Oklahoma has gone up dramatically. It says the surge in seismic activity is due in part to and that it has increased the danger of a damaging quake in the central part of the state . Aftermath: An Oklahoma resident cleans up his in-laws house following the state's last major earthquake in November 2011 . Oklahoma was hit by two earthquakes in less than 24 hours on November 6, 2011. Geologists are predicting another to hit . The statement indicates that a likely factor in the increase in earthquakes is wastewater injection used for fracking. 'We haven't seen this before in Oklahoma, so we had some concerns about putting a specific number on the chances of it,' Robert Williams, a research geophysicist with the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program in Golden, Colorado, told Live Science. 'But we know from other cases around the world that if you have an increasing number of small earthquakes, the chances of a larger one will go up.' That's why earthquakes of magnitude 5 and larger are more frequent in states such as California and Alaska, where thousands of smaller temblors hit every year. This is the first time the USGS has issued an earthquake warning for a state east of the Rockies, Williams said. Such seismic hazard assessments are more typically issued for Western states following large quakes, to warn residents of the risk of damaging aftershocks, he said. The USGS and Oklahoma Geological Survey , citing a dramatic spike in magnitude 3.0 temblors, especially since October 2013 . 183 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater occurred in Okla. from October 2013 through April 14, 2014. This compares with a long-term average from 1978 to 2008 of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger earthquakes per year . Maintenance workers inspect the damage to one of the spires on Benedictine Hall at St. Gregory's University in Shawnee, Okla. on Sunday, Nov. 6, 2011. Two earthquakes in the area in less than 24 hours caused one of the towers to topple . The geological agencies took action after the rate of earthquakes in Oklahoma outpaced that of even California for the first few months of 2014. 'The rate of earthquakes increased dramatically in March and April,' Williams said. 'That alerted us to examine this further and put out this advisory statement.' While Oklahoma's buildings can withstand light earthquakes, the damage from a magnitude-5 temblor could be widespread. Oklahoma's last major earthquake was in November 2011, when a magnitude-5.6 earthquake centered near Prague, Oklahoma, destroyed 14 homes and injured at least two people. 'Building owners and government officials should have a special concern for older, unreinforced brick structures, which are vulnerable to serious damage during sufficient shaking,' Bill Leith, a USGS senior science adviser for earthquakes and geologic hazards, said in the joint statement. The result of the increased number of small and moderate shocks is the likelihood of future damaging for central and north-central Oklahoma, geologists say .","Major increase in seismic shaking led to a rare earthquake warning on May 5 from the U.S. Geological Survey .

"By . James Chapman . Nick Clegg was said to be 'bouncing off the walls' after secret Cabinet correspondence was leaked to yesterday's Daily Mail . The bitter coalition row over knife crime intensified yesterday as the Liberal Democrats claimed that automatic jail sentences for offenders would turn them into ‘hardened criminals’. Nick Clegg was said to be ‘bouncing off the walls’ after secret Cabinet correspondence was leaked to yesterday’s Daily Mail, revealing how senior Lib Dems are resisting Tory plans to toughen punishments for those caught twice with a blade. Sources close to the Deputy Prime Minister said the idea of mandatory sentences was a ‘gimmick’ and that jail risked turning those who have already been convicted more than once into worse offenders. Though Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has been proposing to tighten the law for some months, the Lib Dems also accused the Tories of seeking to exploit the fatal stabbing of teacher Ann Maguire in Leeds earlier this week. Yesterday the Daily Mail published a leaked letter to Mr Clegg from Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander saying plans to impose a mandatory six-month jail sentence on any adult convicted of a second knife offence were too expensive. Marked ‘restricted’, it was sent the day after Mrs Maguire’s death. In an earlier letter to the Deputy Prime Minister, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws said he was unwilling to support mandatory minimum sentences as they were ‘too blunt an instrument’. The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to be blaming the Tories for the breach of Cabinet confidentiality. A Lib Dem source accused them of engaging in political games in the aftermath of Mrs Maguire’s killing. Downing Street dismissed that suggestion as absurd, and it emerged that Tory MPs are planning to force a Commons vote on changing the law regardless of the opposition of their coalition partners. Sources close to the Deputy Prime Minister said the idea of mandatory sentences was a 'gimmick' and that jail risked turning those who have already been convicted more than once into worse offenders . Conservative MP Nick de Bois unveiled an amendment to a new Criminal Justice and Courts Bill that would mean over-18s getting a six-month minimum sentence for two offences, while under-18s would face mandatory detention orders for four months. It was immediately supported by 30 of his colleagues. Mr de Bois said the Lib Dems’ arguments against mandatory sentences were ‘bizarre’. The Lib Dems also accused the Tories of seeking to exploit the fatal stabbing of teacher Ann Maguire in Leeds earlier this week . ‘Most people will think that repeat offenders carrying knives are already hardened criminals,’ he said. ‘If people choose to carry a blade for the second time after having already been convicted once, frankly it beggars belief that the Lib Dems don’t think they should go to jail. ‘Sentencing in this area is inadequate. Thousands of people are getting a slap on the wrist.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove says the law must be toughened, regardless of the objections of Mr Clegg and his colleagues. ‘It’s important that we send a very clear signal that knife crime is going to be dealt with effectively,’ he said. David Cameron indicated that he also wanted tougher penalties. ‘We should continue to look at that, and I’m sure we’ll reach a good outcome on that issue,’ he said. A Lib Dem source said the idea that any members of the party would wish to make society less safe was ‘ridiculous’. ‘Whilst minimum sentencing might sound attractive in media headlines, there is a serious risk it could undermine the role of the judges, who are best placed to decide on sentencing,’ said the source. ‘Sending youngsters automatically to jail regardless of the circumstances also has the potential to turn them into hardened criminals and can lead to more not less crime.’ n Two girls aged 14 and 15 have been arrested on suspicion of planning to murder a teacher. Gwent Police said they were held at Cwmcarn High School in South Wales on Thursday because of concerns about their behaviour. It is believed a knife was found in the older girl’s bag. They were released on bail as inquiries continue.","Lib Dems 'resisting Tory plans to toughen punishments for knife crimes'

Steve Peppiatt, branch manager at the Waitrose store in Twyford, Berkshire, said: 'May Bank Holidays often give Brits a first flavour of summer. Flags: Eden Charles-Lyne, four, builds a sandcastle on West Wittering beach in West Sussex as Britons take full advantage of the sunny Bank Holiday weather .

Taking it easy: People enjoying the sunshine at St James's Park in Central London today . Stuck: Traffic queing at the Blackwall Tunnel in South-East London on Bank Holiday Monday . ‘And this weekend has not disappointed. Al fresco dining has clearly been top of the agenda. 'Sales of barbecue meats sizzling and . pre-prepared salads [have been] soaring alongside seasonal favourites . including Jersey Royals and British asparagus - which is up 28 per cent . year on year. ‘Customers . have also been dusting off their picnic blankets and stocking up on . picnic must-haves including cocktail sausages, pork pies and scotch . eggs.' Ticks . should be removed from the skin as soon as possible using fine-tipped . tweezers. Health officials also advise regularly checking your body - . especially skin folds - for the parasites. To . avoid bites, use a repellent on skin, avoid contact with tall . vegetation, walk on paths or tracks rather than in long grass, wear . light coloured clothing and tuck trousers into socks. Pet owners have also been urged to check their cats and dogs for fleas and ticks to ensure their animals are free of them. Ticks . can spread a terrifying array of diseases, including the bacterial . infection Lyme Disease which can be fatal to both humans and dogs. Some of the rarer illnesses passed on by the insects include Q fever, Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Late spring, early summer and autumn are peak times for tick bites, with the parasites often found when it is warm and damp. A Lidl spokesman said: ‘We’ve seen an increase of over . one third in sales of our BBQ items this early May Bank Holiday compared to . last year.’ And an Asda spokesman said sales of sausages and barbecue equipment were expected to triple those of April. Professor . Wall's ticks test was carried out at Ashton Park Estate in Bristol, a . popular site for dog walkers and hikers that overlooks the city centre. It . is thought that ferocious winter floods could be responsible for the . increased number of the disease-carrying creatures around the country. Experts say the mild, damp conditions have provided the perfect breeding ground for the blood-sucking parasites. Now . the weather has started to warm up the UK could become overwhelmed by . the tiny creatures, putting pets at risk and spreading deadly bugs like . Lyme Disease. Professor Wall . said: ‘It is important that people check regularly for ticks if they . visit tick infested areas and, if bitten, remove any tick rapidly. ‘The . high number of ticks doesn't make it unsafe to carry on visiting these . areas though - and it is important that is remembered.’ He added: ‘It's important people check both their dog and themselves after a walk. ‘Ticks are often found tucked up in creases of the body, so the arm pits or behind the ears. ‘The best way to remove them is to use tweezers and put them close to the skin and press and twist them out.’ Tonight will see outbreaks of rain pushing eastwards over many parts of the UK, giving a few heavy bursts in places. Early . rain will largely clear tomorrow morning from the East to leave sunny . periods and scattered showers, mainly affecting western parts. Another . rather showery day is expected on Wednesday, with the showers perhaps . merging into longer spells of rain for a time across the South.It will be unsettled for a time on Thursday with showery outbreaks of rain, although it should become drier from the South-West. Nick . Prebble, meteorologist at MeteoGroup, warned today it could be the last . chance to have a barbecue for the next few days as the weather begins . to deteriorate.

I think today will be the last of the completely dry weather so far in some areas. ‘It is going to be unsettled with showers and longer bursts of rain. It is going to be quite changeable. You might see sunshine one minute and then showers the next. ‘Tonight, rain already in western parts will spread eastwards. Showers or rain will move eastwards across the UK.’ A Met Office spokesman said rain overnight would be followed by a fine day with many areas enjoying bright and fairly sunny conditions. ‘We have got showery outbreaks and rain across many western fringes now, it will be going into Wales, the north west of England in the next few hours and western Scotland and that will gradually work its way eastwards.’ The odds on a Thames Water hosepipe ban being enforced this year have been slashed to 6/1 following the Bank Holiday weekend.

"By . Daniel Martin . Nick Clegg has said he wants to spend ten years as Deputy Prime Minister – and would refuse to prop up either of the main parties in a minority government. The Liberal Democrat leader said if both Labour and the Tories failed to win a majority in next year’s election, he would accept nothing less than another Coalition. He spoke as a YouGov poll yesterday showed support for the Lib Dems is at a feeble 9 per cent ahead of the European elections on May 22 – meaning the party could lose all 11 of its MEPs. Coalition partners: Tory David Cameron and Lib Dem Nick Clegg . This lack of popular support suggests that if the Lib Dems do enter a second coalition, they may be disproportionately represented in Parliament. Mr Clegg described coalition as a ‘fascinating laboratory’ of ideas and said: ‘I’d very much like to  continue in government.’ Figures close to David Cameron and Ed Miliband have privately said they wish to rule alone in the event of another hung parliament. But Mr Clegg said: ‘My party would not be interested in propping up a minority government without coalition. It isn’t a role I would see as right for myself or the Liberal Democrats... We’ve only just got started, and a ten-year period for us in government means we could make a majority contribution. The last thing I want to do is give up this job.’ He criticised Labour and the Tories for . wanting to go it alone, saying: ‘It’s swashbuckling stuff, but when it . comes down to it  a minority government would  be unstable. And it’s . irresponsible. Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, spoke out against minority government last week - saying it was unstable . 'We are still living in difficult times and difficult times require strong government, capable of taking tough decisions and with the majority in Parliament to make sure they happen.’ The 2010 election ended in a hung parliament, meaning no party had a majority among MPs. As a result, the Tories and Lib Dems formed a Coalition. If there is a hung parliament again in 2015, one option would be another coalition. The next step down would be for Labour or the Tories to form a minority government and enter a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement with a smaller party. The smaller party – the Lib Dems – would not have ministers in the Cabinet, but would promise to help the Government and to support it in a vote of no confidence. Without this support, a minority government would be unable to get things done and could be forced to resign in a no confidence debate. Mr Clegg’s comments indicate he would force a second election if he failed to get a coalition. He told a Sunday newspaper that he wanted the Lib Dems to be a ‘political force in the life of this country – not just a think-tank’. It means there will be no return to the Lib-Lab pact of the 1970s, when Liberal David Steel kept a minority Labour government in power. Last week Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, also spoke out against minority government, saying it is ‘unstable’ and would ‘not be in the national interest’ as it could not take tough decisions to protect the recovery. He will be in charge of negotiating with the main parties in the ‘likely’ event of a hung parliament, and said the Lib Dems would be willing to form a coalition with either Labour or the Conservatives.","Nick Clegg claims he wants to spend ten years as Deputy Prime Minister .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Schoolboy Junior Rucroft stares death in the face every day because he is allergic to himself. The seven-year-old faces the risk of a life-threatening reaction or asthma attack every day because his body reacts badly to his own hair follicles. Junior, of Darlington, Durham, has been admitted to hospital more than 50 times, desperately struggling to breathe. Junior Rucroft is allergic to many things including his hair follicles. Here the seven-year-old poses with the cocktail of medicines that he has to take every day . His mother Paula Hopps was shocked when she was told by doctors that her son was allergic to his own body. The 31-year-old said: ‘I've had phone calls from school because when he gets a bit stressed while he's doing his work, he runs his hands through his hair. Then, when he touches his face, it swells up. ‘It's crazy that Junior is allergic to his hair and I couldn't believe it when I was first told - it seemed ridiculous. ‘You can't avoid your hair so we have to just make sure that Junior's is kept short and that he doesn't rub his head.’ Junior, a pupil at Skerne Park Academy, near his home in Darlington, has a long list of allergies that interfere with his life. He was first diagnosed with asthma and allergies at the age of one after a kiss from his mum almost killed him. ‘I'd been eating a bag of nuts and I kissed him a short time afterwards. Suddenly, his face swelled up and he couldn't breathe,’ explained mum-of-six Paula. ‘It was terrifying and I didn't have a clue why it was happening. I didn't automatically put two and two together. The paramedics said they got there just in time. They gave him an adrenaline injection and oxygen until he got to hospital. ‘He was diagnosed with asthma pretty much straight after that as he kept getting breathless and having to go back to hospital. ‘His doctors also did allergy tests on him and found he's allergic to pretty much everything - nuts, cats, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, horses, grass, house dust mites, pollen, and even human hair fibre.’ It all means life is a day-to-day struggle for Junior and his family as they try to avoid triggering a bad reaction. Paula Hopps with Junior, one of her six children. Junior, seven, is allergic to his own hair follicles as well nuts, cats, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, horses, grass, house dust mites and pollen so Paula spends all day keeping her house clean . Paula added: ‘His allergies bring on asthma attacks, but he also might get random attacks if he's running up the stairs or if he's getting emotional about something. ‘If he's happy and laughing or if he's crying, that can trigger an attack. ‘He's been admitted to hospital well over 50 times. Sometimes, we might just be there for a check-up and his oxygen levels are worryingly low, so we end up having to stay in overnight.’ Junior has missed a lot of school because of being poorly, as well through routine appointments at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Junior also struggles with his weight because of the cocktail of medication he takes and, while he can usually take part in PE lessons, he must have 10 puffs of his inhaler before he starts any exercise. As well as looking after Junior, and her other children - Taylor, 10, Bailey, nine, Casey, eight, Cody, six, and Neveah-Rose, four - Paula is constantly dusting, cleaning and washing to make sure there aren't any dust mites in the house. None of Junior's siblings have allergies, other than one of his sisters, who has hay fever. Paula said: ‘I try to control Junior's condition as much as possible and I've got into a routine of constantly cleaning the house.’ Junior's family are now hoping that a new 10-second breath test will prevent asthma attacks and hospitalisation. Asthmatic Junior Rucroft can do exercise but has to take 10 puffs on his inhaler beforehand . The FeNO tests have just been recommended for use within the NHS, although doctors at James Cook University Hospital have been carrying them out for a number of years. The tests are recommended to help both in the diagnosis and management of asthma and, in Junior's case, allow his care team to check that his condition is not getting worse and to tailor his medication effectively. Paula added: ‘I'm hoping this new combination of treatment is going to help him. ‘At the moment, we just try not to put him in a situation that could cause him to have an allergic reaction or an asthma attack. ‘But, it can be unavoidable. He's allergic to so many things but he copes very well and I just say that he's special.’","Junior Rucroft, 7, has had more than 50 hospital visits struggling for breath .

"By . Richard Spillett . A 42-year-old man who posted abusive Twitter messages about the murder of school teacher Ann Maguire has been pictured for the first time. Robert Riley, of Port Talbot, South Wales, appeared before magistrates in Leeds yesterday where he admitted sending a grossly offensive, abusive or malicious message. Wearing a tracksuit top over a grey T-shirt and a pair of jogging bottoms, Riley was brought into court after being detained overnight for his own safety due to anger about his shocking messages. Troll: Robert Riley posted offensive messages about the death of teacher Ann Maguire online . Court: He admitted posting the tweets in before magistrates yesterday and will be sentenced later this week . The messages were not read out in court but the bench heard that some of them related to the murder of Mrs Maguire, 61, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds a week ago. The magistrates were told that Riley needed to be sentenced where the messages were sent and agreed to transfer the case to Swansea Magistrates' Court. Riley, of Dan Y Coed, Cwmavon, Port Talbot, was given bail on condition that he does not use social networking sites or the internet generally between now and his next court appearance on Thursday. During the 10-minute hearing his solicitor Michael Walsh said: 'He is mortified by his own behaviour and he apologises for any upset that may have been caused to everybody.' Mr Walsh asked the magistrates to free his client on bail, telling them the only reason he had been held overnight was for his own safety. He suggested that Riley may be in more danger in a Leeds prison than he would be walking the streets. Shame: Riley hid his face with his tracksuit hood as he left court yesterday . Tragedy: Teacher Ann Maguire was killed while she taught a class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds last week . Earlier, Sandra White, prosecuting, told the court that Riley had posted a number of offensive tweets, only some of which related to the murder of Mrs Maguire. She said the offence had come to the attention of West Yorkshire Police because of the latest incident, but told the bench that it should properly have been charged in South Wales. Riley is the second person to be charged with sending a 'malicious communication' in the wake of the death of Mrs Maguire, who was stabbed to death in her classroom. Jake Newsome, 21, from the Harehills area of Leeds, was released on bail after being charged over alleged abuse, police have said. He is due to appear before Leeds Magistrates' Court on Wednesday May 14. Mrs Maguire died after she was attacked during a Spanish lesson at the school where she had taught for more than 40 years. She was due to retire in September. The . killing is thought to be the first time a teacher has been stabbed to . death in a British classroom and the first murder of a teacher in a . school since the 1996 Dunblane massacre. Scene: Corpus Christi has been rocked by the death of a woman called 'the mother of the school' Heartbroken: Mrs Maguire's husband of 37 years, Donald, and their two daughters Kerry, 32, and Emma, 30, view the wall of floral tributes placed outside the school . Prayers were said for Mrs Maguire and her family on Sunday. Deacon Sean Quigley included the family of the 15-year-old boy charged with murdering the 61-year-old in his homily at Corpus Christi Church in Leeds which is attached to the school. Mr Quigley, a retired teacher at the college who knows the Maguire family, told the congregation: 'The school, staff and pupils have been consoled by messages from around the world and by many gifts of flowers, and also of food and books. 'The family of the young man involved also have been consoled in their great distress by the messages of love they have received.' A 100m-long wall of floral tributes now runs from the church to the school gates. A book of condolence has also been opened for those who want to express their sympathies. A 15-year-old boy appeared in court last week charged with mother-of-two Mrs Maguire's murder and was remanded in custody.","Robert Riley wrote offensive messages about teacher's death on Twitter .

"By . Leon Watson . Pippa the dog had a miracle escape after she plunged off a 100ft cliff and survived by landing in the sea below . A lucky black labrador survived a 100ft fall after she plunged off a cliff and landed in the sea below. The pet dog called Pippa was being taken for a walk near Swanage, Dorset, when she suddenly became excited at seeing the sea in the distance. She ran off from owners Daniel and Katy Pordage, dashed 500 yards across two fields towards the edge of the cliff without realising the danger. Pippa landed in an area of water between two rocks 100ft below and suffered just an injured front paw in the fall. Two climbers who were abseiling down to scale the cliff at Anvil Point plucked the dog out of the water and held on to her until a lifeboat crew arrived. Pippa was taken aboard and ferried to the lifeboat station where she was reunited with her relieved owners. Mrs Pordage, . a 27-year-old veterinery nurse, looked at the three-year-old and . thought she had broken her front right leg but a further examination . revealed just a damaged tendon. Her . and her husband, a 32-year-old web designer from Hythe, near . Southampton, were enjoying a break on the Isle of Purbeck with their . dogs, Pippa and Marley. They had been walking the two dogs off their leads when Pippa made a bolt for it. Mr Pordage said: 'We were quite a way back from the cliffs, there were two fields and a path between us. Pippa just saw the blue sea and decided to wanted to go in the water and darted straight for it. 'I chased after her and called her to come back. I got to the edge of the cliff and couldn’t see her anywhere. 'I thought that she couldn’t have been stupid enough to go over the edge but she was. Then I heard a dog barking from below.'

Pippa ran off from owners Daniel and Katy Pordage, dashed 500 yards across two fields towards the edge of the cliff without realising the danger . A coastguard team and lifeboat crew from Swanage arrived at the scene and the rescuers found Pippa sat on rocks with two climbers. Mr Pordage said: 'She was extremely lucky because she fell into the water between two areas of rocks. 'Katy is a veterinary nurse of 10 years and had a look at Pippa and thought her leg was broken but the vets discovered it is just a damaged tendon that needed a bandage. 'Pippa doesn’t often deviate from us when we are walking her so it was a shock when she sprinted off.' A spokesman for the Swanage lifeboat, said: 'Luckily, Pippa fell in the only bit of water on the beach below. The lifeboat located the dog sat on a rock with two climbers that happened to be in the area. 'The lifeboat then returned to Swanage where the dog was reunited with her very grateful owners.

"By . Mark Duell . A planned three-day strike by London Underground workers in a row over Tube ticket office closures was today dramatically called off after last-ditch talks. Rail, Maritime and Transport union members were due to walk out from 9pm, but a breakthrough was made at a meeting with LU. The union said the industrial action had been suspended. London Mayor Boris Johnson described it as a ‘victory for common sense and for Londoners’. Scroll down for video . Suspended: The strike was averted with hours to go after last ditch-talks. A sign at Stratford station is pictured . Unpleasant commute: Passengers outside London Bridge Underground station during the strike last Tuesday . Unhappy commute: Crowds wait for buses outside Victoria station during the strike action last Tuesday . But RMT acting general secretary Mick Cash said: ‘Due to the solidarity and determination of our LU members, and their delivery of rock-solid industrial action last week, we have been able to secure real movement and significant progress on the issues at the heart of this dispute in talks with the Tube management over the bank holiday weekend. ‘Pre-conditions . have been removed, protection of earnings has been agreed and we now . have a viable framework for a proper review of the cuts and closures . programme. ‘As a result of . that progress, secured directly through our members campaign of . industrial action and the union's drive to get the facts across to the . people of London, we are able to suspend the action due to commence this . evening and further talks around the fundamental issues of cuts to . jobs, services and safety will now take place.’ Phil Hufton, chief operating officer of . London Underground, said: ‘I am pleased that Londoners will not have to . endure further strike action this week. ‘The only way to resolve this . dispute is for the RMT leadership to work with us to shape the future . of the Tube in a changing world. It is good that they have committed to . doing so alongside the three other unions involved. ‘As we have always said, we are, of course, open to discuss any proposals our staff or the unions may offer. ‘Modernisation . of the Tube means that it is our intention to close all ticket offices, . used in less than 3 per cent of journeys, and instead deliver a vastly . better customer service by bringing more staff than ever before out on . to the concourses of stations at ticket machines, ticket gates and . platforms - just as we delivered during the London 2012 Games. ‘This . will also allow us to save £50million per annum to reinvest in better . and more reliable train services and to keep fares down.’ Called off: People queue outside Oxford Circus Underground station last Tuesday during last week's strike . Crowded: Commuters wait for the Jubilee line at Waterloo Underground station in London last Wednesday . The development followed talks at the . conciliation service. An Acas spokeman said: 'We are pleased that we . have been able to assist . the parties to reach an understanding that allows the industrial action . this week to be withdrawn.' Mr Johnson said: ‘This is a victory for common sense and for Londoners. The RMT leadership has finally seen that their tactics aren't working. ‘I always said these strikes were pointless, and by getting so many people to work during last week's stoppage Transport for London has shown the RMT that its actions, supported by a minority of its members, will achieve nothing. ‘It is vital that we continue to reform the Tube for the benefit of our passengers. I'm delighted that hard-working Londoners and businesses across the capital will now be free to go about their work without the threat of needless industrial action. ‘It is essential we get on with our modernisation programme and that includes the closure of 260 ticket offices, saving £50million a year that will be reinvested into the network. ‘This will get more staff out from behind glass screens and back offices to help passengers, and all without any need for compulsory redundancies. ‘There is no justification at all for holding London to ransom. Tomorrow the Government will announce their support for my proposals on ballot thresholds which will limit the power of unions to disrupt the capital in the future, on a whim and without majority support. ‘That Government backing is very welcome, as is this morning's decision to call off the strike.’","Rail, Maritime and Transport union members were due to strike from 9pm .

"By . Lizzie Parry . John and Corinne Clarkson have created what they claim is the world's tallest burger, the Pie-scraper . At 5ft 4in it stands taller than most children and its 30,000 calories could sustain a man for almost two weeks. The Pie-scraper is thought to be the world's tallest burger - incorporating 10 three-quarter pound cheeseburgers and another 11-and-a-half pounds of beef encasing pies, sausage rolls, a bacon butty, spam and spaghetti bolognese. Takeaway boss John Clarkson of the Mister Eater's Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire, is the man behind the towering dish, which comes with 8.5kg of beef and is served with a side salad of lettuce. For a man adhering to the recommended 2,500 calories a day, the giant burger tower would keep him sustained for almost a fortnight. The 54-year-old, who is 5ft 6in - two inches taller than his creation - is claiming the world record for his Pie-scraper, which is on display in his shop. 'I’ve researched to see if anyone has created a taller burger but no one has,' he said. 'We’ve already created a full burger encased inside another burger so I just thought why not try other things inside a burger? Say, a pork pie, a chip butty or a pizza?' Mr Clarkson and his wife Corinne, 39, spent an hour-and-a-half assembling the structure on a specially-made metal stand to ensure the tower didn’t topple. The three-quarter pound cheeseburger surrounded by chips is the first rung on the ladder, followed by a pork pie with Branston pickle encased in one-and-a-quarter pounds of beef. Each burger bun needed to be extra-large so they were also made to order from a local baker. Then between each cheeseburger lies a different meal encased in burger meat. Scroll down for video . Standing at 5ft 4in the PIe-scraper burger tower is only two inches shy of Mr Clarkson's 5ft 6in . The pie-scraper incorporates 10 three-quarter pound cheeseburgers and another 11-and-a-half pounds of beef encasing pies, sausage rolls, a bacon butty, spam and spaghetti bolognese . The pie-scraper contains a staggering 30,000 calories with spam, black pudding, sausage, steak pie, meatballs, a meat and potato pie and even mushy peas and pepperoni pizza encased in 8.5kg of beef . There is Spam, black pudding and sausage; steak pie and mushroom; a bacon butty; spaghetti bolognese and meatballs; a cheeseburger; meat and potato pie with mushy peas with the final burger containing three layers of pepperoni pizza. If that wasn’t enough to lay claim to Britain’s biggest burger, above each cheeseburger is a layer of bacon with added hash browns, onion rings and peppers at different levels for good measure. Mrs Clarkson said: 'Everyone thinks we are a bit nuts but they aren’t surprised by the things we do now. It’s just about putting a smile on people’s faces and trying to do things bigger and better every time.' Due to its sheer size, the burger was only on display at the popular chippy for a day, before it was then devoured by staff and a few lucky customers. Those who would like to fork out and cook a replica would be set back £150 - but Mrs Clarkson admits it could never be sold. 'It’s a bit of fun and everyone loves a good challenge,' she added. 'And it’s not just the gimmick - I can honestly say the pizza burger is delicious!' Mr and Mrs Clarkson spent an hour-and-a-half constructing their masterpiece, displaying it at their Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire for a day before it was devoured by staff and a few  customers . 68081 . 66084 . 46162 . 42052 . 72911 . 293826 . 237750 . 72029 . 362441 . 177633 . 388912 . 133631 .

Chip shop owners Mr and Mrs Clarkson are no strangers to cooking up extravagant ideas. The couple turned giant TV cartoon food into reality by creating a 10,000-calorie burger. Dubbed the ‘Ulti-Meatum’, the sandwich is a cheeseburger encased in another burger and held together by two buns, also made from burgers. The dish was being sold for £20 at the couple's Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston. It is modelled on a meal from The Best Burger In The World episode of Cartoon Network hit The Regular Show. In the show, the characters of Mordecai, a Blue Jay and a raccoon named Rigby do everything they can to try and eat the burger, which is so good it can only be sold to one customer every 100 years. But fans can now get their hands on a real-life version of the calorific creation for free - only if they dare to take on the challenge of finishing it in one. Anyone who attempts the Man v. Food-style challenge will have to consume five pounds of beef, as well as six slices of cheese and three whole buns. Mrs Clarkson, said: ‘I saw a few people had tried to make it on YouTube but they were terrible.'","John and Corinne Clarkson cooked up the 5ft 4in 'pie-scraper' in Preston .

Wayne Rooney is set to miss Manchester United’s final home game against Hull City at Old Trafford on Tuesday as the England striker continues to nurse a groin strain ahead of the World Cup. Although Rooney did some light training in the gym over the weekend, after sitting out the defeat by Sunderland, he is taking no chances just six days before Roy Hodgson names his provisional squad for Brazil. It promises to be an emotional night, with United captain Nemanja Vidic making a farewell appearance at Old Trafford before he joins Inter Milan on a free transfer — and interim boss Ryan Giggs is believed to be considering the option of naming himself in the squad. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney's World Cup advert with Cristiano Ronaldo . Not risking it! Injured Wayne Rooney will not play against Hull with the World Cup beckoning . Giggs said: 'The perfect scenario is me coming on & scoring the winner, but it doesn’t always work like that. We’ll have to wait and see.' The 40-year-old will 'take into consideration' the fact Tuesday’s game could be his last at Old Trafford, but insists: 'I want to do what’s best to win.' A number of other United stars could also be playing there for the last time, including Patrice Evra. Like Vidic, the Frenchman will be out of contract at the end of the season more than eight years after they joined the club at the same time in January 2006, from Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively. The pair have since won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and three League Cups together, but Evra and the man he calls ‘The Rock’ could not have got off to a worse start. Should I, shouldn't I? Ryan Giggs (L) is considering picking himself for United's final home game of the season . ‘I’m really sad because when I speak about Nemanja it’s like I’m speaking about myself because we joined the club together,’ said Evra. ‘Our first game was for the reserves and it was so hard. Rene (Meulensteen) was the manager and he took us both out of the match. ‘We were talking together in the dressing room and saying, “Oh my god, why have we come to Manchester United? We should go back to our clubs quickly!” Emotional farewells: Nemanja Vidic (L) and Patrice Evra (R) arrived at the same time and could leave together . ‘It was a difficult moment but we stuck together. We were in the same hotel, we went into training together, we won the same trophies. I’m really sad to lose The Rock.’ Although 40-year-old Giggs’s future at Old Trafford is unclear, Hull manager Steve Bruce believes United would be foolish not to offer him a significant role when Louis van Gaal takes over as manager. Bruce, a former team-mate of Giggs at United, even joked that he’s got a job at Hull if he finds himself out of work in the summer. Find space: Hull manager Steve Bruce reckons his former club must keep Ryan Giggs at Old Trafford . Bruce said: ‘There’s always going to be a place for Ryan because he’s been a great. They’ll find a space for him somewhere. ‘I don’t think he’ll leave. If not, he can come and see out his days at the KC in the Europa League.  If he’s available on a free, I’d take him.’ With Premier League safety sealed, Bruce plans to make several changes to his team tonight as he plans for the FA Cup final on Saturday week. Bruce added: ‘There’s five or six who pick themselves, really, but nothing’s a given.’","Rooney will not be risked against Hull as he recovers from a groin strain .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Before every training session, Tony Pulis reminded his players that Brendan Rodgers wasn't a fan of Crystal Palace and their football. Liverpool's manager had them down as a primitive Premier League team who would rely on 'long balls and long throws-ins'. He called it wrong, catastrophically so. After this extraordinary comeback by Palace, recovering from 3-0 down to draw 3-3, Rodgers must play the long game. Centre of attention: Brendan Rodgers oversees his side's dramatic draw at Crystal Palace on Monday night . Liverpool's manager has accepted . that their chances of winning the title are over. Well done Manchester . City and good luck, he said. Truth be told Rodgers under-estimated . Palace and this incredible match will surely be remembered as the night . when Liverpool blew the title. When . Dwight Gayle scored Palace's third goal, there is no stadium in the . country that has experienced a noise level like it this season. The . corrugated iron roofs of the Main Stand, Arthur Wait and Holmesdale Road . at Selhurst Park nearly flew into the night sky. Rodgers, standing on . the edge of the technical area, turned to his assistant, Colin Pascoe. They knew, as everybody else knows, they could not win the Premier . League title from there. Rodgers' team, including the newly crowned Football Writers' Footballer of the . Year, Luis  Suarez, have been left shredded. They have nothing left to . give. Gayle, who also . scored in Palace's defeat at Liverpool in October, has barely been able . to get a game this season and yet he scored two remarkable goals. What a . night for him. On target: Dwight Gayle levels for the hosts on a stunning night of drama at Crystal Palace . Inconsolable: Steven Gerrard comforts Luis Suarez . A . point still sent Rodgers's team top of the table, but it will mean . nothing to them after what was a catastrophic capitulation. If . this was Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal or City, we would be . talking about whether the  manager was the right man for the job. That's . what the Premier League does, it chews managers up and spits them out. At . this level, with a title to play for, you can't surrender and get away . with it. Fortunately, Rodgers has enough credit in the bank to go . forward next season. Rodgers . has paid for his inexperience after his side lost a critical game . against Chelsea at Anfield last week and tossed away a three-goal lead. How did they manage to do it? Maybe . we will never know. It was incredible. But Liverpool's title challenge . all came so suddenly for Rodgers, way ahead of schedule after spending . his first season in charge of Liverpool figuring it all out. Season two has been an extraordinary journey and yet now it has suddenly hit the buffers. Game over: Surely Liverpool's dreams of winning the Premier League title ended on Monday night . Champions . League football next season will be a gamechanger for this club, . however, and Rodgers is already making noises about  signing five or six . players to cope with the group phase before the turn of the year. Liverpool . will, therefore, operate with a swollen squad and, juggling that will . in itself be another test of this manager's ability. Just look how it . turned out for David Moyes at Manchester United, where every member of . the squad expected to play. He couldn't cope. Everyone . wants to play Champions League football, but the bar is high and the . standard is on another level. They have to live with that and somehow . fight it out for a place in the top four again next season. Suddenly the . task feels enormous. End of the road: Rodgers conceded the title to rivals Manchester City after Liverpool's 3-3 draw at Palace . In support: Tony Pulis has performed a minor miracle since taking over at Crystal Palace . Rodgers . will be ready, steadying himself after his trip to the World Cup in the . summer to scout for the players he needs. In a few weeks he will be in . Brazil and it will give the Liverpool  manager a chance to reflect on . the events of the final games of a  Premier League season. They . are a massive test of nerve, something Rodgers has never experienced . before as a Premier League manager. He spoke of giving this title chase . away, his players attempting to play 'Roy of the Rovers football' in an . attempt to pulverise Palace. They were 3-0 up at the time and suddenly, . bafflingly, they were back level at 3-3. After this, Rodgers will look to the long term.","Liverpool drew 3-3 with Crystal Palace despite Brendan Rodgers' side leading 3-0 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Scroll down for dramatic aerial video . Devastated survivors have spoken of the moment their Afghan village was obliterated by a deadly landslide, which has killed as many as 2,500 people. The disaster, which struck on Friday morning, buried Aab Barik, in north east Afghanistan, under tonnes of rock and mud. It destroyed hundreds of homes and displaced as many as 4,100 people, who are now living in tents provided by aid agencies. Bibi Khanum, 55, lost her husband and four children in the devastation. She said: 'Our house . was totally destroyed, we are destroyed and our life is destroyed. Devastation: An Afghan man and woman sit on top of the village where the . landslide struck. The woman lost her family in the disaster, as did . hundreds of her fellow villagers . Rescue efforts: Tents have been pitched near the scene of the disaster in North East Afghanistan . Ruined: Around 700 homes were destroyed, killing as many as 2,500 people . Search: Villagers in Argu, Afgnaistan were seen today digging through debris for traces of their relatives and homes . 'My . husband was killed under the rubble and four of my young children. I am . going crazy without them, repeating their names time and time again.' Aid groups . were today rushing to reach survivors as government officials said the . current death toll was at least 300 and warned it could rise by hundreds . more, after initial reports suggested that as many as 2,500 people may . have died. Large crowds gathered at the remote disaster site, where rescue efforts were abandoned due to the volume of deep mud covering houses. Only a few dead bodies have been pulled from the debris. 'Around 1,000 families are thought to have been affected with some 300 houses totally destroyed,' the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement. 'Assessments to determine priorities on immediate child protection and water, sanitation, and hygiene needs for (displaced) families are continuing.' It added that 700 families were displaced, with many fleeing their homes in fear that the unstable hillside could unleash more deadly landslides. Tents, emergency food supplies, health services and support for children who lost parents were being organised after many survivors spent another night in the open. Wailing near her father's destroyed house, Begum Nisa, a 40-year-old mother of three, described the moment when the wall of mud smashed through the village. 'I was eating lunch by the window of my house, then suddenly I heard a huge roar,' she said. Survivors: Around 4,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, and are now relying on international relief efforts . Grief-stricken: Survivors of the disaster have told how they are struggling to cope without their lost relatives . 'I shouted to my family to save themselves, but it was too late. I have lost my dear father and mother. I also lost my uncle and five members of his family.' Local people and emergency workers had used shovels to try to dig out anyone trapped alive but without success, and relief work turned to caring for survivors. Supplies began arriving as aid groups struggled to reach the village via poor mud roads that were unable to take heavy vehicles. Many villagers were at Friday prayers in two mosques when they were engulfed by the torrent of mud, and a second landslide hit people who assisted those in need. Solidarity: Villagers comfort each other as they wait for some bodies to retrieve. Rescuers have now given up on digging out more bodies . Crushed: More than 300 people have been confirmed dead - but authorities have said there is no hope of finding more than 2,000 others who are officially missing . Afghanistan held a national day of mourning on Sunday after President Hamid Karzai expressed his condolences to those who had lost loved ones. 'We have a list of around 300 people confirmed dead,' Badakhshan governor Shah Waliullah Adeeb told reporters at the scene on Saturday. 'We cannot continue the search and rescue operation anymore, as the houses are under metres of mud.' The harrowing account come as aid agencies attempt to restore basic amenities to the villagers. In a sign of the scale of devastation, the area is now being referred to a burial ground on account of the number of bodies trapped under the mud. Andrew Morris, chief of Unicef for the Northern Region of Afghanistan, said: 'The whole area has been declared a burial ground, our staff described it as in some places as deep as 50 metres of mud. 'The whole side of the mountain collapsed. Initially, after the first landslide, men from the neighbouring villages all ran to help with search and rescue. But the landslide slid further and killed all of them as well. It has left a number of children without fathers, and that is an additional tragedy here. 'Our first priority was to get water supplies going - people had just a few bottles of water handed out yesterday by visitors, the local government. At the same time we are urgently looking at sanitation. 'Then we have to help children to overcome this traumatic event. We have got to get them back to school as soon as we can. That is part of the return to normalcy.' Path of destruction: The landslide, which took place yesterday morning in the Afghan village, destroyed hundreds of homes . No hope: More than 2,100 deaths were confirmed, as rescuers gave up hope of pulling anybody from the destruction alive . Displaced: Some 4,000 people have been left with nowhere to live as a result of the ladndslide . Wiped out: The village in Badakshan province, was hit by heavy rains, prompting the landslide . Badakhshan is a mountainous province in northeast Afghanistan bordering Tajikistan, China and Pakistan. The landslides follow recent severe flooding in other parts of northern Afghanistan, with 150 people dead and 67,000 people affected by floods in Jowzjan, Faryab and Sar-e-Pul provinces. Flooding and landslides often occur during the spring rainy season in northern Afghanistan, with flimsy mud houses offering little protection against rising water levels and torrents of mud.","Aab Barik, in north-eastern Afghanistan, was buried by a tide of rock and mud on Friday caused by heavy rains .

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny insists finishing fourth would not have been his idea of success for Arsenal before the season started. The Gunners signed off their final home Barclays Premier League match with a 1-0 win over West Brom, having already been secure in fourth place following Everton's defeat by Manchester City on Saturday. It was a positive end to a campaign which a couple of months ago had been on the verge of implosion, and will end at Wembley for the FA Cup final against Hull on May 17. Despite that, Szczesny feels things could have been so different, and so much better. Success? Szczesny was part of Arsenal's lap of appreciation but says the season has been disappointing . Sign-off: Olivier Giroud's header gave the gunners a 1-0 win to end the season at the Emirates . 'It is good to sign off with a win in front of our fans, but with two games to go we had nothing to play for and I think we shouldn't really be in that position - we should be fighting for the title, so that is disappointing,' said Szczesny. 'I never considered fourth place before the start of the season as a successful season and a good position - I play for Arsenal because I want to win the title every year. 'Obviously at some point, when you lose games and you lose the chance to fight for the title, then the new challenge is to secure the Champions League spot and that was the aim this season, but I wouldn't have taken it before the season.' After failing to keep pace with Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea - Arsenal suffered heavy away defeats against all of them - Arsene Wenger's side slowly turned their form around. Four straight league wins following the nerve-shredding FA Cup semi-final penalty shoot-out win over Wigan saw the Gunners overhaul Everton and give themselves another shot at elite European football once again next season. Szczesny feels confident Arsenal - who had to cope without key men like Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil for long spells because of injury - can regroup to last the distance in 2014-15. Injury list: Szczesny said that injuries to the likes of Aaron Ramsey had cost Arsenal a shot at glory . Twin Poles: Fabianski and Szczesny are competing for a place in Arsene Wenger's Wembley line-up . 'It didn't happen for us this year, but one thing we have learned is that that we are good enough to challenge next year, and hopefully add a little bit more strength as well with a couple of new players coming in,' the goalkeeper said. 'If we manage to keep the consistency for the whole season, then we will be up there. 'We have had a good run and the momentum is with us so we stay positive and hopefully finish with a trophy at the end of the season.' Stand-in goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was the FA Cup hero for Arsenal against Wigan, saving two of the penalties. Szczesny believes his compatriot - who is out of contract in the summer - has earned the chance to play at Wembley again. 'I think Lukasz has done so well, that he deserves to play, but having said that I am a professional and I would love to play in the FA Cup final,' Szczesny added. 'It is the boss' decision to make, not an easy one, because there is a number one at the club and a goalkeeper who is the reason we are in the FA Cup final.' Another decision Wenger has yet to confirm is whether he will be staying on next season himself, although the Arsenal manager moved to allay any fears his lap of appreciation would be the last time Gunners fans saw him at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger in: The gunners boss is yet to put pen to paper on a new contract but insists he will stay . Appreciation: Bacary Sagna saluted the crowd amid rumours that he will leave the club this summer . Szczesny said: 'It would be huge for us. 'He is our manager and he has shown a lot of trust in a lot of the players at this club and we owe a lot to him.' The Baggies appear set for another campaign in the top flight, as Norwich's goalless draw at Chelsea left them three points clear with two matches still to play and holding a far superior goal difference. Manager Pepe Mel will resolve his future at the end of the season, when it looks like his remit of keeping the midlands club up will have been met. In doubt: Pepe Mel has almost certainly kept West Brom up, but is yet to seal his future at the club . Defender Jonas Olsson believes there is plenty of character within the squad on which to build. 'You have targets and ambitions, but without taking my ambitions down, I think any season where West Brom stay up is an okay achievement,' the Sweden international said. 'If you finish eighth you want to prosper and finish higher (the next season), but there needs to be a balance between ambition and realism, so that is something to reflect on after this season.'","Keeper claims injuries have cost the gunners, but maintains that fourth was not good enough .

A poll of over 5,000 fans however suggested that 75 per cent oppose the change, with John Homer, chairman of the West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club, calling 'an unnecessary break with tradition.' West Brom have worn Blue and White stripes every year since 1892, with the exception of a period during the 1940s when they played in all blue. The change was described as the biggest alteration to a Baggies kit since the early 1990s. The club wore an uneven 'bar-code' design shirt between 1992 and 1994. The move to a pin-stripe echoes a similar change by Southampton two seasons ago. The Saints ditched their traditional red and white striped kit for a red kit with pinstripes, before removing the stripes altogether this season. Southampton: The traditional red and white stripes (left) disappeared in 2012 (right) before a move to all red . Hull City: The TIgers experimented with pinstripes for one season in 2009/10, but reverted to equal stripes . Cardiff City: Owner Vincent Tan insists that the club, who he made ditch their blue kit, will stay wearing red . Hull City also experimented with a pinstriped kit recently, but returned to their usual equal stripes after just one season, during which they were relegated from the top flight. Other Premier League clubs who have broken with tradition recently include Cardiff City, who changed their kit from blue to red when Malaysian owner Vincent Tan took over. West Brom were unwilling to either confirm or deny the new kit design: 'The club does not comment about the designs of new kits before they have been officially unveiled.' a spokesman said.","Club have played in blue and white stripes since 1892 .

"By . Jonny Singer . His dazzling skills once lit up world football, and former Argentina player and manager Diego Maradona showed he hasn't lost his silky touches. Maradona, 53, was invited to the stage by French Guiness World Record freestyler Wassim Benslimane, before being asked to join the juggler in some kick-ups. Dressed in a grey suit, and in shoes not ideally suited to football, Maradona, considered by some to be the greatest player of all time, showed glimpses of his incredible talent. Skills: Maradona showed he still has some of the ability that made him one of the world's greats . Tricks and flicks: The former Argentina star pulled off some nice touches at the freestyle event . In control: the 53-year-old still has an excellent first touch, but was eventually outshone by his partner . At one point he juggled the ball against the floor using the soles of his feet, as well as demonstrating a first touch that would be the envy of many current professionals. Benslimane, however, stole the show, swinging the ball around his neck before doing kick-ups lying down and then tricking his partner into trying to trip him. Maradona, who spent two years in charge of Argentina before an unsuccesful 2010 World Cup, won the tournament as a player in 1986, when he also scored his infamous 'hand of god' goal against England.

"By . Martyn Ziegler, Press Association . Manchester City's hopes for the crucial last two matches of the Barclays Premier League season have been given a major boost after Yaya Toure declared himself fully fit for the climax of the title race. The Ivory Coast midfielder was substituted midway through the second half of the 3-2 win over Everton, raising some concerns about his fitness. Toure has now confirmed, however, that there had been no flare-up of the muscle injury suffered against Liverpool in the middle of April that threatened to end his campaign. Worry: Toure limped away against Liverpool last month and was taken off again at Everton on Saturday . Influence: Toure's performances in midfield and particularly his goals have helped City maintain their title push . The early departure at Goodison Park was a protective measure to make sure he was in the best shape for the games against Aston Villa on Wednesday and West Ham on Sunday. He told the club's website: 'It was very important I came off (against Everton). It has been difficult for me in a short space of time to recover from the injury I picked up at Liverpool and prepare physically. 'If you are not fully prepared it is very tough, because you have to be at 100 per cent for these games and coming back is always difficult, especially at the end of the season, but I feel good.' Toure added that Villa and West Ham will be looking to 'enjoy' themselves after securing top-flight status for next season and that City must be at their very best. 'Both Aston Villa and West Ham are sharp and will come to just enjoy the games, but we have a league to play for,' the 30-year-old said. Return: Toure is back in training and says he will be ready for City's final two fixtures . Expectation: Toure says City are confident they can win the title by beating Aston Villa and West Ham . 'I hope we complete the job, but it depends how sharp we are, how we prepare mentally and physically. 'Our target was always to win something, but for us the League Cup is not enough. The Premier League was always our target, so now we need to do be at our optimum levels when Aston Villa come to our stadium on Wednesday.' He added: 'We definitely expect to win it - as a team at the top, you always expect to win. 'We have worked so hard this year and, if we don't win, it would be a massive disappointment for us, for the fans and for the club as well.'","Ivorian midfielder will be available to play Aston Villa on Wednesday .

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . It feels almost churlish to be labelling someone who cost £27million as an unexpected hero; for that kind of money the volume of goals Edin Dzeko has scored this season should be mandatory. Twenty-four in all competitions isn’t to be sniffed at, but for whatever reason it just hasn’t happened for the Bosnian at Manchester City before now. He is a divisive character at the Etihad. Some absolutely loathe a bumbling first touch and lack of link-up; others recognise that the 28-year-old is a goalscorer and a player who works harder with more intelligence than his languid style suggests. City have proved in recent weeks that if you ping balls into the box, Dzeko will be waiting to tuck in. Marksman: Edin Dzeko has scored crucial goals at Crystal Palace and Everton recently to help guide City towards the title . And that’s exactly what he’s done in recent weeks. Nodding in Yaya Toure’s cross at Crystal Palace with the confidence of a poacher, he settled the nerves at Selhurst Park early on. He did the same at Old Trafford. Dzeko averages a goal every 136 minutes, the sixth best in Premier League history: . Sergio Aguero.........................115 . Thierry Henry...........................122 . Javier Hernandez...................128 . Ruud van Nistelrooy...............128 . Robin van Persie....................135 . Edin Dzeko..............................136 . On Saturday Dzeko was unplayable at Everton. Not only did he score twice - yes, he had two bites at the cherry for his first - but the striker was a real handful for Antolin Alcaraz and John Stones. The debate still goes on about whether he’s really up to it or not. Immediately after the 1-1 draw against Arsenal in March, supporters threw a portion of blame at Dzeko, who was perceived to have been lazy and unproductive. On that particular day he looked lonely, an isolated targetman hoping for someone to play off. Since, Manuel Pellegrini has urged David Silva and Samir Nasri to get closer to him away from home. The results at Palace and Everton are testament to that, while they perhaps should’ve gone away from Anfield with something. Super start: Dzeko runs away after putting City 1-0 at Crystal Palace - the same day as Liverpool lost to Chelsea . Tamed beast: Alvaro Negredo looked a sensation in the first half of the season but his form has tailed off . The Chilean is finding a way to get the best out of Dzeko in a way in which Roberto Mancini couldn’t. He’s had to, given Sergio Aguero’s injury trouble - to have left him out for months on end - and Alvaro Negredo’s puzzling dip in form: he hasn’t scored in the Premier League since January 12. There doesn’t appear to be a quick fix to Negredo’s problems. The former Sevilla man works hard, covers the width of the 18-yard box with more gusto than Dzeko, but simply isn’t as productive with it. It is easier to laud Negredo. He looks to be putting more effort in, wins more in the air and is more comfortable with the intricacy of Silva and Nasri in behind. But he has lost the knack of scoring goals. Dzeko has it, so he is given the shirt. Two at Everton, the first at Crystal Palace, two at Manchester United, the only goal at home against Palace and nudging City back ahead against Southampton last month have all been very important goals. Tactician: Manuel Pellegini has worked out how to get the best out of Edin Dzeko . Pellegrini has it spot on. The former Wolfsburg striker isn’t the archetypal front man for a side so insistent on beauty, but has carried the can while Aguero’s been absent. Plan A is to play through teams, Plan B to go a touch more direct. Dzeko clearly suits the latter and - with a fully fit Argentine - is a threat off the bench. An expensive threat, but one nonetheless. From the start though, and this has been the case since the move to England in 2011, his work is often unseen and underappreciated. Put politely it isn’t obvious and flashy enough to be the topic of praise down the pub after games. That said, he can be frustratingy inconsistent. There is an argument that you ought to expect more bang for your buck. Hotshot: Dzeko's strike-partner Sergio Aguero has had a disrupted season through injury . In a microcosm, Dzeko is both the reason why City should win the league and why they haven’t already won it with ease. Failing Financial Fair Play is unlikely to have serious ramifications for the club - unless UEFA don’t fancy some of Europe’s top sides in the Champions League - but their spending may have to be curbed. You’d expect Dzeko to still be turning in to training from Carrington’s leafy lanes come July for that reason alone. Interestingly, both Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger have bemoaned their striking options this season. What both wouldn’t give for someone like Dzeko. He might have won them the title.","Eden Dzeko has scored 24 goals in all competitions this season .

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . No sooner had Amir Khan boxed his brilliant way into pole position to fight Floyd Mayweather than the clamour for a re-match between the Money man and Marcos Maidana rose up to threaten that prospect. Khan staked his claim to the key to the Mayweather treasure chest with the dazzling welterweight debut in which he crushed Luis Collazo. Before the watching world had time to savour the moment, Maidana followed him into the same ring on the Las Vegas Strip and engaged Mayweather in a brawl so thrilling that not even the world’s No 1 boxer can wait for second helpings. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Amir Khan talk after the fight of his life . Take a bow: Amir Khan won his welterweight debut against Luis Collazo in Las Vegas . ‘Let’s do it again right here,’ he snapped at Maidana as the Argentinian kept insisting that he was the real winner of their close encounter of the brutal kind. September is the proposed date for that spiteful reunion and that is a problem for Khan. The fasting to which Bolton’s most celebrated Muslim must submit during Ramadan concludes at the end of July. As he reiterated here: ‘That doesn’t give me time to train properly for a fight of the Mayweather magnitude.’ Before this star-spangled fight night at the MGM Grand Garden preliminary talks were under way in an effort to persuade Mayweather to put back his next fight from his traditional September date, until November. But commercial considerations come first for the man who is banking $32 million and rising for his Saturday night’s work and a re-match with Maidana is now big box office. ‘If this is the fight the fans want then let’s do it in September,’ he said. It appears they do. Going the distance: Khan won by a unanimous decision as he hoped to set up a bout with Floyd Mayweather . Although the anti-Mayweather crowd jammed into the arena failed to recognise the heart and the talent with which he had brought him through a serious test and booed the majority decision in his favour, those jeers turned to cheers when he offered Maidana another shot. Khan’s best chance appears to be coming back to Mayweather’s home town next May, although he and his advisors will continue to pursue negotiations as Showtime TV executives compute the pay-per-view returns and whether Maidana can help improve those numbers in a return bout. In terms of how much pressure he can apply with his fists, Khan could hardly have done more as he stepped up to the 147 lbs division for the first time in his career. Collazo, who once gave Ricky Hatton all the trouble he could handle, was resurgent and aiming for a million-making fight of his own with Mayweather. Make a date: Mayweather wants to schedule the fight for September, which falls over Ramadam and would effect Khan's training . Yet even though he is the naturally larger welterweight he was knocked down three times by Khan on his way to overwhelming points defeat. After the first decking, from a wonderfully short but precise right in the fourth, Collazo resorted to the desperate measure of fighting with his hands down in hope of luring Khan and his allegedly suspect chin onto a sucker punch. It never happened. Khan had spent a year out of the ring waiting for Mayweather before he was shunted onto Saturday’s under-card but he spent the time learning to defend himself. Virgil Hunter, his latest trainer, also impressed upon Khan the advisability of balancing his speed and skill with an element of self-protection while waiting patiently for the openings for his lightning attacks to present themselves. Below the belt: Collazo is warned by the referee after delivering a low blow that left Khan on the canvas . It worked perfectly against another former world champion. Khan won round after round and Collazo became so frustrated that he stooped to throwing deliberate low blows. To an extent that dubious tactic worked in the eighth, even though he was docked a point by referee Vic Drakulich. So incensed was Khan that he was similarly punished for a foul of his own - and so winded that Collazo won his only round. But two rounds later Khan put him down twice more and the New Yorker of Puerto Rican antecedents was then held up by the ropes and saved by the bell. Then, knowing the fight was lost, Collazo hit disgracefully low in the 12th. Astonishingly the referee did not deduct a point for that grievous offence and even tried to hurry Khan back into action. Team Floyd : Often mocked pop star Justin Beiber was at the MGM Grand to cheer on his friend Mayweather . Khan had to buy himself adequate recovery time by dropping to one knee. When he rose, he punished Collazo through to the final bell. Khan has always maintained that his speed can over-run anyone, Mayweather included, and many previous non-believers are likely to have been converted by the job he did on Collazo. Still, on the question of fighting Khan, Mayweather kept his counsel, as usual. He also kept the unbeaten record he cherishes so much and is 46-0 after unifying Maidana’s WBA world welterweight title with his WBC belt. Mayweather did that despite Maidana hitting him 221 times, the most he has endured since computer punch statistics were introduced. A shuddering majority of those came during Maidana’s cavalry charge through the opening rounds…..from that fabled, knock-out right hand. With Maidana turning it into a street fight, Mayweather was cut beside the right eye by a head butt in the fourth. He praised his corner for a repair job which left him untroubled by any blood flow thereafter. Maidana, having won the first, took the fifth also and was level at that point. Let's do it again! Mayweather celebrates after his close fought victory that may spawn a rematch with Maidana . Thereafter Mayweather’s consummate defending and clever, clinical, precise counter-punching gave him control of the crucial middle rounds. There was no robbery here, although how one judge scored it a draw is a mystery. Maidana was warned for hitting low and Mayweather told him: ‘If we do this re-match please remember that I want to have more children.’ The Argentinian responded by accusing the American of ‘not fighting like a man they way I expected, not bringing the fight to me’ But no boxer is under any obligation to fight the way that would suit his opponent and from this neutral corner there could be no denying that Mayweather’s courage and cleverness deserved to give him the victory. Whether he was strictly telling the truth when he claimed he had risked taking more punches ‘to please the fans’ is more debatable. Khan senses that the great man is slowing down a little, at 37, and now might be a good time to fight him. By that reckoning this time next year could be an even better time.","Amir Khan proved himself worthy of a fight with Floyd Mayweather with victory over Luis Collazo .

Starting next school year, pasta and other grain products in schools will have to be whole-grain rich, or more than half whole grain. That includes rolls, biscuits, pizza crust, tortillas and even grits. The requirement is part of a government effort to make school lunches and breakfasts healthier.

The school food requirement championed by Michelle Obama is part of a government effort to make school lunches and breakfasts healthier . Some schools say the changes have been . expensive and difficult to put in place, and school officials are . asking Congress and the Agriculture Department to roll back some of the . requirements.  Their main concerns: finding enough whole grain-rich . foods that kids like, lowering sodium levels and keeping fruits and . vegetables from ending up in the trash. In . interviews, school nutrition directors across the country mostly agreed . that healthy changes were needed in school lunches — long famous for . daily servings of greasy fries and pizza. Kids have adapted easily to . many of the changes, are getting more variety in the lunch line and are . eating healthier. But . Domokos-Bays and other school nutrition directors say the standards . were put in place too quickly as kids get used to new tastes and school . lunch vendors rush to reformulate their foods. When kids don't buy . lunch, or throw it away, it costs the schools precious dollars. 'The . regulations are so prescriptive, so it's difficult to manage not only . the nutrition side of your businesses but the business side of your . business,' Domokos-Bays said. Some of the main challenges reported by school nutrition directors: . Whole . grains. While many kids have adapted to whole grain rolls, breads and . even pizza crusts, some schools are having problems with whole . grain-rich pastas, which can cook differently. USDA's Janey Thornton, a . former school nutrition director, says the government is working with . the food industry to develop better pastas. Fruit and vegetables are served during lunch at the Patrick Henry Elementary School in Alexandria and next year students will be required to take vegetables from the menu . Whole grains have also proved a hard . sell for some popular regional items, like biscuits and grits in the . South. Lyman Graham of the Roswell, New Mexico, school district says . tortillas are one of the most popular foods in his area, but the whole . wheat flour versions are 'going in the trash.' Sodium. Schools will have to lower the total sodium levels in school meals next . school year and then will have to lower them even further by 2017. School . lunch directors say the 2017 target — 640 milligrams total in an . elementary school lunch and 740 milligrams in a high school lunch — . isn't feasible and say kids will reject the foods. USDA's Thornton . acknowledges the food industry isn't there yet but encourages frustrated . school lunch directors to 'worry about today first before we imagine . the worst down the road.' The . standards require every student to take a fruit or vegetable to create a . balanced plate. The reaction among students has been mixed. 'If the . kids don't eat the food, then all I have is healthy trash cans,' said . Peggy Lawrence, director of nutrition at the Rockdale County Public . Schools in Georgia. Starting next school year, pasta and other grain products in schools will have to be whole-grain rich, or more than half whole grain . Public schools have been known to serve unhealthy foods that contribute to childhood obesity like pizza and french fries . Schools will for the first time this year have to make sure that all foods, including vending machines and a la carte lines, meet healthier standards. While many schools have already moved to make snacks healthier, others depend on snack money to help operate their lunchrooms and are worried about a sales dip. The School Nutrition Association has asked Congress and USDA to only require that 50 percent of foods be whole grain-rich, to suspend the 2017 sodium requirements and to stop requiring students to take a fruit or vegetable. Margo Wootan, a nutrition lobbyist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest who has pushed for healthier meals, says relaxing those standards could gut the program. 'You can't call a meal a meal without a fruit or vegetable,' she said. USDA has shown some flexibility already: In 2012, the department scrapped maximums on proteins and grains after students complained they were hungry. USDA's Thornton says problems will lessen as the food industry creates healthier products. 'I'll bet that five or seven years down the road, we'll see kids eating healthy food and we'll see acceptance,' she said. Republicans say they may intervene before then. Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt, the Republican in charge of the House spending committee overseeing USDA, has said school districts need a 'pause' while problems are worked out. Aderholt's panel is expected to release a new spending bill this month that may propose changes. Republicans also are eying the next five-year renewal of the school foods policy, due in 2015. Sam Kass, senior policy adviser for nutrition at the White House, said last month that there have been 'tremendous gains' in school foods and said he finds efforts to undermine that disappointing. 'First and foremost, the key is not going back,"" he said. At Alexandria's Patrick Henry Elementary last Tuesday, students said they loved their lunches and gobbled up plump strawberries. Kindergartner Jade Kennedy said she recently tried kiwi at school for the first time. But Domokos-Bays said she will serve white pasta to the students until she has to make the change this summer. Tuesday was pasta day, and several children said it was their favorite lunch — 'better than my mom made,' first-grader Ruth Gebregiorgis said.","Michelle Obama created an initiative requiring schools to serve whole grains, lower sodium, and require students to take a vegetable .

"By . Rebecca Hardy . Engelbert Humperdinck screams 'pop legend' before he even opens his mouth. For starters, there are the sideburns. Huge things that stretch from his temples to his jowls and are coloured, like his hair, the deepest auburn. The dye job, he says, is the only thing 'I've ever had done'. He looks, well... how best to describe this showbiz demigod who's sold more than 150 million albums, had a gazillion knickers hurled at him by besotted fans and turned 78 yesterday? Engelbert has returned to the music scene once more with a new album called Engelbert Calling . With his fluffed-up mane, honey tan and huge frame, I think leonine best sums him up. And, boy, has he enjoyed the odd night on the prowl in his time. 'I've had more paternity suits than casual suits,' he says matter-of-factly. There are claims he's slept with 3,000 women. He says the number is lower, but I don't think he was really keeping score. The only woman who's ever truly mattered is his wife Patricia, to whom he's been married for 50 years. 'My wife's a wonderful lady,' he says. 'She's put up with a lot but she's very intelligent and knew deep down that, whatever I did, it wasn't serious. She knew I always loved her more. 'But I think being in showbusiness and having so many people giving themselves, I suppose I thought I was missing something. It was a part of growing up. I think my wife got hurt a lot,' he admits. 'I've tried to make it up to her. I ring her three or four times a day - not because of guilt but because I want to talk. I'd like her to travel with me more but she's not been well.' Enge, as he asks me to call him ('that's Enge as in Stonehenge'), looks genuinely sad when he says this. Engelbert Humperdinck and wife Patricia Healey . His voice - which is part Las Vegas where he spent a chunk of his 47-year career after finding humungous fame with Release Me in 1967, and part Leicestershire where he grew up and still has a huge 25-acre estate complete with its own pub - wobbles. Enge adores his family, which includes six sisters, two brothers and four grown-up children of his own. One of the hardest-working men in showbusiness, he clocked up 65,000 miles on the road in the first three months of this year. I meet Enge before he appears on BBC2's Later… With Jools Holland. He's as jumpy as a frog in a blender. 'This show tonight is scaring me,' he says. 'I can go in front of thousands of people on stage and not be afraid, but when there's just a few people, that scares me.' Enge is one of the least showbizzy showbusiness legends on the planet. So much so, you'd struggle to find anyone with a bad word to say about him – apart, perhaps, from his old mate Tom Jones. Engelbert with Patricia and their third daughter . The two men, who used to be very close, fell out following the death of their former manager, Gordon Mills, from cancer 27 years ago. The pop legends were both discovered by Mills in the mid-60s and became partners in the then huge MAM record label, until Enge decided to branch out on his own. 'We haven't spoken since we lost our manager,' he says. 'Tom never forgave me for not staying with Gordon, but I wanted to go off on my own because Gordon was partial to him. So I haven't spoken to him for 27 years. I tried to make friends with him again but he just pooh-poohed it. I tried to say, ""Let bygones be bygones,"" but he didn't want to know. He and his son (Tom's manager Mark) were as cold as ice, but I don't mind the fact we don't speak. It's his loss.' 'Tom never forgave me so I haven't spoken to him for 27 years. I tried to make . friends with him again but he just pooh-poohed it' Indeed – Enge isn't short of friends. Take the playlist of his new album of duets: Elton John, Cliff Richard, Johnny Mathis, Lulu, Charles Aznavour, Neil Sedaka, Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick… it goes on and on. 'It was listening to Elton John's live album that gave us the idea.' 'Us' is he and his son Scott, now also his manager. 'Elton introduces a song saying, ""I wrote this many years ago when I was a struggling songwriter waiting for an Engelbert Humperdinck to come along and take a song like this."" So, we called him, asked him to do a duet on the album and he said yes. I was so thrilled. 'When he came to LA to record, we sat and talked for over an hour getting acquainted then he said, ""Come on. Let's do it."" He's so professional and courteous. Afterwards he sent me the biggest bunch of flowers you've ever seen.' He duets with Lulu on I Need You Now. 'She's been a part of my success - which is why I wanted to share this album with her,' he says. Lulu, it turns out, voted Release Me a hit on Juke Box Jury back in 1967. 'All the others voted it a miss,' says Enge. Engelbert received a shocking defeat at the Eurovision song contest in 2012  when he represented Britain . This album, he says, has been a 'two-year labour of love' following his shocking defeat at the Eurovision Song Contest in which he came second to last after singing Love Will Set You Free. It was, as he says, 'all political'. 'When you're drawn to sing first, as I was, you're forgotten by the time the whole thing goes through. All I can tell you is it was political and it was disgusting.' Does he regret appearing? 'I thought it was a great honour to represent my country and I had a great song. The mere fact I lost was no reflection on me.' He's had more gold and platinum discs in his career than most of us have had hot dinners. But it wasn't until he was 30 that he got his 'lucky break' with Release Me, when he got a chance to perform the song, which had been released on 13 January, 1967, in a show at the London Palladium, replacing singer Dickie Valentine who'd fallen ill. 'The record didn't move for three months,' he says, 'until I got a shot at the Palladium. The very next day it started selling 80,000 a day, 90,000 and then it went to 127,000 a day.' He went to the States and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. He says Ed 'promoted you in such a way you can't not be successful. Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Moody Blues – they all went on his show and became huge stars. Suddenly I was appearing with people I'd heard singing as a little boy, like Bing Crosby. Engelbert describes Elivis Presley as his 'twin' 'I remember him standing in front of me, rehearsing with his pipe in his mouth – this legend, looking at me. When I finished he took his pipe out and said, ""That's some set of pipes you've got there, boy.""' Enge sparkles when he says this, much as he does when he speaks about his old muckers Dean Martin ('he always called me Humpy Bumpy Lumpy Dumpy. I loved him very much'). Frank Sinatra ('he bought Strangers In The Night off my manager. I'd already recorded it but it didn't belong to me any more. I heard he paid a lot of money for it. I knew Frank very well but I didn't like his ethics – stealing my song') and Elvis Presley ('I saw him three months prior to his death and knew he was troubled, but he was such a big star I felt inadequate to give him advice as a friend. I could see the grey in his face and I could see he was losing it. I later heard he used to speak of me as the twin brother he lost at birth. I thought that was quite a statement.') Back in the days before plain Arnold Dorsey had changed his name to the rather preposterous- sounding Engelbert Humperdinck, Enge was can't-afford-a-packet-of-peanuts-let-alone-a-pint poor. 'I used to walk past the pub and smell the beer instead of walking in and being able to buy half a pint,' he says. 'Those were hard years. There was a lot of starvation. I went three or four days without food.' Now he can eat what he wants, with a fortune of over £65 million having invested wisely in 'bricks and mortar for my children'. But he's never stopped working for it. 'Sometimes now I'll be about to go on stage and there's 10,000 people out there and I'll say to myself, ""God, I don't feel like it tonight."" Then they call your name, you walk out and you just come to life. My job is to entertain people and make them happy. I'm blessed to be able to do that.' He could, he says, 'keep chatting for hours' but he must prepare himself for the Jools Holland show, which he decides to do at the bar with a big glass of wine. Like I say, Engelbert Humperdinck ('I like the name Engelbert. It's unusual,' he says. 'But Humperdinck? Not so much') is a 24-carat pop legend. The duets album Engelbert Calling is out now.

"By . Sarah Bridge . Simon Pearce was once on the brink of stardom. A former disco-dancing champion, the Welsh actor and singer was a star of West End musicals such as Cats and Starlight Express and had landed a modelling contract in New York. Better: Simon Pearce says he hopes to hit the big time once more after recovering from his illness . He appeared on stage with Liza Minnelli and mixed with A-listers like Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davies Jnr. But just as Simon was about to hit the big time and be offered a part in a new group that was being put together - pop band sensation Steps - it all ended. The once-superfit star, used to jumping around on a stage for hours every night, could barely move. He felt lethargic, had no energy and could barely drag himself out of the house. Worse still for someone in a profession which relies on looks as well as talent and personality, his hair began to fall out in huge clumps. Well-meaning friends put it down to stress over the loss of his mother who had recently died, but Simon knew it was more than that. However  doctors were baffled. In the meantime, Simon was desperate to restore his failing locks and went to a clinic for a hair transplant. 'I was so worried about my health and what was happening to my hair,' recalls Simon, now 47. 'But it left me with terrible scars. It affected my confidence and my career and my hair still kept coming out.' The surgeon who carried out the operation was later struck off for carrying out liposuction surgery without proper qualifications, but Simon is philosophical. 'I didn't complain as I'm not that type of person, but I do believe in karma, and what goes around comes around,' he says. 'I just don't think the man knew what he was doing.' Highlight: Simon's West End career was going from strength to strength when he was diagnosed . Friend: Simon counted Liza Minelli among his A-list friends during his theatrical heyday . He had to turn down the chance to sign up to Steps and was unable to work any more due to his weakness. He . was further hit by tragedy, as his father passed away and then his brother, former . British heavyweight boxing champion Dave Pearce, died at the age of just . 41. It took five years for Simon to be finally diagnosed with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome. Now living in Newport, Wales, Simon is taking medication for his condition which has made a great difference to his health. He has also had a second, successful hair transplant from His Hair clinic in Birmingham and is ready to hit the big time again. 'I was doing so well when I fell ill, but now I'm determined to rekindle what I had,' says Simon. 'When it was all going downhill, I was as low as I could possibly be. I did feel like not going on, to be honest - people with chronic fatigue syndrome have committed suicide. But I've had an inner strength and believe that good things do come out of the bad times. 'I wouldn't be the person I am today without the things that have happening to me, and now I just want to get on with my life.' The seventh son of a seventh son, Simon believes the words of a fortune teller once visited by a family friend, who told her that someone close to her called SImon would be successful and famous, but not until later on in his life. 'Hopefully that is what is going to happen,' says Simon optimistically. Currently single, Simon spends his time concentrating on his song-writing and contacting his old friends in the industry to let them know that he is ready for his comeback. 'It's a big step for me, but now I just want to get on with my life.' he says.","Simon Pearce mixed with stars like Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The use of e-cigarettes in public places in England could be outlawed. The devices could be banned from offices and other public spaces under plans being considered by Public Health England. The minutes from one of the organisation’s meetings reveal concerns that they could ‘renormalise smoking’. Public Health England is considering banning e-cigarettes from public places in England . The minutes also contain a recommendation that e-cigarettes should be banned to prevent them ‘undermining smoking prevention’, The Times reports. But Public Health England says banning the use of e-cigarettes in public places is just one possibility that is being considered - and it is far from certain that it will happen. The news comes just days after New York and Chicago banned the cigarettes from public places. On Tuesday regulations were changed to mean that in these cities, e-cigarettes now fall under the same set of regulations as tobacco cigarettes. As a result, they can no longer be used in bars, restaurants and other public places - including parks. However, many experts do not believe England should follow New York in increasing regulations on e-cigarettes. This is . because new research by the health charity Ash has revealed that barely . any non-smokers are taking up the habit by smoking e-cigarettes. The . study showed that almost all of the people who smoke them are doing so . in a bid to say off tobacco - meaning the devices could actually have a . positive impact on public health. On Tuesday new regulations came in in New York which mean smoking e-cigarettes is now not permitted in the city's bars, restaurants or parks . Almost two-thirds of people who smoke them also smoke normal cigarettes while most of the rest are ex-smokers. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash said: 'The dramatic rise in use of electronic cigarettes over the past four years suggests that smokers are increasingly turning to these devices to help them cut down or quit smoking. Significantly, usage among non-smokers remains negligible. 'While it is important to control the advertising of electronic cigarettes to make sure children and non-smokers are not being targeted, there is no evidence from our research that e-cigarettes are acting as a gateway into smoking.' Professor Robert West, who led the study, added: 'Despite claims that use of electronic cigarettes risks renormalising smoking, we found no evidence to support this view. ‘On the contrary, electronic cigarettes may be helping to reduce smoking as more people use them as an aid to quitting.' The director-general of the Institute of Economic Affairs is also against the idea of banning e-cigarettes. Mark Littlewood told The Times: ‘We have found potentially the best lifesaving alternative there is to the smoking of tobacco. ‘E-cigarettes are a lifestyle product and a life-saving product and my concern is that public health bureaucrats are now more interested in whether there should be a cultural norm of individuals putting small cylindrical devices between their lips than whether the consequences of doing so are life-threatening.’ For now, there are no immediate plans for a ban to be put in place. Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England said: 'We have not called for a ban on e-cigarette use in public spaces. 'PHE is working with our partners to consider the options for supporting safe use of e cigarettes to reduce harm and support smokers to quit, some of which were discussed by our board in February.'","Minutes from Public Health England meeting show ban is being considered .

"By . Emma Innes . David Davies MP has accused the Welsh NHS of giving out Viagra 'like sweets' NHS doctors are wasting thousands of pounds by prescribing Viagra to patients who do not need it, an MP has warned. Patients with diabetes claim they are being given the drug even if they don't have erectile dysfunction. Tory MP David Davies accused the Welsh NHS of wasting public money by giving out Viagra ‘like sweets’. But the Welsh Government has hit back at the conservative politician claiming this is not true. Mr Davies said: ‘I am fully in favour of prescribing it to people with conditions like diabetes if they have a problem. ‘But I am not in favour of handing out Viagra to patients who do not need it. ‘Not everyone with diabetes has erectile dysfunction and handing out Viagra tablets like sweets is no more than a waste of public money.’ Mr Davies, MP for Monmouth, South Wales, claims a diabetic man wrote to him to say he was given Viagra even though he has no problems with erectile dysfunction. The patient claimed he was told it is NHS Wales guidance to issue the drug to all diabetics - even though erectile dysfunction affects only 20 to 40 per cent of people with the condition. Mr Davies added: ‘A resident of Wales who is not a constituent of mine contacted me to tell me that he had been prescribed Viagra because he is a diabetic. ‘He told me he does not suffer from erectile dysfunction, but decided to take up the GP's offer to prescribe Viagra, which is an expensive drug to buy over the counter, to find out what it was like. ‘It seems that in Wales you can have free prescriptions, free parking in hospital car parks and free Viagra, but you'll have to wait twice as long for an operation as someone in England.’ Mr Davies is calling for a change from a regionalised health service to a fully national one. He wants the Welsh NHS - recently hit by a series of scandals over hospital waiting times - to have its powers returned to the government. Mr Davies says diabetes patients in Wales are being given Viagra even if they do not have erectile dysfunction . A Welsh Government source said: ‘This is another cock and bull story from David Davies. ‘What he's saying is simply not true.’ Sexual dysfunction is more common in people with diabetes than in other people because the condition can cause damage to the blood vessels and the nervous system causing reduced blood flow and loss of sensation in the sexual organs. Other problems associated with diabetes - such as heart disease and depression - can also increase the chance of developing erectile dysfunction.","MP accused the Welsh NHS of wasting money giving out drug 'like sweets'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A baby boy born with two life-threatening holes in his heart has just celebrated his first birthday - thanks to a cow heart. Ruben Weber-Jackson, from Beverley, Yorkshire, was suffering from restricted breathing because of the holes. Now, during two major operations, they have been repaired - using tissue from a cow's heart - and he can breathe normally. Ruben Weber-Jackson was born with two life-threatening holes in his heart, which restricted his breathing . When Ruben was born last year, his parents thought he was a happy and healthy baby. His mother Petra, 29, said: 'He was pink and everything seemed perfect, really. But in hindsight, there were probably a few little signs, but nothing significant that made us think there was a real problem. 'I remember saying he was such an easy baby who sleeps a lot and was very calm. He also had swollen eyes and there is one photo we took where his lips looked slightly purple.' But when he was two weeks and two days old, she noticed his breathing was unusual. She said: 'I just had a niggling feeling something wasn't right. He was breathing funny but I thought I was just being a paranoid parent. But it got worse and I took him to the GP, who sent us to Hull Royal Infirmary.' Now during two major operations, they have been repaired - using tissue from a cow's heart . Thanks to the cow tissue, Ruben can now breathe normally and has just celebrated his first birthday . Hospital scans showed Ruben had two holes in his heart and a narrowing of the aorta. It meant his circulation was severely compromised - which explained his unusual breathing and purple lips - and he was rushed in for dangerous open-heart surgery. It was during the second operation where the doctors used tissue from a cow's heart, which has saved his life. The procedure, known as a bovine pericardial patch, has saved Ruben's life and allowed him to live to see his first birthday. His mother Petra said: 'There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about how different our lives could be now - how very close we came to losing him' His mother said: 'There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about how different our lives could be now -how very close we came to losing him. 'In some ways, I think he subconsciously knows - he is such a happy baby and he seems to want to make the most out of life.' 'Throughout everything, people kept saying to me ""I . couldn't be as strong as you are"". But the truth is, you don't know how . strong you can be until you've not got a choice.'","Ruben Weber-Jackson was born with two holes in his heart .

"By . Emma Innes . An investigation has been launched following allegations that a patient bled to death while in hospital. Managers at the Royal Bolton Hospital have set up a serious case review panel after a patient, thought to be a man, died on the high dependency ward in March this year. A director from the Bolton NHS Foundation Trust will lead the investigation and a report will be presented to the trust board and the NHS Bolton Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). Managers at the Royal Bolton Hospital are investigating claims a patient bled to death on a ward . The hospital’s head of communications, Heather Edwards, said: ‘We can confirm that we had had an incident in which sadly a patient died unexpectedly. ‘We have set up a serious case review panel to look into this to see what, if anything, could have been done differently. ‘A final report will go to our board, the CCG, and the family once the review has been completed.’ The police are not involved in the investigation. Findings of the investigation could be passed to the coroner once the trust has completed the review. This is not the first time there have been allegations of unnecessary deaths at the hospital. In August 2013 an inquest was told that 86-year-old patient James Bent bled to death at the hospital. He was said to have died after a drip became detached from his hand and no one noticed for two hours. It is thought a male patient died unexpectedly on the high dependency ward in March . Mr Bent had been placed on an antibiotic drip after being admitted to hospital with numerous health complaints including diarrhoea, heart disease, pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. But two hours later he was found collapsed in bed with a pool of blood on the floor after the drip tube feeding him the antibiotics became detached from the cannula - the plastic piece of apparatus connecting the tube to the vein - causing his blood to flow out of the opening. Staff at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester immediately stopped the bleeding but Mr Bent went into cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated. Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said Mr Bent 'died as a consequence of the accidental detachment of a giving set (drip tube apparatus) used to administer intravenous antibiotics from a three way tap connected to a cannula inserted into an arm vein against a background of naturally occurring and alcohol related disease.' The Royal Bolton Hospital also came under scrutiny in 2006 after three women died in childbirth during a four month period. All three women were expected to have normal deliveries but died in similar circumstances.","Managers at the Royal Bolton Hospital are investigating the claim .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Astronomers are tonight anticipating the skies to light up with one of the world’s most incredible meteor showers. The Eta Aquarid shower will peak late tonight and before dawn on Tuesday with stunning views expected all over the world. Star gazers in the southern hemisphere will have the best seats for the show with astronomers predicting 30 to 40 meteors to streak through the skies every hour. The Eta Aquarid meteor shower is due to peak tonight, but will be visible in the night sky through to 7 May. Pictured is the Eta Aquarids Meteor shower taken over three nights over Devils Tower in Wyoming. The shower is made up of debris from Halley's Comet - one of the most famous comets in history . Comet of Origin: 1P Halley . Radiant: Constellation Aquarius . Active: 19 April - 28 May 2014 . Peak activity: 5 - 6 May 2014 . Peak activity meteor count: Around 45 meteors per hour . Meteor velocity: 44 miles (66 km) per second . Where to see it: Anywhere away from bright city lights. However, people in the southern hemisphere will have the best views. What time: In the early mornings, right before dawn. Nasa suggests trying to see the show between 3am and 5am your local time. Northerners might spy 5-10 meteors per hour over the next few mornings, with the best time to see the shower between 3am and 5am your local time. Nasa claims that some Eta Aquarid meteors may also be visible for a few days after 6 May, due to the shower's broad peak period. ‘What makes this shower somewhat special is that the meteors stem from the most famous comet in all of history, Comet Halley,’ said Slooh astronomer Bob Berman. ‘As Halley goes around the sun in its 76-year orbit, pieces of it, little chunks of ice, slough off the comet and we intersect that every year around this time, in early May.’ A view of the Eta Aquarid meteor shower as a result of Earth passing through dust released by Halley's Comet seen from Barranco de Ajuy on Fuerteventura, the Canary Islands in 2013 . Halley's Comet returns to Earth's vicinity approximately every 75 years, so some people could see it twice in their lifetime. The last time it was here was in 1986, and it is projected to return in 2061. The . comet is named after English astronomer Edmond Halley, who examined . reports of a comet approaching Earth in 1531, 1607 and 1682. Halley's most famous appearance occurred shortly before the 1066 invasion of England by William the Conquerer. It is said that William felt the comet heralded his success. The comet was put on the Bayeux Tapestry as a result. Eta Aquarid meteors are known for their speed travelling at 148,000 mph (66 km/s). Fast meteors can leave glowing ‘trains’ of incandescent debris which last for several seconds to minutes. In the Northern Hemisphere, Eta Aquarid meteors can be seen as ‘earthgrazers.’ These are long meteors that appear to skim the surface of the Earth at the horizon. To view the Eta Aquarids, Nasa suggests finding an area well away from city or street lights, prepared with a sleeping bag, blanket or chair. ‘Lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible,’ the space agency advises. ‘After about 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors. Be patient - the show will last until dawn, so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse.’ Meteors come from leftover comet particles and bits of broken asteroids. When comets come around the sun, they leave a dusty trail behind them. Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky. A Nasa fireball camera at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama caught these Eta Aquarid meteors in flight.  Eta Aquarid meteors are known for their speed and can travel at 148,000 mph (66 km/s) The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Eta Aquarid originate from comet 1P/Halley. Each time that Halley returns to the inner solar system its nucleus sheds a layer of ice and rock into space. The dust grains eventually become the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October if they collide with Earth's atmosphere. Comet Halley takes about 76 years to orbit the sun once. The last time comet Halley was seen from the Earth was in 1986. Comet Halley will not enter the inner solar system again until 2061. The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Eta Aquarids originate from comet 1P/Halley (pictured).

She says that following surgery to remove the cancer, she looks as if she has been bitten by a shark. Scroll down for video . Diagnosis: Julie Dawson (with partner Andy) was diagnosed with melanoma after years of sun worshipping . Medics saved her life by cutting out a massive chunk of her right limb in a bid to completely remove all traces of the malignant melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. She has been left with a large hole on her leg, leaving her too shy to wear swimwear, shorts or dresses. Ms Dawson, an office administrator from Consett, Co Durham, said: 'I used to love shorts and dresses, but now I never wear them. 'My vanity to be tanned almost cost me my life, and it’s certainly knocked my confidence. 'I hate my scar. Whenever anyone notices it, I tell them I’ve been bitten by a shark, but there aren’t many sharks round here.'

Cancer: She first noticed a suspicious-looking mole on her right calf in 2007, which grew to the size of two one-pound coins stacked on top of each other . She had the operation to remove the huge cancerous growth the following year, which left her with a large palm-sized gash on her leg. She added: 'When I was a kid, we’d always be out playing with no suncream on. 'And then when I got older, we’d be out sitting in the pubs. I always had my legs out, but never bothered putting suncream on. 'I suppose I’ve only got myself to blame really, especially because I used to go on sunbeds a couple of times a week, but I didn’t know. 'It was only during my treatment that Macmillan helped me realise I had been doing all the wrong things during my cancer treatment. 'They taught me I had been doing all the wrong things for years, and helped me pay for the 30-mile round trip to the hospital I had to take every day to get my dressings changed. Mrs Dawson said: 'I hate my scar. Whenever anyone notices it, I tell them I've been bitten by a shark' 'Having skin cancer made me frightened and alone, but my friends, family and the Macmillan online community helped me through. 'I want other people to realise that skin cancer is very real, and they need to take precautions otherwise at best they’ll be left scarred for life like me. 'It nearly left my boys without a mum.' Ms Dawson lives with her partner Anthony Panting, 52, and sons Liam, ten, and six-year-old Daniel. Carol Goodman, Cancer Information Nurse Specialist at Macmillan Cancer Support says: . 'See . your GP if you have any of the signs of malignant melanoma such as . moles that change shape, size or colour, have jagged borders, are . raised, bleed or are bigger than a pea, or if you notice any other . changes to your skin.' 'It’s important that you take care in the sun. Use a sunscreen of at least SPF30 and reapply it often. 'Wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses and avoid the midday sun.' She is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s campaign to ensure no-one faces cancer alone and to raise awareness of the dangers of skin cancer, after she received financial help from the charity to pay for travel costs during her treatment. Carol Goodman, Cancer Information Nurse Specialist at Macmillan Cancer Support said: 'The number of people with malignant melanoma is increasing, with around 13,000 people diagnosed in the UK each year. 'Some people still don’t understand that sunbathing and using sun beds damages the skin. 'We want people to enjoy the sunny weather but be mindful of the damage too much sun exposure can cause.

"By . Mark Prigg . Google's Glass wearable computer contains just $80 worth of electronic components, a website which took one of the $1500 gadgets apart has found. The teardown.com site took one of the prototype smart specs, which are a prototype 'explorer edition' designed to help people build apps, apart and posted these amazing images of what goes into Glass. Google is expected to reveal a cheaper, consumer version later this year. Scroll down for video . What goes into Glass: Teardown.com took apart Google's Glass hardware and revealed exactly what goes into it, from the display prism that makes an image appear in front of a wearer's eye to the tiny camera that captures images. The cost of Glass: The site was able to work out the cost of every component in Glass - which came to a total of $79.78 . Originally the Google Glass was only available to 'Explorers' better known as developers. Finally Google offered a one day sale on April 15, 2014 allowing the general public to purchase the Glass for a $1500 - when teardown.com bought theirs. They found the single most expensive part inside Glass is a Texas Instruments OMAP 4430 applications processor, which costs $13.96. There is also a $5.66 camera, a $3 display, and 16GB of NAND flash memory from Toshiba for $8.18, bringing the total to $79.78. However, the site admits this is just a rough estimate of the cost of the parts. The site said it will be doing a deeper inspection. 'Now that the Glass is part way through the full Deep Dive Teardown analysis we will have a better understanding of what each component costs,' said Thomas Gallant, a spokesman at the site. However, a Google spokesperson said the teardown estimate was wrong, according to The Wall Street Journal, and declined to comment further. The site was also able to identify many of the components used, including the GPS chip, made by Cambridge Silicon (orange), the Wifi control chip (red) and the audio chip (green) that drives the bone conduction speaker in glass, as well as the headphones that can be plugged in. Glass also has a touchscreen control, shown here, controlled with a Synaptics chip (red) The Glass Memory, supplied by Toshiba, is shown in red, and a second type of memory from SK Hynix is in Green. Glass has an applications processor chip (orange) and a power management chip as well, along with a special maths chip (yellow) Earlier this month Google allowed anyone in the US to buy them. 'The number of spots available is limited, so mark your calendar if you want to get in,' the firm said. Google will also include a free sunglass shade or one of its newly-introduced prescription glasses frames along with any purchase. Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device. What goes into Glass: Teardown.com took apart Google's Glass hardware and revealed exactly what goes into it . Glass can also clip onto specially developed prescription lenses. With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme. Reaction to the new design was mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. The 'arm' that contains the glass circuitry (left) showing the camera lens exposed. On the right is the prism that allows wearers to see an image. However, the updates were welcomed by those who have a first-generation device, with comments on its Google + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience. One owner, Dawn Martin, commented: 'My glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because I can't hear it well enough ... yay for updates/upgrades!' Another fan of the device, Jeremiah Townsend, commented: 'Can't wait ... now that we'll be able to use them with prescription glasses, they'll be glued to my face.'﻿ . Others however complained that the device was still not widely available. Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!' However, the Google Explorer program has been praised for using a clever marketing model where people buy a product at its developmental stage so they can contribute to shaping its design. 'In essence Google has crowdfunded Glass and has shown big business how crowdfunding can be done. In essence it is a giant kickstarter campaign in all but name,' according to Forbes. It estimated that Google would have earned about $50 million during the development phase as well as enhancing the desirability of the product.","Researchers reveal exactly what goes into Google's Glass for first time .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Technology that could one day power your smartphone using just body heat has been developed. Wearable computers or devices have been hailed as the next generation of mobile electronic gadgets, but finding a way to deliver sufficient, long-lasting power has been a problem. Now scientists have come up with a novel solution using a glass and fabric-based thermoelectric generator that could spell a new age of discreet smart technology. A team of researchers at KAIST University in South Korea headed by Professor Cho of electrical engineering have proposed a novel solution to creating wearable technology by developing a glass fabric-based thermoelectric generator (pictured). The device converts body and can charge mobile phones . A team of researchers at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology University) in South Korea headed by Professor Cho of electrical engineering are behind the innovation. Dutch designer Borre Akkersdijk demonstrated wearable technology at this year's SXSW festival in Texas. The BB.Suit is a 'onesie' made of copper woven within layers of cotton thread. These wires can be connected to chips including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS . Batteries and processors are hidden inside built-in pockets on the onesie. Akkersdijk is now working with tech firms to develop the product further. But there are no immediate plans to launch the garments commercially. Professor Byung Jin Cho with his team created a flexible thermoelectric (TE) generator that allows you to recharge electronic devices from your own body heat. The device is suitable for recharging heart monitors, smartglasses and other wearable technology, experts claim. A thermoelectric generator is a device that can convert heat, or a temperature difference, into electric energy. Using the small but significant temperature difference between skin and air, Professor Cho and his team have been able to produce this tiny and wearable thermoelectric generator. For electronics to be worn by a user, . they must be light, flexible, and equipped with a power source, which . could be a portable, long-lasting battery or a . generator. KAIST's generator is extremely light and flexible and produces electricity from the heat of the human body. Professor Cho confirmed that the generator could also charge smartphones. 'Right now we are trying to make a sample that provides electricity for medical sensors,' he says. 'After that, smartphones will be next application of the TE generator.' It is so flexible that it can be bent almost in a complete circle, and there are no changes . in performance even if the generator bends upward and downward for up . to 120 cycles. Wearable computers or devices have been hailed as the next generation of mobile electronic gadgets, from smart watches to smart glasses to smart pacemakers. Professor Cho's device (pictured) is suitable for recharging heart monitors, smartglasses and other wearable technology . The glass fabric-based thermoelectric generator is so flexible that it can be bent almost in a complete circle with a gap of just 20 millimetres (0.8 inches), and there are no changes in performance even if the generator bends upward and downward for up to 120 cycles . To date, two types of TE generators have been developed. These are based either on organic or inorganic materials, the former being carbon-based compounds found in biological systems and the latter molecules lacking carbon found in geological systems. The benefit of organic-based TE generators is they are highly flexible and compatible with human skin, ideal for wearable electronics, but they have a low power output. Inorganic-based TE . generators produce a high electrical energy, but they are heavy, rigid, . and bulky. Professor . Cho came up with the new concept and design technique to build a flexible . TE generator that minimises thermal energy loss but maximises power . output, combining the benefits of both organic and inorganic materials. When using the generator for a wearable wristband device, it will produce around 40 milliwatts of electric power based on the temperature difference of 0.5°C (31°F) between human skin and the surrounding air. For now it is intended to be suitable for charging small devices like mobile phones . 'This . is quite a revolutionary approach to design a generator. In so doing, . we were able to significantly reduce the weight of our generator, which is an essential element for wearable electronics,' he says.

Professor Cho further described the merits of the new generator. 'Our . technology presents an easy and simple way of fabricating an extremely . flexible, light, and high-performance TE generator. 'We expect that this . technology will find further applications in scale-up systems such as . automobiles, factories, aircrafts and vessels where we see abundant . thermal energy being wasted.'","A team of South Korean researchers have devised a fabric-based generator .

"By . Mark Prigg . Facebook says it will let users log in to apps anonymously, without sharing their identities and personal information with mobile applications they don't trust. Facebook's 1.28 billion users can already use a 'log in with Facebook' button to sign up for apps that let them listen to music, play games, read the news and monitor fitness activities. But using the button allows apps to access information related to the Facebook user's identity. Mark Zuckerberg announced the anonymous app login at Facebook's F8 conference in San Francisco . Facebook says the new feature will be adopted by websites and mobile apps within the next year. By checking or unchecking a box, users will be able to specify if they want to share their friend list, their birthday or their 'likes,' among others. They will also have the option to use an anonymous login option that will allow people to log in to apps and websites without sharing any personal data with those apps or sites. Developers of apps and websites will choose whether to use the anonymous login alongside or in place of the traditional login. With the anonymous login, Facebook will have information about users but the apps won't. Facebook says the feature will let more people to try out new apps. 'It lets you try apps without fear,' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at Facebook’s f8 developer conference in San Francisco. 'We know some people are scared of pressing this blue button for social login', Zuckerberg said. 'If you’re using an app that you don’t completely trust … then you don’t want to give it a lot of permissions.' Zuckerberg also admitted the firm's priorities were changing. 'We used to have this famous mantra, `move fast and break things,' Zuckerberg said. 'But moving quickly was sometimes so important that Facebook's engineers would tolerate a few bugs, or push out products that were not always fully baked.' Fixing the bugs, Zuckerberg said, 'was slowing us down.' Backpedaling on features that didn't work -or that users didn't like- slowed things, too, though Zuckerberg did not mention that. Facebook's new mantra may not be as sexy. Zuckerberg pointed to a new sign that read 'Move fast with stable infra,' as in infrastructure, and the audience laughed. Facebook also improved the way users choose what infomration to share with sites they use Facebook to log in to. The new feature will be adopted by websites and mobile apps within the next year. By checking or unchecking a box, users will be able to specify if they want to share their friend list, their birthday or their 'likes,' among others. Zuckerberg also revealed the firm's app has been downloaded over a billion times . Social login helps Facebook collect more personal information about its users, like shopping preferences, browsing habits and mobile app use. Facebook uses the information it gathers to sell targeted advertisements. The company is also launching more granular controls that let people determine the types of information they share with apps when they want to use their Facebook identity to log in. 'The new Facebook Login puts control squarely in people's hands by letting them choose what they share with apps,' the firm said. Experts say the move could boost interaction between users and advertisers on the site. Facebook says it's new service will let users log in to apps anonymously, without sharing their identities and personal information with mobile applications they don't trust . Facebook Login accounts for just over half of social logins, according to Gigya, which provides social login technology to web site and mobile app developers. Google’s social login product accounts for 31%. On mobile, Facebook leads by large margin, with 62% to Google’s 26%. Patrick Salyer, CEO of Gigya said: 'The changes Facebook announced today regarding Facebook Login mark a major milestone for trust and transparency between brands and consumers. 'Allowing consumers to control and understand what data they are providing brands with fosters more trust with those brands and will ultimately provide for a better user experience while making users more willing to share their data on mutually beneficial terms.' The firm also unveiled a new ad network for developers. 'Mobile ads don’t work well for advertisers, who struggle to reach the people they care about; and they don’t work well for people using apps, who end up seeing ads that aren’t relevant for them,' the firm said.. 'Over the last few years, we’ve proven that mobile ads work on Facebook. 'Today we're introducing the Audience Network, which extends the reach of Facebook campaigns into third-party mobile apps.'","Will allow more control over which apps can see personal data .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Twitter is a hive of opinion, news and GIFs but sometimes even the most interesting people can tweet during events or about certain topics that annoy their followers. In the not-so-distant future, these users will be able to mute irritating or boring tweets temporarily, rather than blocking the account completely. The feature is reportedly being trialled on mobile devices at the same time CEO Dick Costolo hinted at introducing a ‘whisper mode’ for private conversations. Reports emerged today Twitter is also trialling a mute option on its apps. Users said they spotted the feature on iOS and Android devices as well as Tweetdeck, pictured. The tool lets people silence users temporarily, but does not block them from sending notifications and direct messages . On Twitter, any user can be blocked. This means the blocked user can't see the tweets of the person who has blocked them, and can't send them replies or direct messages. With the mute button, users can be effectively hidden temporarily. This means muted people can still tweet and message the user, but their tweets are hidden from the timeline. The 'whisper mode', on the other hand, will work like direct messages for groups of people, rather than one-on-one conversations. Costolo made the comments during an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. ‘There are frequently public conversations that you would like to grab hold of and take into whisper mode. Being able to move fluidly between that public conversation and the private conversation is something we’ll make simpler.’ Private conversations are already possible using direct messages (DMs), but these only apply to one-on-one discussions. Whisper mode would effectively be a group version of DMs. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, pictured, made the comments during an interview with Bloomberg. He said the site was looking at introducing a 'whisper mode' that would let groups of Twitter users to talk in private - similar to direct messages but for more people . Meanwhile, the mute button started appearing across iOS and Android devices on the official Twitter app, as well as Tweetdeck, earlier today. Users have been tweeting screenshots of the tool, that lets users silence specific tweeters in a timeline. It only appears to have been rolled out to a select few. The main difference between the mute tool and the block function is that notifications and direct messages from muted users will still appear. Twitter constantly experiments and rolls out features that don't always end up becoming permanent features. When asked about Twitter testing, Costolo said: 'In our latest iOS or Android apps, there are well over 100 experiments running in each of those apps.'","Twitter CEO Dick Costolo made the comments during a television interview .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The length of a day on a planet outside our solar system has been measured by scientists for the first time. The planet, 63 light years from Earth, takes only eight hours to complete a full day. It orbits the young star Beta Pictoris in the faint southern hemisphere constellation of Pictor - deriving from the Latin phrase for the 'painter's easel'. Scroll down for video... This artist's view shows the planet orbiting the young star Beta Pictoris. This exoplanet is the first to have its rotation rate measured. Its eight-hour day corresponds to an equatorial rotation speed of 62,100 mph (100,000 km/h) - much faster than any planet in the solar system . Only . 12 million years old, or less than three-thousandths of the age of the . sun, Beta Pictoris is 75 per cent more massive than our parent star. It . is located about 60 light-years away towards the constellation of . Pictor (the Painter) and is one of the best-known examples of a star . surrounded by a dusty debris disc. It circles its host star at only eight . times the distance of the Earth and the sun distance - making it the . closest exoplanet to its star ever to be directly imaged. Earlier . observations showed a warp of the disc, a secondary inclined disc and . comets falling onto the star, all indirect, but tell-tale signs that . strongly suggested the presence of a massive planet. This means it has a spinning speed of 62,100 mph (100,000 km/h) - much quicker than any planet in the solar system. By comparison Jupiter's equator has a velocity of about 29,200 mph (47,000 km/h) while the Earth's travels at only 1,050 mph (1,700 km/h). Despite its short day Beta Pictoris b is more than 16 times larger and has a mass 3,000 times greater than the Earth. The gas-giant discovered in 2008 is more than one-and-a-half times the size of Jupiter and still very young and warm - only 20 million years old compared to 4.5 billion years for Earth. It circles its host star at only eight times the distance of the Earth and the sun distance - making it the closest exoplanet to its star ever to be directly imaged. Beta Pictoris b is a giant planet - several times larger than Jupiter - and is approximately ten million years old. This near-infrared image show the planet glowing in infrared light from the heat released in its formation. The bright star Beta Pictoris is hidden behind a mask in the centre of the image . Dr Remco de Kok, of the Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Utrecht, said: 'It's not known why some planets spin fast and others more slowly but this first measurement of an exoplanet's rotation shows the trend seen in the solar system where the more massive planets spin faster also holds true for exoplanets. 'This must be some universal consequence of the way planets form.' Over time Beta Pictoris b is expected to cool and shrink which should make it spin even faster. On the other hand other processes could change the spin of the planet. For instance the spin of the Earth is slowing down due to tidal interactions with our Moon. Using the Very Large telescope in the Chilean Andes the Dutch astronomers relied on a precise technique called high-dispersion spectroscopy to split light into its constituent colours - different wavelengths in the spectrum. The principle of the Doppler shift - a change in frequency in wavelengths - allowed them to detect different parts of the planet were moving at different speeds and in opposite directions relative to the observer. Using the Very Large telescope in the Chilean Andes the Dutch astronomers relied on a precise technique called high-dispersion spectroscopy to split light into its constituent colours - different wavelengths in the spectrum. Using this data they were able to extract the rotation signal from the planet . By very carefully removing the effects of the much brighter parent star they were able to extract the rotation signal from the planet. Professor Ignas Snellen, of Leiden University, said: 'We have measured the wavelengths of radiation emitted by the planet to a precision of one part in a hundred thousand which makes the measurements sensitive to the Doppler effects that can reveal the velocity of emitting objects. 'Using this technique we find different parts of the planet's surface are moving towards or away from us at different speeds which can only mean that the planet is rotating around its axis.' This technique is closely related to Doppler imaging which has been used for several decades to map the surfaces of stars - and recently that of the brown dwarf Luhman 16B less than seven light years away where it rains molten iron. The fast spin of Beta Pictoris b means in future it will be possible to make a global map of the planet - showing possible cloud patterns and large storms. The researchers whose study is published in Nature hope to use the technique on a much larger sample of exoplanets and characterise much smaller ones than Beta Pictoris b.","Planet is 16 times larger than Earth and has a mass 3,000 times greater .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The charred remains of least 50 mummified Egyptians have been found in a plundered tomb in Cairo. It is thought most of the bodies were members of the ancient Egyptian elite, and inscriptions suggest the tomb contains a prince and princess, related to two pharaohs who ruled during the 14th century BC. But excavation wasn’t easy because the tomb is covered in soot - from a fire started by grave robbers in the late 19th century. A tomb containing up to 50 mummified remains has been found in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings. Pictured can be seen fragments of coffins, cloth and pottery within tomb KV 40. The tomb was used twice, once in the 18th dynasty (14th century BC) and again in the 22nd dynasty (9th century BC) The find was made during excavations by Egyptologists from the University of Basel Kings' Valley Project close to the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings, about 310 miles (500 kilometres) south of Cairo.

Experts identified the burial place of several children as well as other family members of two pharaohs. The team have been working on tomb KV 40 - where the find was made - close to the city of Luxor for three years. From the outside, only a depression in the ground indicated the presence of a subterranean tomb. Up to now, nothing was known about the layout of tomb KV 40, nor for whom it was built and who was buried there. The Egyptologists assumed it was a non-royal tomb dating back to the 18th dynasty (1543–1292 BC). They first cleared the 20ft (six metre) deep shaft which gives access to five subterranean chambers before recovering the countless remains and fragments of funerary equipment. The scientists discovered mummified remains of at least 50 people in the centre chamber and in three side chambers. Based on inscriptions on storage jars, Egyptologists were able to identify and name over 30 people. Titles such as 'Prince' and 'Princess' distinguish the buried as members of the families of the two pharaohs Thutmosis IV and Amenhotep III who are also buried in the Valley of Kings. Both pharaohs belonged to the 18th dynasty and ruled in the 14th century BC. The analysis of the hieratic . inscriptions, related to hieroglyphics, revealed that tomb KV 40 . contains the mummified remains of at least eight hitherto unknown royal . daughters, four princes and several foreign ladies. While most of them were adults, mummified children were also found. 'We discovered a remarkable number of . carefully mummified newborns and infants that would have normally been . buried much simpler,' explains Egyptologist Professor Susanne Bickel. 'We believe that the family members of the royal court were buried in this tomb for a period of several decades.' The . identification of people buried in the proximity of the royal tombs . gave the team of researchers important insight into who had the . privilege to spend eternal life close to the pharaoh. 'Roughly two thirds of the tombs in the Kings' Valley are non-royal,' continued Bickel. 'Because . the tombs do not have inscriptions and have been heavily plundered we . so far have only been able to speculate on who lies buried in them.' The tomb was found in the Valley of the Kings, a valley in egypt where pharoahs and nobles from the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties (known as the 'New Kingdom') in Ancient Egypt were buried from the 16th to 11th century BC. Amongst other tombs, the valley is famous for containing that of Tutankhamun . Tomb KV 40 containing the newly discovered remains was found about 20ft (six metres) underground with a corridor, a central room and three side rooms. Most of the walls and ceilings are black from heavy fire, believed to have been caused by regular plunderers in ancient times but also as recently as the 19th century . This is a panorama view over the area in the Valley of Kings investigated by the University of Basel Kings' Valley Project. Tomb KV 40 is located directly next to tomb KV 64 and was first discovered by the Basel Egyptologists in 2012, but it has only recently been excavated and studied . Even though the tomb was looted in ancient times as well as at the end of the 19th century, the researchers found countless fragments of burial equipment, such as fragments of coffins and textiles. 'The remains and the walls have been heavily affected by a fire that was most likely ignited by the torches of the tomb raiders,' suspects Bickel. The fragments of various wooden and cartonnage, layers of linen or papyrus covered with plaster, coffins indicate that tomb KV 40 was used a second time as a burial ground by members of priestly families in the 9th century BC. Anthropological analysis, as well as further examination on the burial goods, will deliver important insight into the composition of the pharaonic court of the 18th dynasty as well as the conditions of life and the burial customs of its members.","A tomb containing the remains of up to 50 royal Egyptians has been found .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It was hoped that a new road unveiled in the Netherlands that could change the way we drive in the future. Glow-in-the-dark paint was deployed on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) section of the N329 road near Oss, Netherlands but the ‘smart highway’ has experienced teething problems. The markings have ‘faded out’ and have been found to be highly sensitive to large amounts of moisture – which could prove a frequent problem in rainy northern Europe. Scroll down for video . Blurred lines: Dutch company Studio Roosegaarde unveiled its glow-in-the-dark technology two weeks ago (pictured) that could be used to light up roads in the future and create interactive 'Smart Highways,'  - but have admitted that the lines fade in the rain . The proof of concept for Studio . Roosegaarde’s innovative ‘Smart Highway’ design project is intended to . be an alternative to street lights in remote areas and lead to . interactive and sustainable roads. The technology was first unveiled in 2012 when it scooped ‘Best Future Concept’ at the Dutch Design Awards and has been dubbed a green solution to lighting our roads. Using ‘photo-lumising’ powder, the paint absorbs sunlight in the day and releases it at night for up to 10 hours, providing drivers with clear markings on where to go – or that is the plan. Engineers are working on honing the idea after reports from drivers that markings are not as clear as they should be. The stretch of road near Oss is not glowing as brightly as was hoped as it has been found that moisture affects the glow-in-the-dark paint, pictured here glowing at optimum levels . Civil engineering firm Heijmans, which is in charge of the project, told BBC News that the markings are sensitive to rainfall and consequently are not giving out a consistent amount of light. ‘As expected the “real life” trial enables us to learn from the environment and users,’ the firm said in a statement. ‘We will use these insights to introduce an update to the Glowing Lines 2.0 version. In the meantime we have temporarily faded out the lining to prevent any confusing situations for road users. ‘As planned we are working on developing Glowing Lines version 2.0, which will be ready for this summer. It will then be introduced on a larger scale in the Netherlands and abroad.’ The technology is currently being tested on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) stretch of the N329 near Oss . The UK Highways Agency said it is watching the trial but that previous studies have shown that using glow-in-the-dark paint is unsuitable for the UK. Roosegaarde Studio refuses to let the water issue dampen its hopes that ultimately the paint could be used to make interactive roads. For example, weather symbols could be painted on the road that appear when the temperature reaches a certain level. Despite teething problems, it is hoped that the powder technology within the paint could be used to make road markings that change according to the temperature, giving drivers live weather reports that could warn them of icy roads . Studio Roosegaarde's plans for interactive roads also include lanes where electric cars could be charged . There are also plans for other functionality including priority lanes that indicate when and where cars should change lanes. ‘Innovative designs such as the Glow-in-the-Dark Road, Dynamic Paint, Interactive Light, Induction Priority Lane and Wind Light will be realised within…five years,’ the companies recently said. ‘The goal is to make roads that are more sustainable and interactive by using interactive lights, smart energy and road signs that adapt to specific traffic situations.’ Dynamic lines could be used to tell you when you can overtake and when you should stay in lane .","Studio Roosegaarde’s technology uses 'photo-luminising' powder and is being tested on a road near Oss in the Netherlands .

Scroll down for video . Almost free: Seven bison raised in captivity in Britain are about to run free in a forest in Romania in a coordinated reintroduction project for a species that was said to be extinct in the wild around 100 years ago. The herd are pictured in their new home . The European bison, Eurasian beaver and White-tailed eagle are among the animals that have made a remarkable comeback in Europe over the past 50 years, zoologists said. A total of 27 mammal and bird species recovered over the past 50 years thanks to legislative measures and conservation efforts, according to a report released in September 2013. Scientists from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), BirdLife International and the European Bird Census Council (EBCC) worked with experts from across Europe to gather relevant data about the distribution and abundance of selected species. The European bison, which is the largest herbivore in Europe, became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss. However, a large-scale breeding and reintroduction programme based on individuals remaining in captivity has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern Europe. One of the creatures set to wander the forest is a female European bison born and raised at Highland Wildlife Park in Kingussie, Scotland, according to the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS). She is called Glen Rosa and is named after the picturesque Highland glen on the Isle of Arran. She joins six other female bison from three other British and Irish herds at the Aspinall Foundation's Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent. ‘Glen Rosa and the other bison will join an already established herd in Vanatori Neamt Nature Park, Romania, to help augment both numbers and genetic diversity within the group,' said Douglas Richardson, head of living collections for Highland Wildlife Park. ‘As the breeding programme coordinator for European bison, my main tasks are to ensure that the captive programme remains robust and that animals are made available for projects like this and as such I worked with the Aspinall Foundation to select animals from breeders of European bison within the UK and Ireland to support this reintroduction project.’ Saved from extinction: In 1927 the European bison (pictured) became extinct in the wild but a number were kept in zoos. A coordinated approach to their management was started in 1932, with the first captive-bred bison reintroduced back into the wild in 1952 . Glen Rosa was born at the park on 21 July 2012 to a male called Tomek and a female named Glen Esk. She, along with the other females born between 2010 and 2012 were selected to be part of this reintroduction due to their genetic background and to increase the number of females within Vanatori Neamt Nature Park. Damian Aspinall of The Aspinall Foundation which led the translocation of the bison, said: 'Many people forget that extinction of species is not simply a problem in Africa and Asia. It is happening here on our doorsteps in Europe too. 'That’s why Foundation was delighted to be able to asked to use our expertise in relocating animals to lead the translocation of these bison to Romania.' Glen Rose underwent a series of medical checks earlier in the year to ensure she was healthy before being sent to her new home. In 1927 the European bison became extinct in the wild but a number were kept in zoos. A coordinated approach to their management was started in 1932, with the first captive-bred bison reintroduced back into the wild in 1952. Reintroductions continue and in 2012, the total wild population had risen to over 3,000. The Highland Wildlife Park is currently home to 17 European bison, including 15 females and two males and all of the creatures that have been born on site are named after Scottish glens.","A total of seven bison raised in captivity in .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Buried deep within volcanic rock of Western Australia, researchers have stumbled across a mineral that is unlike any other crystal on Earth. The purple mineral is ‘completely unique in its structure and composition' and contains an unusual combination of elements, including: strontium, calcium, chromium, sulphur, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. It has been named putnisite and its tiny . crystals are are no more than half a millimetre in diameter. Deep purple: The mineral has been named putnisite and the tiny crystals are no more than half a millimetre in diameter, found on volcanic rock (pictured) This sample measures 0.4mm and was recovered from Armstrong Mine in Widgiemooltha, Western Austalia . Putnisite is a newly discovered mineral with tiny crystals less than 0.5mm in diameter. It was found on volcanic rock near Lake Cowan in Western Australia. The crystals appear as tiny pink spots on dark green and white rock, which under a microscope look like tiny glistening cubes. The purple mineral is very brittle and is unique among the world's 4,000 known minerals. Putnisite does not belong to a family and is not related to anything. The mineral is made up of a ‘very unusual’ combination of elements, including: strontium, calcium, chromium, sulphur, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. It is not yet known to have a practical use but has been named after important Australian mineralogists Andrew and Christine Putnis. Dr Peter Elliott, a mineralogy researcher at the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Museum, has described the mineral that was discovered south of Lake Cowan near the town of Norseman in Western Australia. The purple mineral is associated with quartz and is very brittle. It is unique among the world’s 4,000 known mineral species, according to the study published in Mineralogical Magazine. ‘What defines a mineral is its chemistry and crystallography,’ Dr Elliott said. ‘By X-raying a single crystal of mineral you are able to determine its crystal structure and this, in conjunction with chemical analysis, tells you everything you need to know about the mineral. Found: Dr Peter Elliott, a mineralogy researcher at the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Museum, described the mineral that was discovered south of Lake Cowan (pictured) near the town of Norseman in Western Australia . ‘Most minerals belong to a family or small group of related minerals, or if they aren't related to other minerals they often are to a synthetic compound - but putnisite is completely unique and unrelated to anything. ‘Nature seems to be far cleverer at dreaming up new chemicals than any researcher in a laboratory.’ The new mineral occurs as tiny crystals, no more than 0.5 mm in diameter and is found on a volcanic rock. It appears as dark pink spots on dark green and white rock which, under the microscope, look like square, cube-like crystals. The mineral is made up of a ‘very unusual’ combination of elements, including: strontium, calcium, chromium, sulphur, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Not quite part of the family: The newly-discovered purple mineral is associated with quartz (pictured) and is very brittle. Experts said that while most minerals belong to a family, . putnisite is completely unique and unrelated to anything . It has yet to be determined if the new mineral will have any practical use, but putnisite has been named for important Australian mineralogists Andrew and Christine Putnis. The mineral was first discovered during prospecting by a mining company in the area and was passed on to CSIRO for initial before being handed to Dr Elliott for more detailed analysis. Dr Elliott has researched 12 new Australian minerals in the past seven years and found seven of those himself. Two of these ‘new’ minerals - domerockite and hylbrownite - were discovered in South Australia and were named after Dome Rock, where the mineral was first was found and Henry Yorke Lyle Brown, who was Government Geologist of South Australia from 1882 to 1912.","Putnisite crystals measure no more than half a millimetre in diameter .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . They might look a little like the Elton John of the insect world, but these spectacle wearing praying mantises are part of an experiment into 3D vision. British scientists have made the world’s smallest pair of 3D glasses for the carnivorous insects to wear. They measure just five millimetres wide, are made from the same material as the pairs worn at the cinema and are attached with beeswax to the insects, which appear to be quite happy with their new accessory. Scroll down for video . Specs appeal: British scientists have made the world's smallest pair of 3D glasses (pictured) for praying mantises to wear . There are over 2,400 species of mantises in 15 families, which live in temperate and tropical habitats around the world. Their closest relatives are termites and cockroaches. Mantises may have a visual range of up to 20 metres. Their compound eyes may comprise up to 10,000 ommatidia - clusters of photoreceptor cells. The eyes are widely spaced, affording a wide binocular field of vision and at close range, precise stereoscopic vision. The dark spot on each eye is a pseudopupil. As their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily active during the day. Mantises have two grasping, spiked forelegs or raptorial legs in which prey items are caught and held securely. Most mantises are exclusively predatory. They eat small insects or their siblings when young and when they grow larger, have been known to prey on small scorpions, lizards, frogs, birds, snakes, fish, and even rodents. Scientists from Newcastle University created the miniature glasses to investigate the 3D vision of the praying mantis, which is the only insect known to see in three dimensions, instead of 2D. In an experiment, the creatures will watch a film - similar to 3D films seen at the cinema - only they will be shown a movie of computer-generated flies within their strike distance on 3D-enabled computer monitors. If the insect accurately pounces it will prove that despite its simple nervous system, it can process the images in the same way as humans, the scientists said. The experiment will determine if mantids can see the moving object . standing out in depth in a similar way to humans and monkeys. It is hoped the £1million research . programme could give insight into 3D vision which could provide cheaper . and less technical versions of the technology. Here's looking at you: Scientists from Newcastle University created the tiny glasses to investigate the 3D vision of the praying mantis, which is the only insect known to see in three dimensions, instead of 2D . Dr Vivek Nityananda, who is involved in the experiment at Newcastle University said: ‘This is a really exciting project to be working on. So much is still waiting to be discovered in this system. ‘If we find that the way mantises process 3D vision is very different to the way humans do it, then that could open up all kinds of possibilities to create much simpler algorithms for programming 3D vision into robots. ‘We can do this by fooling them into misjudging depth, in the same way that our brains are fooled when we watch a 3D movie.’ Making a spectacle of themselves: The praying mantises are wearing the glasses (pictured left and right) so that scientists can understand how relatively simple insects can see in 3D . Analysing how mantises see in three dimensions could give clues about how 3D vision evolved. It is possible that 3D vision in mantises is closer to that of vertebrates, where disparities between the positions of an object’s image in the two eyes can be detected and used to reveal the object’s position, even when the object is camouflaged and is invisible in either eye individually. If this is the case, it would mean that mantises have independently evolved similar 3D processing to vertebrates. Dr Jenny Read from the Institute of Neuroscience, who is leading the project, said: ‘Despite their minute brains, mantises are sophisticated visual hunters which can capture prey with terrifying efficiency. Basic Instinct: In an experiment, the creatures will watch a film, similar to 3D films seen at the cinema, only the insects will be shown a movie of flies within their strike distance . ‘We can learn a lot by studying how they perceive the world.’ It is the first major research project investigating mantises since 1983 when Samuel Rossel discovered they have 3D vision. Dr Rossel placed prisms over their eyes and creating an optical illusion that an object was within their range, triggering a strike from the mantises. Good Will Hunting: If the insect (pictured) accurately pounces when watching the 3D film with its glasses on, it will prove that despite its simple nervous system, it can process the images in the same way as humans, the scientists said .

"By . Associated Press . Firefighters worked through the night and into early Monday to battle a large wildfire that destroyed at least 20 homes and left one person dead after a controlled burn spread out of control in central Oklahoma. The wildfire broke out Sunday afternoon near Guthrie and by 9 p.m. had burned an estimated 4 to 6 square miles of land as well as several homes, Guthrie Fire Department Chief Eric Harlow said. Aerial television footage shows the fire still burning at daybreak Monday and Harlow said the fire was about 75 per cent contained. More than 1,000 people were evacuated from homes in the city about 35 miles north of Oklahoma City Sunday, according to the fire department. Scroll down for video . A firefighter walks past a burning mobile home at a mobile home park near Prairie Grove Rd and Douglas during Oklahoma wildfires in south Logan County . The man who died was a 56-year-old who did not leave his home . Harlow said a 56-year-old man who did not leave was found dead in his home Sunday night. CNN reported that at least 20 homes were thought to have been lost so far, with ily cedar trees making the fire very difficult to contain. 'It's growing so fast it's pretty hard to estimate,' Logan County's Deputy Sheriff Richard Stephens told CNN. 'There are a lot of cedar trees, they have a lot of oil in them and they just explode.' Fire department crews were assessing the fire and damage by helicopter at daybreak Monday. Tabitha Diamond, who lives a few miles from Guthrie, told KOCO-TV that she was returning from a music festival in Noble when she saw the flames and sped home. The fire missed her place but destroyed a nearby trailer home. 'It didn't get close enough, but it got too close,' she said. At least six homes have been destroyed after a controlled burn spiralled out of control . The American Red Cross set up a shelter at a church in Guthrie for those affected by the fire. High winds and dry conditions fueled several wildfires in Oklahoma on Sunday, and those conditions were expected to persist Monday. The National Weather Service predicted a high temperature of 100 degrees in Guthrie on Monday, with winds gusting up to 31 mph.","One person dead, at least 20 homes destroyed in Oklahoma wildfire .

"By . Mark Prigg . A row over hi-tech experts under new Ukraine-related sanctions has sparked a major row over the International Space Station. Extensive cooperation in space between Washington and Moscow came under renewed pressure after the United States banned high-tech exports to Russia. Russia pledged tit-for-tat measures in revenge for U.S. sanctions it said would hit its space industry, a symbol of national pride and a sphere of fierce competition with the United States dating back to the Cold War. Scroll down for video . Russia has threatened to withdraw its service to take US astronauts for the International Space Station, for which U.S. space agency NASA pays more than $60 million per person. Two US astronauts are currently aboard the station - Steve Swanson, flight engineer and astronaut Rick Mastracchio. Rick Mastracchio has already begun to pack cargo and personal supplies for his return to Earth. The home-bound crew will enter their Soyuz TMA-11M spacecraft for a 3.5 hour trip home next month. Swanson is set to return at a later date. A deputy prime minister suggested that U.S. astronauts, who depend on Russian rockets to get to the International Space Station (ISS), use trampolines to reach it instead. However, analysts said Moscow was unlikely to curb its shuttle service to the ISS, for which U.S. space agency NASA pays more than $60 million per person, as it provided essential financing for the cash-strapped industry. The White House said on Monday the United States would deny export licences for any high-technology items that could aid Russian military capabilities and revoke existing licences. 'The seriousness of these measures is absolutely obvious for us,' Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told gazeta.ru in an online interview, highlighting high-tech cooperation between the two countries, including launching satellites, either American-made or containing U.S. components. 'All this hits at our high-tech enterprises and industries.' Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, responsible for Russia's defence industry and known for anti-Western rhetoric, suggested space may be the next frontier in the standoff over Ukraine, which has taken relations between Washington and Moscow to their worst since the Cold War. Rick Mastracchio's space selfie, taken while on a recent spacewalk to fix a computer. There are now fears his return trip could be cancelled over a sanctions row . 'The United States introduced sanctions against our space industry... We warned them, we will reply to statements with statements, to actions with actions,' he wrote on Twitter. 'I propose that the United States delivers its astronauts to the ISS with the help of a trampoline,' he added. The United States and the Soviet Union were locked in the so-called ""space race"" for decades. Russia's Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space in 1961 and Neil Armstrong of the United States was the first man on the Moon in 1969. With the Cold War over, competition gave way to cooperation. While NASA was banned earlier this month from contacting the Russian government due to sanctions, operation of the space station, a $100 billion research project owned by 15 countries, remains exempt. Rick Mastracchio (pictured) also got fellow spacewalker Steven Swanson to take this picture of him in front of the station's Japanese module . But Sergei Oznobishchev, director at the Institute for Strategic Assessments think-tank in Moscow, said many other joint space projects would suffer immediately. 'This is a very sensitive issue since our defence industry was completely unprepared for such developments,' he said. 'Both sides will suffer but Russia will lose out more in terms of technology transfer.' 'For us, this cooperation was largely a technology school.' Analysts said Russia still lagged in production of high-tech electronic components - including microchips for satellites - and that meant its space and arms sectors were overwhelmingly reliant on imports from the West.

Depending on the scale and scope of the sanctions, at stake could be up to five commercial satellite launches contracted by foreign clients by the end of this year at the Khrunichev Center, a state-run Russian spacecraft maker. 'We are ready to carry out all the commercial launches we have planned for this year and we hope that will be the case. 'We have all the necessary permits to that end,' said Alexander Bobrenyov, the Khrunichev Center's spokesman. But in a sign of market concern over the sanctions, shares in British satellite operator Inmarsat fell on Tuesday despite the company saying the schedule of satellite launches for its new faster broadband network was not affected.","Russia pledged tit-for-tat measures in revenge for U.S. sanctions .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Oscar-nominated French actress Catherine Deneuve has put her sprawling 18th century chateau on the market for £3.2million. Chateau de Primard, set in a leafy pocket west of Paris, boasts a home cinema cinema, 750-square-foot sauna suite, and a staggering 530-square-foot kitchen. The garden, complete with an outdoor pool, was famously designed by landscape gardener Jacques Wirtz, who sculpted the hedges of the Elysee Palace in the capital. For sale: Chateau de Primard, in Guainville, 46 miles west of Paris, boasts a home cinema, 530-square-foot kitchen and two 700-square-foot bedrooms . Ms Deneuve, who was married to celebrated British photographer David Bailey between 1965 and 1972, is widely regarded as one of French cinema's greatest exports. The 70-year-old cinema star made her name playing aloof characters for directors including Roman Polanski and Luis Bunuel - earning her BAFTA and Oscar nominations. For decades, she has split her time between the 1,300-square-foot estate and an inner-city flat for decades - but now hopes to retreat to the countryside to 'relax'. With eight master bedrooms, numerous outbuildings, and an outdoor pool, demand for the four-floor property in Guainville, 46 miles from central Paris, has rocketed since it was put up for sale this month by Sotheby's. The ground floor features a dining room, a 'lounge boudoir', a living room, and the 530-square-foot kitchen. The 18th century mansion is one of just around 300 homes in the leafy pocket of northern France hugging the Eure river. It was converted into a farm in the 1960s but has since been restored . Retreat: Catherine Deneuve, 70, has spent decades splitting her time between Guainville and Paris. Recently, the cinema doyenne, who starred in Roman Polanski's Repulsion (right) revealed she wants to retreat to the countryside . On the first floor, the future owner will inherit a 700-square-foot master bedroom, a further two smaller bedrooms, a bathroom, guest suite, and a child's room. Alongside another 700-square-foot master bedroom, the second floor has a 750-square-foot sauna suite, two more children's rooms, another guest suite, and a lounge. The top floor is made up simply of a lounge and a home cinema. The estate, was remodelled into a farm during the 1960s, but has since been restored to its 18th century style. Ms Deneuve, who was married to British photographer David Bailey, is lauded as French cinema's greatest export, but has lived a quiet and solitary life on the estate, locals say . Locals said Ms Deneuve led a quiet life on her own in the village, home to just 300 properties. She was regularly seen out in the Eure-et-Loir region shopping for plants and mingling with residents. According to the mayor of Guainville, Jocelyne Poussard, Ms Deneuve also paid regular visits to her 18th century mansion nearby. Last month, Ms Deneuve told local media she wants to be in the countryside to relax. Ms Deneuve recently waded in on the scandal of President Hollande's alleged affair, defending him from a tirade of abuse. It came after fellow actress Sophie Marceau branded the leader 'a jerk' and 'a coward' - words Ms Deneuve slammed as 'rude' and 'astonishing'.","Chateau de Primard, in Guainville, west of Paris, boasts home cinema, 750-sq-ft sauna suite, 700-sq-foot bedrooms .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Legendary Fifties siren Shirely MacLaine has listed her sprawling, 7,450-acre New Mexico ranch for sale at $18m. Her reasoning for the price? Because one plus eight equals nine. And the number nine is significant according to her 'numerology' beliefs, which are based on the 'vibration and meaning' of figures. 'Nine is the number of completion,' says the 79-year-old Oscar-winning actress, who is famed for her kooky new-age spiritual beliefs. 'To me, it's not about money, it's about completion.' Unorthodox pricing: Actress Shirely MacLaine has listed her 7,450-acre ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico, for $18m, based on the principle that one plus eight equals nine, and nine is the 'number of completion' According to the Wall Street Journal, Ms MacLaine originally consulted a number of psychics, who advised her to list the property for a cool $30 million, but the headstrong screen legend ultimately settled on her own logic. 'If it works for Shirley, it works for us,' says her realtor, Susan Kline of Sotheby’s International Realty’s Santa Fe office. The beautiful landscape holds a roughly 9,000 square-foot main house and comes with a caretaker's cottage, a horse barn, a yurt, a swimming pool and two ponds. Ms McLaine . says the moment she set foot on the property, some 20 years ago, she . was struck by its energy. Indeed, on a 2011 Oprah show appearance, she spoke freely of the 'numerous' UFO encounters she and a neighbor had witnessed for 'extended periods of time.' Fully equipped: The property boasts a 9,000-square-foot home with a horse barn, swimming pool, two ponds and a stone labyrinth atop a hill which Ms MacLaine says helps her listen to her 'inner guidance' As you'd expect from a woman who takes an active interest in transcendental meditation, metaphysics, reincarnation and extra-terrestrial activity; the elaborate home comes with some rather otherworldly features. The Plaza Blanca Ranch, as it's known, 'insists on peace,' says Ms MacLaine, and boasts a stone labyrinth, built atop a hill, which she claims helps her listen to her 'inner guidance.' 'When I . was writing or when I had decisions to make or had something bothering . me, or when I wanted to thank the universe for something, I would go up . and walk the labyrinth,' she affirms. After purchasing the property, Ms MacLaine split the main house into two, and says that whenever she hosted 'reincarnation seminars', participants were regulated to only one side. Kooky beliefs: The Oscar-winning legend, pictured in Los Angeles in January, told Oprah in a 2011 interview that she had regularly witnessed UFO's at her ranch, where she has lived for 20 years . She also built an apartment underneath the house, modeled after the Native American concept of Kiva, which functions as an underground room for spiritual ceremonies. Film buffs will be interested to know that her dining room holds the large table which appeared in the film Terms of Endearment, for which she won an Oscar for Best Actress in 1984. 'It was such a difficult shoot - I said, ""I'm taking it!""' she allegedly told the production crew. As for Ms MacLaine's unorthodox pricing methods, MailOnline spoke to Brendon DeSimone, a national real estate expert, CEO of DeSimone & Co, and author of upcoming book Next Generation Real Estate. The glory days: Ms MacLaine, pictured in 1955, is leaving her secluded ranch and moving closer to Santa Fe, to avoid becoming a 'recluse' Ms DeSimone explains that while he can't comment on 'how far off' the listing price might be, his is an industry where anything goes. 'People can price at whatever they want,' he says, adding that celebrity-owned properties with stories behind them have a tendency to 'push people over the edge' in terms of closing a sale. It's a statement echoed by New York-state based broker Harris Safier, who once sold a house that reputedly belonged to Isabella Rosellini. Despite his market value estimation, the buyer chose to pay five per cent over Mr Safier's highest suggested price range. 'They did it for the cache they perceived,' he tells us. At the end of the day, despite Ms MacLaine's deep spiritual ties to the place she has called home for 20 years, she says she is moving closer to New Mexico's capital, Santa Fe, for somewhat materialistic reasons. 'I want to go to the movies, good restaurants,' she says. 'I really need to be closer, or I would tend to become a complete recluse out there.'","The Oscar-winning actress was advised by psychics to list the 7,450 acre property for $30m, but ultimately followed her 'numerology' principles instead .

"By . Rebecca English Royal Correspondent . Tenderly gazing over her infant son’s beribboned crib, it is study in royal portraiture. Taken by legendary English photographer, Sir Cecil Beaton, this is the first official portrait of future king Prince Charles, shot at Buckingham Palace in December 1948, when he was just a month old. Fast forward more than thirty years, and a rather startled-looking Prince William is introduced to the world by the Queen’s brother-in-law Lord Snowdon, another celebrated society photographer. Traditional: Cecil Beaton's 1948 photo of the of Queen gazing down at Charles is a study in royal portraiture . Formal: Prince William looks rather startled in his 1982 official portrait taken by Lord Snowdon . Although more relaxed than those featuring the Queen, they are still formal, studio portraits of a future king and his queen, proudly showing off the next generation of the family line. Given the illustrious history of recent royal family portraits, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s decision to use one of proud grandpa Mike Middleton’s happy family snaps in the family backgarden – complete with pets - is a definite break with tradition. And, inevitably, there will be those that feel that shots do not carry the gravitas normally expected of a formal family portrait. According to well-placed royal sources, however, the decision was very much William and Kate’s. ‘It’s just where they feel happy and most comfortable,’ said an aide. ‘They are a young couple who have just had their first baby. There has been huge demand from the public to see some official photographs of Prince George. It seemed perfectly natural to them to pose for a few nice family snapshots which they could then issue.’ Relaxed: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose to release an intimate family portrait of Prince George . Seen it before? Mr Middleton's pictures of the Royals on the grass in his Berkshire garden echo those of the young Prince William taken in the grounds of Government House in Auckland, New Zealand . It is also understood that neither . William or Kate, who were most recently photographed by celebrated . fashion photographer Mario Testino for their official engagement . portrait, were keen not to ‘burst the happily little family bubble’ they . have existed in at the Middleton family home since George’s birth. ‘Inviting in a well-known society portraitist or a professional photographer is a very formal experience and one they weren’t keen to go through at this early stage,’ said a source. ‘The fact is that the formal portraits will all come when Prince George is christened in a few months’ time. ‘And as no-one knows when his first official engagement, so to speak, will be, it was sensible to release a few pictures to say thank you for all the  public support they have received.’ The Mail also understands that the couple were keen to take the wind out of the sails of the huge - and extremely lucrative - international market for unofficial paparazzi pictures of George by releasing their own at the earliest opportunity. Family affair: Sources said they did not want a professional to 'burst the happy little family bubble' ‘But the most important thing was that . they genuinely felt much more comfortable having these shots taken by a . member of their family,’ the source said. Not always formal: This 1983 shot shows a more relaxed Prince Charles and Princess Diana with their young son William . A senior royal aide also made clear . that the couple had been keen to issue a set of pictures as a mark of . thanks for the privacy they had been given immediately after the birth . of their son. ‘They asked . the media to give them some time as a family – that was hugely important . to them - and British media have done that,’ they added. Renowned celebrity photographer Brian Aris, who has photographed almost every member of the royal family, ranging from the Queen and Princess Margaret to Princess Anne and more recently the then Kate Middleton, described the decision as ‘rather refreshing’. He told the Mail: ‘It’s an unusual decision but perhaps reflects the young approach that Prince William wants to bring to bear. ‘Of course the pictures are historic . and the decision to take them in such an informal manner means they, . perhaps, lack the level of gravitas that would normally be expected. ‘But on the whole I would say this is quite refreshing.’ He . added: ‘Taking a professional portrait of a young baby is quite an . intrusive procedure, given the lighting and strobes you would need. 'I . have to say I would never normally take a photograph of a baby under six . weeks old, and this little one is just three. ‘So perhaps they have had the right idea after all.

"By . Joel Christie . Michael M. and John Kirby - both now in their 40s - claim that in the mid-1980s they were lured to the New York apartment of Stephen Brown and subjected to sexual abuse. While Kirby managed to escape just one encounter, then-prep school student Michael endured repeated and frequent assaults, so much so he came to consider it 'normal'. 'It seems to be that every area of my life is affected,' Michael  told The New York Daily News. But now, some 30 years later, Brown, 62, is behind bars, after Kirby randomly spotted him going after children in Central Park. Caught: Stephen Brown, 62, was arrested on March 4 after allegedly planning to meet with a 12-year-old boy in New York and later found in the possession of 11,000 child pornography images. Investigators started looking into Brown after two men, claiming to be former victims of abuse, saw him acting suspiciously in Central Park . Michael M. and Kirby used a Nikon camera and a 300-mm. lens to snap pictures of Brown gleefully interacting with kids at the boat near the Central Park Children's Gate, where he strolled through each day, according to park employees. They turned the images over to police, who began investigating Brown. On March 4 they swooped on Brown, arresting him at the Inn on the Hudson in Peekskill, Westchester County, about 40 miles north of New York City, where he allegedly traveled 'to engage in various sexual acts' with a 12-year-old boy. He was charged with possessing 15 explicit photos — all shot by him — of a then-10-year-old boy, which investigators have confirmed is the same child he was meeting at the inn. He faces similar charges in Albany County, where he remains in custody, related to alleged conduct at his family’s upstate property. Authorities say they recovered over 11,000 illicit images from a variety of devices, with more expected to be found. 'Due to the quantity of child pornography that he’s possessed, what he was going to do to a 12-year-old child and the access that he has had to children in the past, both the NYPD and the state police are very concerned that there are multiple victims within the New York City and New York State area over the course of his lifetime,' said state police Senior Investigator Bill Gray, of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Seeking prey: Stephen Brown, seen here in his Facebook profile picture, would visit the boat pond at the Central Park Childrens Gate each day, according to workers. It was here bis two former alleged victims were able to get photos of him . Cliff David, who owns the boat rental stand in Central Park that Brown frequented, said he was always cautious of Brown's 'sick smile' and worried about what he was up to. 'I hoped and prayed it was only as far as I saw, because there was nothing I could do,' said David. Central Park Yacht Club leader John Tucker also said he would watch Brown intently and did not have a good feeling about him. 'We always kept an eye on him,' Tucker, 81, told The News. 'There were always suspicions from most of the guys.' Kirby, 41, and Michael M., 42, were students at the Allen-Stevenson school when they first ran into Brown at a luncheonette, which has since closed down. They would go there with friends to play video games. The boys, struggling with troubles at home and school, became easy targets for Brown, who soon invited both to his apartment on the Upper East Side. Brown was in his 30s at the time but told them he was a decade younger. A private school graduate, he lived off his family's wealth. Brown was arrested as he allegedly waited for a planned meeting for a 12-year-old boy in upstate New York. He was also in possession of 15 explicit photos of the same boy when the child was 10 . At the apartment they would listen to records, smoke cigarettes and joints and drink tall boys. 'I felt like he was my best friend, as Mike did,' Kirby said. 'So we had what seemed to be a very close friendship.' Michael M. agreed, saying: 'He was fascinating and he was fascinated in me. At least that’s how it seemed.' Kirby said he was 15 or 16 when he was abused. After sleeping on the apartment floor, the teen said he awoke to find his fly unzipped and the older man fondling him. It was the 'most horrible and uncomfortable feeling', said Kirby, who stopped the advance. Brown apologized and the incident was never mentioned again. For Michael M., the abuse allegedly began when he was 14 and was regular. Brown started introducing him to porn. 'He told me I could masturbate if I wanted to,' Michael M said. 'I don’t remember what his line was, but he took it to the next level and performed fellatio.' Even after Michael left for boarding school, the encounters continued on weekends and vacations. 'It was a thing that happened that was not spoken about, even when we were alone,' he said. 'It just sort of happened automatically every night.' 'In a lot of ways my life hasn’t progressed (since). 'It’s hard for me to say how. I’m still discovering that.' Kirby, now a father, said he hopes the story will reach other victims of abuse, and said he has a message for those people. 'I know you think he’s your best friend and a great guy,' said Kirby. 'But the fact is he’s really sick.' Any victims of sexual abuse should contact the Manhattan District Attorney’s Sex Crimes Unit hotline on 212-335-9373.","Stephen Brown, 62, was arrested March 4 in Peekskill, upstate New York .

"By . Damien Gayle . and Ryan Gorman . A Columbia University Dental School student who has been missing for more than a month has been found dead in the Hudson River. Jiwon Lee, 29, was pulled from the water after a passers-by spotted a body floating off West 86th Street. She went missing on April 1, weeks before her graduation. She had been suffering from depression and had attempted suicide at least once before she disappeared. Dead: The body of Jiwon Lee, 29, was pulled from the Hudson River in New York on Saturday . Police told the New York Daily News . that Miss Lee was wearing just a sweater, underwear and boots when her . body was pulled from the Hudson on Saturday afternoon. They confirmed the identity of the body yesterday and informed her next of kin. Miss . Lee had not been seen since leaving her apartment on Manhattan’s Upper . West Side at around 8.30 p.m. on April 1, police said. Her . relatives said they believed foul play was involved, but investigators . allegedly found a suicide note on a desk in the apartment written out to . her family. Miss Lee had previously tried to take her own life with pills, an NYPD official told MailOnline. 'She wrote them all a letter that it was not their fault, she gave up on life,' said the police officer. Police are not sure how long ago the note was written, but do see it as an ominous sign. Miss . Lee last spoke with her brother and another person, whose phone number . has since been disconnected, before she went missing, a friend told Gothamist. The call lasted . for half an hour until just before the last contact her phone had with a . local cell tower, her brother Matt Lee told MailOnline. The number tracked to Sacramento, California, and she had spoken with the person previously. Well respected: Jiwon Lee was recently the president of the American Student Dental Association . Mr . Lee previously said that his sister's disappearance was out of . character. 'She’s never done anything like this,' he said last month. 'we don’t think it is anything she did herself that has caused her to be . missing.' The five-foot-two, 120-pound student was last seen by her roommate at their West 98th Street apartment. Police . last tracked her cell phone to West 179th Street, near the George . Washington Bridge, through pings from cell towers, her friend Kimberli . Leal told MailOnline. The . phone last contacted that tower at 9.33 p.m., her brother said, adding . that there was no reason he was aware of for her to be in that area. He had said he was hoping her disappearance had nothing to do with the bridge. Mr . Lee lives on West 175th Street, and loved ones believed she may have . been on her way to see him, but he was not expecting her, he lamented. Police . previously searched the area with dogs and divers but have came up . empty. A review of bridge surveillance footage also showed nothing, but . the police source said she could still have accessed the pedestrian . walkway. Found: Police confirmed the body was that of Miss Lee yesterday and informed her next of kin . Where she was last seen: Miss Lee went missing after leaving her apartment at 8.30pm on April 1 . Investigators and . loved ones spent days combing the area for signs of the missing . part-time comedian. They also created a Facebook page to aid in the . search. A search of the harbor also didn't turn up any trace of the missing woman. A . group of friends had gathered every day to post signs in the areas . around her apartment, where she went missing and by Columbia University . Medical Center, said Miss Leal. Before . news of her death emerged, Mr Lee had paid tribute to his sister and . begged her to come hom. 'She’s an amazing individual, very high . achieving, very caring about others,' he said. 'We just want her to come . home.' Jiwon Lee had been the president of the American Student Dental Association, according to Jonathan Shenkin. ‘Jiwon is an exceptionally well . respected leader in this nation in the dental community,’ he told . MailOnline. ‘People adored her from the moment they met her.’ Mysterious: Jiwon Lee went missing from her Upper West Side apartment to a neighborhood about 70 blocks north, near the George Washington Bridge . Missing person: Family and friends had conducted searches across New York for Miss Lee . Miss Lee had just passed her board exams and was expecting to graduate in May, according to Miss Leal. The . soon-to-be dentist wasn’t outwardly having any personal problems in the . days and weeks leading up to her disappearance, Miss Leal said. ‘Everything was fine.’ The well-rounded student also taught math to middle school students in the city through AmeriCorps, according to the Columbia Spectator. A GoFundMe . site had been set up to help raise money to hire a private . investigator. Money raised was also to be used to provide a reward to . anyone who comes forward with information leading to Miss Lee.","Police pulled the body of Jiwon Lee from the Hudson on Saturday afternoon .

"By . David Mccormack . Two circus performers remain in a critical condition after a platform collapsed during a performance in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday, and caused them to fall 40 feet to the ground. A broken clamp has been determined as the cause of the accident which occurred on Sunday during an act in which eight . performers were supposed to hang 'like a human chandelier' using their hair. Despite a spokesperson for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, appearing on television claiming none of the injuries are life-threatening, officials at Rhode Island Hospital told ABC News that several of the injured remained in a critical condition as of Monday. Scroll down for videos . Performance gone wrong: An injured female performer is lifted onto a stretcher after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus in Providence . Three circus performers remain in a critical condition after a platform collapsed during a performance by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday . Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare said investigators know that at least one clamp - D-ring carabiner - attaching the human chandelier to the rafters at the Dunkin' Donuts Center failed. It is unclear why it broke or if other parts of the complex rigging system malfunctioned. Eleven people were admitted to hospital on Sunday after the platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt, . sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground. Pare said two of the acrobats are still in critical condition; three are in serious condition and three are stable. Dayana Costa and Julissa Segrera were in critical condition while Stefany Neves, Viktoriya Medeiros and Viktorila Liakhova were in serious condition. Listed in good condition were Samantha Pitard, Svitlana Balanicheva and Widny Neves. Two of them had surgery, including Widny Neves, 25, who suffered a badly broken arm. Her father Roiter told NBC News that it is a miracle that no one died.

It's too high and too heavy, too many girls. But no one is . dead from this accident,’ he told NBC News. In addition to a broken arm, his daughter suffered minor fractures to her back and neck and will need months of physical therapy to recover. But he had no doubt she would return to big top and its most daring acts. 'All circus acts are dangerous jobs,' he said. 'If you work in that field, you accept the risk.' The rigging for the show was designed by the troupe's founder, Andre Medeiros, whose wife Viktoriya was in the air and is among the injured. The seriously injured . suffered broken bones and internal bleeding, while several other staff suffered minor . injuries. No audience members were hurt. 'All performers have received medial treatment and are resting comfortably, we are pleased though their injuries are serious none appear to be life threatening,' said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.

Suddenly the platform crashes to the ground and a loud gasp of horror can be heard from the audience . Eleven people were admitted to hospital on Sunday after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt, sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground . Payne also told Today . that there was still a possibility that a performance scheduled for . Monday evening may go ahead without the aerial element of the show. The . accident was reported to police at about 11:45 a.m., 45 minutes into . the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus' Legends show at the . Dunkin' Donuts Center. He . said the metal-frame apparatus from which the performers were hanging . came free from the metal truss it was connected to. The eight women fell . 25 to 40 feet, landing on a dancer on the ground. Rhode Island Hospital in Providence admitted 11 patients with varying injuries. Three of the victims were ground personnel. It was witnessed by an audience of about 3,900, many of them children. All . the performers have been doing ‘some variation of this act for some . time,’ Payne said, though he didn't know how long. The current . incarnation of the act began in January with the launch of the show, he . said. Providence .

At first, she said, she thought it was . part of the act. ‘It . just went crashing down,’ Sydney said. ‘Everyone was freaking out. We . heard this huge clatter and then we just heard the girls scream.’ She said spotlights were on the performers at the time, but all the lights went out after the fall. Rosa .

Fire department rescue units from Providence, East Providence, and Smithfield were called to assisted with the injured. The circus performances were suspended after the accident and quickly canceled. Officials later announced that the scheduled 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. performances have been canceled. A circus announcer told the audience that accidents can happen in live performances and thanked the first responders for there efforts. The hair-hanging stunt is described on the circus' website as a ‘larger-than-life act’ featuring eight female performers. ‘These “hairialists” perform a combination of choreography and cut-ups including spinning, hanging from hoops, and rolling down wrapped silks, all while being suspended 35 feet in the air by their hair alone,’ the website says. ‘In this hair-raising act, audiences will even see the weight of three girls held aloft by the locks of only one of these tangled beauties.’ Rosa Viveiros, right, from Seekonk, Mass., along with her niece Lily Lannon, 9, left, describe the accident that happened during the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus performance on Sunday .","An acrobatic stunt went horribly wrong on Sunday during a performance by the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Rhode Island .

"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter . Victim: Chef Henry Stangroom, 21, was stabbed to death by his flatmate Andrew Morris . A brilliant financier killed his girlfriend’s brother after she dumped him and ordered him to delete a sex tape, a court was told. Andrew Morris, 30, fatally stabbed his 21-year-old flatmate Henry Stangroom after spending months in a blur of alcohol and cocaine. The victim’s sister, Michelle, had told him she would not see him again unless he returned to his £120,000-a-year job, the Old Bailey heard. The actuary had gone on sick leave for five months after suffering panic attacks during a £200million deal with finance giant Goldman Sachs. She also ordered him to destroy a sex tape they had made on his mobile phone during a visit to the flat he shared with her brother in Battersea, South West London. She was worried after a friend had been involved in a scandal involving England rugby player James Haskell, in which a couple were filmed secretly. Highly-qualified Morris, who worked as a risk assessor handling huge business deals, killed Mr Stangroom three days later. The young successful chef, who worked at the Criterion, in Piccadilly Circus, was stabbed repeatedly in the heart, lungs and head. Morris was later found in the bathroom after attempting suicide, with wounds to both wrists and a harpoon spear in his neck. He admits killing his friend, but claims he was mentally ill at the time after suffering from severe depression and the impact of his drug and alcohol abuse. Miss Stangroom had moved out of the flat she shared with Morris and her brother six weeks before the attack. Sister: Michelle Stangroom had ordered Morris to destroy a sex tape they had made on his mobile phone, the Old Bailey heard . Morris said she told him she was concerned a tape they had made could cause similar problems as it did for Mr Haskell, former captain of the England under 18s. The rugby player was suspended from Wellington College after one of his friend’s was filmed having sex with his girlfriend on a camera planted in a dormitory cupboard. ‘She asked me to dispose of similar material we had made,’ Morris told the court. It was a tape. It was made on my mobile phone. ‘She said her friend had got into hot water making a similar tape with this England rugby player.’ Later, Morris sobbed as he claimed a furious row was behind the killing. He said he stabbed Mr Stangroom while defending himself after taunting him over a fatal road tragedy some time earlier. Fear: Miss Morris was worried after a friend had been involved in a scandal involving England rugby player James Haskell, in which a couple were filmed secretly . Mr Stangroom had killed 19-year-old Jack Bland as he drove to his family home in Odiham, Hampshire, after a wedding reception. The chef assumed he had hit a deer and drove on with a smashed windscreen. He was later given a suspended sentence for dangerous driving. Morris said the victim told him he would not let him ruin his sister’s life as they argued and stalked each other around the flat. He told the jury: ‘I said it wasn’t me who ruined lives, it was him. I was referring to the accident he had. I went into the kitchen. I got hit on the back of the head.’ 'As he came towards me I put the knife up in front of me and pushed it towards him. I wanted him to stop stabbing at me' Andrew Morris . Morris then claimed the victim lashed out with a knife, inflicting a cut on his arm as he ran to the bedroom to get help. ‘It was my fault. I said some things that I shouldn’t have said. I probably said the most hurtful thing I could ever have said to him,’ Morris said. He grabbed the spear gun before the pair grappled again and Morris said he picked up a second knife to defend himself. ‘As he came towards me I put the knife up in front of me and pushed it towards him. I wanted him to stop stabbing at me,’ he said. It was then that the chef was fatally injured, said Morris, and he claims to have tried to stop the bleeding as he gave his friend mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Morris said he intended to kill himself by slashing his wrists, but simply ended up sitting in the hot water for two hours. He then put the spear gun under his chin and used his toe to fire it. However, it did not inflict a fatal wound and he was later found by paramedics. Tragedy: The young successful chef, who worked at the Criterion, in Piccadilly Circus, was stabbed repeatedly in the heart, lungs and head . The jury has heard how Morris’ life spiralled into depression after he went on sick leave from his job in the City. The father-of-one became a recluse, spending months inside his flat drinking up to two bottles of wine a day, inhaling nitrous oxide and snorting cocaine. Morris gradually spent all his money and in the end could not afford to pay his bills and his credit was so bad he was refused a pay-day loan. He attempted suicide several times and once slashed his wrists and sat in the bath fully clothed while his brother and best friend were in the flat. In the weeks before the killing he Googled ‘murder mental illness’ and ‘sentence for murder in UK’ but told the jury they were linked to a TV show he was watching. Morris, of St Neots, Cambridgeshire, denies murder. The trial continues.

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Associated Press . The married father who was put in jail 13 years after committing a crime has spoken out one day after he was formally released. 'It's still a dream. It hasn't really sunk in yet,’ Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson said on the Today Show Tuesday morning, saying that he hasn’t slept since his release. ‘I watched my family, watching them sleeping. I just wanted to make sure I didn’t wake up from the dream.’ SCROLL DOWN VIDEOS . Reunited: Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson and his wife LaQonna spoke out on the Today Show Tuesday morning about the emotional hearing on Monday that led to his release . In awe: Anderson, 37, said that he has not slept since the release- opting to watch his family sleep instead . Anderson spent 13 years free from prison due to a clerical error, then nearly a year behind bars when the mistake was caught. On Monday, he walked out of a southeast Missouri courtroom a free man again - this time with no need to look over his shoulder. The reunion with his wife and four children comes after 10 months apart, because he said that he did not want his kids to visit him behind bars. ‘Especially with children they're so young and impressionable… I didn’t want my children to feel that that’s normal to see that that's something that’s acceptable,’ he told Savannah Guthrie. Anderson, now 37, was 23 when he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in the robbery of a fast-food restaurant's assistant manager. He told The Associated Press last month that he waited, and even asked about going to prison, but the order never came. A free man: A judge ordered Cornealious Anderson (left) out of jail today. He was arrested last year when it was discovered he was never sent to prison for a robbery conviction in a clerical mistake. Pictured above with wife LaQonna and daughter Nevaeh, 3, after his release today . When asked why didn't he turn himself in, he said: 'The thought crossed my mind but once someone tells you ""It's not your job to turn yourself in, it's their job to take you in...""' 'I know it sounds weird but if I had to do it all over again, I don't know if I would do anything different.' In July, Anderson's sentence was supposed to end. It was then that someone at the Missouri Department of Corrections realized he had never been put behind bars. Eight U.S. marshals arrived one morning at his home in a middle-class neighborhood and took him away. He was in prison by noon that day, and had remained behind bars until Monday. Anderson and his wife credit God for getting them through the process. Emotional: Once he returned to the family home on Monday, that was the first time he had seen his four children in over 10 months because he wouldn't allow them to visit while he was in jail . Celebration: The relatives that were in the court room at the time of the verdict broke down in sobs while those at home broke out the silly string . Changed man: In his 13 years of freedom, Anderson got married, had children, started a construction business, coached his son's youth football team and volunteered at his church . ‘His hand was in this the whole time,’ Anderson said. ‘(Having Anderson home), the feeling is just great. I missed by husband, I missed by best friend,’ LaQonna Anderson said. In addition to the judge, the man who owned the fast food restaurant that Anderson robbed has also praised his self-improvement over the past 13 years and pushed for his release. ‘It’s about  time they let the guy go home. It’s the state's screw up, not his,’ the man said in a statement. ‘That’s awesome. That in itself is enough for me. It lets you know his character,’ Anderson said. Mississippi County Associate Circuit Judge Terry Lynn Brown needed just a 10-minute hearing before ruling that he was giving Anderson credit for time served for all 4,794 days between his conviction and when he was arrested last year. Mistake: If he served his full sentence, Anderson would have been released last July. That's when authorities realized the clerical error and brought him to prison . Reunion: Anderson embraces his grandmother Mary Porter after being released from custody on Monday . Nightmare over: Anderson, his grandmother (left), wife LaQonna (right) and daughter Nevaeh walk down the stairs and out of court today .

Anderson, . 37, left the courthouse with his wife and 3-year-old daughter on one . arm, his grandmother on the other, tears in all of their eyes.

I'm just so thankful. I just thank God for everybody.' ‘I’m . going to enjoy every moment that I can: with real food and a real bed, . just enjoy these guys,’ he said as he was welcomed home by his children. Justice: Anderson walks out of court victorious today with wife LaQonna and daughter Neveah . Anderson, who had never . been convicted of a serious crime before the robbery, suspected his case . had been overlooked and asked his former attorney what to do. 'Day . by day, month by month, year by year, time passed, and they never . picked me up,' he said in an interview last month with The Associated . Press. So Anderson went about his life, never trying to conceal his whereabouts or identity. He . married, divorced, married again. He raised three children of his own . and a stepchild, owned and operated three construction businesses. He . coached his son's youth football team in Webster Groves, and he ran the . video operation at his church. The hearing was in Charleston, Missouri, because that's where Anderson had been imprisoned.

The three women held captive in a Cleveland house before escaping a year ago Tuesday have spent their first year of freedom in nearly a decade learning to drive, taking boxing lessons and cherishing time with their families. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus both said in statements released Monday that they are thankful and growing in many ways. Michelle Knight said in an interview on NBC's Today show Monday that she forgives the man who kidnapped and tortured her and the two others. She said Ariel Castro deserves forgiveness because she'd want to be forgiven if she did wrong, and 'that's the way of life.'

DeJesus was 14 when she was kidnapped by Castro. She said she's enjoying learning how to drive and use new technology. 'I am spending time with my family and working with Amanda on a book that we are really excited about,' she said. Berry said the future is bright for her and thanked her family and friends for support. 'On this day, we decided that the right place for us to be was with other families who have gone through what our family has gone through,' Berry said.

Berry was 14, DeJesus was 16 and Knight was 20 when they disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004. They were rescued from Castro's rundown house May 6, 2013, after Berry broke through a screen door. Berry and DeJesus are collaborating with two Washington Post reporters on a book due out next year.

Olympic swimming champion Ian Thorpe has been out for the first time after being discharged from hospital where he was treated for two superbug infections he contracted during shoulder surgery. Sporting a new beard and wearing his shoulder in a  sling, the five-time gold medallist looked upbeat as he walked the streets in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

Released from hospital: Olympic swimming champion Ian Thorpe is seen for the first time after being released from hospital sporting a beard and wearing sling after he was treated for a superbug infection following shoulder surgery. The five-time gold medallist was spotted in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Swimming great Ian Thorpe has just spent three weeks in an intensive care ward after being treated for an infection he caught while undergoing shoulder surgery. The 31-year-old, who has fought a well-documented battle with depression, is now expected to undergo rehabilitation and psychological treatment . The swimming great was spotted visiting an office in the Sydney suburb of Randwick. Thorpe faces future shoulder operations and is also undergoing continuing treatment for his longtime battle with depression. 'He still has significant damage to his shoulder which will require further surgery,' his manager, Will Erskine told the MailOnline, 'but he's obviously very happy to get away from a hospital bed.' Thorpe's relaxed and smiling demeanour was in contrast to the dazed and confused condition he was found in three months ago in a vehicle outside a suburban backyard in Sydney's west. In early February, police were called by a Sydney family who thought someone had broken into their van. They found a dishevelled and disoriented Thorpe, who it was later revealed thought he was sitting in a friend's car. Thorpe's manager said at the time the swimmer had been taking antidepressants and medication for his shoulder. Will Erskine said Thorpe is now looking forward to taking on media commitments in the UK and Australia. ''There's some exciting things he's going to immerse himself in,' he said. 'He's moving forward. 'Nothing is confirmed yet, but he had a wonderful stint working for the BBC in the London Olympics. 'He likes it over there. He likes the European way of life.'

"By . Steph Cockroft . A controversial judge who jailed a rapist for just 45 days has stepped down . from the case after saying the 14-year-old . victim 'wasn't the victim she claimed to be'. Defendant Sir Young, 20, was given the 'lenient' sentence for raping a fellow pupil at Booker T. Washington High . School in Dallas, America - despite a possible 20-year jail term for the crime. But State District Judge Jeanine Howard caused further outrage when she appeared to make comments about the girl's promiscuity - even though Young had pleaded guilty to the rape. Dalls Judge Jeanine Howard (pictured) has stepped away from a rape case after sparking outrage by saying the 14-year-old victim 'wasn't the victim she claimed to be' Now the judge - who also came under fire for giving Young community service in a rape crisis centre - has removed herself from the case. The judge had told The Dallas Morning . News: 'She wasn't the victim she claimed to be. He is not your typical sex offender. 'There are rape cases that deserve life. There are rape cases that deserve 20 years. 'Every now and then you have one of those that deserve probation. This is one of those and I stand by it.' Prosecutor Josh Healy said Young's . victim, who is now 17, had been left in tears by the ruling. He said she . and her family told him they were 'shocked'  and 'extremely . disappointed'. But Judge Howard told the newspaper she gave the sentence because medical records indicated the . girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby - something the victim's family denies. Rapist: Defendant Sir Young, 20, pleaded guilty to the rape of a fellow student at Booker T. Washington High School, Dallas, when he was 18 and she was 14 . Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said his prosecutors had pushed for five years' prison time. He . also said the judge did not order Young to follow standard sex . offender requirements, such as attending treatment, undergoing an . evaluation or staying away from children. Prosecutors will now ask the new judge on the case to re-evaluate Young's probation, potentially giving him stricter conditions, according to the paper. Judge Howard's outspoken comments were not the first time she had been criticised over the case. The judge was also forced . into an embarrassing U-turn after the chief of the local rape crisis . centre refused to allow Young to carry out the community service portion . of his sentence there. Bobbie Villareal, executive director of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center, told WFAA.com: 'I’m sure she probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps. 'But it’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision.' Ms . Villareal slammed the 'lenient' conditions passed down by Judge Howard, . who is known in legal circles for her creative approach to sentencing. She said: 'It is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down. We won't have him: Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center refused to allow Young to volunteer, with its executive director saying 'it's just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision' 'It . sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault. That . victim’s family definitely didn’t feel like there was justice for her . and for other survivors of sexual assault.' Young's sentence of deferred adjudication probation means that if he meets various terms laid down by Judge Howard, he will not have a permanent criminal record. As well as the community service order, he must also spend 45 days in jail and a further 24 hours in jail every October 4 - the date of the rape - for the duration of his probation. Changes: Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room where the rape happened . The court heard that the pair were kissing in a practice room at the performing arts school, but that she had told him to stop when he began rubbing her body, the paper reported. Ignoring her pleas, he instead pulled off her leggings and raped her. 'I didn’t want to do anything other than kiss,' the victim told the court. She said she had told Young 'no' and 'stop' before and during the attack. Booker T. Washington High School has since added a window to the room and installed CCTV cameras.","Sir Young, 20, admitted raping a 14-year-old girl at a school when he was 18 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . A group of teenagers who were injured in a stabbing rampage at their Pennsylvania high school last week have returned to their campus for the first time. Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville re-opened to students Tuesday morning for a walk-through ahead of the resumption of classes Wednesday, and some victims were nervous about reliving the frantic experience. Sophomore Alex Hribal, 16, has been charged with stabbing 21 other students and a security guard in the attack last Wednesday after he allegedly bolted down hallways and into multiple classrooms wielding a knife in each hand. But now the blood-stained floors and piercing cries are gone. Scroll down for video . Injured: Victim Brett Hurt, center, who suffered a bruised lung in the attack, was on the verge of tears as he used a wheelchair to navigate the hallways . Back: Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville re-opened to students Tuesday morning for a walk-through ahead of the resumption of classes . Michael Spila who was stabbed in the back said he was concerned he might have flashbacks. 'Mentally, I'm still shocked from what happened,' he told WPXI. 'I was kind of nervous because I was . afraid I might start freaking out or something because you don't know . what would happen if you walked in and had flashbacks. And luckily . nothing happened.' Gracey Evans, watched in . horror as Hribal allegedly plunged a knife into the back of her friend . Brett Hurt while he bravely shielded her during the stabbing spree. 'It was different — but a good different,' the 17-year-old junior told NBC News of returning to the scene of the attack Tuesday. Evans and friends gathered around Hurt and linked arms for a photograph. The students waited for the 16-year-old, who suffered a bruised lung in the attack, to arrive so they could go in together, showing him their support. Evans said Hurt was on the verge of tears and had to use a wheelchair to navigate the halls. The students spoke with several teachers who were there when the early morning stabbing unfolded. Warning signs: Suspect Alex Hribal, 16, is led from his arraignment after he was charged with four counts of attempted murder as an adult. Authorities believe he threatened two students before carrying out the attack last Wednesday . Terror: Twenty one students were injured in Wednesday's blood bath, as well as a security guard. The two students Hribald allegedly threatened were not injured . Evacuation: Students at Franklin Regional High School were evacuated after the stabbing. They are due to resume school on Wednesdau . They told the teens they were sorry about what happened and provided tissues and candies in all classrooms. 'It's hard for them,' Evans told NBC of the teachers, 'but harder for us.' Parents were invited to visit Tuesday to help their children deal with the potentially traumatic experience. Counselors and therapy dogs were on campus to help students process. The . return to school comes after it was revealed that detectives believe . Hribal threatened two students by phone before the attack, according to a . search warrant. Neither was one of the victims. The warrant, obtained hours after last . Wednesday's rampage, said two students received 'threatening phone . messages and completed calls' from someone believed to be Hribal. It said the threat of violence contained an expletive. District Attorney John Peck said the two male students who got the calls were not among those stabbed or slashed in the attack, which occurred minutes before the start of classes at Franklin Regional High School. Neither Peck nor the warrant say when the calls were made. Murrysville police Chief Thomas Seefeld previously said investigators were looking into a threatening phone call the night before the assaults. Sophomore student Alex Hribal, 16, (pictured here in his high school yearbook) will be charged as an adult on several attempted murder charges . Transported: Hribal is driven away from a district magistrate in a Westmoreland County Sheriff's car after he was arraigned . 'The caller is believed to be the . actor because of the subsequent conduct of the actor coming to school . and attacking numerous individuals,' the warrant said. Seefeld . noted Monday that police had not definitively linked the calls to the . 16-year-old suspect but were seeking phone records to determine if they . came from a phone he could have used. Defense attorney Patrick Thomassey did not return calls Monday from The Associated Press. But he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which first reported the contents of the search warrant: 'I don't know of those phone calls.' He had previously told the AP that Hribal's parents weren't aware of any threatening calls the night before the attacks. The warrant indicates detectives seized three video game systems and games, a wooden kitchen knife-holder, some notebook paper believed to contain Hribal's handwriting and two computers. Four students remained hospitalized Monday, three in critical condition. The fourth was upgraded to fair condition. School spirit: A group of students tapes up a sign supporting their school near the entrance to Franklin Regional High School  on Thursday . Prayers: Ashlin (L) and Jude Burkhart, from Murrysville, hold candles during a prayer vigil for victims of the Franklin Regional High School stabbing rampage, at Calvary Lutheran Church in Murrysville, Pennsylvania on April 9, 2014 . The high school's teachers attended a . counseling session at a nearby church before returning to the school for . the first time Monday, part of a three-day effort by school officials . and a hired crisis management team to fully reopen the school for . classes Wednesday. Earlier, some parents said their children were eager to get back to school. 'That's where he wants to be, to be with his friends,' Jeff Mauro said of his son, Jamie, a ninth-grader who witnessed some of the stabbings. 'This has been a learning experience that we have to love each other — all of us.' Laura Thompson said her children 'seem to think they're going to be fine. But I think it's going to be different when they're back in that environment.' Thomassey has said he plans to waive Hribal's right to a preliminary hearing next week. After that, he said he would ask a judge to move the case to juvenile court, a move prosecutors are expected to contest. Thomassey said that request will be based largely on a mental health evaluation by a doctor he's hired.","Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, re-opened to students Tuesday for a walk-through ahead of the resumption of classes .

"By . Emily Crane . Grisly find: The body of James Crawford, 33, was found inside his Melbourne apartment on Monday morning . A young architect is believed to have been murdered up to two weeks before his sister found his body in his Melbourne apartment. Police are waiting for autopsy results after the body of James Crawford, 33, was discovered with several stab wounds to his chest at 9.30am on Monday. His sister located the remain of Mr Crawford when she went to visit him at his Albert Park apartment after no one in the family had heard from him in weeks. Police said the 33-year-old suffered multiple blows to his chest with a sharp object and are awaiting autopsy results to identify exactly when he was killed. Mr Crawford ran a small architecture firm, Inner Arc, from his apartment above a vintage shop on Cardigan Place. He owned the building and rented out the bottom shopfront to Empire Vintage store. The young architect was the son of television producer Henry Crawford and screenwriter Sarah Darling and was the grandson of the founding patron of the National Portrait Gallery, Gordon Darling, according to the Age. Henry Crawford, who won an Emmy Award for the show A Town Like Alice, said he was in shock before flying from New Zealand to be with his family. 'It's horrid, it's a bit of a state of shock and you feel powerless,' he said. 'James is a good boy and to my knowledge, was never involved in anything shady or anything like that. It sounds to me like robbery, but I don't know.' His last contact with his son was two weeks ago via email. Suspicious death: Homicide detectives were brought in to investigate the architect's death after his body was found in his Albert Park street with stab wounds to the chest . Lynda Gardener, the owner of the vintage store below Mr Crawford's apartment, said she had not seen him in three weeks. 'It's so sad. I've known him for about five years and he's always been so pleasant,' Ms Gardener told the Herald Sun. 'He's a very private person but would always say hello.' Homicide detectives are treating the death as suspicious and yesterday doorknocked the area to speak to neighbours and nearby businesses. They said it was too early to say if Mr Crawford knew his attackers, or if it was a foiled robbery. Mr Crawford had been living in Melbourne for two years after moving to the United States to finish his interior architecture degree in Denver and an architecture degree in San Francisco. He previously attended boarding school at Geelong Grammar in Victoria and completed an information technology degree at Bond University.","James Crawford, 33, was found with multiple stab wounds to his chest .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . An Alaskan teenager has been accused of using an assault rifle to shoot dead two state troopers as they tried to arrest his father in a remote village. Nathanial Lee Kangas was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and a count of third-degree assault when he appeared in court on Saturday. The 19-year-old allegedly shot Trooper Gabriel Gabe Rich and Sergeant Patrick Scott Johnson in the back as they struggled to detain his father, Arvin, in the remote village of Tanana on Thursday. Charged: Nathanial Kangas arrives in a courtroom in Alaska. The teenager is accused of shooting dead two state troopers . Victims: Gabriel Rich, left, and Patrick Johnson were shot as they responded to a call in a remote village . As bail was set at $2 million, the judge . asked Kangas if he had anything to say. After a long pause, the teenager . replied: 'I'm sorry.' Every seat in the courtroom was full, and the walls were lined with law enforcement . officers of several agencies as Kangas faced his charges. Officers . hugged and consoled each other at the hearing. Kangas' mother, Judy, and younger brother, Albert, each gave brief apologies. 'I . want to tell everybody, the families, from the bottom of my heart that I . am sorry,' Mrs Kangas said as she choked back tears. The troopers, both fathers, were part of a four-man team that patrolled the remote regions of Alaska. On . the day of their deaths, Rich and Johnson had been following up a . report that public safety official Mark Haglin had been threatened with a . gun. The pair had traveled to Tanana, which is accessible only by boat or plane, to arrest Nathaniel's father, Arvin Kangas. The 58-year-old was due to face charges of driving without a . license and threatening Haglin, an unarmed official. Haglin had . received reports that the elder Kangas was driving around the village, . even though he doesn't have a valid driver's license. After Haglin . approached his home, the elder Kangas pointed to a rifle . and suggested he would use it if Haglin did not leave, according to the . charging document. Haglin . then contacted state troopers, who obtained an arrest warrant and . accompanied him to the home a day after the confrontation. Crime scene: The officers were shot as they tried to arrest Arvin Kangas at this Tanana house in Alaska . Arvin . Kangas refused to cooperate with the troopers after being informed of . his arrest warrant and tried to run inside his home, according to the . charging document. The troopers pursued, and a scuffle ensued, according . to the document. That's . when Nathanial Kangas allegedly appeared with an assault rifle and shot them. He then pointed the weapon at . Haglin, but lowered it and Haglin was able to flee, according to court documents. Haglin . called for help, and with the aid of other community members, was able . to detain the teenager Kangas until more troopers arrived. Kangas 'spontaneously stated that he was sorry for doing ""it"" and that he shot troopers because the troopers were wrestling with . Arvin,' the documents stated. His father was also arrested and is being held in Fairbanks. 'These . are serious crimes, killing two Alaska State Troopers, two of my Alaska . State Troopers ... I would support the recommendations of the district . attorney and hope that you put the maximum amount of bail possible,' Colonel James Cockrell said during Saturday's hearing. Processions were held for Rich and Johnson on Saturday. Their bodies were taken from Anchorage to Fairbanks. The deaths highlighted the dangers the force faces as it patrols remote and difficult terrain. Arrest: Arvin Kangas has been charged with assault and his 19-year-old son Nathaniel is being held in connection with the shootings . Evidence: Forensic science officers arrive at the remote village as they investigate the double shooting . Cut off: Investigators take photos on the porch of the house, where the troopers had confronted a man about an earlier alleged gun threat . 'This will take us a long time to heal,' Colonel Cockrell said on Friday. 'Currently . department members are dealing with shock and disbelief trying to make . sense of Sergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich's deaths,' Cockrell told KTUU. Like . many troopers assigned to patrol multiple villages, Rich and Johnson . worked from a rural service base about 130 miles from Tanana, which they . reached by plane. The men and their rugged patrol route had featured on a National Geographic reality show, Alaska State Troopers. Tanana resident Ruby Cruger is related to the Kangas family, but said she did not know the details of the shooting, just that it has affected the entire community. 'They're all shocked,' Cruger said of the town's reaction to the shooting. Loss: Sergeant Scott Johnson, pictured, was a father of three girls . Reality show: Alaska trooper Gabe Rich is pictured on the National Geographic show he featured in . National Geographic said in a statement that it was 'incredibly saddened' to learn of the deaths. Spokesman Chris Albert said the troopers are among the many who are subjected to the daily challenges of working in isolated areas of the state, such as Tanana. Johnson was born in Fairbanks and grew up in the Alaska community of Tok. He was a veteran trooper who joined the force in 1993. He spent his career in Fairbanks and worked a variety of roles, including patrol trooper, field training officer and as a canine officer, instructor and canine unit supervisor. The husband and father of three daughters also had worked as a supervisor of a Fairbanks-area narcotics team. Rich was born in Sayre, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Fairbanks. He first worked as a patrolman with the North Pole Police Department southeast of Fairbanks before deciding to join the troopers in 2011. With the troopers, he spent most of his career on patrol. Survivors include his fiance, their one-year-old son and his fiance's eight-year-old son. At the time of his death, Rich was in the process of adopting the older boy, troopers said. Johnson and Rich joined the interior rural unit on January 1. The unit covers 23 villages scattered across a sparse terrain. Their deaths came the same day the name of Manokotak village public safety Officer Thomas Madole was added to the Indian Country Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Artesia, New Mexico.

"By . Richard Shears . An English national has been arrested in Cambodia for allegedly molesting a young boy, less than a month after another British paedophile was sent to jail for 10 years. The arrest of 36-year-old Richard William Fruin, from Gloucestershire, for allegedly abusing an eight-year-old boy follows the jailing earlier this month of paedophile David Fletcher, 67, from Norwich, who had been convicted of raping a number of children living in a slum. Fruin, who has a conviction for child pornography in the UK, was charged with molesting the eight-year-old after he was found sleeping with the youngster in a guest house in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. Richard William Fruin had been staying at the Boeung Meas guesthouse in the capital of Cambodia . Police said Fruin, who fled to Cambodia after serving a year in prison in Britain for producing child pornography, was found with the boy when police raided the Boeung Meas guesthouse. He has already made one brief court appearance this week and is expected to be brought before a magistrate again early next month. ‘We are still investigating to determine whether or not he had sex with the boy,’ Lieutenant Colonel Lao Lin, who heads the country’s anti-human trafficking department, told the Cambodia Daily. Police have established that Fruin has been working as an English teacher in Phnom Penh following his recent arrival in the country. Fruin has been charged with molesting the eight-year-old after he was found sleeping with the youngster in this guest house in Phnom Penh . His known record of paedophilia goes back to 2005 when he was charged at Gloucester Crown Court with 15 counts of producing child pornography. He was released on bail and fled the country for seven years. According to the anti-paedophile organisation Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) he travelled to Africa and South East Asia before returning to the UK last year, where he was re-arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. On his release, he flew to Cambodia. Cambodia was once the haunt of child molester Gary Glitter . ‘He has a history of abuse and the police have found many more [Cambodian] victims,’ Mr Khoem Vando, deputy director of project management at APLE told The Cambodian Daily. The mother of the young boy found with Fruin on Sunday night claimed that all three of her sons - including two aged 10 and 11 - told police they had been abused by the paedophile. ‘If police had not taken any action last night, I don’t know what he would have done to my son,’ the woman told the paper. She said that Fruin had been visiting her shop in Phnom Penh for about a month and had previously taken her two older sons to his guest house. ‘I had no idea that he intended to hurt my children,’ she said. Miss Pen Chantha, owner of the guesthouse, said Fruin had been staying there for about a month. ‘I was shocked when the police came to arrest him,’ she said. ‘I never saw anything strange while he was staying at my guesthouse.’ If convicted on a single charge of purchasing a child for prostitution, Fruin could be sent to jail for up to five years. Police said it was possible more charges could follow. Cambodia has for years been the haunt of paedophiles from Britain and other European countries. It was where notorious child molester Gary Glitter lived before he fled to Vietnam as authorities started moving in on him. He served prison time in Vietnam before being deported to the UK. Paedophile David Fletcher, 67, from Norwich, was sent to the notorious Prey Sar Prison in Cambodia after he was convicted of raping a number of children a month before paedophile Richard William Fruin was arrested . When Fruin, from Stroud, appeared in court in Gloucester last year it was revealed that among provocative photographs found at his home were pictures of a 14-year-old boy called Luke Harrison. A 21-year-old builder at the time of Fruin's court appearance in 2012, Mr Harrison plunged to his death from a Cornish cliff top during a football tour earlier in the year. Prosecutor Tim Hills told the court that in 2005, when Fruin was first arrested, he was associating with the young Mr Harrison and had taken him to a farmhouse in Worcester - where indecent pictures of him were taken. Mr Hills told the court that Fruin's offences came to light after a postman tried to deliver a parcel to his home, a package that was in fact addressed to Luke Harrison. The postman refused to hand the parcel over to Fruin, who snatched it. The postman reported Fruin for theft, resulting in police searching his home and finding 'evidence of drug use'. Police had expected to find further incriminating drug evidence on Fruin's computers, but instead discovered pornographic films and pictures, most of them from the internet - but there were others of Mr Harrison in provocative poses.","Richard William Fruin has been charged with molesting the child .

"By . Richard Alleyne . Heartbreaking: Stephen Guillermo, 26 (pictured) was shot dead in his San Francisco apartment complex on Saturday morning after a night out drinking . A university student has been shot dead after a night out drinking when he accidentally returned home to the wrong apartment. Stephen Guillermo, 26, apparently pressed the third floor instead of the fifth on the elevator and then tried to enter what he thought was the condominium he shared with his brother and sister. But the apartment was owned by Amisi Sudi Kachepa, 68, who it is alleged shot him when he tried to force open the door early Saturday morning. Kachepa, who later surrendered to police and was arrested, reportedly told people in the building that he blamed Guillermo for breaking the knob on the door of his unit. The knob on the door was missing yesterday at the apartment in San Francisco, SFGate reported. Marc Guillermo, the victim's brother, said he could not understand what had happened. He said Mr Guillermo was studying international business at San Francisco State University, and worked both driving for the ride sharing service Lyft and selling Puma athletic shoes. He had hoped to join the U.S. Foreign Service, he added. 'He's not aggressive or violent,' Mr Guillermo said. 'He's a quiet person.' 'It just doesn't fit,"" said Sharrmaine Guillermo, his sister, adding that her brother did not become hostile when he drank, and she cannot figure out how he would even start some sort of confrontation. Promising future: Stephen Guillermo (pictured left and right) was studying international business at San Francisco State University and worked both driving for the ride sharing service Lyft and selling Puma athletic shoes . 'Stephen is not the kind of guy who would do that.' Mr Guillermo would talk through any confrontation and would not be combative, she said. 'We're all confused, we just can't understand how it could have happened,' she said. 'He was such a gentle, quiet guy - he's just not the type that would be violent or inspire that type of response,' said his cousin, Emil Guillermo, a columnist with AsianWeek. He said that the shooting belied claims that San Francisco was a safe city. 'The older resident apparently felt he needed a gun to live in his urban apartment on Mission and 5th Street,' he wrote. 'This is how safe the city is when one only feels secure when armed and dangerous. 'That’s the situation that leaves an innocent 26-year-old dead.'

Authorities say 33-year-old Jasmine Mitchell is on the run and considered 'dangerous and desperate', wanted in relation to a major identity theft operation that has claimed thousands of victims. On April 29, detectives received information that Mitchell and a second suspect, 34-year-old Roy Kim were living at an apartment complex across from the San Pablo Lytton Casino, according to Inside Bay Area. Both had arrest warrants against their names, and police detained three people after searching the apartment and finding a large-scale identity theft and credit card operation.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A former top aide to the woman at the center of the 'Bridgegate' scandal plaguing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied under oath on Tuesday that she had anything to do with the fiasco swirling around Gov. Chris Christie. The embattled governor is still contemplating a run for president in 2016, but must first weather the storm brought on when Bridget Kelly, then his deputy chief of staff, allegedly set into motion a week-long political plot in September 2013 to punish an unsupportive Democratic mayor by choking off traffic leading from his town to the iconic George Washington Bridge. Christina Genovese Renna was Kelly's top aide and Christie's director of intergovernmental affairs. 'I had no knowledge of, or involvement in, the bridge lane closures,' she calmly told a special legislative panel on Tuesday. Renna's role in the series of events that led to five resignations and firings was described in an investigative report commissioned by Christie – a document that created a mini firestorm of guffaws from Democrats even as it absolved the governor of wrongdoing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Christina Renna testified Tuesday before a special investigative committee in the New Jersey legislature about the 'Bridgegate' controversy swirling around Gov. Chris Christie, denying any involvement in the political mess . A special New Jersey legislative committee heard testimony Tuesday from Renna, a former midlevel Chris Christie staffer who worked for central 'Bridgegate' figure Bridget Kelly . A legislative committee is investigating who was behind the politically motivated order to close lanes leading to the George Washington bridge last September . First couple: Mary Pat Foster (L) and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R) attended the Bloomberg & Vanity Fair cocktail reception following the 2014 White House Correspondents Association Dinner on Saturday . Christie has insisted throughout that he was unaware of any plot involving the bridge until media reports started appearing. The report from the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher placed the blame on Kelly and a Christie appointee to the powerful Port Authority named David Wildstein. Former aide to Gov. Chris Christie, Christina Renna, testifies  in Trenton on Tuesday, May 6, 2014, before New Jersey lawmakers probing the George Washington Bridge lane closures scandal . It also includes a summary of an interview Renna gave with attorneys. According to that summary, a sobbing Kelly called Renna at work after the public release of an email in which Kelly wrote to Wildstein that it was 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.' 'Kelly was hysterically crying and said that she was sorry,' the summary reads 'Renna asked Kelly if she was going to come into the office, and Kelly said no.' 'Kelly hung up and called Renna back at some point later in the day to ask Renna to log into Kelly’s Twitter and delete Kelly’s account, because people were tweeting ""mean things"" about Kelly.' The special . New Jersey investigative committee subpoenaed Renna months ago, along . with mroe than two dozen other figures in the scandal. Its co-chair, . Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski, has said he won't rule out calling Gov. Christie to personally testify under oath. He . told the Associated Press that Christie's testimony, which would . ratchet up the Bridgegate frenzy to new levels, is 'a possibility but . not a certainty.' Bridget Kelly, who was Christie's deputy chief of staff and Renna's boss, is likely one target of a criminal probe led by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman -- who got his job succeeding Chris Christie after he won the governor's mansion . David Wildstein (C), a Christie appointee at the Port Authory of New York and New Jersey, resigned in December after it emerged that he supervised the implementation of the week-long bridge lane closures that grew into a national scandal . Traffic crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, making it a key artery into New York City -- a road choked off from a New Jersey town for a week in September 2013 . Heaven: Christie hung out with TV actress Sofia Vergara at the WHCA dinner . A parallel investigation by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman – Christie's successor in that job – is reportedly . seeking criminal indictments. Wisniewski has insisted his committee will only call witnesses whose participation won't interfere with Fishman's probe. Spooked: Former Port Authority Chairman David Samson has stopped cooperating with the investigative committee, complaining of leaks to the press following his delivery of documents to committee Democrats . Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator who shares control of the committee with WIsniewski, told Bloomberg that Renna's testimony will be 'a point on the road of trying to find out all of the things that might have gone wrong here.' 'Not much in the administration operates outside of the governor’s hands,' she added, hinting that Christie himself is likely the Democrats' ultimate target. The committee hearing Tuesday's subpoenaed testimony was constituted in January with a two-year charter, giving it jurisdiction until well into the 2016 presidential primary season. Former Port Authority Chairman David Samson said Friday that he would stop cooperating with the panel, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refusing to turn over more documents. He blamed the committee for 'bias' and 'violating its own rules of confidentiality' with a series of embarrassing media leaks. Samson’s attorneys, Michael Chertoff and Angelo Genova, have complained that documents their cluient has already given the committee 'were discussed with the press, replete with criticism of our client and conclusory statements.' Wisniewski noted in an interview with the Newark Star-Ledger that his committee is a legally constituted body and Samson himself is an attorney. 'It’s a significant step for a member of the state bar to refuse to cooperate with a lawful subpoena,"" Wisniewski said. The bridge scandal has taken its toll on Christie, even bringing a barb from President Barack Obama during his humorous remarks at Saturday's annual White House Correspondents Association dinner. '""Washington seems more dysfunctional than ever,' Obama said. 'Gridlock has gotten so bad in this town you have to wonder: What'd we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad?'","Christina Renna worked for then-Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, who is accused of launching a partisan plot against a Democratic mayor .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Tapes from the 911 calls made to police which led to them investigating a suspicious incident at a Miami hotel involving three professional footballers have been released. The recordings come after an unidentified woman went to Miami Police headquarters two days after the calls were made to say she had been partying with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, along with receiver Quinton Patton and Seattle Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette. The woman said she kissed Kaepernick and undressed after a night of drinking and smoking marijuana with him and two others. She adds that she later woke up in hospital without any memory. Mr Kaepernick has denied any wrongdoing. An unidentified woman told police that she had been partying with Colin Kaepernick, pictured . The police report also notes that she had a 'sexual relationship with Mr Kaepernick in the past'. Now the tapes of the calls have been revealed, showing that two unidentified men made two separate 911 calls on the night of April 1. In the first call, a man identifying himself as hotel security tells the operator a woman, who called herself ‘Jesus’ was in a hotel room and was refusing to leave. ABC News reported that the caller said: ‘She said her name was Jesus and she don’t have no clothes on. She is visiting this gentleman here.’ Mr Kaepernick, left, with team mate Quinton Patton, who was also named in a police report . Meanwhile in a second call, the website said the unidentified male said: ‘There’s a young lady in my friend’s bed. She says she’s not leaving until she sees him... No, no, he's not her boyfriend. He's someone she wants to sleep with.’ The incident, which occurred last month at the Viceroy Hotel in Miami, is being treated as suspicious by police although they have not called it a criminal investigation and do not have a timeline for any updates. After the incident was reported and Mr Kaepernick’s name appeared in a police report, the quarter back took to Twitter to defend himself after it was said he was being investigated for sexual assault. The incident is said to have occurred last month at the Viceroy Hotel in Miami, pictured . He tweeted: ‘The charges made in the TMZ story and other stories I’ve seen are completely wrong. They make things up about me that never happened. 'I take great pride in who I am and what I do, but I guess sometimes you have to deal with someone who makes things up. 'I want to thank all of the people who have shared their encouraging sentiments. I assure you that your faith is not misplaced.' A police spokesperson said: 'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault.

"By . James  Nye . Lara Spencer and her controversial Cinco de Mayo celebration at ABC Studios in New York City during  Good Morning America on Monday . Good Morning America's Lara Spencer issued a public apology on Tuesday via Twitter after offending Hispanic viewers with her crass celebration of Cinco de Mayo. During a brief segment on Monday morning, the GMA anchor, with margarita in hand and sombrero on her head, announced enthusiastically that today was 'Cinco de drinko'. The outburst caused a backlash from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists who bemoaned the lazy characterization north of the border as a day to get drunk and not as the more sombre time of reflection in Mexico. Issuing her apology just before 6pm on Tuesday, Miss Spencer said that she 'Got carried carried w (sic) excitement over Cinco de Mayo celebration on GMA - sorry.' John Quinones, her colleague at ABC and host of What Would You Do? accepted her Twitter apology saying, 'Thanks, Lara. I know you meant no harm.' Miss Spencer's apology follows that of MSNBC's for their insensitive on-air celebration of the popular Hispanic holiday. Early on Monday the network produced and broadcast a segment that featured a staff member onscreen wearing a sombrero, shaking maracas and taking a swig from a bottle of tequila which was punctuated with 'olé'.

"By . Sarah Dean . A divorced Australian mother who was looking for love online has told of the terrifying day a man she met on a dating site beat her so hard with a baseball bat that her head caved in. Glenn Cable smashed Simone O'Brien, 36, repeatedly at her home in Brisbane in front of her teenage daughters after she broke up with him on September 25, 2012. In just ten minutes she was left with broken bones, her skull shattered, unconscious and fighting for her life. She has now revealed her ongoing struggle, explaining: 'Seeing myself is scary and makes me frustrated'. Traumatised: Simone O'Brien has spoken to Channel Nine's A Current Affair show about former boyfriend Glenn Cable who attacked her with a baseball bat . Tearful: The Australian mother was left disfigured by the life threatening attack on September 25, 2012 . In a moving interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair show tonight, Ms O'Brien revealed: 'I can't get out of bed some days, it just seems endless.' The extent of damage monster 42-year-old Glenn Cable inflicted on the mother-of-three, who had been living in Carseldine, north of Brisbane, can be seen in the interview. Graphic photos show her lying in a hospital bed fighting for her life. After Ms O'Brien broke off their relationship with a phone call, due to growing doubts and the fact Cable had used a dodgy check to pay the deposit on a house they were meant to be buying together, Mr Cable stormed round to her home. At 18:06 she made the call and by 18.16 her daughter Gabby was calling an ambulance to save her mother's life after witnessing the savage attack. Controlling Mr Cable took O'Brien into the bedroom and beat her senseless with a baseball bat that he had - unknowingly to her - stored under her bed. Unconscious: Ms O'Brien, seen here in a hospital bed after the savage attack, was left fighting for her life . Shocking: Titanium plates were used to rebuild her skull and hold it in position . Shattered: Ms O'Brien's skull, shown here in an X Ray, collapsed during the attack . Hopeful: After her attack Ms O'Brien, pictured here in hospital with her son Zach, is rebuilding her life . Her left arm was snapped in two places, her top jaw was shattered so badly that she could barely open her mouth two millimeters, her nose and right cheek bone were broken along with both eye sockets, her skull was completely shattered and she was left blind in one eye. Talking to host Tracy Grimshaw in the interview, brave Ms O'Brien - who refers to Mr Cable as 'the accused' - is seen with a plaster on her head and the scars of her attack are evident. Titanium plates were used to rebuild her skull and hold it in position and every couple of weeks she still flies to Brisbane for ongoing treatment at the Princess Alexandra Brain Rehab Unit. The tearful mother-of-three said: 'It just makes me cringe to think that a person could just hit somebody and keep hitting them.' Radiographer Karen Roper, who lived on the same street as Ms O'Brien, ran into help her and was horrified by what she found. 'I couldn't make out any features at all... her face was mush,' she said. Monster: Glenn Cable, shown here in a picture from his online dating profile,  beat Ms O'Brien repeatedly until her skull caved in . Liar: Ms O'Brien met Mr Cable - who gave her the impression he was well off - online on a popular dating site, shown here, in February 2012 . Ms O'Brien met Mr Cable - who gave her the impression he was well off - online on a popular dating site in February 2012, four years after her divorce from her children's dad. He told her he didn't have any children of his own but this later turned out to be just the first of many lies. She eventually introduced him to her children Gabby, Ashling and Zach but he grew jealous of the time she spent with them and also deleted her friends' numbers from her phone. Paying for everything in the relationship, Ms O'Brien called it off but got back together with Mr Cable when he proposed to her in front of her children. 'That was done because he knew my kids were my world,' she explained, admitting that she knew their engagement didn't feel right. Talking about the result the attack, which happened about 10 months after they met, has had on her life, two years on, Ms O'Brien said: 'I've lost my confidence I'm scared to meet people, I cry a lot.' She said she is speaking out now in the hope that it might save another woman from domestic violence. Mr Cable was jailed in the Supreme Court in Brisbane for 15 years.

Justice Roslyn Atkinson said: 'You did everything you could to destroy that family, but fortunately you haven't.' He will be eligible to apply for parole release on March 24, 2025, Brisbane's The Courier Mail reports.

"By . Associated Press . Kevin Durant has been awarded the NBA's title of Most Valuable Player and fought back tears while thanking his mother for helping him reach this point. The emotional outpouring culminated with a tribute to Wanda Pratt, his mother, when he spoke about the sacrifices she made and the inspiration she provided while raising Durant and his brother in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. 'You made us believe,' Durant said to Pratt, who was at the ceremony in Edmond, Oklahoma. Big moment: Kevin Durant was presented with the Most Valuable Player award at a conference in Oklahoma on Tuesday . Emotional: The Thunder forward paid tribute to his mother Wanda Pratt and called her 'the real MVP' 'Kept us off the street. Put clothes on our backs, food on the table. When you didn't eat, you made sure we ate. You sacrificed for us. You're the real MVP.' Durant explained that Pratt was a single mother with two boys, and though times were tough while growing up, Pratt always thought something better was ahead. Durant said to appreciate moments like these, he often looks back to gain perspective. 'One of the best memories I had is when we moved into our first apartment,' he said as tears streamed down Pratt's face. 'No bed, no furniture, and we just all sat in the living room and hugged each other, `cause that's when we all thought we made it.' Taking it in: Ms Pratt was in the audience as her 25-year-old son accepted his honor with humility, taking time to thank both his relatives and each of his teammates . Hug: Durant went to embrace his mom after he told how they struggled in his childhood and how she would regularly go without in order to make sure that her sons had enough food . In accepting his first MVP award, the Oklahoma City's player took the title from LeBron James who had won the last two MVP awards and four of the previous five. Durant received 119 first-place votes, James finished second with six first-place votes and Blake Griffin of the Los Angeles Clippers was third. Durant, 25, called it 'surreal' and at one point, as he thanked his teammates, he stopped and said, 'I don't know why I'm crying so much.' 'Everything in my life, I had to take it,' Durant said. 'They're not going to give it to you out of sympathy. I wouldn't want it any other way. This was another case, if I wanted to win the MVP, I had to go take it. I felt that this was the year I did that.' 'One of the best memories I had is when we moved into our first apartment. No bed, no furniture, and we just all sat in the living room and hugged each other, `cause that's when we all thought we made it' Humble: Durant called the award 'surreal' and at one point, as he thanked his teammates, he stopped and said, 'I don't know why I'm crying so much' During a speech in which Durant revealed a humility and vulnerability rarely displayed by a professional athlete, he also drew some laughs. 'I could walk in and have a terrible day and I could see Hasheem (Thabeet) smiling at me, at 7-foot-3 with small pants on,' he said. 'That would change my day.' Durant mentioned qualities about each teammate, showing respect for the veterans who challenge him and the rookies who inspire him to do things the right way because they look up to him. 'I go home and I think about that stuff, man,' he said. 'When you've got people behind you, you can do whatever.' Durant won his fourth scoring crown in five years by averaging 32 points. The 6-foot-9 forward helped the Thunder go 59-23, second-best in the league, despite playing much of the season without three-time All-Star Russell Westbrook because of a nagging knee injury. Having his back: Durant mentioned qualities about each teammate, showing respect for the veterans who challenge him and the rookies who inspire him to do things the right way . Gratitude: The 6-foot-9 forward helped the Thunder go 59-23, second-best in the league . 'He's basically put himself in front of everybody else in the league and shown that he's the best player in the world,' Westbrook said at the end of the regular season. James agreed, saying Monday: 'Much respect to him and he deserves it. He had a big-time MVP season.' Durant's run of 41 consecutive games this season with at least 25 points was the third-longest streak in NBA history. 'It was a two-man race, and then toward the end, it was kind of a no-brainer,' Griffin said. James averaged 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds and 6.3 assists while shooting nearly 57 percent from the field. Griffin averaged 24.1 points and 10.1 rebounds. Durant scored at least 40 points 14 times. He also averaged 7.4 rebounds and a career-high 5.5 assists while shooting 50 percent from the field. One and two: Durant beat Miami Heat's LeBron James to the award, who won it the last two years and four of the last five . While Westbrook was out after his most recent knee surgery, Durant averaged 35 points and 6.3 assists as the Thunder went 20-7 and remained among the league's elite. Teammates and opponents say Durant became a more complete player this season. They praised him for improving his court vision, consistently making the extra pass and moving more efficiently without the ball. 'I think we take it for granted,' teammate Nick Collison said. 'To be able to stay on for long periods of time - have to cut hard, catch the ball in the right spot and defend on the other end - is tough to do. To be able to show that shows that he has an edge to him. He doesn't take a night off.' Though Durant's consistency stood out this season, he had several exceptional games. He scored 48 points on January 4 at Minnesota, then scored 48 again two games later at Utah. Making the difference: Durant led the Thunder to the No 2 seed in the Western Conference and regularly scored 'triple doubles' He scored a career-high 54 points in a home win against Golden State on January 17 and two games later scored 46 at home in a victory against Portland. Two games after that, he had a triple-double - 32 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists - in a win at Philadelphia, and he followed that with 41 points in a victory over Atlanta. He scored 51 points at Toronto on March 21 in a staggering 53 minutes and hit the game-winning 3-pointer with 1.7 seconds left in double overtime. 'I put in so much work and so many people helped me,' he said. 'I feel like we all won it. Our equipment guy gave me a hug today and said, ""This is my first MVP,"" and I thought about that. And I said, ""Yeah, this is our first MVP."" I couldn't have done it without the teammates, without the trainer. Everybody. We all just did this together.'","The Oklahoma City Thunder star won his first MVP award after LeBron James earned the title for the past two seasons .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A heartbreaking letter, which was sent by a Titanic crew member to assure his parents he was 'all right' just days before the ship tragically sank, has sold at auction for $34,000. British Leonard Taylor, 18, sent the two-page note to his parents in Blackpool, Lancashire on April 9, 1912, six days before the ship hit an iceberg on its way to New York. Now the hand-written letter - which was found in a box more than 50 years after it was sent - has sold at an auction in Boston, . America for more than ten times the price for which it was originally sold. Titanic crew member Leonard Taylor, 18, wrote a letter to his parents in Blackpool, Lancashire, just days before he was killed when the ship sank in the Atlantic. The letter has now been sold at auction for $34,000 . The two-page letter, sent by Mr Taylor when the ship had docked in Ireland on 9 April 1912, says: 'I am only writing to let you know that I am alright' Mr Taylor's nephew Ken Graham from Poulton, Lancashire, had found the rare letter buried away in a box of his mother's belongings in the late 1960s. He went on to sell the letter 20 years later for around $3,000 - a tenth of the price for which it has now been sold. The 83-year-old said: 'It's all relative and Â£1,800 was a fair amount of money back then. I am just very proud that it is still of interest and that this is a link to my family that will go on and on.' Mr Taylor, who worked as a Turkish bar attendant on board the ship, sent the letter to his parents when the ship docked in Ireland on its doomed maiden voyage. The teenager, who worked as a Turkish bath attendant, was on his first voyage at sea when the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the Atlantic . In the hand-written note, the teenager told his parents: 'I am only writing to let you . know I am all right.' He then described his 'low wages', the 'good food' and how he was 'very comfortable', before signing it off from 'your loving son, Len'. But just days later, the teenager died when the ship sank after hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic. More than 1,500 other people also lost their lives in the tragedy on April 15, 1912. The letter was then buried away for nearly 50 years until Mr Taylor's sister died. It was only then that Mr Graham found the historic letter. The 83-year-old said: 'I remember when I was young, my mother would have people round who had also lost relatives on the Titanic. 'I suppose it was like a support group and they would be meet our house and Mum would cry. 'She often got emotional when she was talking about her brother. 'A lot of time had passed by the time I was born but she did still talk about him from time to time and I could tell she missed him. ""She was definitely proud of him.' Mr Graham later sold the letter at Sotheby's - an art and private sales auctioneers - where it was bought by an American collector. He added: 'The irony of it all is that he drowned but he was a champion swimmer. 'When my mum passed away in the late 1960s, my brother gave me a case of her letters and papers and photographs from the house. 'When I was going through them that I found the letter from the Titanic. 'I had no idea it was there. I suppose my mum must have inherited it from her parents and quite naturally kept it in memory of her brother.'

"By . Ashley Collman . You can't sell just anything on Ebay. The Canadian town of Cape St George got into trouble with the online marketplace yesterday when it posted a listing for a dead whale that washed onto its shores last week. Mayor Peter Fenwick says the town was informed that it was their responsibility to get rid of the rotting 40-foot sperm whale, so like many people trying to get rid of something they didn't want they turned to Ebay. They weren't necessarily interested in making a profit off of the whale, Fenwick said, but rather just finding anyone willing to take it off their hands. Any takers? The town of Cape St George in Newfoundland, Canada is trying to get rid of a 40-foot sperm whale that washed ashore last week . But as of Monday afternoon, the advertisement had been pulled down by the site which outlaws the selling of animals, dead or alive, on their site. Fenwick was also informed by Environment Canada that selling the endangered sperm whale carcass violates the federal act protecting species at risk. By the time the advertisement had been pulled down, the highest bid surpassed $2,000. Fenwick says they looked into moving the whale with a 50-foot boat, but that the vessel wasn't strong enough. The says they can't afford any other method of disposing the whale. Now he hopes the bidders are still interested in the whale. The city is willing to give the whale away for free as long as someone will take responsibility for towing it away. No luck: The town initially tried selling the carcass on Ebay, but that listing was taken down by the site for violating their policy against selling animals - alive or dead. Bids reached over $2,000 before it was taken down . 'We’ll be glad to talk to them about giving them the whale,' Fenwick told CTV News. 'We’re hoping that’s not illegal.' Fenwick says the whale hasn't started decomposing yet, but believes that's because it's still partially covered in ocean water in near freezing temperatures. The mayor would like to see the whale gone before that though, telling the Toronto Sun that 'the smell of rotting fat is horrible'. This is the fourth whale that has washed up this Spring in Newfoundland. When two blue whales washed up last week, the Royal Ontario Museum offered to presrve the marine animals .","A 40-foot sperm whale washed up on the shores of Cape St Geroge in Newfoundland last week .

A Texas woman shot in the leg during a 1998 terrorist attack on tourists in Yemen told her harrowing story to a jury at the trial of an Egyptian cleric Tuesday, saying she didn't know whether she was about to be freed or killed when a kidnapper announced: 'It's goodbye to you all!' Margaret Thompson, walking with a limp, took the witness stand at the trial of Mustafa Kamel Mustafa as the government drew close to finishing its presentation of evidence. Prosecutors are expected to rest Wednesday after the testimony of a second one-time American hostage, Mary Quin. Thompson described how her vacation in late December 1998 became a nightmare when vehicles carrying Thompson and 15 other tourists were overrun by gun-toting Muslim extremists. A courtroom sketch shows Abu Hamza at the Federal Court house in Lower Manhattan, New York. Hamza is a disabled Egyptian Islamic preacher who was extradited from Britain on charges he conspired to support Al-Qaeda, in part by trying to create a training camp in Oregon 15 years ago . Abu Hamza - seen here in 2003 - denies 11 terror charges related to the taking of hostages in Yemen in 1998, supporting Al Qaeda, advocating jihad in Afghanistan and planning to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon . She said a kidnapper told the hostages at one point: 'It's goodbye to you all!' Asked by a prosecutor what she thought he meant, she said: 'I hoped it meant that they were getting ready to release us, but I feared it meant that they thought we were going to die.' Thompson, a retired information specialist for petroleum companies who worked at the time in London, said the hostage takers held them overnight before they were marched to an area with three parallel sand berms as gunfire, first distant, got closer. She said the hostage takers seemed to be shooting between the legs of the hostages at one point and, at another, had pushed a woman to the ground before firing around her head without hitting her. Authorities have said the terrorists used hostages as shields in the attack. Thompson said the kidnappers seemed to be going down the row of hostages, demanding to know who was American, when the drama reached a crescendo, with gunfire raging around them until she was struck in the left leg by a bullet. 'I've been shot!' she recalled saying as a fellow hostage, a woman, handed her a scarf and told her to lie still. Hamza, 56, is expected to start testifying in his own defence on Wednesday . 'Very quickly after that the Yemen soldiers appeared from the other side of the berm,' she said. 'What I remember was a whole line of them. I saw their military berets come up over the top of the berm.' Thompson said she was taken to a hospital in Aden, Yemen, for several days before she was transferred to London. She recalled one journey in a helicopter in which two of the four hostages who were killed by the hostage takers were covered in a blanket at her feet. Mustafa is charged with conspiring to support terrorists by supplying a satellite phone to the Yemen hostage takers and by trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon. He has pleaded not guilty. He is expected to testify Wednesday afternoon.","Texas woman Margaret Thompson was one of 16 Western tourists snatched by terrorists in the Yemen in December 1998 .

An Iranian conman allegedly duped ten wannabe models into being his sex slaves after pretending to be an oil tycoon with an enviable list of contacts in the fashion industry. The 50-year-old, known as Shoja S, reportedly fathered seven children with the women after convincing them all to live at his Spanish palace for three years with the promise of making them catwalk stars. The European and Asian girls, aged between 19 and 24, soon realised they were being conned, but were unable to leave after allegedly being subjected to emotional and physical abuse. An Iranian conman duped ten wannabe models into being his sex slaves after pretending to be an oil tycoon who could make them catwalk stars (file picture posed by model) 'They were always controlled and supervised by him,' it was reported by Spanish newspaper ABC, according to The Local. 'He threatened to harm them if they didn't tell him everything they were doing.' One of the women has now filed a lawsuit against Shoja S for allegedly forcing her family to pay the €6,500 (£5,300) rent for his mansion in Marbella where they were housed.

"By . Wills Robinson . Resignation: Yingluck Shinawatra has been forced to step down after Thailand's Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power . Thailand's prime minister has been forced to resign after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abusing her power, pushing the country deeper into political turmoil. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, 46, was charged with abusing her authority by transferring a senior civil servant to another position in 2011. The court ruled that the transfer was carried out with a 'hidden agenda' to benefit her politically powerful family and, therefore, violated the constitution, an accusation she has denied. 'Transferring government officials must be done in accordance with moral principle,' the court said in its ruling. 'Transferring with a hidden agenda is not acceptable.' It is not immediately clear who will become the new acting prime minister. The ruling also forced out nine Cabinet members who the court said were complicit in the transfer of Thawil Pliensri from National Security Council Chief to a role in Yingluck's office. The verdict marks the latest dramatic twist in Thailand's long-running political crisis. It is a victory for Yingluck's opponents who for the past six months have been engaged in violent street protests demanding she step down to make way for an interim unelected leader. But it does little to resolve Thailand's political crisis as it leaves the country in limbo - and primed for more clashes. Since November, more than 20 have been killed and hundreds injured in demonstrations. The ruling also casts doubt on whether new elections planned for July will take place, which would anger Yingluck's mostly rural supporters who have called for a major rally in Bangkok on Saturday. Reaction: Anti-government supporters celebrate after hearing the news that Prime Minister Yingluck Sinawatra was forced to step down following a court ruling . Coverage: The judge, sitting in Bangkok, read out the verdict live on television . It also remains far from clear whether her opponents will be able to achieve other key demands, including creating a reform council overseen by a leader of their choice who will carry out various steps to rid the country of corruption and what they say is money politics, including alleged vote-buying. The campaign against Yingluck has been the latest chapter in Thailand's political upheaval that began when her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted by a 2006 military coup. It came after protestors accused him of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for the constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Controversial: She was charged with abusing her authority in 2011 when she moved a civil servant to another position. Her supporters claim she has been the target of a 'judicial coup' Raising a glass: Protestors, who have been filling the streets and calling for Yingluck to be ousted for the last six months, toast their 'victory' The Constitutional Court in 2007 made . a landmark ruling dissolving Thaksin's original Thai Rak Thai party for . fraud in a 2006 election, and banned its executives from politics for . five years. Thaksin went into self-imposed exile in 2008 to escape a . two-year jail sentence for conflict of interest while prime minister. Thaksin's allies in late 2007 handily . won the first post-coup election, but the Constitutional Court in 2008 . kicked out two successive pro-Thaksin prime ministers. A coalition government then cobbled . together by the opposition Democrat Party had to use the army to put . down pro-Thaksin demonstrations in 2010 that left more than 90 people . dead in street battles, but Yingluck and her Pheu Thai party won a . sweeping majority in a mid-2011 general election. Yingluck's fortunes plunged when her . party's lawmakers last year used shady legislative tactics to try . to ram through a law that would have given an amnesty to political . offenders of the previous eight years, including Thaksin.","Her stepping down pushes the country deeper into political turmoil .

"By . Helen Pow . Two fishermen whose boat capsized off the coast of Florida have been rescued after 17 hours at sea. Justyn Bradley and Cory Bowman were fishing off Jupiter Inlet near Fort Pierce Sunday when a 12-foot wave toppled their 21-foot boat. The men clung to the bobbing vessel throughout the night, as a plane went over but didn't spot them. But they were thankfully rescued by the Coast Guard and a civilian boat Monday morning. Scroll down for video . Saved: Justyn Bradley, pictured, and his friend Cory Bowman were rescued Monday morning after their boat capsized off the coast of Florida . 'It was just strong will and knowing that you will be rescued,' Bradley told WPBF of surviving the ordeal. 'Our phones are gone, radio gone, everything. You've got nothing.' According to Bradley, the giant wave capsized their vessel 'in a matter of seconds.' 'It was a sheer wall [of water],' Bradley said. 'It broke over the boat. There was no time to think of what happened. It rolled the boat instantly.' He said he was thrown 'about 30 feet off the boat.' 'My buddy went down and we came up and surfaced,' he added to WPBF. Capsized: The Coast Guard captured the two men on their capsized boat, pictured . Neither were injured thankfully, and they managed to save a small cooler containing around three days' worth of food and water, which they credit with their survival. They then scrambled to get on top of the capsized boat and began the long wait for help to arrive. The two were on the boat for some 17 hours as it floated from Jupiter to Fort Pierce. Fortunately, the two men had told their wives exactly where they planned to fish during the trip so when they didn't return as planned Sunday evening, their concerned families alerted the Coast Guard. 'We had to go through a whole night where a plane came close and left, and didn't [see us] and left,' Bradley told WPBF. Around 8:30 Monday morning, a Coast Guard air crew spotted them. They were about 50 miles off the coast from where they set out. Map: The fishermen launched at Jupiter Inlet and were rescued at Force Pierce .

Around the same time, a civilian boat also spotted Bradley and Bowman and came over to help. Coast Guard cameras captured the good Samaritans pull them to safety. Miraculously, the friends escaped without injury, though they were treated for exhaustion and dehydration. 'Thanks to everyone involved,' Bradley told the station. 'If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be here today.' He added a word of warning to other anglers: 'Let people know where you're going, let them know what your plan is. Outside of that, you got nothing... and be in contact with them, in case something like this happens so you can be found.'","Justyn Bradley and Cory Bowman were fishing off Jupiter Inlet near Fort Pierce, Florida, Sunday when a 12-foot wave toppled their 21-foot boat .

"By . David Mccormack . A 20-year-old man is suing Nassau County Police Department for what he claims was an unprovoked attack following a routine traffic stop. Kyle Howell from Westbury, New York, suffered a broken nose, bone fractures near both eyes and facial nerve damage as a result of the April 25 incident. His lawyer has submitted surveillance video from a local shop which he claims shows his client being viciously attacked by two officers. Scroll down for video . Kyle Howell from Westbury, New York, suffered a broken nose, bone fractures near both eyes and facial nerve damage as a result of the April 25 incident . Court records show Howell was charged with assaulting the officers, tampering with physical evidence and resisting arrest, among others. Police alleged in felony complaints that Howell tried to eat a bag of marijuana and punched and kicked them after ‘a violent struggle ensued as officers attempted to retrieve the evidence’ and arrest him. Police also alleged potential evidence was partially destroyed by the time they subdued Howell, who caused injuries to the officers that required hospital treatment. They also charged him with marijuana possession and criminal possession of a controlled substance after reportedly finding a small bag allegedly containing cocaine during a search of Howell's 2002 Honda. Security video footage shows one of the two officers rush to the drivers seat when Howell is sat and start kicking and punching him in such a manner that the cars rocks . ‘I remember getting a knee to my face and after that, I don’t really remember much. I was hit in the head so many times,’ Howell told CBS New York. ‘They were telling me to spit something out of my mouth.’ Howell denies that claims. He was release on $10,000 bond following a hospital arraignment. Attorney Amy Marion filed a legal claim against the county on Monday seeking unspecified damages. It claims that Howell was the victim of false arrest, excessive police force, and deprived of his civil rights, including by Nassau University Medical Center employees who concealed illegal police behavior. After seeing the video, prosecutors have launched a probe and police internal affairs investigators also are looking into the officers' actions. Eleven days since the incident and Kyle Howell's eyes remained bloodshot during a news conference on Tuesday in Garden City, N.Y. At Tuesday press conference, Kyle was joined by his father and mother, Donovan and Joan Howell, and attorney Steven Gaitman . ‘We've seen this video and have been investigating both the actions of the officers as well as the charges that the police filed against Mr. Howell,’ said Nassau District Attorney Kathleen Rice. The officers involved have been identified as Vincent Logiudice and Basil Gomez, reports Newsday. Both officers are on modified duty where they don't have contact with the public and can't earn overtime pending the outcome of the internal affairs probe, Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter said. Nassau County police have not commented, citing pending litigation. Howell conceded he was arrested twice in 2012 and pleaded guilty to petty larceny and marijuana possession. Howell is then dragged from the vehicle and charged with assaulting the officers, tampering with physical evidence and resisting arrest .","Kyle Howell from Westbury, New York, was pulled over on April 25 during a routine traffic stop .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A McDonald's owner who has 'ketchup in the veins' has proved he's lovin' it more than most - with a collection of 75,000 pieces of the restaurant's memorabilia. Mike Fountaine - whose collection spreads over more than 7,000sq ft at his home in Pennysylvania, America - owns more than 1,000 McDonald's cups, 11,700 lapel pins and nearly every Happy Meal toy the chain has produced. The 60-year-old's collection also includes uniforms, buttons and old displays - as well as a giant figure of the fast food chain's mascot, Ronald McDonald. Scroll down for video . He's lovin' it: Michael Fountaine, 60, from Pennysylvania, has spent almost half a century amassing his 75,000-piece collection of McDonald's memorabilia . 'Ketchup in the veins': Mr Fountaine poses with the McDonald mascot, Ronald McDonald, which is stored in one the nine rooms which the McDonad's owner has filled with memorabilia . The restaurant owner, who began a career with McDonald's as a teenager aged 15 in 1968, has nearly every Happy Meal toy, as well as 1,000 cups and glasses . But despite Mr Fountaine's collection already having 398 categories, the restaurant owner has no intention of slowing down - and says he still . adds more than . 100 items to the horde each month. He said: 'This collection means everything to me, it is my life's work. Thousands and thousands of hours have been spent assembling this collection and taking pride to display it extremely nicely. 'I'm very proud to be a part of the McDonald's family. We have a saying here when you love the business that you have 'ketchup in your veins', which I certainly do.' Mr Fountaine started working on the grill at McDonald's in 1968 - the same month the Big Mac was introduced - when he was 15. He started collecting items from the fast food chain one year later, after he was given a lapel pin to celebrate his first year of service. Now Mr Fountaine has so much stuff, he had to build a 2,400sq ft barn to . house it all - even though he already had nine rooms and two miles of shelving filled with his collection. Mr Fountaine has worked at McDonald's for nearly 50 years, first becoming an assistant manager in 1972 at a restaurant in Rockville, Maryland, pictured . The 60-year-old, pictured right taking the keys to his first McDonald's restaurant, now runs two franchised McDonald's restaurants of his own . Mr Fountaine's storage system also includes a 'secret room', to add an air of mystery to his collection. He said: .

'I also have a room containing more than 1,000 McDonald's cups and glasses from throughout its history. 'In total my collection takes up around 7,000sq ft on my property.' The McDonald's fanatic has spent hours meticulously arranging his items, ensuring they are put on display in the right order and category. Mr Fountaine says his display will only keep on growing - with around 100 items being added to the collection each month . He is unable to put an price tag on the collection but says thousands of man hours have gone into amassing and cataloging the haul. He said: 'My table of content has 398 . categories including buttons, lapel pins, cups, uniforms, happy meal . displays and equipment.' Fortunately for Mr Fountaine, his girlfriend Susan Wirth enjoys living with the collection too. She . said: 'On our first date Michael and I went out to dinner and then he . showed me his collection.

He says customers comment that it's the 'most beautiful McDonald's restaurant they have ever seen . But it's not just the collection in which Mr Fountaine takes pride. His restaurant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, boasts a cherry wood fireplace and chandeliers. He said: 'People say it's the most beautiful McDonald's restaurant they have ever seen. I wanted to make it first class all the way and at lunch time it's always full. 'I installed a musical playground for children, of which there are less than ten in the world. I wanted to make it my trophy restaurant.' In 1986, Mr Fountaine was presented with the Ronald McDonald award for his local community service work. He hopes to turn his collection into a museum to help raise money for Ronald McDonald charities. He said: 'By charging admission to see the collection any money raised could go to Ronald McDonald House charities to help kids around the world who have cancer.' McDonald's archivist, Mike Bullingdon, said: 'In my opinion Mike has the most encompassing collection in the world, it's in pristine shape, they're one of a kind pieces, it's just awesome.'","Mike Fountaine has the world's largest collection of McDonald's memorabilia .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Women are not allowed to serve in ground close combat roles, but the ban could now be reviewed earlier than planned . Women could be rushed into frontline combat roles to plug gaps in the armed forces, a Defence Minister has suggested. The government is ‘seriously’ considering bringing forward a review into lifting the ban on female personnel serving in combat roles due in 2018. Tory minister Lord Astor said it could be held earlier to improve the diversity of the forces ‘maintain operational effectiveness’ at a time of spending cuts. Britain is lagging behind other major countries in refusing to allow women to serve in in the Army, Navy and RAF in ground close combat roles on the frontline. Australia will open all units to women at the beginning of 2016, and the US last year removed its official ban on women in combat roles. Under EU law, the UK government must review the ban by 2018. But speaking in the House of Lords, Lord Astor revealed the decision could be made much earlier to help the forces cope with reduce troop numbers. He told peers: ‘While the nature, scope and timing of the review have not yet been determined, we are considering whether to bring it forward, recognising the need both to improve the diversity of the workforce across defence and to maintain operational effectiveness.’ Previous reviews in 2002 and 2010 recommended women continue to be banned from the frontline. But Lord Astor said: ‘We are reviewing seriously a date earlier than November 2018. ‘The Ministry of Defence remains fully committed to treating everyone fairly and properly, whatever their gender, ethnicity or other characteristic. We will continue working to eliminate any form of discrimination.’ Women can currently serve as engineers, intelligence officers, medics, fighter pilots and dog handlers. At the weekend it emerged three women have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy. Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alexandra Olsson and Penny Thackray have completed months of specialised training to earn their ‘Dolphins’ – the clasp worn by qualified submariners – becoming the first women in the 110-year history of the Navy's Submarine Service. Lieutenants Maxine Stiles, Alexandra Olsson and Penny Thackray have made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy . But during a debate in the House of Lords there were cross-party calls to go further and allow women to serve in combat roles. Tory peer Lord Selkirk, a minister in the Thatcher and Major governments, said: ‘If women have the inclination, aptitude, ability and strength required, is it not time for the Government to consider following the examples of such countries as Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and, not least, the United States of America, all of which either have allowed women to take their place in combat roles on the front line or are in the process of doing so?’ Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall said allowing women into combat roles is 'something that we need to be considering seriously' Labour defence spokesman Lord Rosser said: ‘Serious consideration needs to be given to the further roles that women can play, including serving in front-line combat, since we need to maximise the talent and expertise available.’ Last month the head of the Army said suggested women should be allowed to fight in combat roles. Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall raised the prospect that the Army may ease its last restrictions on women taking their place in front-line fighting. He told the Army’s Soldier magazine: ‘We are in a minority of armies now in that respect. ‘It’s definitely something that we need to be considering seriously but we need to go about this with great care, especially with all the other changes going on. ‘This isn’t just about getting more females into the 30 per cent of roles that are combat trades but getting more of them into the Army.’ Troop numbers are to be cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, with the shortfall to be made up by the recruitment of 35,000 reservists. The Army currently has 7,500 women soldiers, who serve with the artillery and engineers in front-line roles. Women fly as fighter pilots as well as taking more traditional female duties as medics and intelligence officers.","Review due in 2018 could be brought forward to lift ban on combat roles .

"By . Hugo Duncan . The latest figures from the OEDC back George Osborne's economic plan, showing 100,000 jobs are being added every month . George Osborne yesterday received a boost from a respected international watchdog, which declared he was right to stick to his economic plan. The Chancellor’s strategy was backed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as a separate report said that firms are taking on about 100,000 staff a month. The figure from research group Markit – which equates to about 3,300 workers a day or 1.2million a year – would push employment to a record high of more than 31.5million by the General Election in May next year. The OECD said it expects output in the UK to grow by 3.2 per cent this year – up from the 2.4 per cent predicted in November. That is faster than any country in the Group of Seven major industrialised nations. Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD, said the recovery will continue to build. In a blow to Labour, he added: . ‘There were millions of voices rising in the UK saying change course. In the end the British Government was proven right.’ Mr Osborne said the latest forecasts were ‘a real vote of confidence in the UK’s long term economic plan’ but warned that risks remain. ‘Britain is coming back and our long term economic plan is working,’ a Treasury spokesman said. ‘But we can’t take the recovery for granted. ‘The impact of the Great Recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad based recovery are now in place. The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the  plan that is laying those foundations.’ The report is a further blow to Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have consistently criticised the Chancellor’s austerity plans only to see the recovery take off. Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, welcomed ‘a growing tide of better economic news for the UK and a growing headache for the Labour Party and their narrative on the economy’. Danny Alexander (left) welcomed the figures and said the news represented a 'headache' for Ed Miliband (right) and the Labour Party as they focus on the cost of living crisis . Labour has put the ‘cost of living crisis’ at the heart of its economic message. But with inflation now at 1.6 per cent, its lowest level for nearly five years, and wages picking up, the squeeze on family finances looks to be coming to an end. Ministers welcomed the OECD’s prediction that business investment will pick up this year, making the recovery far less reliant on the housing market and consumer spending. Mr Alexander said: ‘I have always said that strong business investment is a pre-requisite for a sustainable and balanced recovery. 'That business investment should be further helped by the forecast that the UK will be the fastest growing G7 economy in 2014. ‘There is still more to do but the improving economic outlook is undoubtedly a great help to families and businesses across the country.’ Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted that wages in the private sector will be rising by more than 3 per cent by the end of the year compared with just over 1 per cent now. ‘Pay growth is likely to rise over the coming 12 months,’ he said. Michael Saunders, a London-based economist at global banking giant Citi, added: ‘All the signs are that Britain is booming.’ Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘The UK economic recovery shows no signs of running out of steam. With the outlook brightening, the pace of job creation hit a record high.’","OEDC says Osborne's plan is working and he was right to stick to it .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A man was allegedly slashed across the face with a scythe during a ‘shocking’ brawl between rivalling gipsy families outside a plush four-star hotel in a ‘peaceful and tranquil area’. A group of travellers had been drinking inside the Hilton Treetops Hotel in Aberdeen, Scotland, when the bitter row broke out on Saturday. One of the men was allegedly slashed with a scythe after the argument spilled outside into the car park of the hotel.

Hotel staff had to call the police in order to split the opposing parties up as other guests watched the scuffle unfold in shock. A spokesman for the hotel said: ‘We can confirm police were called by Hilton Aberdeen Treetops following an incident in the hotel car park involving individuals who had visited the bar. ‘On becoming aware of the situation, hotel team members acted swiftly and the matter was dealt with by the authorities, with whom we continue to liaise.’ Councillor Martin Greig said the Hilton Treetops is in a quiet area of town and said it was shocking that such an incident had taken place. He said: ‘This is a peaceful and tranquil area and to hear of such a shocking crime it is extremely upsetting. ‘The hotel is much respected business. ‘This is mainly a residential area and the community enjoys relatively low levels of crime.’ Aberdeen City Council has had a number of problems with illegal travellers’ camps and is looking to set up a by-law to combat the problem.","Man, 34, suffers face and leg injuries following assault outside Hilton hotel .

"By . James Rush . An international panel of experts are to re-examine all of the data gathered in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 to ensure search crews have been looking in the right place. Government officials from Australia, China and Malaysia today pledged not to give up searching for the aircraft that disappeared almost two months ago. They met in the Australian capital to discuss the next step in the search for the missing flight, which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia. Scroll down for video . Australia's Transport Minister Warren Truss (centre) speaks during a press conference with Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein (left) and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantang (second right) after talks about missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Experts are to re-examine information gathered so far . Officials met in the Australian capital to discuss the next step in the search for the missing flight, which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia . The area became the focus of the hunt after a team of analysts calculated the plane's likeliest flight path based on satellite and radar data. Starting Wednesday, that data will be re-analyzed and combined with all information gathered so far in the search, which has not turned up a single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million square kilometers (1.8 million square miles) of ocean. 'We've got to this stage of the process where it's very sensible to go back and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered, all of the analysis that has been done and make sure there's no flaws in it, the assumptions are right, the analysis is right and the deductions and conclusions are right,' Angus Houston, head of the search operation, told reporters in Canberra. Investigators have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A weekslong search for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk. 'Unfortunately, all of that effort has found nothing,' Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss said. 'We've been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one, but in practice, that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft.' Houston has warned the underwater search is likely to continue for up to a year. Houston and Truss met with Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantang in Canberra on Monday to map out the next steps of the underwater search, which will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre patch of seafloor .

A map shows the possible path of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as released by the Malaysian Transport Ministry last week . Houston and Truss met with Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantang in Canberra on Monday to map out the next steps of the underwater search, which will focus on a 60,000 square kilometer (23,000 square mile) patch of seafloor. Financial responsibility is a major focus of the talks and Truss has seemed to open the door to Boeing, which produced the 777-200ER jet, and engine maker Rolls Royce, to contribute financially. 'They also have a vested interested in what happened on MH370 so they can be confident about the quality of their product, or take remedial action if there was some part of the aircraft that contributed to this accident,' he told reporters. 'So, I think we will be looking for increasing involvement from the manufacturers, and their host countries.' Officials are contacting governments and private contractors to find out whether they have specialized equipment that can dive deeper than the Bluefin-21 .

Last week, Malaysia released its most comprehensive account yet of what happened to Flight MH370, detailing the route the plane probably took as it veered off course and the confusion that followed. U.S. President Barack Obama had publicly promised to commit more assets, but government sources say the United States is keen to begin passing on the costs of providing the expensive sonar equipment the officials say they are trying to source. Officials are contacting governments and private contractors to find out whether they have specialized equipment that can dive deeper than the Bluefin-21, an unmanned sub that has spent weeks scouring the seafloor in an area where sounds consistent with a plane's black box were detected in early April. The Bluefin has been limited by the fact that it can dive only to depths of 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) - and parts of the search zone are likely deeper than that. Adding to the difficulties is the fact no one really knows exactly how deep the water in the search area is. 'I don't know that anyone knows for sure, because it's never been mapped,' Truss said, adding that detailed mapping of the seafloor will be a key focus of the next phase of the search. In addition to deeper diving capabilities, the new equipment will be able to send information back to crews in real time. The Bluefin's data can be downloaded only once it returns to the surface after each of its 16-hour dives. It will likely take another two months before any new equipment is in the water, Truss said. The Bluefin will continue to be used in the meantime, though its search is currently on hold while the Ocean Shield, which has the sub on board, is taking on supplies at a base in Western Australia. The 21-foot-long autonomous underwater vehicle is designed for deep-sea surveying and is capable of staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling, scanning regions at a speed of two to three knots. Shaped like a torpedo, it can operate almost up to three miles underneath the waves and is equipped with a variety of sonar and cameras that can search and map 40 square miles of sea floor per day. Bluefin-21 has a depth rating of 4,500m, meaning it has been at its limit in the Indian Ocean search zone. Bluefin 21 is designed for deep-sea surveying and is capable of staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling . Searchers usually programme the propeller-driven vehicle with the coordinates for a back-and-forth search that has been compared to mowing a lawn. First, the vehicle will survey the area with side-scan sonar. The sonar readings are stored in the robot's removable memory, and retrieved once the sub comes back up to the surface. If the sonar scan turns up objects of interest, the Bluefin-21 would be refitted with high-resolution cameras for a visual survey. The robot would have to dive closer to the seafloor for a concentrated survey of the target area. One of the Bluefin-21's most recent claims to fame was its role in the search for wreckage from Amelia Earhart's airplane, which disappeared in the Pacific in 1937. Bluefin Robotics says its AUV can also be used for archaeology, oceanography, mine countermeasures, and unexploded ordinance.","Government officials met in Australia to discuss next step in MH370 search .

"By . James Chapman . The ‘Great British Revival’ is at stake in the general election a year today, David Cameron warned last night. With a poll showing Ukip doing the Tories serious damage, the Prime Minister urged supporters to stick with the Government’s economic plans. Otherwise, he said, the Labour Party would take charge and spend and borrow more. A poll has shown that Ukip, under Nigel Farage, pictured, is damaging the Conservatives - with just a year to the general election . Tory strategists accept that many of their supporters will back Ukip as a protest in this month’s European poll – and must be brought back into the fold before the general election. An analysis by YouGov showed that 42 per cent of those who voted Conservative in 2010 plan to back Ukip in the European elections this month. Of 9,000 people questioned by the polling group, almost 2,000 said they would vote for the anti-European party if a general election were held now. Tory defectors outnumbered by three to two the Labour and Lib Dem defectors together. YouGov’s Peter Kellner said: ‘Farage should not claim that his party is winning votes from Labour on anything like the scale that it is taking them from the Conservatives.’ A new Survation opinion poll for the Daily Mirror puts Labour just one point ahead of the Tories . Labour, under Ed Miliband, pictured,  have done 'little to allay the fear that they would spend more than the country can afford' if they are triumphant at the next general election . The Prime Minister has told his MPs to brag about the success of policies aimed  at women. At a private party meeting, David Cameron said the  Government had been ‘underselling’ its policies directed  at helping women. Since 2010, the number of women on . FTSE100 company boards had increased to 20.7 per cent and the gender pay gap was ‘almost eliminated for full-time workers under 40’, Women’s Minister Nicky Morgan told MPs. The number of women  running small businesses had risen from 14 per cent to 20 per cent under the Coalition, Miss Morgan added. Yet despite the progress made, Mr Cameron told MPs and peers that ‘we have been underselling this ourselves’ in terms of women’s policies. Former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, now a leading pollster, says Mr Cameron remains his party’s ‘biggest electoral asset’ but time is running out to persuade voters that he and his colleagues are on their side. He argues that Ukip is ‘an ideal conduit for the blowing of mid-term raspberries’ but those who want their vote to count in 2015 will have to choose between the main parties. Mr Cameron, who addressed MPs and peers with his chief election strategist Lynton Crosby last night, said: ‘The general election is one year away. For each of those 365 days, the Conservatives have one clear message: we are the team that is turning Britain around. ‘We have set out a serious, long-term economic plan: reducing the deficit, cutting income taxes, backing business, capping welfare, reducing immigration, delivering the best schools and skills – and that plan is working for families across our country.’ He said the deficit had been cut by over a third, the economy was one of the fastest growing in the developed world and 1.5million more people were in work. He added: ‘Immigration is down. Welfare has been capped. And something I’m very proud of: today 250,000 fewer children are being taught in failing schools. All this means more peace of mind for families, more young people with the chance to get on in life, and more financial security. ‘From the ashes of the Great Recession we are building a Great British Revival. All this is at stake a year from now. Labour’s only plans are for more spending, more borrowing, more debt – more of the same that got us into the mess.’ Toward the end of the last parliament a cartoon showed a lady asking her husband: ‘Is it possible to be sick of an election before it’s started?’ Many will have the same thought long before we choose our next government, 365 days from today.For David Cameron, though, the year will feel terrifyingly short. Last night the PM reassured his troops that they can take on Ukip – the biggest worry for many in the party – by reminding voters that only the Conservatives can deliver a referendum and real change. Lord Ashcroft, pictured, believes it will take more than 12 months to change many voters view that the Tories are not on their side . Grumpy though some Tories are, they know Cameron remains their biggest electoral asset. They also know there is no alternative; as my polling has shown, Boris is popular but no silver bullet.Cameron remains more popular than Ed Miliband and the Conservatives are more trusted than Labour to run the economy. The Tories hope these things will matter more to voters as the decision gets closer. Meanwhile, jitters will grow if Labour’s lead persists. It will take more than 12 months to change many voters’ view that the Tories are not on their side. In the meantime, they must show more clearly what a national recovery could mean. My polling has found people are more likely to think a Tory government would benefit Britain than to believe it would be good for them. Nick Clegg will also feel the year rushing by. To most voters the Lib Dems have betrayed their principles, or sunk without trace, or both. Achieving office has also cost them the votes of the none-of-the-above brigade, probably for good. That means the Lib Dems must define a national purpose for themselves. This – though Tories blame them for thwarting their most beloved schemes – is proving a struggle. They must hold on to as many as they can of the 57 seats they won in 2010 on perhaps half their former national vote share; perhaps more than any other party, their fate lies in the marginals. Miliband will be counting down the days more impatiently. Labour’s current lead would see him comfortably into Downing Street. But he knows governing parties tend to recover ground in the months before an election. He needs to show Labour have learned their lessons on the economy and that he has more to offer than complaints about how expensive everything is. Labour have done little to allay the fear that they would spend more than the country can afford and undo what progress the coalition has made on things like tackling benefit dependency. For Nigel Farage, too, May 7, 2015, cannot come soon enough. For Ukip, European elections bring attention by the truckload, but they have always marked the high points of success. Though an ideal conduit for the blowing of mid-term raspberries, Farage will need to explain why Ukip are worth voting for when more is at stake. Stickers are already printed bearing the legend ‘Don’t blame me, I voted UKIP’. Fine, for those who want to opt out of the decision. But what to say to people who want their vote to count? All the parties have to contend with public weariness and cynicism – not just about the behaviour of politicians but over whether politics itself can do much to change things. This threatens the established parties: in a world where governments seem to have so little power to solve problems and improve our lot, what does it matter who is in charge? Conservative supporters know Cameron remains their 'biggest electoral asset' and they also know there is no alternative. Lord Ashcroft's polling suggests that despite the popularity of Boris Johnson, pictured, he is 'no silver bullet'. How should the parties react to this attitude? Like this: show a bit of humility, keep things in proportion and treat the voters as grown-ups. Don’t overclaim, either about what you have done or what you can do. Don’t tell people you’re going to change their world or that your opponents would shatter it. Talk to people about the things they care about, rather than repeating what you hope they can be made to care about. For the voters, it is going to be a long year. The first thing they will need persuading of is that it matters who wins.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . More than 50,000 carers will have to quit their jobs to look after loved ones with dementia this year, research shows. Dementia care costs businesses in England £1.6billion a year and 66,000 employees have to adjust their work schedule to make time for their caring responsibilities. Public Health England and leading health charity, the Alzheimer’s Society, have joined forces in a major campaign to encourage the public to tackle one of the nation’s biggest health issues. Scroll down for video . Research shows more than 65,000 workers are having to change their schedule to care for someone with dementia. Picture posed by actors . The Dementia Friends initiative, which has also been backed by some of Britain’s biggest stars, aims to show that it will take a whole society response to enable people with the condition to live well. Celebrities including Amanda Holden, Ray Winstone, Chris Martin, Paul O’Grady, Simon Pegg and Alesha Dixon feature in a video, urging the public to become ‘dementia friends’, as they perform the Beatles classic, With A Little Help From My Friends. Author Sir Terry Pratchett, who has Alzheimer’s, is also involved. And yesterday Sir Paul McCartney was announced as an ambassador for the campaign. Dementia Friends has released research which shows signs of businesses being more willing to help with dementia care. A report compiled by the Centre for Economics and Business Research for the campaign showed that most firms have already provided or would consider providing support to carers of someone living with dementia. Nearly nine out of ten businesses polled (87 per cent) have or would consider letting carers work flexible hours, while more than half of businesses would consider providing a range of support to dementia carers such as flexible working hours (63 per cent), extended leave (61 per cent), working from different locations (53 per cent) plus counselling and support (51 per cent). Around 18 per cent would consider paying for respite care. Popstar Alesha Dixon and actor Ray Winstone feature in a new video for the Dementia Friends initiative, in which a number of celebrities urge the public to help those suffering from the condition . The report also shows the average person diagnosed with dementia has been in their current job for at least nine years. The relatively rapid progression of the disease means that it is inevitable that many people affected while still working will have to take early retirement. Researchers found that carers are struggling to fit care duties into their lives as they spend 28 hours a week on average caring for loved ones. The majority (51 per cent) are also working; employed carers spend an average of 18 hours a week caring on top of their jobs. More than one in four firms (27 per cent) have had an employee who needed to make adjustments to work schedules to care for a dementia sufferer. Author Sir Terry Pratchett, who has Alzheimer's, is also involved in the new campaign . Despite the survey showing employers’ willingness to help, Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said more must be done. ‘The fact that thousands of workers in this country are juggling caring responsibilities without support and understanding from their employers is frightening,’  he said. ‘Society is not yet fully supportive of people with dementia, either in the workplace or in everyday life. ‘I would love to see everyone become Dementia Friends and make life that little bit easier for people with dementia.’ Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: ‘Our research shows that there is a real public desire to do more to help people with dementia live well in society. ‘This campaign will help people understand the issues faced and give them the information they need to support people in their community with dementia.’","More than 65,000 people are now juggling work and care for sufferer .

A man accused of smashing a beer bottle through a car window and injuring a schoolgirl is to face crown court. Matthew McCrea is charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and is alleged to have thrown a bottle at the silver Fiat Punto car a family was travelling in. Abbie Keers, nine, is said to have been sitting in the passenger seat and needed surgery after the alleged incident on the A693 in Stanley, County Durham, at around 10.20pm on Valentine's Day. McCrea, 24, spoke only to confirm his name and details at Consett Magistrates' Court. He entered no plea to the charge. The youngster was travelling with her grandmother, former Northumbria Police officer Sandra Webb, mum Clare Webb and little sister Lexi, who was three at the time. The car was travelling from the roundabout near the library towards the Asda roundabout when it was hit by the bottle. Blair Martin, prosecuting, said: 'The vehicle was a Fiat motor vehicle driven by the injured party's grandmother. 'Also in the car was the injured party's sibling and the mother of the children. The injured party was in fact in the front passenger seat. 'The vehicle was driven through the underpass along the A693 Stanley bypass.

It hopes to replicate the success of its value tablet computer, the £119 Hudl, which has chalked up sales of around 550,000 since it was launched last September. The smartphone, which will be unveiled ahead of Christmas, is likely to have a price tag of around £250 – considerably cheaper than a top-of-the-range iPhone which costs £709, and the latest Samsung S5, which costs £579. Smart and cheap: Tesco' is set to launch a phone version of its value tablet Hudl  which is expected to use Android operating system and come with a number of Tesco services built-in . A Hudl 2 is coming out in September, while the company also plans to unveil its budget smartphone ahead of Christmas, which will be considerably cheaper than the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy S5. The cheapest 8GB iPhone 42, on a SIM free basis is £348 and goes up to £709 for the top of the range 5s version, while the latest high-spec Samsung S5 is £549. It seems likely that Tesco would have to charge less than £250 if it is make a big statement about its entry into the mobile phone market under its own name. Some details were revealed by the retail giant’s chief executive Philip Clarke today however the retailer has not released details of the specifications or the price. Mr Clarke has made internet shopping via computer, tablet and smartphone the main focus of his revival of Britain’s biggest retailer which is trying to turn around a two year fall in sales and profits.

It is believed the Tesco smartphone will use Google’s Android operating system and come with a number of Tesco services built-in, including internet shopping and Blinkbox, its movie and music streaming service. The Hudl is made by the Taiwanese company, Wistron, which specialises in making devices for retailers to sell under their own name. It used to be the manufacturing arm of computer company Acer and makes a wide range of devices from PCs to LCD TVs and mobile phones. Tesco's chief executive Philip Clarke hopes to replicate the Hudl tablet success with the new smartphone . Mr Clarke said: ’The opportunity in multi-channel retailing, in online retailing, is what led us to develop the Hudl tablet, and we’ve now sold 550,000 I think. Hudl 2 is coming out in September and there’s going to be a Hudl phone by the end of the year. ‘All are going to come loaded with the Tesco services - Blinkbox, the trilogy of music, movies and books that’s just launched, grocery home shopping, Tesco Direct, F&F Clothing and our bank account launches in June or July, and that’ll be on the smartphone too.’ A Tesco spokesman said the device would run on the Android operating system, and be benchmarked against other high-end smartphones on the market, but the company could not yet confirm a price or list of the device’s specifications. A host of high street retailers have launched their own tablet devices over the last year, looking to cash in on the smartphone and mobile device revolution. Retailer Aldi announced earlier this year that it was relaunching its LifeTab, which originally sold out in less than 24 hours when it went on sale for £80 in December last year. Argos also moved into the market with the MyTablet device. A report by research firm eMarketer in October found that tablets had now reached a third of the UK population, and more than 20 million of us use them on a regular basis. Because of the move into the market by retailers like Tesco, eMarketer found that more than half the population would be using a tablet by 2017.","Tesco to launch smartphone version of their budged tablet Hudl .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Ann Pollen has admitted killing her husband in a botched suicide pact after he was arrested over child sex offences in 2012 . A vulnerable woman who admitted killing her domineering husband in a botched suicide pact has been told she will not go to jail. Ann Pollen pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of husband Leonard after she was told by a judge at the Old Bailey she would be given a suspended sentence. The court heard 'submissive' Ann agreed to the pact with her 58-year-old husband after he was arrested over an allegation of historic child sex abuse in 2012. The couple drew up a 'Last Will and Testament' explaining their decision before sending it to a relative on Friday August 30, 2012. The pair then swallowed pills, drank alcohol and slashed each other's . wrists. When they both survived they attempted it again the next . day. In the document, Leonard wrote: 'I have decided to commit suicide and Ann has agreed to join me. By the time you get this we will be well dead.’ When the relative received the note on September 2 they informed police who forced entry into the house on September 3. They found Leonard had died but Ann was still alive. Ann was later charged with murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter between August 29 and September 4, 2012. She entered a guilty plea to manslaughter after the Crown decided not to pursue the murder charge and judge Peter Rook QC indicated she would receive a suspended sentence. The judge said: ‘The prosecution now accept the defendant killed her husband as part of a suicide pact between them in which each intended to die. ‘The prosecution accept Anne Pollen had intended to die herself, however she survived. ‘In this case it is accepted that the deceased had a settled intention to kill himself and he was intent on committing suicide himself whether or not it was part of a suicide pact. ‘The idea of suicide is entirely that of the deceased. It is also accepted the deceased was the dominant partner. On the other hand the defendant was submissive and compliant with her husband’s wish. ‘She could not contemplate life on her own without her husband. She is likely to have had acute fears of abandonment.’ Sitting at the Old Bailey (pictured), judge Peter Rook QC said Ann would not be jailed for her part in the crime, which her defence barrister argued was 'almost beyond sensible imagination' Prosecutor David Jeremy QC said: 'The Crown’s case is based on the defendant’s conversation with several individuals immediately following the discovery of her and the deceased. 'She slashed his wrists on the Friday night, and on the Saturday after the first attempt had not been successful.' Pollen was 'subservient and suggestible' to her husband, he said. Defending, Tim Moloney QC said: 'We say this is a truly exceptional case. We submit the circumstances are almost beyond sensible imagination.' Pollen, of Hawthorn Road, Edmonton, north London, is on bail and will be sentenced tomorrow. The court heard Mrs Pollen has had plastic surgery to the wounds on her wrist and is now receiving disability living allowance. Judge Rook indicated that the sentencing range in this case was between 18 months and two years. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ‘As a result of increased and strained pressures on their relationship, Leonard and Ann Pollen each took a life-changing decision to enter into a suicide pact with the settled intention of death. ‘It is accepted that they cut each other’s and their own wrists. In these fairly rare circumstances a homicide investigation is always undertaken to establish the facts. ‘I hope that Mr Pollen’s wider family can take some satisfaction that Ann Pollen has accepted responsibility for her role in his death.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ann and Leonard Pollen agreed to help kill each other in August 2012 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Trial: Former BBC star Stuart Hall, 84, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, today admitted one charge of indecently assaulting a girl under 16 . Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall has pleaded guilty to one charge of indecent assault on a girl under 16 ahead of his trial for a string of sex assaults. The 84-year-old stood in the dock at Preston Crown Court and replied 'Guilty' when asked how he pleaded to the offence, which took place between 26 January 1978 and 1 January 1979 . He will now go on trial later today accused of raping and indecently assaulting two young girls. Hall, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, is charged with seven counts of rape against one complainant between 1976 and 1978 in Manchester. Five of the rapes are said to have taken place when she was aged under 16. He is also accused of two counts of indecent assault against the woman within the same period, plus eight counts of rape and three indecent assaults against a second alleged victim between 1976 and 1981, at various locations in Greater Manchester and Cheshire. One of those alleged rapes is said to have taken place when the complainant was aged under 13. The charge he admitted today was a new indictment, Count 21, which the judge allowed the prosecutor to add to the charge sheet this morning. Led into the dock in front of a packed press bench, Hall was asked by the clerk of the court to identify himself as James Stuart Hall and he replied: 'Yes, I am.' The former It's A Knockout presenter has pleaded not guilty to all 20 allegations he will be tried for this week. He has been a familiar face and voice in British broadcasting for half a century, and his eccentric and erudite football match summaries made him a cult figure on BBC Radio 5 Live. The trial at Preston Crown Court, which starts today, is estimated to last seven days. Hall, pictured at a previous hearing, admitted one new indictment at Preston Crown Court this morning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . She credits him with being a 'huge influence' on her and the person who nurtured her love of music. Now Amanda Holden has decided to let the public know just how much her maternal grandfather, who she referred to as Papa, meant to her by taking part in a campaign to highlight the plight of dementia sufferers. The Britain's Got Talent judge has never spoken about her grandfather's battle with the condition before. Scroll down for video . Amanda Holden has become a Dementia Friend to help make life better for the 670,000 people in England living with the condition . However the 43-year-old mother-of-two devoted an entire chapter to him and her grandmother in her autobiography No Holding Back which was released last year. In the book she describes spending many happy days and holidays in their company and describes how her Papa 'nurtured my love of music – he was fanatical about it. He played record after record, although we were never allowed near his prized player. Like all Welshmen, he thought he had the best voice in the world (no one dared tell him he was a bloody terrible singer!) It was him who introduced me to opera, musicals, orchestral pieces and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. 'He taped the tunes I liked the most on his reel-to-reel tape recorder, which was the height of technology then, and give me copies to take home.' It is understood he passed away in 2007. Miss Holden is now taking part in an advert, which will be screened this evening to encourage people to become 'dementia friends' to help boost volunteering, education and support for the growing number of people with the condition. Almost one in 10 dementia carers have to withdraw from work altogether and 12 per cent have been forced to reduce the number of hours they spend at work . Musicians Chris Martin, Lily Allen and Alesha Dixon are also taking part. Volunteers who take part in the scheme will be able to attend free sessions to learn how to spot the signs of dementia and offer support for sufferers, the Alzheimer's Society said. In a new ad which will be aired for the first time tonight, the pop stars will be seen performing The Beatles' track I Get By With A Little Help From My Friends. Author Sir Terry Pratchett - who suffers from Alzheimer's disease himself - is also involved. Sir Terry Pratchett is also involved in an advert, which will be screened this evening to encourage people to become 'dementia friends' The news comes as a new report found that English businesses are losing out on hundreds of millions every year because of employees' caring obligations for people who have dementia. Almost one in 10 dementia carers have to withdraw from work altogether and 12 per cent have been forced to reduce the number of hours they spend at work. Experts have estimated that the total cost of those who leave employment or have to reduce their hours totals more than £1.6 billion. The report compiled by the Centre for Economics and Business research on behalf of Dementia Friends - the Alzheimer's Society's campaign - estimated that throughout this year 50,000 carers will have to quit their job due to caring responsibilities. And a further 66,000 will have to make adjustments to the number of hours they work. Public Health England and the Alzheimer's Society are encouraging more people to sign up to the Dementia Friends initiative. 'The fact that thousands of workers in this country are juggling caring responsibilities without support and understanding from their employers is frightening,' said Alzheimer's Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes. 'We're all beginning to talk about dementia, however, society is not yet fully supportive of people with dementia, either in the workplace or in everyday life. I'd love to see everyone become Dementia Friends, and make life that little bit easier for people with dementia.' Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, added: 'This campaign will help people understand the issues faced and give them the information they need to support people in their community with dementia. 'Businesses can encourage staff to become Dementia Friends through a suite of online videos, addressing the common challenges faced by customers with dementia, such as paying for goods or filling in forms.'","Amanda Holden taking part in campaign to highlight dementia sufferers .

"By . Chris Brooke . Jailed: Amanda Spencer, 23, has been jailed for 12 years for 'pimping out' vulnerable young girls . A YOUNG woman who forced vulnerable girls as young as 11 into prostitution was jailed for 12 years yesterday. Amanda Spencer, 23, befriended the girls, plied them with drugs and  alcohol and made them have sex with strangers in parks, toilets and flats. She became a ‘pimp’ at 15 and for five years ran a ring of teenage prostitutes to feed her addiction to drugs. One victim said: ‘When I was 13 she made me feel it was normal to have sex. I wish I had never met her. ‘She took my childhood. I hate her and she ruined my life.’ Spencer showed no remorse as she was jailed for 16 child prostitution offences at Sheffield Crown Court. Judge Michael Murphy said she had been responsible for the ‘heartless exploitation of young and vulnerable girls’, many of whom were in care. She met the victims she called her ‘sisters’ hanging about in a market and park in Sheffield and took them under her wing to become their ‘best friend’. Once they were in her control, Spencer forced them to dress provocatively, lie about their age and have sex with men. The judge told her: ‘They didn’t have much of a childhood but what they had, you effectively spoiled. They looked up to you as their friend and as their protector. Unfortunately, what they found was not a protector but  an exploiter.’ The judge said he had watched the ‘torment and shame’ of the victims as they gave evidence  during the nine-week trial. They were the most vulnerable witnesses he had seen in 40 years at the court, he added. Spencer, of Rotherham, was convicted of 16 offences relating to five victims by a jury. Spencer, pictured at Sheffield Crown Court, was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against between 2006 and 2011 . She was cleared of eight offences. The jury was unable to reach a decision on another 14 charges. One . victim was a 15-year-old homeless cocaine addict when she was forced to . have sex with six ‘smiling’ Kurdish asylum seekers one after the other. When she refused a . seventh man, she was punched in the face by Spencer and relented. She . said Spencer was paid £150 by the men and spent it on cocaine. The court heard Spencer punched a 15-year-old victim when she refused her seventh sexual partner in a row . Spencer forced her to have sex with 40 or 50 men in two years and used cocaine and cannabis daily to ‘put her in a trance’. The girl added: ‘I will carry with me what she made me do every day of my life.’ Another victim, who was forced to lose her virginity at 13, said Spencer befriended her when she was wearing her school uniform. Later she was taken to a house party and agreed to have sex for £80 with a man in his 30s. The girl got £20 and Spencer took the rest. Spencer forced one girl to have sex with 40 or 50 men over two years, the court heard . A girl of 14 said Spencer became her ‘best friend and family rolled into one’. She was then forced into prostitution. ‘She preyed on my weaknesses. I will be left with the mental and physical scars of what happened to me for the rest of my life.’ Spencer, who has a four-year-old son who lives with her parents in South Yorkshire, denied pimping any of the girls or working as a prostitute. The court heard that she ran away from home on her 15th birthday, and was placed in foster care. She became addicted to crack cocaine and would drink a bottle of spirits a day. Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Chapman said Spencer had carried out ‘sustained and calculated abuse’ and ‘preyed on some of the most  vulnerable people in our community’.","Amanda Spencer, 23, befriended young girls on the streets of Sheffield .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan 'cheated death' when his sports car spun out of control on the motorway as he made his way home after losing the snooker World Championships. Little more than three hours after Mr O'Sullivan lost the tournament's final game to Mark Selby, the 38-year-old and his son were involved in the dramatic crash on the M1 near Leicester. His young son Ronnie Junior, six, was alongside his father in the two-seater sports car when it hit the motorway's central reservation in the early hours of this morning. Father and son: Ronnie O'Sullivan and his son Ronnie Jnr, pictured at last year's World Championship, were involved in the dramatic crash on the M1 this morning . Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan's sports car was believed to have spun out of control on a motorway as he made his way home following the snooker World Championships . But the pair incredibly walked away 'without a scratch' after the crash. They were returning to Mr O'Sullivan's home in Chigwell, Essex, from the  world-famous Crucible Theatre in Sheffield after the snooker favourite was defeated by 14 frames to 18 in the snooker World Championships. Mr O'Sullivan and Ronnie Jnr, one of his two children with ex-partner Jo Langley, were able to climb free of the wreckage and were said to be 'shaken' by the incident, which occurred at around 1.30am, but not seriously hurt. It is believed that the car drove through a patch of standing water on the motorway before hitting the central reservation, and that alcohol was not a factor in the crash. Mr O'Sullivan's manager Sonny Nath told MailOnline that Mr O'Sullivan and Ronnie Jnr had not been injured in the smash. Scene: The crash happened close to junction 21 of the M1, near Leicester, as Mr O'Sullivan travelled from The Crucible to his home in Essex . Crash: Am Audi R8, thought to be Ronnie's car parked at the Hilton Hotel in Sheffield earlier in the week . 'Both Ronnie and his son were not hurt at all and are fine,' he said. Mr O'Sullivan's spokesman Justin Rigby confirmed he was unhurt - and added that there was no suggestion Mr O'Sullivan was speeding or drinking before the crash. 'He wasn't that bad, he's not got a scratch on him,' said Mr Rigby. 'He's back home again now. There's no problem with drink driving.' He added: 'He's fine and his son is fine, they're not injured at all.' Past glory: The star with his former partner Jo and Ronnie Jnr as a baby at the tournament in 2008 . Ordeal: Mr O'Sullivan, pictured at the Crucible, and Ronnie Jnr were able to climb free of the wreckage and were said to be 'shaken' by the incident . Mr O'Sullivan had said after the final that he had 'never been in such a good place' despite the defeat. 'He (Selby) out-fought me, out-battled me and I've got no complaints. I fought my hardest,' the Rocket told fans. Police . were unable to confirm whether it had been Mr O'Sullivan involved in . the crash, but said that officers had attended an incident on the south . bound stretch of the motorway, close to junction 21, early this morning. 'We . did have a road traffic collision on the M1 south bound at about 1.30 . in the morning, there was an adult and a child in that vehicle,' a . Leicestershire Police spokesman told MailOnline. Champion: Mr Selby, pictured with his wife Vikki, lifts the trophy after winning the final against Mr O'Sullivan . The spokesman added that no one was injured in the collision, which involved just one vehicle - an Audi R8. She added that the car had been recovered following the crash as it was 'too damaged' to be driven away. Mr O'Sullivan split with former . partner Ms Langley in 2008 and is currently engaged to former Holby City . actress Laila Rouass, who he has been in a relationship with since . 2012. Ms Rouass, who came . fourth in 2009's Strictly Come Dancing, had tweeted that she was at The . Crucible, later writing 'Unlucky. Congrats to Selby,' after her fiance's . defeat.

Throughout his career, which spans more than 20 years, Ronnie O'Sullivan has won countless titles, but has also made headlines for his actions away from the table. Known to fans as 'The Rocket', Mr . O'Sullivan rose to prominence when in 1993 at just 17 years and 358 days . he won the UK Championship, becoming the youngest player ever to win a . professional ranking tournament - a record which still stands. Mr O'Sullivan, who was born in Wordsley, West Midlands, and grew up in Chigwell, Essex, is also the youngest player ever to have won the Masters, having . captured his first title two years later in 1995 when he was 19 years . and 69 days old. During his . career, Mr O'Sullivan has scooped five World Championship, five Masters, . and four UK Championship titles, and is known as a prolific . break-builder - holding the record for the most ratified maximum breaks . in professional competition, with 12. Prior to yesterday's defeat he had been the firm favourite to take the Dafabet World Championship title, after wins in 2012 and 2013. In 1996 the snooker star received a two-year suspended ban, a £20,000 fine and was advised to donate a further £10,000 to charity after snooker's governing body found him guilty of assaulting media official Mike Ganley during the World Championships. Later that year he was accused of bad sportsmanship after he played a number of shots left-handed during the 10-3 defeat of the French Canadian Alain Robidoux. In 1998 he was stripped of the Irish Masters title because he had tested positive for marijuana. Mr O'Sullivan has had well-documented . problems with drink, drugs and depression during his colourful career, . and has had spells in the priory clinic to treat his issues.

"By . Sam Webb . Joanne Berry, 30, is alleged to have posed on websites as a woman who liked 'role play' in sex and encouraged a man to 'rape' her - but gave him the address and contact details of another woman . A woman arranged for her work colleague to be raped at home by men she tricked on online sex chatrooms, a court heard today. Joanne Berry, 30, is alleged to have posed on websites including Cougar Shag as a woman who liked 'role play' in sex and wanted 'to create some sort of rape scenario'. On one occasion she instructed a man, Dean Hicks, to knock at her front door and then burst in and 'rape' her. But Berry, a temporary administrator from Grove Park, south east London, didn't give Mr Hicks her own address, but that of a female acquaintance, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Prosecutor Andrew Espley told Maidstone Crown Court in Kent, where Berry is on trial, said: 'Joanne Berry arranged for men to go round to [the victim's] house and rape her. 'How did she do it? She went on various sex chat websites. She pretended she was [the victim], she gave [the victim's] address, she used her name, she gave the registration of her car which was going to be parked outside, pretended to be her. 'She then told the men to come round and engage in a fantasy rape game with her, basically to rape her.' The court heard Berry had confided in the victim over claims she herself had been raped on March 3, 2012. The victim had tried to support Berry, who sent her about 12 text . messages a day. On April 13, 2012, when Berry texted her, implying she . was going to kill herself, the victim decided to alert the police and . give them Berry's phone number. However, Berry refused to give the police her correct details, causing the victim to believe Berry was 'attention-seeking'. She texted . Berry asking her not to contact her anymore and pleading her to seek . professional help because 'she was making her angry and frightened'. The victim texted Berry asking her not to contact her anymore and pleading her to seek professional help because 'she was making her angry and frightened', the court heard . Cougar: Berry is alleged to have used websites such as Cougar Shag (pictured) to set up the rape . Mr . Espley said the victim later received a series of texts from Berry . saying that 'she had thought she could trust her and now she had lost . her job and lost her as a friend'. A . few days later the victim's sister, who lived with the victim, was at . home alone when she heard banging on a door, but did not answer, . believing it was next door. The . following day, on April 28, 2012, the sister answered the door after . hearing another loud knock to a man who asked if her name was [the . victim's name]. Mr Espley said: 'She said she wasn't and asked who he was. He said that he had been speaking to [the victim] all day online.  '[The sister] thought that he might have the wrong address and the man said: ""This is a f***ing wind up."" He then left.' He said when the sister returned home later that day she found two messages on her answer phone, one saying: 'I am getting bored of this now, you are playing games' and a second saying: 'Sorry about that I think I have the wrong number'. The following morning the victim was at home when she heard a banging on the front door and answered it to find a man she didn't know standing there. Mr Espley said: 'He asked if she was [her name] and when she said she was he tried to push his way in. 'She immediately called up to her sister and at this point the man stopped and said: ""Is this a wind up?"".' 'He then began to say he had been chatting to someone online who he believed was her and that she wanted him to go to the house and carry out a fantasy rape by knocking on the front door and then trying to push his way in. 'The man said that once he had carried out the fantasy rape he was to ask for information about Joanne Berry.' Prosecutor Andrew Espley told Maidstone Crown Court in Kent (pictured) that she arranged for men to go round to (the victim's) house and rape her . The court heard the man, Mr Hicks, said he'd been told to ask for a password - 'feather' - which the victim remembered Berry had once told her reminded her of her grandparents. Mr Hicks told the victim she should phone the police and he waited in his car until they arrived. Berry is charged with putting the victim in fear of violence, committing an offence of assault with the intent of committing a relevant sexual offence, the common assault of the victim and attempting to cause the victim to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The prosecution claims Berry committed the offences by procurement.  Berry denies all four charges.  The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . From the perkily named Pershing's Crusaders to the more ponderously titled When The Kaiser Does The Goose-Step (To A Good Old American Rag), patriotic songs were once almost as popular as their poster equivalent. Now, with the World War One centenary almost upon us, a selection of beautifully illustrated sets of sheet music have been released to mark the occasion. Along with Pershing's Crusaders and When The Kaiser Does The Goose-Step, others include We're Goin' To Knock The 'Hel' Out Of Willhelm and We're Going Over. Patriotic: Jaunty American songs such as We're Going Over celebrated the US entry into WW1 . Although most hail from the US, where patriotic tunes have long been part of popular culture, others come from the UK and include such ditties as Your King & Country Want You. While Your King & Country Want You is little remembered, others such as Keep The Home Fires Burning, remained popular well into the 1960s. Written by composer Ivor Novello with the help of Lena Gilbert Ford - a woman who was not, as is sometimes reported, his mother - the ballad speaks of men 'summoned from the hillside' and 'called from the glen' and sent off to war. Despite the tragedy that awaited many, the song exhorts listeners to 'keep the home fires burning' and to 'turn the dark cloud inside out until our boys come home'. Jaunty: Paul Stewart and Jack Frost both wrote songs that confidently predicted victory over the Kaiser . Another, It's A Long Way To Tipperary, was jauntier and proved enormously popular with soldiers marching off to war. Among them were the Connaught Rangers, an Irish regiment, who were recorded walking through Boulogne singing the tune by Daily Mail correspondent, George Curnock. Like many British patriotic songs, it spoke less of great deeds on the battlefield and more of a poignant longing for home. By contrast, many of the scores that originate in the US are more martial in nature and speak confidently of victory. First off the mark: Paul A. Rubens' recruiting song won royal approval and was released as war began in 1914 . One, God Bless America, which was composed by Irving Berlin in 1918, is now considered an unofficial national anthem, while even the distinctly unpatriotic likes of George M. Cohen - the man behind patriotic parody Yankee Doodle Dandy - were moved to create popular tunes for soldiers. Cohen's 1917 work, Over There, exhorted young Americans to join up and called on every 'son of Liberty' to go and fetch their guns. But whether upbeat or packed with longing for home, the soldiers singing the ditties were headed for horrors from which many never returned. From It's A Long Way To Tipperary to Over There, the songs today are a poignant reminder of a generation lost to war a century ago.

"By . David Kent . Nemanja Vidic was given a rousing send-off by Manchester United as he said goodbye to the club he's served for eight years, claiming his heart will always be at Old Trafford. The central defender was handed a present by Sir Bobby Charlton before Ryan Giggs' side played Hull City on Tuesday night. And even though the 32-year-old started on the bench at Old Trafford, he did get a run out in his final home game for the Reds. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Nemanja Vidic was given a present by Sir Bobby Charlton at Old Trafford on Tuesday night . Saying goodbye: The central defender is leaving at the end of the season for pastures new at Inter Milan . Surprise: Vidic started on the bench against Hull City but came on after an injury to Phil Jones . Phil Jones left proceedings after picking up an early injury, which threw the Serbian on earlier than expected. Giggs had planned to give Vidic his standing ovation later on as United fans caught a final glimpse of a man who has been a terrific servant for the club since joining from Spartak Moscow in 2006. And he was emotional when the time came to say goodbye. 'Physically I will leave but my heart will always be at this club. I've spent so many years here,' Vidic said. 'I've worked with so many great people and will always watch and care about United. 'It was a tough season. It has been a tough night - it was very emotional. He won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and three League Cups under previous manager Sir Alex Ferguson. But as United changed under David Moyes, certain players became surplus to requirements. While there would have been very little resistance to Vidic penning a new deal for at least another year, he felt the time was right to jump ship. Giggs said afterwards: 'Nemanja goes with all our best wishes of success in the coming years.' Cracking send off: Vidic was centre of attention after kind words from interim manager Ryan Giggs . The final walk: Vidic began on the bench at Old Trafford during his last home game for the club . See you soon! Vidic applauds the supporters and said his heart would always be with the club . Writing in the matchday programme, he said: ‘Thank you for all the support you have given me over the years. I know I will be supporting the club in the future. ‘You never know what's going to happen with emotions. You can try to predict but I wasn't emotional before and I haven't cried yet.' Vidic admits the lap of the pitch won't be the same without a trophy but that it is 'the least the players can do' to thank the supporters. He said: 'As we didn't do well this season, that walk around Old Trafford won't be the same after many years where we have always been celebrating something after the final game. Now, it has become a chance to thank the fans for supporting us this year. I think this is definitely the least that we can do. 'We must perform in these last games to give them something to look forward to next season and to believe this team can win again. That is what the players are thinking about now - to try to put on good performances and build on that next season.'","Nemanja Vidic has been a key player for Man Utd since joining from Spartak Moscow in 2006 .

Two schoolgirls arrested last week for allegedly plotting to kill a maths teacher at their school have been expelled. The girls, aged 14 and 15, were arrested on Friday after a fellow pupil overheard them allegedly plotting to stab teacher Alison Cray. When police searched them, they found a knife in the 15-year-old's schoolbag. Now 1,000-pupil Cwmcarn High School, in Wales, has permanently excluded the pair, while police have released them on bail. The schoolâ€™s chair of governors Gary Thomas praised the way in which the alleged murder plot had been acted upon 'swiftly'. On a letter on Cwmcarnâ€™s website, he said: 'There are clear measures, policies and protocols in place to ensure that everyone is safe and everyone knows how to report any concerns. 'I am very proud of the school and particularly the way in which the pupils are educated to be responsible and report any concerns immediately.' Ms Cray, 46, said she has worked as normal since the alleged incident which was 'all handled before it got to me'. Police said a 15-year-old pupil from Newbridge was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill, possession of a bladed article on school premises and conspiracy to commit murder. The 14-year-old girl from Risca was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. A Caerphilly Council spokesman said: 'We can confirm that concerns were raised about a pupil at Cwmcarn High School last week, which were swiftly dealt with by staff and Gwent Police. The pair have now been permanently excluded from the school, and have also been released on police bail . 'Support is now in place for both pupils and staff and we would like to assure parents that all appropriate steps were taken to respond effectively to the situation. We are now helping the Police with their enquiries.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai . Follow @@riathalsam . Stoke defender Robert Huth, perhaps sensing the escalation of a recent and curious epidemic, took to Twitter on Monday evening and advocated Luis Suarez starting yet another season under suspension. He wrote: ‘Still maintain that crying on the pitch should warrant a three-match ban.’ By then, Suarez had just about made it down the pitch, legs shaking and chin wobbling. One assumes his chin was wobbling. It was impossible to know with any certainty because, for a matter of several minutes, his shirt was pulled over his eyes. Broken: Luis Suarez was reduced to tears as Liverpool were held to a draw having lead 3-0 after 60 minutes . Hard man: Robert Huth is known for his rough tackling on the pitch and his harsh words off it . First when he lay on his front on the pitch, and when he made it to his haunches, then all the way to the side of the pitch as Steven Gerrard, with the urgency of a family member at a funeral, moved to protect the privacy of last summer’s cannibal. A camera was swatted away; let Luis be alone at this moment of intense suffering. He’s Luis Suarez, a rehabilitated man, and he cares deeply about this club he so very nearly left for a better option last year. And so on. Remember the threat of a transfer request, the days he spent training with the reserves? Nine months ago to the day, he criticised the club’s refusal to let him leave in an interview: ‘This is about the club having agreed to something, both verbally and in the contract, which they are now not honouring.’ It was bitter, nasty even. And now the crocodile tears that are becoming increasingly common. In the space of a week, John Terry has blubbed, Ashley Cole has shed a few and Nemanja Vidic, one of the last true hard men of European football, tried to stir a will-he, won’t-drama. Speaking ahead of his last game at Old Trafford last night, Manchester United’s Vidic, who will soon earn £2.5million a year after tax at Inter Milan, said: ‘You never know what’s going to happen with emotions. You can try to predict but I haven’t cried yet.’ Unstoppable: Dwight Gayle came off the bench to score twice as Crystal Palace recovered to get a point . Inconsolable: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard lead Suarez away after the end of the match at Selhurst Park . Caressed beyond: Suarez bends around Huth during a Liverpool's 2-1 FA Cup win in March 2012 . Emotional: John Terry (left) and Ashley Cole both looked drained after Chelsea's draw against Norwich . Iconic: Paul Gascoigne's tears after the 1990 World Cup semi-final defeat was the picture of the tournament . Then there’s Cole. What was the meaning of his tears on Sunday? Is this goodbye? Has a year on the fringes heralded the end of Cole’s eight-year journey at Chelsea? A journey that, lest we forget, started when he ‘almost crashed’ his car because Arsenal’s offer to keep him was only £55,000 a week? Football bonds are formed quickly and fickly. And, increasingly, it ends in tears. Indeed, this has been the  season for them. Sometimes, they are a little more understandable. Gerrard’s tears three weeks ago, after Liverpool beat Manchester City  and when it looked as if they would win the Premier League, was touching to some people, though not all. Gazza, famously crying at Italia 90 (left), falls into the same bracket. But don’t all these tears just cheapen raw, painful, tragic emotion? One of the most moving footballing environments I have been in was Swansea City versus Aston Villa on November 27, 2011, the day Wales manager Gary Speed died, aged just 42. There, during the minute’s silence before the match, Speed’s good friend Shay Given was unable to hold back the tears ahead of kick-off. No-one would dare begrudge him that. Tussle: Huth (right) playing against Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge earlier in the season . You could also feel the raw devastation of Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke at the weekend, when he broke down following the club’s first relegation out of the Football League after a 94-year stay. Relegation means the loss of jobs, from the manager and players to the tea lady and kit man. Less understandable is the reaction of a player who wanted to leave and who now mourns that he has fallen short of an ambition. Just like Terry. If Suarez was sad on Monday night, it was for himself, for his own ambitions. Liverpool and their history likely had nothing to do with it. Huth’s law might have some merit.","Robert Huth slammed Luis Suarez on Monday night .

"By . Margot Peppers . In the spirit of upcoming Mother's Day, a new report has been published that reveals which are the best and worst countries in the world for moms to live. According to Save the Children's 15th annual State of the World's Mothers Report, Finland, Norway and Sweden are the safest places for mothers, but Africa, which houses the top ten worst countries to bring children into the world, is the most dangerous. Somalia is considered the most dangerous place for mothers due to natural disaster as well as persistent conflict. Shockingly, the report found that six per cent of women in the African country are likely to die of a maternal cause, and a staggering 15per cent of children will perish before they turn five. Maternal instinct: According to Save the Children's 15th annual State of the World's Mothers Report, Somalia is the most dangerous place for a mother to live, Finland is the best and the U.S. is only 31st . By contrast, in Finland, which ranked the top country, just one in 12,000 women will die because of maternal causes, and only one in 345 children will die before their fifth birthday. The report looked at health, educational and economic factors in 178 nations to determine which are the safest and happiest places for mothers to live in. It named the Democratic Republic of Congo the second to last country on the list because of 'horrific abuses against women and children', which has claimed - both directly and indirectly - more than 5.4million lives. Indeed, the foundation noted that it is statistically more dangerous to be a woman or a child in the Democratic Republic of Congo than it is to be an armed fighter there. And when it comes to child deaths, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo account for a staggering 20per cent of worldwide cases. Other countries that ranked low on the list were Syria and the Philippines - the former due to the enduring civil war, and the latter because of a sequence of natural disasters. Somewhat surprisingly, the U.S. ranked number 31 on the list, down from its place in the top ten in 2000. Improvement? A recent report form the World Health Organization found that the deaths of women due to pregnancy-related causes has dropped, but the rate is still 33 an hour . The report cited natural disasters including hurricanes Sandy and Katrina as causes for this drop, as well as an increase in high-risk pregnancy among obese mothers and those with hypertension. Save the Children emphasizes the importance of education, health care and aid in order to better the situation. 'Urgent actions [are] needed to support mothers who are raising the world's future generations under some of the most difficult and horrific circumstances imaginable,' it reads. A recent report form the World Health Organization found that the deaths of women due to pregnancy-related causes has dropped since 1990.

"By . Emma Innes . Doctors are baffled by an ultra-rare condition which means a three-year-old boy has grown to just 2ft 5ins tall. Brody Land, who still wears clothes designed for children aged six to nine months, has a form of dwarfism so rare that doctors in the UK have been unable to properly diagnose him. The toddler stands at just 74cm (2ft 5 in) tall when the average height for a boy of his age in the UK is 95cm (3ft 1in). Brody Land (pictured with his mother, Emma) is just 74cm tall when he should be about 95cm tall . He is able to walk, although sometimes uses a pushchair when he gets tired, and his mother has taught him sign language because he struggles to speak. Brody’s parents, Emma and Chris Land, have now set their sights on travelling to the U.S. where they hope specialists will be able to provide them with a diagnosis. Mrs Land, 25, a part-time administrator, said: ‘We just need a diagnosis and I don’t want to stop until I know what he has got. I’m learning as I go along because there are no other children in the UK with the same condition. ‘I had my first three-month scan with Brody and they told me that he had Down’s syndrome, but this was not the case. ‘At 11 months old they told me he had dwarfism but they couldn’t give me a diagnosis. ‘When Brody was about two the doctors said to me that they had done everything they could and they just told us it was Brody’s syndrome.’ Brody is so small that he still wears clothes designed for children who are between six and nine months old . Doctors say Brody is the only child in the UK to have his condition so they are unable to formally diagnose him - his parents say they have been told he has 'Brody syndrome' Brody's doctors say they have done everything they can for him. He is pictured at 10 months old . The mother-of-one had to give up full-time work as a nursery nurse to attend the many hospital appointments Brody required but the youngster has recently started mainstream nursery school. Mrs Land, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ‘Brody has started going to school every morning and he absolutely loves it. He’s such a sociable little boy and he hates playing alone. ‘All the children at school look after him and hold his hand - I think they just want to protect him really. He is progressing well though and he’ll continue in mainstream education while he’s in primary school.’ Mrs Land and husband Chris, 28, a labourer, are now desperate for a diagnosis and are hoping to raise £10,000 to take him to America for specialist tests. After a pregnancy scan, Brody's parents were told he had Down's syndrome but they were later told this was not the case and that he actually has a form of dwarfism . Brody's parents now hope to take him to see specialists in the U.S. in the hope of getting a formal diagnosis . Mrs Land said: 'When Brody was about two the doctors said to me that they had done everything they could and they just told us it was Brody's syndrome' She said: ‘We are part of a dwarfs’ community that meets once a year and they’ve all got a diagnosis. I’d just like to say this is what he has. ‘Going to America is our last hope really. We just want a bit of closure and I won’t give up until I have done everything I can. ‘When he gets older and starts asking me questions about his condition I want to be able to say that I tried everything.’ Mrs Land says she wants answers about Brody's condition so she can answer his questions as he gets older . Mrs Land said: 'We just need a diagnosis and I don't want to stop until I know what he has got' Consultant paediatrician Dr Andrea Nussbaumer, from Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘We are dedicated to providing the very best possible care for all our patients and we continue to work with a number of specialists in the hope of getting an accurate diagnosis for Brody’s condition. ‘In the meantime we are concentrating on working with Brody and his family to ensure that he receives all the care and support he needs.’ Anyone wishing to donate can email Mrs Land on Brody-syndrome2010@outlook.com .","Brody Land wears clothes designed for six to nine-month-old children .

"By . Martha Cliff . 'Choose your weapon!' This might sound like the opening line of a film about ninjas or soldiers but instead, it's an everyday phrase for the UK's dominatrices - a group who spend their days taking whips, riding crops and canes to their willing clients. One of their number is Mistress Dita, a former prison administrative officer from Hull, who agreed to speak to Rupert Everett as part of his new documentary series, Love for Sale. She's offering him a close encounter with her arsenal of riding crops and canes, which she intends him to use on her willing 'slave' standing in a corner, trussed up in full leather bondage wear. Rupert Everett talks to Dominatrix - Mistress Dita in her home in Hull . He chooses a cane and then watches in fascination as Mistress Dita wields it with panache, each thwack leaving red stripes on her client's back. 'That was a particularly shocking moment,' he reveals. 'Being in the same room as a dominatrix as she dealt with her client, that is not normally in a day's work.' Michael Waldman, the director of Channel 4's Love for Sale has explored the sex world before in previous documentaries but had never been treated to a live show. This time around, the director was determined to find out exactly who was paying for these kind of niche sexual services. 'We wanted to talk to both Dita and her client. We spoke to him once the cameras were off and he wasn't wearing his gimp mask and he was a perfectly normal, nice, intelligent man.' Rupert with Mistress Dita in her S&M dungeon . Mistress Dita has around 100 clients and says that she could have another ten years in the business . The services of Mistress Dita, who has around 100 regular clients, may come as a shock to those who are unfamiliar with the world of S&M, although not quite as much as the latest addition to her repertoire. 'I've introduced hard sports into my repertoire' she tells a curious Rupert. 'So hard sports is the poo and water sports is the wee. I save my waste from the morning then I feed it to my clients. There's a big market for it.' Astonishingly, Mistress Dita says there is such a large demand for her waste she even has own website, selling everything from gift vouchers, to toe nail clippings and worn underwear but she says that by far the most popular item on sale is her faeces. 'I sell a . lot ,' she explains. 'I send it through Royal Mail, my first one yesterday went to Stoke on Trent, it was Â£25.' Even Mistress Dita says that she doesn't really understand what her clients get out of it. 'I've been in this business . for three years and I still can't put my finger on why guys want it but . all I can say is each to their own,' she says. Mistress Dita uses a selection of 'weapons' on her clients . 'I . never judge anyone because I've worked in a prison with sex offenders . and paedophiles so all I think is that there are far worse things men . can be doing.' Bizarrely, halfway through her interview, Dita's mother enters with the promise of a quiche for Rupert, so what do her family make of her profession. 'The only way I could have . shocked my friends and family is if I had told them I was settling down . and having kids,' she reveals. 'They were really supportive, especially my mum who even . made Rupert and the crew a packed lunch.' Dita works seven days a week and never takes any holiday so she's certainly not lacking in work ethic but will she ever swap the world of the dominatrix for something more mainstream? 'As . a dom, you are expected to be older, and at 44, I could have another ten years . left in me,' she says, thoughtfully. 'I don't think I want to do it for that long though,' she qualifies. 'I'd love to . help the street walkers of Hull who are vulnerable. Maybe set up a . centre for them. But at the moment I love what I'm doing.' Mistress Dita, Rupert Everett and her client at her home in Hull . It's certainly not for everyone, although Everett remains cool throughout - even when confronted with some of the more arcane tools of Dita's trade. 'Oh yes, he is completely unembarrassed by anything which is extremely unusual' says director Waldman. 'The fact that he is so unfazed makes him completely perfect for the job. Other people might be worried or scared or concerned about how they look but Rupert sails through. 'And the fact that we are shocked by how unfazed Rupert is makes us question why we are so fazed ourselves.' Rupert believes that sex workers need protecting and we should stop discriminating against them . The fact that Rupert comes across as so nonjudgmental was key to making the sex workers who appear in the documentary feel comfortable enough to share a glimpse into their lives. And Mistress Dita certainly isn't the only unconventional star of the show. Another is Sammy, a former builder and father of two, who allows Everett to perch on the bed at his home in Milton Keynes as he prepares to set up a live webcam for 50p a minute online sex. Sammy has been taking female replacement hormones for the past three years but still possesses male genitalia and caters to a very specific type of client. As Sammy begins to provide the service for one of his regular clients, in full view of Everett and the Channel 4 film crew, he continues to chat - despite the bizarre situation. 'Meeting . Sammy was a very odd situation' continues Waldmann. 'The film crew were . stood in the room, Sammy was lay on the bed with his legs apart and . Rupert was balanced on the bed looking bemused but not taken aback. 'That . is my job as the director to create an atmosphere that is more relaxing . for people like Sammy so you can achieve a more human reaction.' Everett himself has strong opinions on the sex trade, confessing to having used male . prostitutes himself and says sex workers are in need of . support not discrimination. 'I . don't think it's an issue - too bad if some people have a problem with buying . sex,' insists the 54-year-old. 'They should be so lucky to be . buying sex! Selling sex is much more precarious, it's a terrifying thing . to do, but they need support that's what I really think.' Rupert joins sex worker Sammy, for a session of online sex . Despite Everett's support for sex work, Waldmann insists that this is not necessarily the message the documentary carries. 'Rupert had a very personal view, he wasn't an objective reporter,' he explains. 'He was passionately interested. 'However we wanted to make sure that he heard voices of those he didn't agree with and make sure there was a range of views.' The programme is undeniably eye opening but does Waldmann believe it will alter the British attitude to the sex industry? 'Society will always have a problem with prostitution,' he admits. 'And I wouldn't say that there is no problem,. 'It is by no means an enviable profession, but what I do hope is that the programme makes us a little less judgmental. 'You can't assume everyone who's involved is evil and I hope people think about that.'

"By . Andrew Shanahan . Andrew Shanahan weighed 16st 5lb after too many sandwiches, crisps and lager . In 2011 I took a selfie which saved my life. It’s a truly horrible image showing the full extent of my 16st 5lb body, featuring a distended gut topped with the sort of boobs that could make a pre-teen girl wince with envy. I took the guttie to send to a friend as a laugh, but when I contemplated the image the full extent of my issues with weight hit me. I had to change. I had no idea that the mission would ultimately include thousands more gutties, the launch of a new magazine called Man V Fat and even gained support from Jamie Oliver. My weight had initially suffered when I was working hard on building my business and balancing the demands of being a dad to two lovely boys, while trying to squeeze a bit of a life in at the sides. The stress of work was leading to a procession familiar to many working types where I trudged from bed, to desk, to sofa and back to bed. My food choices were geared towards comfort and the temporary alleviation of tiredness. My four food groups were sandwiches, crisps, chocolate and lager. All of this was playing havoc with my health – I had developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to a higher chance of having a stroke), I no longer played sport and my confidence was in tatters. Something about the guttie cut through all of that though – it left me with nowhere to run – I knew I had to change. The thing that I wasn’t prepared for is that according to the weight loss industry: men don’t diet. No matter how hard I looked I couldn’t find anything that was aimed at helping me: a normal, fat bloke who just wanted to get some no-nonsense advice about how to lose weight. The diets, the magazines, the weight loss . groups were all women only. What I saw was an industry that has simply . jettisoned the notion that men – half of the market – might want to lose . weight. The gut selfie that triggered his weight loss (left) and another as he began to lose it. He blamed his 16st 5lb frame on 'too many sandwiches, crisps and lager' He said: I lost' weight slowly, by making more and more healthy choices. I learned about nutrition and the science behind weight loss.' The Diet Coke Man is a man precisely because the notion of a man dieting is anathema to the weight loss industry. I did join several weight loss classes, but as the token man in a class of 30 women there’s only so many times you can hear about how menstruation affects your weekly weigh-ins before realising that you’re not the target market. What I learned is that rather than diet, men get fit. Instead of advice about what foods to cut down on and how to make really tasty, healthy food I was bombarded with messages about how I could get a six pack, build bigger arms and perfect my deadlift form. All of this wildly overlooked the fact that at 40 per cent body fat I was far more likely to be drinking a six-pack than seriously contemplating developing one. I began to wonder how many other men out there were being led down the same cul-de-sac that I was and finding that their hopes to simply shift a bit of weight were being met with the unrealistic expectation that they tone up, rather than slim down. All of this wouldn’t be such an issue if . the scale of men’s weight problems wasn’t so vast. In the UK alone we . have over 20.4 million men who are overweight or obese. Some figures . suggest that by 2030 over half of all men in the UK will be obese. Today, he weighs 13st and having discovered on his weight loss journey there are few resources to help the 'average bloke' lose weight, decided to launch a free weight loss magazine . This is the single biggest public health issue that we can actually do something about – millions of lives can be saved and immeasurably improved simply by providing more support. Every year the NHS is faced with a £6 billion bill for illnesses related to weight – more than the cost of illnesses related to smoking and drinking. Lord McColl, a former professor at Guy’s Hospital, has warned that the obesity epidemic will shortly bankrupt the NHS. Despite all of this we continue to leave men dangling in the wind. I lost weight slowly, by making more and more healthy choices. I learned about nutrition and the science behind weight loss. What stunned me was that it was so . simple! How could an entire industry have been built up around the . indisputable scientific fact that you lose weight by expending more . energy than you take in? And yet there it was – a baffling array . of approaches, products, quick-fixes, no-effort cures and out-and-out . quackery – but still I couldn’t find anything to help men. The first issue of Man V Fat is out on May 5th. The magazine was a crowdfunded project . Once I’d lost nearly 50lb I felt like a new man – I was no longer embarrassed of my gutties and I had started to enjoy yoga and boot camps at my local gym. I couldn’t ignore the fact that men were being abandoned though and so a new business was born: Man V Fat – a free digital magazine that supports and champions weight loss in men. I wasn’t sure if there would be enough public demand for it so I set up a crowdfunding project and when we cruised past our £9,000 target and got support from Jamie Oliver, the National Obesity Forum and the British Dietetic Association, I realised that this was a project whose time had come.

"By . Isabelle Loynes . It has been dubbed ‘Pink Viagra' – the herbal supplement for women that claims to boost libido and satisfaction between the sheets. Launched this spring, the makers of Lady Prelox claim it works by improving poor circulation, which they claim causes a lack of sexual desire. The key ingredient is a French pine bark extract called Pycnogenol, plus rose hip extract and amino acids. Dubbed the 'female Viagra' after the little blue pills that treat erectile dysfunction in men, herbal libido booster Lady Prelox is on sale on the high street . Taken once a day, this herbal mix is said to encourage blood flow to the reproductive organs and the  brain, making sex more enjoyable for women. Three clinical trials with 255 women published in Panminerva Medica – the Journal of the Italian Medical Association - found the supplement improved female sexual pleasure. All participants who supplemented with Lady Prelox showed a significant improvement in desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm satisfaction and also recorded less discomfort and pain during intercourse. Around 87 per cent reported an improvement in their sex lives after eight weeks, and scientists concluded the pill, on sale at Holland & Barrett at – many would argue – a hefty £37.95 for a month’s supply, ‘significantly improves sexual function’. The product is the female version of Prelox for men. Launched in 2010, annual European sales for Prelox now top £10 million. So is it really any good? We asked two women to take the pill and report how it affected their sexual desire… . Claire Johnson, 42, is an operations manager. She lives in Aylesford, Kent, with her husband Daniel and two children . Revived: Claire Johnson, 42, says she had little sexual desire and just wanted to get sex 'over and done with' Having quite a few older friends, I had heard people talk about the menopause and the symptoms that go with it. So, when I started noticing I had some of the same things - tiredness, mood swings, difficulty sleeping - I wondered if I was going through the change. I wasn't sleeping very well which meant I was tired throughout the day and would snap at my husband for no reason. I didn't feel like myself but was powerless to stop how I felt. In general, I just didn’t feel great and my sex drive was affected by that, too. My husband and I were having sex – about once a week – because knew sex was important to the relationship, but I just saw it as something I needed to tick off the to-do list. After taking the herbal supplement, she had 'more energy, was less stressed and more interested in sex' As a woman, desire works differently to men and we need to be in the right mood to be intimate. But the way I was feeling meant the mood was never quite right. I would have sex but wouldn't really enjoy it, instead I would just want to get it over and done with.’ My husband Daniel didn't really notice something was wrong with our sex life until I started taking the supplement and it improved. Then he saw a huge difference in me. But before this point, my moods were bad and I was terrified we’d get to the point where we weren’t having any sex at all. Then, in November, a colleague mentioned she had been taking Lady Prelox tablets as one of the participants in a clinical trial. Knowing it was herbal meant I didn’t really have anything to lose. I wouldn’t have wanted to take a chemical tablet. Because it’s natural, it took some time to work  - but two months of taking it I noticed I felt different. I had more energy, was less stressed and more interested in sex. Instead of seeing it as a chore I would find myself thinking about when my husband and I could get a moment to ourselves. I was more passionate and instead of slapping his hand away if he was being amorous, I encouraged it. The quantity of sex we are having is the same, but the quality is much better - and Daniel has definitely noticed a difference. In general, I feel better within myself in so many different ways. Intimacy is so important in a relationship and now I feel we’ve got that back. I’d recommend it to anyone who wants to get the spark back in their sex life. Stella Ashton, 33, is a teacher from Cheltenham Spa and a mother-of-three . I became single a year ago after a long-term relationship and I was left feeling really daunted by the idea of dating. Being a busy working mum I never really had time to think of myself and was always rushing around. It meant I never really thought about dating and finding a new relationship, until recently. No energy for a relationship: Busy mother Sarah said she had no libido, but now feels happier and ready to date again . I don’t want to be on my own forever and would like to meet someone but at the same time, at the end of last year, I was just left feeling exhausted. I didn’t feel very sexy or particularly interested in being intimate with someone - the desire to have sex had just gone away - and I knew that needed to change before I would meet someone. Pycnogenol is derived from the pine bark of a tree known as Pinus pinaster (pictured) I was also daunted about being on my own and trying to get to know a new partner. So, I went to see a sex therapist who suggested I try Lady Prelox. ‘She explained it was a completely herbal supplement that supposed to help women with low libidos and who, generally, felt unsexy. Since it was herbal I knew I didn't have anything to lose, so the sex therapist gave me some boxes to try. After just four weeks of taking it, I felt so much better. I was happier in myself, I felt more attractive, more feminine and less anxious. In turn, my libido came back and I began to be interested in the idea of dating and having a relationship with someone. I know that my sex drive was so low before because I was so exhausted – but these pills seemed to reverse that. Now I’m confident that when I do meet someone, I’ll be able to have a full relationship – and will definitely keep taking the tablets.","Lady Prelox, which costs £37.95 for a month's supply, lauched in the spring .

"By . Dan Bloom . Researchers claim one of the world's largest networks of underground rivers could be hidden under the sea bed off the coast of Ireland. It is thought the freshwater channels could be up to 30 miles long and measure up to 70ft wide in places. The discovery was made by researchers in Galway Bay on the west coast, one of Ireland's most treasured beauty spots. Breakthrough: Scientists believe a network of underground 'rivers' up to 30 miles long are flowing under Galway Bay, creating a well on Inishmore island (pictured) which provides limitless fresh water . The 'rivers' are formed by water seeping through porous limestone and slowly carving out channels over hundreds of years. Smaller channels are common in Ireland, where much of the country is made of limestone rock. It is so permeable that it allows the existence of 'disappearing' lakes unique to Ireland called turloughs, where vast bodies of water can vanish underground within a short space of time through cracks in the rock. In Galway Bay, the researchers said, the water was likely to be flowing for several miles before emerging as 'springs' out of the sea bed and straight into the Atlantic. They discovered it because locals on Inishmaan, one of the Aran islands, spoke of a well of fresh water which never ran out, the Sunday Times reported. West coast: The location of Inishmaan island in relation to the rest of Ireland and Galway Bay . Breakthrough: One of the researchers at the University of Ireland described the find as a 'submarine river' The researchers from the National University of Ireland analysed the well and discovered it was supplying more water than all the rain falling on the island. That meant the source of the water must have been on the mainland, they said. Dr Tiernan Henry, a lecturer at the NUI in Galway Bay, told the Sunday Times: 'The islands generally have water problems, they are always . short, but this well went deep into the rock and was getting more . water than falls on the whole island. 'We found it had tapped into a . submarine river flowing from the land some miles away.' Ireland is already famous for its limestone caves, one of the most well-known of which is Dunmore Cave near the south eastern city of Kilkenny. Folklore described it as one of the darkest places in Ireland and inside it is still murky and wet, filled with stalactites and stalagmites formed over millions of years. It contains almost a quarter of a mile of passages, stretching 150ft below ground, and in AD 928 it was the site of the brutal Viking massacre.","Waterways could be up to 70ft wide under the sea bed in Galway Bay .

The researchers concluded 'America's elite are largely drawn from the intellectually gifted, with many in the top 1% of ability.' Researchers concluded 'America's elite are largely drawn from the intellectually gifted, with many in the top 1% of ability.' Individuals were deemed to be in the top 1% of ability if they attended an undergraduate or graduate school that had extremely high average standardized test scores that put the typical person well within the top 1%. Researchers have determined that standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, give a reasonably good â€” yet of course imperfect â€” measure of a person's general reasoning capacity. Five groups of America's elite were examined by Duke University's Jonathan Wai: Fortune 500 CEOs, federal judges, billionaires, Senators, and members of the House of Representatives. 'Within each of these groups, nearly all had attended college with the majority having attended either a highly selective undergraduate institution or graduate school of some kind,' Jonathan Wai wrote in the journal Intelligence. 'High average test scores required for admission to these institutions indicated those who rise to or are selected for these positions are highly filtered for ability.'

The researchers concluded 'America's elite are largely drawn from the intellectually gifted, with many in the top 1% of ability.' Wai said today's elites are increasingly coming from the high end of the IQ distribution. 'That's especially true in highly complex fields like finance and tech,' Wai wrote in Business Insider. 'Billionaires in the investments and technology sectors had the largest fraction of people who were also in the top 1% of cognitive ability. 'Think Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg.' Billionaires in the investments and technology sectors had the largest fraction of people who were also in the top 1% of cognitive ability. 'Think Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg,' said Wai. He also examined the mix in the US political system. 'Within the Senate and House, Democrats had a higher level of ability and education than Republicans. 'Females were underrepresented among all groups, but to a lesser degree among federal judges and Democrats and to a larger degree among Republicans and CEOs. Billionaire ability and education level by sector: Billionaires in the investments and technology sectors had the largest fraction of people who were also in the top 1% of cognitive ability. However, Wai wrote in Business Insider that the work did not prove that America's top performers still had their limits. 'This does not mean they are geniuses (I would reserve that term for someone who does mind-bending work like Albert Einstein); but they are really smart.' Researchers also analysed the male top female ratio in each group . In general the research found women were largely underrepresented. Notably, female Fortune 500 CEOs were underrepresented by a factor of 28.3 to 1, Wai said. 'But among those women who had climbed the ranks, they had to be smarter and more select, on average, than their male counterparts,' he said. Roughly 60% of female CEOs but only 40% of male CEOs were in the top 1% of cognitive ability. The connection between attending Harvard University and being a part of America's elite was also investigated. Roughly 11% to 13% of CEOs, judges, billionaires, and Senators had attended Harvard in some capacity, but only 6.6% of the House did so.","Five groups of America's elite were examined: Fortune 500 CEOs, federal judges, billionaires, Senators, and members of the House of Representatives .

"By . Mark Prigg . You may think a cheetah would be hard to beat, but researchers have found that, for its size, a tiny California beetle is actually the fastest animal ever found. Paratarsotomus macropalpis is no bigger than a sesame seed - however, it was recently recorded running at up to 322 body lengths per second. The previous record-holder, the Australian tiger beetle, only reached 171 body lengths per second, while a cheetah running at 60 miles per hour attains only reaches 16 body lengths per second. Paratarsotomus macropalpis is no bigger than a sesame seed - however, it was recently recorded running at up to 322 body lengths per second, equivalent to a person running roughly 1300 miles per hour. The mite is local to Southern California and is often found running along rocks or sidewalks. Although it was first identified in 1916, little is known about its habits or food sources. The mites also are adept at stopping and changing directions extremely quickly, attributes the researchers are investigating further for potential insights that may be relevant to bioengineering applications. Extrapolated to the size of a human, the mite’s speed is equivalent to a person running roughly 1300 miles per hour. The California college student who spent a summer chasing down the remarkable mites says the discovery is exciting not only because it sets a new world record, but also for what it reveals about the physiology of movement and the physical limitations of living structures. 'It’s so cool to discover something that’s faster than anything else, and just to imagine, as a human, going that fast compared to your body length is really amazing,' said Samuel Rubin, a junior and physics major at Pitzer College. 'But beyond that, looking deeper into the physics of how they accomplish these speeds could help inspire revolutionary new designs for things like robots or biomimetic devices.' Rubin’s advisor, Jonathan Wright, Ph.D., a professor of biology at Pomona College, became interested in the mites while studying the effect of muscle biochemistry on how quickly animals can move their legs. But it wasn’t until Rubin and other students documented the mites’ running speeds in their natural environment that the research team knew they had found a new world record. The previous record-holder, the Australian tiger beetle, only reached 171 body lengths per second, while, a cheetah running at 60 miles per hour attains only about 16 body lengths per second. Both relative speed and stride frequency increase as animals get smaller, and in theory, muscle physiology should at some point limit how fast a leg can move. 'We were looking at the overarching question of whether there is an upper limit to the relative speed or stride frequency that can be achieved,” said Wright. “When the values for mites are compared with data from other animals, they indicate that, if there is an upper limit, we haven't found it yet.” The mite is local to Southern California and is often found running along rocks or sidewalks. Although it was first identified in 1916, little is known about its habits or food sources. The mite is local to Southern California and is often found running along rocks or sidewalks, although little is known about its habits or food sources. The research team used high-speed cameras to record the mites’ sprints in the laboratory and in their natural environment. 'It was actually quite difficult to catch them, and when we were filming outside, you had to follow them incredibly quickly as the camera’s field of view is only about 10 centimeters across,' said Rubin. The research team was also surprised to find the mites running on concrete up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), a temperature significantly higher than the upper lethal temperature of most animals. 'They’re operating at temperatures that seem to preclude activities of any other animal group. 'We’ve seen them running where there were no other animals visibly active,' said Wright. The mites also are adept at stopping and changing directions extremely quickly, attributes the researchers are investigating further for potential insights that may be relevant to bioengineering applications.","Paratarsotomus macropalpis is no bigger than a sesame seed .

It firstly lets people calculate the ratio of water to ground beans needed, and set times reminding them when to pour in the water. It can also be used to discover how long to let the mixture steep, according to its Baltimore-based creator, Kevin Zweerink, who is a graphic design student at the Maryland Institute College of Art. To begin the process, connoisseurs need to select which type of bean they are using as well as the coarseness of the grind and the size of their cup, to work out the best coffee-to-water ratio. On track for the best brew: To get started, people have to enter what type of beans they are using and can save their favourites (pictured left). The app lets them create timers for each brew to use while making their cup of . coffee (right) so that it can beep when they need to move onto . the next step, ensuring precision . A recent . study has revealed that regardless of how precisely a person makes their . coffee, the brew releases more flavour if they gulp it down. Scientists said that taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly. They looked at ‘sip volume’ when drinking coffee and found larger sips have a ‘higher aroma release’. The . researchers said: ‘The findings could be useful to understand the . factors which contribute to attract consumers to the pleasant aroma of . coffee.’ However, . the advice goes against that for other drinks, such as wine, where . people are advised to take small amounts in their mouth to get the . maximum flavour and aroma. The app then generates a time for how long the process will take. Users can set alarms to remind them when to start pouring in water and when to stir, for example. ‘Large numbers, clear alert sounds, and a bold progress indicator make it easy to keep your attention on your coffee,’ according to the App Store. Because users can customise the process for a certain type of coffee, they can explore the subtle science of getting the best out of beans and make tiny tweaks to each cup they make until they reach the perfect formula. 'I came up with the idea for Brewseful . when I was just starting to become interested in nice coffee,' Zweerink told MailOnline. 'I was . using the regular stopwatch app on my phone, but I wanted a more . specialised timer that could help keep track of all the different . parameters that go into a really solid cup, something that would allow . me to make small tweaks and gradual improvements each time I brewed.' He does not think that his app will change the way people drink coffee, but he doesn't want it to, as he likes the way people have personalised rituals for making a cup. 'I hope that Brewseful can play a small part in keeping track of the details and help people find what tastes best for them,' he said.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The fight or flight response is well known, but now scientists have discovered brain cells that control the desire to fight – and mate. While researchers found that innate social behaviours like mating and aggression are closely related long ago, this is the first time they have pinpointed specific neurons deep in the brain that trigger them. They discovered that it is possible to switch the behaviour of a mouse from ‘sniffing and mounting’ to attacking by increasing how strongly the neurons were stimulated. Brainy breakthrough: For the first time researchers have pinpointed the specific neutrons deep in the hypothalamus of a mouse's brain (circled in orange) that trigger fighting and mating. Here, nerve fibres (the yellow lines) emanate from estrogen receptor-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus (yellow dots) that control aggression . The researchers discovered the specific neurons responsible for fighting and mating deep in the brain of mice and could switch between the behaviours using pulses of light. If the neurons were strongly activated by pulses of light, a male mouse attacked another male or female. Weaker activation of the same neurons triggered ‘sniffing and mounting,’ or mating behaviours. The study results suggest that the level of activity within the population of neurons may control the decision between mating and fighting. Biologist David J Anderson led a team at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) that genetically identified neurons that control aggressive behaviour in the mouse hypothalamus - a structure that lies deep in the brain. They managed this by using pulses of light to stimulate the neurons in a method called optogenetics. Optogenetics uses light emitted by LEDS mounted to the skull, or deeply implanted optical fires, to control neurons that have been genetically sensitised to light. The scientists found that when the neurons were strongly activated by pulses of light a male mouse attacked another male or female. However, weaker activation of the same neurons triggered ‘sniffing and mounting,’ or mating behaviours. A love and a fighter: If the neurons were strongly activated by pulses of light, a male mouse (pictured) attacked another male or female. However, weaker activation of the same neurons triggered 'sniffing and mounting,' or mating behaviours . They found that they could switch the behaviour of a single animal from mounting to attack by gradually increasing the strength of neuronal stimulation during a social encounter. The results of the study, which was published in Nature, suggest that the level of activity within the population of neurons may control the decision between mating and fighting. The neurons were initially identified because they express a protein receptor for the hormone oestrogen - reinforcing the view that oestrogen plays an important role in the control of male aggression. Because the human brain contains a hypothalamus that is structurally similar to that in the mouse, these results may be relevant to human behaviour too.","Scientists from Caltech pinpointed the specific neutrons responsible for the behaviours in the brains of mice for the first time .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From composing a tactful message to crying into tissues, breaking up is hard to do. But it appears that there are popular times of year to ditch a partner and, surprisingly, just after Valentine’s Day is one of them. A significant number of people also call time on their relationship just before Christmas – perhaps to avoid buying their significant other a lavish present. It's me not you: Two weeks before Christmas and a short time after Valentine's Day are popular times of year to ditch a partner, based on Facebook status updates, according to an infographic (pictured) created by David McCandless and Lee Byron . One in six Americans have dumped someone - or had someone dump them - by text message, email, or through social networks, a recent study revealed. People aged between 18 and 29 are the most likely to break up via text or email. A total of 16% of 30 to 49-year-olds have sent a message and 7% of over 50s. The trend has been linked to the rising popularity of online dating sites. The findings are shown in an infographic created by London-based data journalist David McCandless and Lee Byron for a book called The Visual Miscellaneum and is based upon the analysis of Facebook updates. It shows that the most popular time to break up is shortly after Valentine’s Day, when people appear to be spring cleaning their lives as well as their homes. A smaller peak occurs on April Fools day and curiously more people seem to break up on Mondays in April and early May than on other days. Not so merry Christmas: Plenty of people also call time on their relationship a couple of weeks before Christmas - perhaps to avoid buying their significant other a lavish present. However, very few people are dumped on Christmas Day, which is considered 'too cruel' The infographic, posted on the blog Information is Beautiful, shows that people are more likely to break up earlier rather than later in the summer and that more couples go their separate ways as the nights draw in and winter approaches. While the Christmas period is thought to be ‘too cruel’ to dump a partner, two weeks before the big event is the most popular time of all. A recent study found that young people increasingly choose to dump their partners electronically. An online relationships report from Pew Research Centre found both sexes are guilty of breaking up with someone online, but women marginally beat men by one per cent.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Today host Matt Lauer has opened up about how he first discovered his co-host Savannah Guthrie, 42, was pregnant, and reveals some of the sneaky tactics he employed to help her conceal it during team nights out at Russia's Sochi Winter Olympics. During a joint appearance on Tuesday's Late Night With Seth Meyers, he explained that during rowdy staff dinners, Ms Guthrie would sometimes 'hand [him] a shot' so she could mask the fact that she was skipping alcohol. 'So Savannah owes me a liver right now,' he joked. What friends are for: Matt Lauer (left) has admitted to taking shots on behalf of his co-host, five-months-pregnant Savannah Guthrie (right), to conceal that fact that she was avoiding alcohol in Sochi . It also came to light that Mr Lauer realized she was pregnant when he noticed her 'faking' shots during a previous drinking game one night. A restaurant employee was apparently teaching guests how to take shots 'military-style' off their elbows, when he realized Ms Guthrie wasn't actually swallowing the alcohol. He says 'a light bulb went on' when he returned to his hotel room later that night, after which he promptly sent his co-host a text. Olympic shots! Mr Lauer first realized that Ms Guthrie might be pregnant when he noticed her elaborately 'faking' shots during a drinking came one evening on their Sochi trip . 'I texted her, ""Are you pregnant?"" And I got this very curt message back. Like, ""Yes. Shut up. Don’t tell anyone”', he told Mr Meyers. Ms Guthrie, who is now five months pregnant, but didn't go public with the news until after she returned from Russia, laughed and clarified that her actual response was different. 'What I said was, ""How can you ask me that when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is listening to us!”' she exclaimed. Glowing: Ms Guthrie, who is set to give birth in August, returned to the Today show at the start of this week after a week long 'honey-babymoon' Today's Natalie Morales says she also noticed that Ms Guthrie had started shying away from alcohol during the Sochi trip, admitting: 'Some of us had caught on.' Ms Guthrie concluded by saying that she appreciated her female colleague's discretion. 'Here’s the difference between you [to Ms Morales], and you, [to Mr Lauer]... Natalie suspected but did not ask,' she said. 'Matt went all ""Matt Lauer"" on me!' How can you ask me that when Putin is listening to us! Ms Guthrie returned to the Today show on Monday after her week-long 'honey-babymoon'. The glamorous host, who married communications consultant Michael Feldman, 45, on March 15, even found time to blog while she was off work, telling fans how 'glorious' her 'pregnancy beach vacation' was. In an April 23 post titled 'Letting it all hang out on the best vacation of my life', she continued: 'Vacationing while pregnant is an excellent excuse to let it all hang out and not worry about how you look in a bathing suit. Non-stop: The 42-year-old, who married communications consultant Michael Feldman, 45, on March 15, even found time to blog while she was off work, telling fans how 'glorious' her 'pregnancy beach vacation' was .

The location was not mentioned. 'Gone fishin. And by ""fishin"" I mean lounging on the beach #honeybabymoon See you next wk,' she wrote. Ms Guthrie's colleagues certainly . appeared to have missed her. Matt Lauer excitedly tweeted a pictrure of . her in the TV studio this morning captioned 'She's back!' and the Today . Show twitter feed also welcomed her 'home'. 'I am going to eat what I want. I am . going to drink what I want. I am just going to enjoy the miracle that is pregnancy' One of her first tasks back was to talk about her changing body in light of new research showing that women spend an average of 50 minutes daily in front of their own reflections. As she looked at herself in a mirror, Ms Guthrie said: 'I love my baby bump. I love the fact that I'm 42 years old and lucky enough to get this chance, and the human body is remarkable. 'I'm divinely inspired, i think, to be able to create life. so right now, I'm just loving that my body is able to do this and produce life.' The broadcaster admitted in her baby blog earlier this month that she feared she would never become a mother. She and Mr Felman  are expecting their first child together this August and they are choosing not to find out the sex before. Whirlwind: She and her new husband, Michael Feldman, are expecting their first child together this August . The couple tied the knot outside Ms Guthrie's home town of Tucson, Arizona, last month without publicizing the event to media. During the course of the evening the newlyweds privately announced to family and friends that they were expecting a child. Ms Guthrie later went public with her 'surprise' wedding and pregnancy news on the Today show.

December last year. Luckily, despite her worst fears, the gown still fitted on her big day. Ms Guthrie added that it had been tough to keep her wedding and pregnancy a secret especially with her high public profile.

Angela Ahrendts has landed one of the biggest ‘golden hellos’ in business history, with Apple welcoming her to her new role with a deal worth a staggering $68million (£40million). Ahrendts is credited with turning Burberry’s fortunes around and while there became the first woman to top the City pay league in Britain with a total package of £16.9million ($28million) along with an 80 per cent staff discount and £25,000 ($40,000) Burberry clothing allowance. She left Burberry last year after eight years in the job to run Apple’s 423 stores and its retail website – and her pay deal dwarfs her previous one. Apple said she will receive 113,334 shares in the company worth $600 each, amounting to $68million, providing she hits her targets over the next four years, The Times reports. CEO Tim Cook described her as 'wicked smart' when he announced her arrival to staff, the paper said. Her shock departure from Burberry wiped nearly $910million (£536million) off Burberry’s value. Ms Ahrendts, 53, transformed the brand over her tenure, and is credited with 'de-chavving' its image after its famous check became popular with minor celebrities and football fans. The company, which has been transformed into a global luxury brand with a growing presence in emerging markets, revealed a 17 per cent growth in underlying retail sales in the six months to the end of September 2013. The share prices later recovered some of their losses in early trading to be down 3.8 per cent at 1,524 pence at about 8am. Ms Ahrendts joined Burberry in January 2006, and became chief executive six months later. The company, whose models currently include Cara Delevingne and David and Victoria Beckham’s son Romeo, has been one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 under her leadership.

"By . James  Nye . For more than 50-years rumors have persisted of a top-secret base operated by the CIA - from where the spy agency planned the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and still keeps stockpiles of chemical weapons. Its existence has never been officially confirmed, but a new investigation claims the location for the covert base is in fact just 20 miles north of San Antonio, Texas, at the US Army facility Camp Stanley. Referred to mysteriously over the years by the anodyne Midwest Depot, the bland code word belies the supposed role it has played over the years as the CIA fought clandestine wars in Angola, to Iran-contra to the arming of Afghan rebels. Totally nondescript: This is the bland entrance to Camp Stanley outside San Antonio - which reportedly is the site for the CIA's most secret base - Midwest Depot . Documents that reveal brief mentions have been poured over by the New York Times, while former CIA analyst Allen Thomson has indicated that Camp Stanley is indeed the storied third CIA facility in the US, in addition to the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and Camp Peary, a military base near Williamsburg, Virginia, known by its code name, 'The Farm.' Thomson asserts that the Camp Stanley Storage Activity (CSSA) was established in 1949 and 'has always been the cover for Midwest Depot, then the covert facility dates to the earliest days of the CIA and, speculatively, may have been created to provide an arms channel to resistance groups in Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe and elsewhere.' Indeed, Camp Stanley has most likely played a hitherto unheralded role in some of the most contentious historical events since the 1960s. It is allegedly where Cuban exiles prepared for the disastrous and farcical Bay of Pigs invasion attempt to topple Fidel Castro. The facility has also been tied to arming rebels in Nicaragua and providing AK-47 rifles to Afghanistan's Northern Alliance after 9/11, so that they could battle the Taliban. 'To be a little dramatic about it, how many of those AK-47s and RPG-7s we see Islamists waving around today passed through the Midwest Depot on their way to freedom fighters in past decades?' Thomson told The New York Times. Run of the mill: This is an aerial shot of the base known as Midwest Depot - which is where the CIA reportedly keeps its supply of weapons for far-off wars . A huge grey area of 4,000 acres on the map, Camp Stanley is south of Fair Oaks ranch near Interstae 10, 20 miles of downtown San Antonio. It maintains a low-key gatehouse and some visible warehouses around the perimeter. Satellite images reveals dozens of nondescript bunkers lining the interior of the base. According to The New York Times, Camp Stanley is so secret that a congressional investigator during the Iran-contra affair in the 1980s made the observation that the facility where the CIA kept missiles bound for Iran classified, even as other 'incredible things were unveiled during the hearings.' Three years ago it was acknowledged that the base was a munitions storage facility, but no more. Failed invasion: Castro's troops at Playa de Citron after successfully repelling the US-backed invasion of the Bay of Pigs - which was allegedly planned at Camp Stanley in the 1960s . Repelled: Fidel Castro conducts a mass interview of the prisoners captured in the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion . 'The mission of Camp Stanley is the receipt, storage and issuance of ordnance material as well as quality assurance testing and maintenance of military weapons and ammunition,' Phil Reidinger, a spokesman for the Army Medical Department Center and School, said Monday. 'Because of its ordnance missions, Camp Stanley is a controlled-access facility.' However, research published in December by retired CIA analyst Thomson, who worked for the CIA from 1972-1985, includes a '1967 CIA memo linking Camp Stanley to paramilitary training of Cuban exiles before the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and a 1987 memo showing that equipment bound for the Nicaraguan Contras passed through' the facility, according to the Times. In their research The New York Times also discovered a 1963 CIA memo that discusses 300 tons of C-4 plastic explosives available in the 'Midwest Depot stocks' with no restrictions 'because the items have world-wide distribution and are consequently deniable.' Langley: CIA Headquarters is one of only two acknowledged facilities used by the spy agency - the other one being Camp Peary, a military base near Williamsburg, Virginia, known by its code name, The Farm . A 2009 interview with an anonymous CIA logistics officer claimed that AK-47 rifles sent to the Northern Alliance after 9/11 came from the Midwest Depot. Also, arms sent to anti-Marxist fighters in the Angolan civil war in the 1970s claimed the same. Thomson, who claims to have never known the location of Midwest Depot during his time at the CIA told The New York Times he had found an explicit reference in a 1986 memo by the notorious Colonel Oliver North - the key figure in the Iran-contra affair. The memo stated that the CIA would transport missiles bound for Iran to 'Midwest Depot, Texas' in anticipation of flying them out of Kelly Air Force base. Mentioned in memos: Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver North, former aide to former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, is sworn in on 9 December 1986 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C. on arms sales to Iran .

In July, according to Thomson, the army bought two million rounds of ammunition of the same caliber to fit Ak-47s, which American soldiers do not use. The delivery address was Camp Stanley. However, the key revelation in identifying Camp Stanley as Midwest Depot was the 2011 lawsuit filed by former CIA employee Kevin Shipp. He claimed his family, who lived at a government owned house at Camp Stanley, fell ill because of toxins at the base. The lawsuit and subsequent memoir written by Shipp was prevented, but his son Joel, who is not bound by confidentiality has written a memoir of his own. In it he refers to Camp Stanley as 'a secret base which had been used for illegal arms running and chemical weapons storage.'","US Army Facility Camp Stanley is reputed to be the top secret CIA base known only as Midwest Depot .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Phablets - a cross between a phone and tablet - have typically divided gadget fans, either they’re too big, too small or not powerful enough. A team of researchers in Canada have created a potential solution with a device that changes from a phone to a tablet and a notebook, using a set of screens and hinges. The foldable gadget can be made smaller for texting, or larger for reading maps, and can even create a makeshift laptop with a keyboard. Scroll down for video . The shape-changing PaperFold, pictured, consists of three screens fixed together using hinges. The individual screens can be used independently or as a single system. Displays can be folded inwards to form a phone, or outwards to form a tablet-sized device when reading a map, for example . In PaperFold, each display tile can act independently or as part of a single system. It automatically recognises its shape and changes its graphics to provide different functionality upon shape changes. For example, folding two screens into a notebook shape opens up a keyboard on the bottom screen.

"By . Meghan Keneally . The first openly gay college basketball player Derrick Gordon has publicly debuted his relationship with an actor more than twice his age. Gordon, 22, attended the GLAAD media awards on Saturday with 47-year-old Gerald McCullouch who is best known for his role on CSI. The two men walked the red carpet together and posted multiple photos of their evening onto their widely-followed Twitter accounts. Scroll down for video . Going public: Gerald McCullouch (left) and Derrick Gordon (right) walked the red carpet together at the Saturday evening GLAAD media awards in New York City, making their debut as a couple . 'A night that I will never forget and a night that I didnt want to end.....@glaad  #betrue #loveislove,' Gordon wrote, tagging McCullouch's handle @ItsAHardG. Gordon later called McCullouch 'handsome' in response to a different Tweet. 'Unforgettable event last night....THANK YOU GLAAD...@ItsAHardG ..@glaad #Betrue #beyourself #loveislove,' he wrote in a later post. Gordon also posted a photo from inside the event while posing with McCullouch and Wilson Cruz, the spokesman for GLAAD. '22 years old now...4 years ago I wouldnt have never imagine my life changing so much and being at the GLAAD AWARDS...IM TRULY BLESSED!!!!' he wrote on Sunday. Making the message clear: Gordon shared a number of pictures of the night with a few important hashtags . Big night: The awards capped off a big few weeks for Gordon as he came out in early April . 'Living it up!' Gordon shared this picture of himself with McCullouch and Wilson Cruz, the GLAAD spokesman . Gordon, a sophomore guard on the UMass team, made the announcement about his sexuality via an interview with ESPN in early April and was met with resounding praise. 'It's a lot of weight lifted off my shoulders. I can finally breathe now and live life happily,' he said. Their joint appearance was the first time that the two men have been spotted together since Gordon came out earlier this month. During that interview, Gordon mentioned an earlier boyfriend but did not say his name and it was implied that they had broken up. McCullouch has long been open about his sexuality and has starred in a number of gay-themed films and television shows. Groundbreaking: Gordon, a UMass-Amherst sophomore, is the first openly gay college basketball player in Division 1 . Most recently, he has been promoting a web series that he is starring in called Husling, which follows the lives of a group of sex workers. McCulloch was not the only one that Gordon was happy to see at the GLAAD event, however, as he posted about how Kylie Minogue danced on their table and they were seated alongside Naomi Watts, George Michael and George Takei. The weekend of support didn't end when the GLAAD awards came to a close. Two days later, Gordon posted that he had a good chat with Michael Sam, the first openly gay NFL player, and Jason Collins, the first openly gay NBA player, calling them his 'big brothers'. Neither were able to make it to the Saturday night ceremony.","Derrick Gordon walked the red carpet with Gerald McCullouch and their loving tweets hinted at a relationship .

She's the queen of delivering rejection as a judge on her long-running show, America's Next Top Model, and now it looks like Tyra Banks has got a taste of her own medicine. According to RadarOnline.com, the 40-year-old runway pro was snubbed by Victoria's Secret when she suggested she make a 'surprise' appearance in last December's annual CBS televised show. '[Ms Banks] was rejected by the brand and the network, despite her long affiliation with the company,' the undisclosed source said. 'She’s outraged and is threatening to never to work with Victoria’s Secret again.' Snubbed: Tyra Banks, 40, allegedly attempted to make a 'surprise' appearance at December's televised Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, but was rejected despite her long affiliation with the company . The reasons behind her alleged rejection? She's old news, apparently. 'Tyra’s feelings were hurt because the excuse she was given is that the audience likes to see the newest models, not the ""veterans"" on the runway during the VS TV show,' the source explained. Ms Banks, who enjoyed a lucrative career as one of the lingerie giant's original Angels for eight years between 1997 and 2005, was said to have been 'dying' to make a comeback.

Since then, the supermodel mogul has been running and co-hosting her wildly successful America's Next Top Model show, and will be working on its 21st cycle this summer. She also announced earlier this year that was would be appearing in a sequel to Disney's cult hit, Life-Size, due out next year. Newer models: Victoria's Secret apparently felt their audience were more interested in its 'newest models' (as seen in this cast shot from the show Tyra wanted to walk) rather than its 'veterans' But as for those angel wings, it appears she won't be dusting them off and re-attaching them any time soon. The December show, in which she reportedly wanted to appear, pulled in almost ten million viewers and showcased long-time Angels Adriana Lima, for her 14th year running, and Alessandra Ambroiso for her 13th year, as well as fledgling Angels Lily Aldridge, Toni Garrn and Behati Prinsloo. 'Tyra doesn’t want to make a public spectacle out of the snub, because it would make all the parties involved look bad, the source concluded.

By contrast, her erstwhile beau appears to have been having the time of his life in Memphis, where his best friend Guy Pelly married American socialite, Lizzy Wilson on Saturday. The prince, who was seen ‘twerking’ on the dance floor, was having such a good time at the ‘unbelievably wild’ party that he made the band play five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Johnny Weir announced in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday that he and on-again-off-again husband Victor Voronov are back together again. The figure skating fashion cop broke the happy news of their second reconciliation in as many months in a 4am tweet along with a plea for privacy and a bit of understanding. 'My husband and I have happily reconciled,' wrote the 29-year-old. 'Please respect our privacy and integrity at this time.' Aaaaand we're back! Figure skating fashionisto Johnny Weir took to twitter in the pre-dawn early monring hours Tuesday to announce that he and once-estranged husband Victor Voronov have again agreed to bury the bejeweled hatchet . Flighty: The medal-winning figure skater made his announcement just days after he appeared at the Kentucky Derby wearing a feathered hat featuring a flying horse . 'Love is dangerous,' he went on. 'Love is safe. Love is ugly. Love is beautiful.' Weir and Voronov had been putting on a high-profile display of all love's aspects since first announcing their split in March. 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together,' he tweeted back on March 19 in a subdued start to a roller coaster and very public breakup that ensued. Days later, Weir told Access Hollywood of the 'personal hell' he was experiencing when the cameras turned off during his stint as a Sochi commentator because of Voronov, who he called abusive. 'Some of my closest friends have seen him hit me before,' he said at the time. Not to be outdone, Weir's non-practicing, Georgetown-educated attorney husband shot back with accusations of Weir's infidelity. TMZ revealed court documents in which Voronoz painted himself as a victim of Weir's theatrical self obsession and said Weir cheated on him with a porn star and a club owner. TMZ also posted a photo allegedly showing a nasty little bite mark on Voronov's arm left by Weir after a spat. According to Radar, it subsequently leaked that Weir used gay sex hookup app Grindr on which the skater sent  full-front naked selfies to other men. The battle raged, though with fewer tantalizing public details, until around mi-April. Happier times: The couple had been married just two years (pictured here is their 2011 wedding day) when they announced their divorce in March . Real victim? The couple's dog Tema became a source of drama as Voronov accused Weir of holding the canine hostage . Weir and Voronov married in what looked to be a match made in heaven back in 2011, but a little over two years in, things publicly started to go down hill fast. Because they also went uphill just as quickly--and on more than one occasion--here is a timeline of the breakups and makeups and some of the juicy bits therein. Breakup, March 19: Weir announced the split via a tweet that read, 'My husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts, and I wish him well. Weir quickly decided he no longer wished Voronov well as he accused the out of work lawyer of physical and emotional abuse. Voronov shot back with accusations of mÃ©nage Ã  trois infidelities, Weir's own violent streak (he said Weir bit him) and a claim that the skater was holding their little dog Tema hostage. Makeup, April 14: Voronov reportedly agreed to reconcile and move back into the couple's home, but only if Weir agreed to publicly apologize. The next day, Weir hit back with a sexually explicit 5-page 'post-nuptial' agreement. Breakup, April 16: it was revealed that the couple were not patching things up after all, which Voronov publicly blamed on Weir's mother Pamela. Weir remained mostly silent after this breakup. Makeup, May 6: Weir took to Twitter at 4am to happily announce his second reconciliation with Voronov in two months, writing: . 'To love hard, is the greatest gift, even with all it's flaws. Keep shining.' That's when makeup number one came as Voronov agreed to move back in with Weir so long as he agree to a list of stipulations that included a public apology from Weir and written agreement that the skater's mother must butt out of their married life. Weir then shot back the next day with a bizarre 'post-nuptial agreement' with the reality star's own demands. The 5-page document included a list of no-no's like extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation outside the marriage, denied each the right to be 'in close range' of any exes and required bi-yearly STD tests from both parties. Something . about the list must not have settled well with Voronov, because the . following day the couple were off again thanks to Weir's mom Patti, who . Voronov told Us Weekly was 'definitely the source of the breakdown of . our marriage.' Fast . forward to 4am on Tuesday morning and, without revealing how fences . were mended or if his mother finally butt out, Weir happily announced he . was back with Voronov. He tweeted following his announcement: . 'To love hard, is the greatest gift, even with all it's flaws. Keep shining.' Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding and emotionally abusive husband .

"By . Sam Webb . The pressure on under-fire TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson intensified today after it emerged that communications watchdog Ofcom is investigating his motoring show Top Gear to see if a recent episode that sparked a race row breached broadcasting guidelines. The episode, filmed in Burma and Thailand and shown in March, featured a scene where the motoring show’s stars built a bridge over the River Kwai and as an Asian man walked over it Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there’s a slope on it.' Slope is seen by many as a derogatory term for people of Asian descent, and the show’s producer had to step in . and apologise for what he called a 'light-hearted' joke.Scroll down for video . Controversy: Comments made by Jeremy Clarkson, pictured during the series finale of Top Gear with co star Richard Hammond, are being investigated by a media watchdog . The segment on Top Gear, which is fronted by (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, may have counted as a breach of 'content standards' The Ofcom investigation will look at whether the clip counted as a breach of 'content standards'. Somi Guha, an actress who complained to the BBC, said the language used was an example of 'casual racism' and 'gross misconduct'. Clarkson used his Twitter account to respond to the allegations after they first came to light, and said: 'I'm not a racist. I am currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives quite near Wales.' But in contrast, Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman  said he regretted the 'light-hearted' wordplay and realised 'that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas'. Andy Wilman made the statement after Indian-born Ms Guha instructed lawyers to make a formal complaint about the use of the word, which she described as 'casual racism'. In a statement, Mr Wilman said: 'When we used the word ""slope"" in the recent Top Gear Burma special it was a light-hearted wordplay joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local Asian man who was crossing it. 'We were not aware at the time, and it has subsequently been brought to our attention, that the word ""slope"" is considered by some to be offensive and although it might not be widely recognised in the UK, we appreciate that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas, for example in Australia and the USA. It comes after a troubled few weeks for the show and its most famous presenter who is reportedly getting divorced from his wife after 21 years of marriage. Clarkson was embroiled in controversy last week when it was claimed he used the n-word while reciting the nursery rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe during filming of BBC2’s Top Gear. The Daily Mirror saw unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two similar sports cars and claims the word 'n*****' can be heard. Mr Clarkson, shown filming for Top Gear, when it is alleged he used the n-word - a claim he denies . Warning: The presenter, pictured apologising, said he is now on his final warning from the Corporation . Clarkson said he 'mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur' in two takes, and used the word 'teacher' in its place in a third. He claims the BBC has put him on his final warning for 'appearing' to use the racial slur in unaired Top Gear footage - and he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again. Jeremy Clarkson with his wife Frances Cain. The couple are reportedly getting divorced after 21 years of marriage . The 54-year-old admitted 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy. And despite begging for forgiveness less than two days ago for the clip, Clarkson also claimed the Corporation had forced him to apologise and he did not want to. Writing in his weekly column in The Sun, the presenter compared the apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian civil war because they were both things he had not done. 'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that,' he wrote. 'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one. 'An apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's shirt... But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and hoping the story would die down as a result?' The pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer, he claimed. Ms Goha is also . suing the BBC for up to £1million. Ms Guha claims that broadcasting . Clarkson's comment amounts to unlawful discrimination by a public body. Racist? Didier Dogba, pictured, is Jeremy Clarkson's West Highland terrier . Her . lawyers, Equal Justice, claim her action could cost the BBC £1million . in punitive damages under equality laws unless it apologises and takes . the hit motoring show off the air. They . say she is one of a group of people who were offended by the term - and . so sought legal advice from the firm, who previously worked on racism . allegations surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother. A BBC spokeswoman for Top Gear said the Corporation had no comment on Miss Guha's action. March 16: Top Gear Burma special featuring 'slope' remark airs in the UK. March 29: Indian-born actress Somi Guha reveals she is suing the BBC for up to £1million over 'slope' remark.

April 23: Top gear executive producer Andy Wilman says he 'regrets' use of the word 'slope' being broadcast bit insisted it was 'light-hearted wordplay'. May 1: Clarkson denied allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series. In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. May 2: Clarkson releases a statement saying it was 'inevitable' the BBC would eventually sack him but ‘begged’ for public forgiveness after the footage was aired. May 6: Reports emerge that Clarkson and his wife, Frances, are getting divorced. May 6: Ofcom announce investigation into Top Gear episode featuring 'slope' remark . In April Clarkson was accused of racism for naming his dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba. The 54-year-old Top Gear host was criticised after tweeting a picture of his black West Highland terrier and revealing he had named it after the striker, a prolific goal scorer from the Ivory Coast. Clarkson, who often mocks political correctness, asked: ‘Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’ Today, Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife added to claims the BBC presenter is getting divorced - and insisted his current partner deserves a large chunk of his estimated £30million fortune. Alex Hall, . who was married to the Top Gear star for six months, came out in support . of his current wife, Frances, from whom he is said to be getting . divorced. Miss Hall said Frances had supported Clarkson throughout his lucrative TV career and so deserved a generous divorce settlement. Top Gear has been at the centre of a number of controversies. In . 2008, the show was rapped by the BBC Trust for showing Clarkson and . fellow presenter James May sipping gin and tonic at the wheel during a . stunt. During . a press conference in Australia in February 2009, Clarkson branded then . Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' In . 2011, Hammond was discussing a Mexican sports car and suggested that . vehicles reflect the national characteristics of the country they are . from. He . said: 'Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, . leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a . hole in the middle on as a coat.' The . Mexican ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza did make a formal . complaint to the BBC and called on the presenters to make a public . apology for stirring 'bigoted feelings against the Mexican people'. 'Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations, but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception. 'A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear, in which I quoted the rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe. 'Now, . of course, I was well aware that in the best known version of this . rhyme, there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid. 'The full rushes show that I did three takes. 'In . two I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the . third, I replaced it all together with the word ""teacher"". 'Now . when I viewed this footage, several weeks later, I realised that in one . of the mumbled versions, if you listen very carefully with the sound . turned right up, it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was . trying to obscure. 'I was mortified by this, horrified, it is a word I loathe. 'And I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted. 'In fact, I have here the note I sent at the time to the production office. 'And . it says, ""I didn't use the n-word here but I've just listened through . my headphones and it sounds like I did.

Two 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' stars have failed to cough up $20,000 they each pledged to donate to the Detroit Public Schools Foundation in Sunday night's episode - which was filmed nearly six weeks ago. NeNe Leakes challenged fellow cast member Kenya Moore, a former Miss USA who is from Detroit, to donate the sizable sum to a charity, during part three of a sixth-season reunion of the Bravo TV show. The move was designed to show that Moore is broke. But Moore agreed, picking the education nonprofit, which supports value-added programs and activities for the benefit of the bankrupt city's schools. No check: Two 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' stars - NeNe Leakkes and Kenya Moore, pictured, have failed to cough up $20,000 they each pledged to donate to the Detroit Public Schools Foundation in Sunday night's episode - which was filmed nearly six weeks ago . However, the charity hasn't seen a dollar of the apparently generous gifts. 'No we haven't (heard anything about the donations),' Foundation president Glenda Price told MailOnline Tuesday. 'I'm certainly hoping we do hear something. There has been a tremendous amount of interest generated but there hasn't been any official word about contributions.' Price said she was surprised but overjoyed when she heard news of the intended cash injection. The two rivals agreed to donate the money during a heated exchange between the two over Leakes' behavior at a charitable event Moore had organized. 'Since you felt that I behaved so badly at your charity event, I will do this for you,' Leakes said. 'Let's . put our differences aside for a day of charity. You pick the charity of . your choice.

"By . Juliet Paylor . Britney Spears has been sued for accidentally breaking a dancer's nose after showing up in a 'disheveled and confused state' to a rehearsal for the 'Work B****' video. The incident is said to have occurred while rehearsing for her music video on August 19 last year, TMZ reports. Dancer and actress Dawn Noel claims that the 32-year-old was struggling to perform even the most simple moves when she arrived to the Woodland Hills studio to rehearse with her backing dancers. In hot water: Britney Spears will apparently be served with a lawsuit on Monday after she accidentally broke backing dancer Dawn Noel's nose during rehearsals for her Work Bitch music video on August 19 last year . According to Ms Noel, she was standing to the side of the star when Spears twirled around in an unbalanced manner and extended her arms, whacking the dancer square across the face. The plaintiff says the blow was of such considerable force that everyone in the studio heard a 'cracking sound'. 'Plaintiff Dawn Noel felt immediate . intense pain and grabbed her nose, at which time defendant Britney . Spears said ""sorry"" and then continued to attempt to learn the dance . routine,' the lawsuit reads. Seeking damages: According to Dawn Noel, the pop star was 'in a dishevelled and confused state' and twirled around in an unbalanced manner when she thrust her arms out to the side, smacking her in the face . Halfhearted apology: According to the plaintiff, the 32-year-old singer only offered an 'I'm sorry' and continued with rehearsals despite the dancer being in excruciating pain . Unable to . take the discomfort any longer, Ms Noel sought medical attention half an . hour later, during which she was told she had a nasal bone fracture . requiring surgery. Noel . claims that although she was promised by the star's people that her . medical bills would be taken care of, they've yet to cough up eight . months later. 'After . months of waiting for defendants to come through with their promise, . and making certain that this incident did not become public knowledge to . protect the privacy of all involved, defendants' representative then . advised that they would not pay for any of plaintiff's medical . treatment,' the lawsuit states. Attorney Sark Ohanian of Carpenter, Zuckerman & Rowley will file the lawsuit on behalf of his client on Monday. The . specific amount of compensation Ms Noel is seeking has not been . released but she is filing for damages due to battery, negligence and . medical expenses.

"By . Associated Press . and Francesca Chambers . Global warming is rapidly turning America the beautiful into America the stormy, sneezy and dangerous, according to a new federal scientific report. And those shining seas? Rising and costly, the report says. Climate change's assorted harms 'are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond,' concludes the 2014 National Climate Assessment released on Tuesday. The report emphasizes how warming and its all-too-wild weather are changing daily lives, even using the phrase 'climate disruption' as another way of saying global warming. Still, it's not too late to prevent the worst of climate change, says the 840-page report, which the White House is highlighting as it tries to jump-start often stalled efforts to curb heat-trapping gases. Scroll down for video . Global warming is rapidly turning America the beautiful into America the stormy, sneezy and dangerous, according to a new federal scientific report. Since January 2010, 43 of the lower 48 states have set at least one monthly record for heat. California had its warmest January on record this year. This March 13 photo shows cracks in the dry bed of the Stevens Creek Reservoir in Cupertino, California . Black line: Observed global average changes. Green area: model simulations using only changes in natural factors (solar and volcanic). Blue area: model simulations with the addition of human-induced emissions. Climate changes since 1950 cannot be explained by natural factors or variability, and can only be explained by human factors, the report says. However, if the nation and the world don't change the way they use energy, 'we're still on the pathway to more damage and danger of the type that are described in great detail in the rest of this report,' said study co-author Henry Jacoby, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jacoby, other scientists and White House officials said this is the most detailed and U.S.-focused scientific report on global warming. 'Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,' the report says. 'Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience.' The report looks at regional and state-level effects of global warming, compared with recent reports from the United Nations that lumped all of North America together. The map on the left shows a projected change in average annual temperature over the period 2071-2099 (compared to the period 1970-1999) under a scenario that assumes rapid reductions in emissions and concentrations of heat-trapping gases (RCP 2.6). The map on the right assumes continued increases in emissions (RCP 8.5). The colors on the map show temperature changes throughout the past 22 years (1991-2012) compared to the 1901-1960 average, and compared to the 1951-1980 average for Alaska and Hawaii. The bars on the graphs show the average temperature changes by decade for 1901-2012 (relative to the 1901-1960 average) for each region. The far right bar in each graph (2000s decade) includes 2011 and 2012. The period from 2001 to 2012 was warmer than any previous decade in every region. The map on the left shows the projected change in average temperature under a scenario that assumes substantial reductions in heat trapping gases (B11). The map on the right assumes continued increases in global emissions (A2) A draft of the report was released in January 2013, but this version has been reviewed by more scientists, the National Academy of Science and 13 government agencies and more than 4,000 public comments. It is written in a bit more simple language so people could realize 'that there's a new source of risk in their lives,' said study lead author Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University in Connecticut. The advisory committee responsible for the report - which includes representatives from 13 U.S. departments and agencies, academics, businesses and non-profits- released similar reports assessing the global climate in 2000 and 2009. Even though the nation's average temperature has risen by as much as 1.9 degrees since record keeping began in 1895, it's in the big, wild weather where the average person feels climate change the most, said co-author Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist. Extreme weather like droughts, storms and heat waves hit us in the pocketbooks and can be seen by our own eyes, she said. And it's happening a lot more often lately. The map shows percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events (defined as the heaviest 1% of all daily events) from 1958 to 2012 for each region of the continental United States. These trends are larger than natural variations for the Northeast, Midwest, Puerto Rico, Southeast, Great Plains, and Alaska. The trends are not larger than natural variations for the Southwest, Hawaii, and the Northwest. The report says the intensity, . frequency and duration of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have . increased since the early 1980s, but it is still uncertain how much of . that is from man-made warming. Winter . storms have increased in frequency and intensity and shifted northward . since the 1950s, it says. Also, heavy downpours are increasing — by 71 . percent in the Northeast. Experts expect the number of times it rains to go down, but the intensity of downpours to go up. Especially at risk in this region are the approximately 1.6 million people who live within the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) 100-year coastal flood zone, the majority of whom live in  New York and New Jersey. Heat waves, such as those in Texas in . 2011 and the Midwest in 2012, are projected to intensify nationwide. Droughts in the West and Southwest are expected to get stronger. The combination of the two are contributing the dryness that precedes raging wildfires. The report concludes that heat waves are 'largely a natural phenomenon,' but the increase in severity is 'likely due to human activity, with a detectable human influence in recent heat waves in the southern Great Plains, as well as in Europe, and Russia.' Human contributions to climate change 'approximately doubled the probability' Texas would experience record-breaking heat. In January 2013, none of California was in either extreme or exceptional drought; now nearly 77 percent of the state is.This year California had its warmest January on record. Since January . 2010, 43 of the lower 48 states have set at least one monthly record for . heat, . Nineteen different state records were broke in the last year alone,  according to an Associated Press analysis of federal weather . records. Six were for heat: . Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and . California.Nine states set monthly records for being too wet: Iowa . (twice, setting records for April and May last year), Georgia, Michigan, . New Jersey, Florida, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. Two states set . records for lack of rain: New Mexico and Utah. Two set records for . coldest individual months: Maine and North Dakota. 'We're being hit . hard,' Hayhoe said, comparing America to a boxer. 'We're holding steady, . and we're getting hit in the jaw. We're starting to recover from one . punch, and another punch comes.' The report also says 'climate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways.' Those include smoke-filled air from more wildfires, smoggy air from . pollution, more diseases from tainted food, water, mosquitoes and ticks. And then there's more . pollen because of warming weather and the effects of carbon dioxide on . plants. Ragweed pollen season has lengthened by 24 days in the . Minnesota-North Dakota region between 1995 and 2011, the report says. In . other parts of the Midwest, the pollen season has gotten longer by . anywhere from 11 days to 20 days. Sea level has . risen 8 inches since 1880 and is projected to rise between 1 foot and 4 . feet by 2100. Authors of the report worry that the Arctic Sea, which borders Alaska, Canada and Russia, could permanently become nearly ice free during the summer. Even if humans completely ended harmful emissions, temperatures are predicted to rise by 0.5°F throughout the next several decades, not withstanding unpredictable natural disasters that could affect the global climate. At the current rate of human activity, temperatures will rise 2- 4°F throughout the same period of time. And all this will come with a hefty cost, the report says. Flooding alone may cost $325 billion . by the year 2100 in one of the worst-case scenarios, with $130 billion . of that in Florida, the report says. Already the droughts and heat waves of 2011 and 2012 added about $10 billion to farm costs, the report says. Warning: The report claims that extreme weather events like Hurricane Sandy have and will become more common . Billion-dollar . weather disasters have hit everywhere across the nation, but have hit . Texas, Oklahoma and the Southeast most often, the report says. Of the more expensive weather events was the October 29, 2012 Superstorm Sandy. 'The resultant direct costs to the community and indirect costs to the economy will undoubtedly rise into the tens of billions of dollars,' the report says of the storm. The White House plans to use the long report as . scientific justification to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gas from . the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil and to encourage . local communities to adapt to changes in the climate, as outlined in President Barack Obama's 2013 Climate Action Plan. Republicans are not fans of Obama's plan. They have dubbed the White House's clean energy push a 'war on coal.' They’ll find various ways, particularly in the House, to try to stop us . from using the authority we have under the Clean Air Act. All I would . say is that those have zero percent chance of working. We’re committed . to moving forward with those rules,' White House counselor John Podesta told reporters on Monday during the White House press briefing. House Republicans are currently trying to pass legislation that would stop the Environmental Protection agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The new rules are scheduled to be unveiled next month, and Podesta said on Monday that the EPA is on track to meet that deadline.","The Obama administration released it's National Climate Assessment on Tuesday .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Benefits Street star White Dee is becoming a role model for a generation of Brits who think they don't have to work, a top Labour MP has claimed. Simon Danczuk, who was brought up by a single mother on benefits, attacked the 'circus' surrounding the controversial mother of two - who shot to fame as the star resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street. He told MailOnline her recent antics, where she was pictured enjoying a lavish holiday in Magaluf despite claiming she is too depressed to work, were 'fetishising benefits culture'. White Dee partied in Magaluf despite claiming that she was too ill to work . Dee - whose real name is Diedre Kelly - was seen partying in the Spanish resort, lounging by a pool and swigging Champagne during her four-day sunshine break. The trip sparked claims that she could be questioned by officials over whether her financial or medical circumstances had changed since the Channel 4 show. But the mother of two, who is said to receive around £200 a week in benefits, is now planning trips to France and Spain to raise her mood. Mr Danczuk said: 'I do not think it's healthy that White Dee is held up as some sort of poster girl for benefits. 'This fuels a culture whereby people think you can be famous for doing nothing, even claiming benefits. 'The welfare system is a vital safety net but it shouldn't be glamorised and the circus surrounding White Dee doesn't help anyone. 'She clearly has a lot to offer and should be known for realising her potential, not being on benefits. 'Dee needs supporting back into work and all the hangers on and TV agents that think caricaturing people on benefits is great for ratings should take a long hard look at themselves. 'We need to be encouraging people into work and helping them make something of themselves, not fetishising benefits culture.' Labour MP Simon Danczuk has attacked the circus around White Dee which is undermining support for the welfare safety net . During the controversial documentary Benefits Street, Dee said she had suffered from depression since her mother died and has 'good days and bad days' with the condition. Her agent told MailOnline earlier this week: ‘Dee has been back in the UK since Saturday. Dee had lots of fun as the many pictures show. ‘She missed the children [and] she hates flying, but she understands why we are trying to get her active to help us decide the suitability for some projects we would like her to undertake in the future. ‘She is not on Job Seekers’ Allowance as reported - she is on [Employment and] Support Allowance. We have been in touch with the benefits agency since we started to represent Dee in February.’ The Department for Work and Pensions has refused to comment on her case directly, but was prompted to mount a fresh defence of its welfare plans following anger at her holiday. A DWP Spokesman said: 'We are reforming disability benefits by introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews for Disability Living Allowance - something missing under the old system. 'We are also re-assessing people on incapacity benefits to see what work they can do - with the right support - rather than just writing them off on sickness benefits as happened in the past. 'Our welfare reforms will ensure that support goes to those who need it most.' There is no suggestion Dee has broken the rules, but since starring in Benefits Street she has appeared on TV several times and been linked with a string of new jobs including standing as an MP and becoming a TV chef. This week she took to Facebook to deny claims that she drank champagne while on her holiday. Dee, 42, said: ‘I’m turning into Jesus - making cloudy lemonade turn into booze. You gotta love the press haha.’ Her agent said she had been offered TV work but was still ‘too unwell’. ‘It is like a light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can do,’ he said of her condition. ‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’","Simon Danczuk says youngsters think they can get famous on benefits .

"By . Daniel Mills . He is already one of the most famous babies in the world. So how did Prince George manage to go unnoticed during an  outing with his Spanish nanny in New Zealand recently? While the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge where thrust under the spotlight of the New Zealand media in Christchurch, it appears baby George flew right under the radar while with his minder, Maria Borallo. Witnesses say they saw the world's most in-demand nine-month-old in a park during a day out in the New Zealand capital. Scroll down for video . Undercover: Maria Borrallo, seen here at Sydney Airport with George, went out with the little prince in Wellington but was not recognised . A day out: Frank Kitts Park where Prince George spent a portion of the day with his nanny Maria Borallo . Wellington ice cream business owner Barry Ludlow told Fairfax Media Prince George was accompanied by Ms Barallo, who is trained at the prestigious Norland College which has been producing childminders for the rich and famous since 1892. He said he served her up a 99c cone, which Ms Barallo took to nearby Frank Kitts Park along with Prince George. 'There were plenty of people walking around the waterfront, there were children everywhere, but I don't think anyone saw them. They didn't look out of place at all.' It is an incredible feat considering the amount of attention baby George drew while with mum and dad during the royal tour Down Under. Mr Ludlow said he thought he was the only one who recognised George, who was largely obscured from view inside his pram. Crowd pleaser: Despite becoming one of the most famous baby faces in the world overnight, the young prince escaped attention on his outing in Wellington . Well trained: Ms Borallo is a Norland nanny who has worked with other prominent high-society families in the past. He said he'd served icecream to plenty of famous people in the past and didn't treat his sighting of baby George has any different. Mr Ludlow's sighting was corroborated by two other sources close to the royal tour, according to Fairfax NZ. One said: 'I can say that it definitely happened.' 'I certainly don't think it was meant to be hidden that the little prince was playing in the park.' Even the city's mayor didn't deny the rumours, when contacted by Fairfax. She said she hoped they enjoyed a chance to have some peace and quiet without being recognised. Ludlow said he could not remember the date, but details of the weather that afternoon suggest it was April 14, when William and Kate left George at Government House in Wellington while they visited Christchurch. A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge declined to make a comment.","Maria Borallo was served while pushing baby George in his pram .

Usually the number one requirement of a map is accuracy, but one of the world’s first printed atlases - that contains a bizarre and distorted map of Britain - is on sale for £90,000. The barely unrecognisable shape of the British Isles was an interpretation of the works of Roman mathematician, astrologer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy. Ptolemy lived between 90-168 AD and wrote about the world’s geography in the Roman Empire. Normally the number one requirement of a map is for it to be accurate, but one of the world's first printed atlases (that contains a bizarre and distorted map of Britain pictured) is on sale for £90,000 . The atlas is an interpretation of the works of Roman mathematician, astrologer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy . It wasn’t until 1,300 years later after the process of printing developed that Ptolemy's works were turned into a printed atlas, called Cosmographia. One rare copy of the book has now emerged for sale in London. On the pages that cover Britain, the outline for the coast of France, Belgium and Holland is comparatively accurate.

The south west of England, famous for its rugged coastline, is a rectangular shape with straight lines, while the south east from Southampton to Kent is pushed upwards at a 45 degree angle. The rest of England is much narrower, and the east coast is where Birmingham, Nottingham and Leeds should be. Although the Welsh coastline is recognisable, Scotland appears to have grown a large appendage that sticks out into the North Sea and spreads across to where Norway is. Because Britain is half the size it should be, the North Sea, or Oceanus Germanicus, is twice as wide. To the west, Ireland is reasonably accurate in terms of shape, although it is positioned further north than it ought to be. Rupert .

'All 15th century books by their nature are pretty scarce, not many copies survive today.' Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . TV show Grand Designs is deterring people from building their own home because they think it must be a Hobbit’s house constructed from ‘yoghurt and goat hair’, a government minister has warned. Nick Boles said self-build should be an affordable option for people struggling to get on to the property ladder. But the planning minister told MailOnline that it need not involve a ‘funky architect’ drawing up plans for dramatic dwellings which look like the ‘Battlestar Galactica has landed on Surrey’. Channel 4's Grand Designs, hosted by Kevin McCloud, risks putting people off the idea of building their own home . The government has unveiled a £150million fund to kickstart a wave of self-build across the country. The money will be used to provide up to 10,000 serviced plots which are ready to be built on, with water, sewage and power supplies, a dropped kerb outside and where archaeological checks have been carried out. The Treasury says it wants to emulate Germany and the Netherlands where tens of thousands of people have built their own homes as an alternative to trying to raise the money for an existing property. A recent survey suggested one in seven Brits will research how to build a home for themselves within the next 12 months. But Mr Boles insisted the homes do not need to resemble the ambitious and vastly expensive projects which feature on Channel 4’s Grand Designs – which often run over time and budget. Planning minister Nick Boles said he wants people to realise building their own home is an affordable option . He told MailOnline: ‘I love Grand Designs, the programme, as much as anybody. 'But what we need is not so much grand designs but affordable designs so anybody inclined to build a starter home can look at it as a mainstream option. ‘We need to get away from the idea that these things have to be made out of yoghurt and goats hair; that unless it is something that is designed by some out-there architect and looks like a Hobbit house or Battlestar Galactica has landed on Surrey, it's not a Grand Design. ‘These builds can be essentially quite ordinary. They are probably going to be slightly more in keeping with a local area because they are not designed in some headquarters of a house building company miles away. ‘They are designed by a local builder for somebody locally. It's not somebody just doing it to make money and run - there will be conditions attached to prevent that.’ Under the new Right to Buy, local residents will be able to demand the council sell them a plot which has water, electricity and other utilities already connected. ‘It doesn't need to be you laying the bricks or having a funky architect,’ Mr Boles said. ‘You can have something just a bit more personal, the number of bedrooms and so on. ‘You can actually save quite a chunk of money building yourself, even if you are not actually doing the work.’ The Right to Build will be consulted on this summer, with the law changed if the Tories win the next election. Self-build projects can be cheaper than buying a starter home, and are more likely to be in keeping with the local area, Mr Boles claimed . In many countries, including Austria, Belgium, Italy and Sweden, more than half of all homes are self-build projects . But Mr Boles hopes a few councils will act as ‘vanguards’ to trial the process before 2015. ‘This is an affordable option. The core idea is that if you live in a local area for a period of time, maybe two or three years, so you demonstrate some kind of local link, you would be able to put yourself on a list just like you would for social housing and say: I want a serviced plot of land with infrastructure and basic utilities on it. ‘The council would have a duty to offer you a plot within a period of time.’ He said the policy could be as revolutionary as Margaret Thatcher giving council tenants the right to buy their own council house in the 1980s. ‘When people used to approach councils saying we would quite like to buy our council house or council flat, they got a flea in their ear,’ Mr Boles said. ‘Once the Conservative government gave people a Right to Buy their council play if they fulfilled certain conditions then suddenly they flew off the shelves. It was a complete transformation. The idea is [Right to Build] would have a similarly revolutionary effect.’","Planning minister Nick Boles insists self build is an affordable option .

"By . Dan Bloom . A notorious gangster whose family once appeared in their own reality TV show sparked chaos when he clambered 100ft up a Ferris wheel and stayed there for six hours. Domenyk Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester's Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison. Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre. Scroll down for video . Chaos: Notorious gangster Domenyk Noonan bought Manchester city centre to a standstill for six hours after he scaled a 197ft Ferris wheel to protest his recall to prison. Authorities said the stunt cost £30,000 . Thrill-ride: Noonan waved to the crowds below from the wheel and conducted an interview via his mobile phone . Audience: Crowds gathered as Noonan refused to leave. Eventually police and the wheel's operators decided to turn it, despite Noonan sitting on the axis, so they could release the people trapped aboard . Officers said his 'outrageous' actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours. The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started at 3.30pm yesterday when he yelled: 'I am going to jump.' The 49-year-old, whose family appeared in the 2012 Donal McIntyre show At Home With the Noonans, clambered onto the roof of one of the pods of the 197ft wheel before climbing ladders to its centre. He remained on the axis through two rain showers until he was eventually cheered down by his supporters at around 9.45pm - wearing a hard hat and harness given to him by the authorities. He was then taken off in an ambulance and arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. Response: Firefighters put on hard hats and harnesses as they prepared to rescue the notorious gangster . Chaos: The area, which is a few yards from the central bus and tram terminal, had to be cordoned off . Defiant: Noonan remained through two rain showers and shouted down from his perch 100ft up the wheel, but because he was so far away, most onlookers said they were unable to hear what he was saying . Ride: Noonan had clambered aboard the wheel by jumping on top of a pod before climbing along a ladder . Big statement: Officers said Noonan's 'outrageous' actions endangered the lives of tourists, including a petrified three-year-old boy, who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in central Manchester for two hours . Operators of the Big Wheel shut it down, leaving customers stranded in their pods for two hours. Police cordoned off a large area as the stunt caused havoc for thousands of commuters at the nearby central bus and tram terminal. They said their operation could have cost the taxpayer £30,000. Speaking on his mobile phone from halfway up the wheel, Noonan told the Manchester Evening News: 'This is the scariest thing I have ever done in my life. 'I want the police to stop harassing me, even the probation service over the last three days. They are threatening to recall me to prison.' Rescue: Noonan grinned as he descended the wheel in a hard hat and harness given to him by the authorities . Hanging around: Police in hard hats and harnesses waited last night as the stand-off went on for six hours . He said he had a 'stupid argument over the washing-up' with a friend at an address where he is required to stay under the terms of his licence. Because of the argument, he said he went to stay at another friend's house which was a breach of his licence conditions. Noonan accepted that he would be arrested and recalled to prison as a result of his protest but said: 'At least this time I have actually done something.' A crowd of more than 1,000 people gathered to watch the protest. Dangerous: Tourists including a three-year-old boy were trapped inside the pods for two hours . Noonan could be heard shouting to the crowd from his position but it was not clear what he was saying. Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'I think what happened was outrageous. 'Police . will always facilitate lawful protest but there was nothing lawful . about this when you risk the lives of the people who were in the pods, . including the young and elderly, and a boy of three who was extremely . distressed. 'He risked the lives of the people who went to rescue him. 'If you want to make a protest, that's not the way to do it.' He said 12 people had to be rescued from the pods by allowing the wheel to turn while Noonan was still perched on the axis. He . added: 'I took the decision that their safety was more paramount than . his and took the decision to rotate the wheel and take them off. A . number of them were shaken up but thankfully didn't need any medical . assistance.' Noonan is a notorious gangster who is part of one of Manchester's best-known crime families. Born Dominic Noonan, he changed his . name to Domenyk Lattlay-Fottfoy in an apparent tribute to his code of . honour: 'Look After Those That Look After You, F*** Off Those That F*** . Off You'. His family first rose to . notoriety in the Manchester gang scene after the murder of 'White Tony' Johnson, the leader of the Cheetham Hill Gang, who was gunned down in . 1991. His brother Desmond 'Dessie' Noonan appeared in a 2005 documentary film by investigative reporter Donal MacIntyre in which he boasted he had 'more guns than police'. On solid ground: Noonan was immediately arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass . Attraction: The wheel has been in Manchester for several years and was recently  moved to the main square . Notorious: Noonan is not shy of publicity, appearing in TV documentaries and changing his surname to Lattlay-Fottfoy (which allegedly means Look After Those That Look After You, F*** Off Those That F*** Off You) Dessie was stabbed to death days before the film was due to be aired. His funeral cortège, watched by 5,000 local mourners and made up of 40 limousines, was led by a pipe band of retired policemen and off-duty firemen. Dominic reportedly took the helm of the family after his brother's death, and went on to feature in more documentaries and a reality TV show called At Home with the Noonans. The family had links to Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police sparked the London riots in 2011. Desmond's second wife Julie is the sister of Mark Duggan's mother, Pamela. Father-of-one Domenyk, at 5ft 11in . and weighing around 18st, has more than 40 convictions for offences . including armed robbery, police assault, possession of firearms, prison . escape and fraud. He has spent 22 years in prisons across Britain after being convicted of or suspected of dozens of offences. He . was arrested over claims he was involved in the 2011 riots when they . spread to Manchester, but the case against him was later dropped. Stunt: Police said cordoning off the area and rescuing Noonan had cost local services an estimated £30,000 . Life and crimes: Noonan was jailed for nine and a half years in 2005 for having a revolver under his car bonnet . His last sentence was handed down in 2005, when he was locked up for . nine and a half years after a revolver and ammunition were found under . the bonnet of his Jaguar when police stopped him. It is believed he was being recalled to prison yesterday because he is still on licence for that offence. Domenyk's nephew Damien Noonan Junior, then 25, was jailed in 2012 for plotting to flood the streets with a banned dance drug and arranging the brutal abduction and torture of a man. He was jailed at Preston Crown Court for six years and nine months for kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to supply drugs. Domenyk's other brother Damien senior was the . head bouncer of the former Hacienda nightclub in Manchester before he was killed . in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2003 aged 37. Damien's widow Mandy famously won £1m in a EuroMillions Olympics draw in 2012, a day after her nephew Kiaran Stapleton was jailed for life for shooting dead .

"By . Dan Bloom . A humble bungalow which a family bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago has been turned into a luxury holiday home worth £5million. Dr Edward Andreae paid just £40,000 in today's money for the home on Dorset's Sandbanks peninsula, an exposed spit in Poole Harbour which many people feared would be too unstable to live on. But the home soared in value as the tiny enclave's popularity soared, becoming what is now the fourth most expensive property hotspot in the world. The way we were: This is the humble bungalow bought for just £1,000 in the 1920s on the prime Sandbanks peninsula in Dorset. The site is now worth £5million . Luxury: The bungalow, bought by the current owner's great-grandfather, was demolished and replaced with this luxury seven-bedroom house which is let out to holidaymakers for £4,000 a week. Owner Tim Baldwin said he will bring his 10-month-old daughter to the house to have the same experiences he did as a child . History: The peninsula and its modest huts around 100 years ago in a postcard. Tim Baldwin's great-grandfather bought his bungalow for just £1,000 in the 1920s . Idyll: The approximate location of the house on the peninsula, whose millionaire residents include QPR manager Harry Redknapp and Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis . Desirable: Houses began to be built on the spit in the late 1800s, but the current boom only took off in the 1960s. Pictured: A plan of the area from 1896 . The bolthole was passed down through four generations of the same family until it fell into a state of disrepair. In . 2011 Dr Andreae’s great-grandson, Tim Baldwin, and his father Jonathan, . made the drastic decision to demolish the 90-year-old home and erect a . new one in its place. They . spent £580,000 creating a luxurious beachfront house that is now worth . 5,000 times (500,000 per cent) more than the original holiday home. The two-storey property, named Hook Sands after the old bungalow, has seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. It is clad in larch wood, powered by solar panels and has a garden that backs onto the beach. Interior . designer Mr Baldwin, 33, from Bath, rents the house to holidaymakers . from April to October each year for up to £4,100 a week. He . said: 'For the last 90 years the bungalow has been in my family. It was . originally purchased by my great grandfather, so that there was a place . that everyone could go on holiday together. Bolthole: The luxury home is now available to rent for up to £4,000 a week - four times more than the amount the plot was originally bought for in the 1920s . Luxurious: Sandbanks, a spit measuring less than half a square mile and jutting into Poole Harbour, has the fourth-highest land value in the world . Pristine: But many people were unwilling to move into homes on the peninsula in the early 1900s because they were concerned about the stability of the land . 'It was a much loved place and I have good memories of spending every summer there as a child, and it wasn’t for a long time that I had a holiday abroad. 'It has been passed through my family and over the years it has had various additions and alterations and was rather like patch work. 'There was no central heating in the bungalow which was difficult in the colder months and we wanted a house that could be used year round. “We decided that instead of trying to fix the various problems that there were with the house, that we should take it to the ground and build it back up. 'It was a very special place to me and when the bulldozers came in and the house came down I thought I would be a lot sadder, but it’s all about the location and the views. 'We wanted to create a contemporary house that was going to last for another 100 years. 'I’m really looking forward to taking my daughter, who is 10 months old, to the property for holidays so she can do the same things I did as a child.' Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not always such . a popular place to live. Luxurious: Sandbanks as the area is today. Last month an old bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 elsewhere went on the market for £2.25million . Sea view: Once a humble holiday bungalow, the sprawling seven-bedroom luxury house looks out over the English Channel and a secluded beach . £1,000 was a common sale price for houses there despite the average price of a five-bed family home being more than double that (£2,074) in 1930. Even a three-bed semi was more expensive at £1,192. Only in a property boom in the 1960s did the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. Sandbanks is home to QPR manager Harry Redknapp, Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis and computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden. Last month a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million. And in March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down. Adrian Dunford, of Tailor Made Estate . Agents, said: 'If this property was to come onto the market we would . look to market it at circa five million pounds. 'A lot of the plots in Sandbanks were purchased for less than 1,000 pounds in the early 1900s.'","Bungalow bought cheaply in 1920s on Dorset's Sandbanks, when it was feared surface was too unstable to live on .

"By . Peter Campbell . US drugs giant Pfizer took £67million more from the UK Government than it paid in tax over a three-year period. The firm shelled out £118million in corporation tax between 2010 and 2012 – but received a whopping £184million in tax credits. The rebate comes despite it making almost £5billion in sales from its British operations over the period. Pfizer shelled out £118million in corporation tax between 2010 and 2012 ¿ but received a whopping £184million in tax credits . The figures, revealed in documents filed at Companies House, come as the multinational was criticised for building up £43billion in tax havens across the world. Data for the most recent trading period show that the US group's main British arm, Pfizer Limited, received a tax credit of £184.8million in 2011 after racking up losses of £759.7million. It paid £5.4million into public coffers the year after. The rebate also dwarfs the tax paid by Pfizer's 22 other UK subsidiaries over the three-year period. One, PowderMed Limited, received a tax credit of £703,000 in 2010 after significant losses. But it gave the Treasury just £8,000 in 2011, and £82,000 the following year. A further division, John Wyeth & Brother Limited, made profits of £56.5million in 2012, but paid tax of only £3.5million – a rate of only 6 per cent. Meridian Medical Technologies Limited's tax bill was zero in 2010, even though it made a profit of £3,778. Together, Pfizer's UK divisions made combined profits of £266million in 2012 but paid only £31million in tax – a rate of just 11.7 per cent. The ticker symbol for AstraZeneca is displayed next to a ticker for Pfizer on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . The US company has already admitted that moving its tax base out of the US is 'one of the key drivers' of its £63billion plans to buy British drugs giant AstraZeneca. The group has almost 200 offices registered in tax havens across the world where it has an estimated £43billion nestled away. Some 40 per cent of its subsidiaries are based in offshore shelters or low tax regimes such as the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands, Jersey and the US state of Delaware – a highly controversial tax shelter. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: 'At a time when the world needs new antibiotics, Pfizer is investing in tax avoidance.' Pfizer said it pays its 'fair share' of taxes wherever it does business. A spokesman added that because of restructuring and investment costs, Pfizer generated losses in the UK in 2011.","Firm received a whopping £184million in tax credits, papers reveal .

The scenes were filmed at the beach and dunes of Berrow in Somerset last year . Hinkley Point near Berrow. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'This one must have slipped under the radar' Sedgemoor District Council’s Tim Mander said: 'With all the modern technology available today to edit footage, I was a little surprised to see Hinkley had slipped through. 'I was watching with my wife when I saw the nuclear power station in the background and said ""hang on, that looks familiar - that wasn’t there in 1915!""' BBC spokeswoman Maddy Chambers said the inclusion was an oversight. She said: 'While we do our utmost to ensure that every shot is period specific, this one must have slipped under the radar.' Sedgemoor District Council's Tim Mander said: 'I was watching with my wife when I saw the nuclear power station in the background and said ""hang on, that looks familiar - that wasn't there in 1915!""' The series shows the lives of medics and their patients at a fictional field hospital in France during the First World War . But Mr Mander added: 'Overall, the publicity has been superb and the beach has been featured several times which is great for the area. 'Sedgemoor District Council is delighted to have worked with the BBC during the production of the show at Berrow. The filming took place last autumn.' He added: 'The BBC was impressed with the help and co-operation given by our Resorts Officer and his team, which ensured the filming went smoothly. 'Sedgemoor is a ""film friendly"" council and regularly works with Creative England to identify locations required by major film companies within the district.' The Romans were certainly an advanced civilisation, but as far as we know, they never discovered gas propulsion. But a scene in the hit film Gladiator suggests otherwise when a chariot strikes a wall and flips over - revealing a gas canister hidden beneath. This is just one example of hundreds of continuity errors to appear in Hollywood movies but most of them go unnoticed by the audience. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, have discovered the brain merges together similar images seen within 15 seconds. Without this skill, even simple changes in people’s facial expression would be so overwhelming that we’d feel like we were hallucinating. Other famous gaffes include the incongrous sight of a white van clearly visible in the background of a huge battle scene in Braveheart and a crew member in a straw hat on board a pirate ship piloted by Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Perhaps the most famous example is a stormtrooper clearly banging his head on a low hanging sliding door as he runs into a room in George Lucas' Star Wars: A New Hope.","Hinkley Point was built more than 40 years after The Crimson Field is set .

"By . Richard Spillett . Former footballer John Hartson - who beat the odds to survive testicular cancer - has been pictured with his 'miracle' third child. The ex-Celtic striker needed emergency surgery in 2009 when cancer spread to his brain and lungs and at one stage he was given '50-50' chances of survival. But having battled through chemotherapy treatment to beat off the deadly disease, he is now celebrating after his wife, Sarah, gave birth to 6lb 2oz baby Paige Faith. Overjoyed: Footballer-turned-pundit John Hartson with wife Sarah and new baby, Paige Faith . Miracle: Hartson admitted he did not expect to be a father again after his battle with cancer . Hartson, who already has two daughters with Sarah, five-year-old Lena and four-year-old Stephanie, feared he would never be a father again after he was diagnosed with cancer five years ago. The 39-year-old told Wales Online: 'I have managed to father two perfect little daughters and I do see it as a little bit of a miracle. I came very close to leaving this place and now I feel blessed.' Shortly after the birth on April 19, he tweeted: 'Paige faith hartson born 19-4-14. 12.23pm weighing 6.2pounds.. We're both absolutely delighted mother and baby girl doing well.' Swansea-born Hartson scored over a 150 goals during his career and was capped 51 times for Wales. But a year after his retirement from the game in 2008, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that doctors said had spread to his brain and lungs. Describing the diagnosis on the website of his charity, The John Hartson Foundation, the former player wrote: 'The way I saw it, I was 31, I was fathering kids, I was training hard every day, I was moving clubs – I was doing everything that was asked of me. Good news: Delighted Hartson's tweet shortly after the birth . Birth: Paige Faith is the couple's third child. They discovered Sarah was pregnant with their second daughter when he was in remission . Football: Hartson during his playing days at Arsenal in 1995 (left) and Celtic in 2006 (right) He added: 'I was also, if I’m honest, pretty ignorant about the symptoms of testicular cancer and the importance of getting treatment early. I had no idea of the danger I was putting myself in. 'It wasn’t until I started suffering the most horrendous headaches that I went to see my GP and mentioned the lumps. 'Within days I found out the lumps were testicular cancer and the headaches were the result of a tumour. 'I had waited so long to get checked that the cancer had spread to my lungs and my brain and I was diagnosed with stage-four cancer.' Campaign: Hartson has since set up his own charity to raise awareness of testicular cancer . Battle: Hartson was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 34, when he already had three children . During his treatment, doctors gave Hartson and his wife the option of freezing his sperm, but they decided not to. They discovered Sarah, now 41, was pregnant with their second daughter Stephanie while he was still in remission in 2009. Hartson - who also has two children from an earlier relationship, teenage daughter Rebecca and 11-year-old son Joni - has since worked to raise awareness of the importance of early checks. Writing for his charity, he added: 'Had I got the lumps checked when I first discovered them, I could have spared myself months of operations and gruelling treatments, not to mention the worry I could have saved my family in the process. 'So I urge you – don’t do as I did, do as I say. Check yourself regularly, know what to look for and get anything out of the ordinary seen to by your GP. It could save your life.' He has since made a full recovery and has been given the all clear by doctors.","John Hartson feared he'd never be a father again after battle with disease .

"By . Richard Spillett . Soaring spring temperatures could bring swarms of the huge jellyfish to British shores, experts are warning. A one-metre wide barrel jellyfish which washed up in Portland, Dorset this week is thought to be one of the first in an influx of the creatures heading to UK waters. The warmer than average weather expected in coming months means beach-goers may see jellyfish much bigger than they are used to - some as big as dustbin lids. The huge barrel jellyfish washed up in Portland, Dorset is said to be one of the first of an invasion of larger species of the creatures heading to Britain . This particular variety is said to be harmless but experts have warned beach-goers to watch out for other species . Experts are warning that some of the new jellyfish can sting and anyone affected should seek medical attention . Richard Harrington from the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said: 'This predicted hot weather to come can mean that even more jellyfish are likely to wash up or be in the seas around places like the west Country.' Commenting on the latest find, he added: 'Although this barrel jellyfish is harmless, the numbers of jellyfish are likely to grow fairly quickly as sea temperatures rise. 'We are very keen to hear from people that find any washed up anywhere around the country. Dog walker Suzanne Sheldon, who discovered the creature, said it was the largest jellyfish she'd ever seen . Experts are warning anyone planning to head to the seaside later in the month to beware of the creatures . 'The barrel jellyfish is an Atlantic species and are sometimes found washed up but still advise the public not to touch them.' Portland resident Suzanne Sheldon, 48, found the large creature washed up on her local beach earlier this week and reported the find to the MCS. She said: 'I came across this massive jellyfish as I took my dog for a walk on a quiet beach at Portland. 'It was at least three feet in width and was very bulky too. It was the largest jellyfish I have ever seen.' Weather forecasters expect high pressure to take hold later in May, sending temperatures rising above 20C.","Huge barrel jellyfish found by dog-walker after being washed up in Portland .

"By . Ray Massey . The original Mini has been named Britain’s favourite car of all-time - 55 years after its launch. The McLaren F1 supercar was second in a survey by motoring magazine Autocar, with the Jaguar E-type in third place and the Range Rover fourth. The Ford Escort Mexico was placed tenth. The Mini, which has been dubbed Britain's favourite car, became an instant sensation 55 years ago . It was dubbed the 'classless car' when it launched in 1959 because it was as popular with celebrities as with mums . The Mini, designed by Sir Alec Issigonis became an instant sensation when launched in 1959 and went on to become a symbol of the ‘Swinging Sixties’. It was dubbed the first ‘classless car’ because it was as popular with stars such as Peter Sellers and Twiggy as with students and mums out shopping. More than 5.3million were sold over more than forty years. Autocar editor Chas Hallett said: ‘It comes as little surprise that the original Mini has topped the list of all-time British greats. Second: The McLaren F1 is favoured by top-level drivers - but the rest of Britons would prefer an old Mini . Third: The Jaguar E-type was made between 1961 and 1975, and regularly tops 'most beautiful car' lists . Sloane ranger: The British four-wheel drive SUV came fourth.

Source: Autocar . ‘It represents a lot more than the British car industry; the Mini is associated with Great Britain around the world and, in many ways, it was ahead of its time.’ The Mini marque was revived in a larger and more-powerful version by new owners BMW in 2003 though the current incarnation built in Oxford is two and a half feet longer, seven inches wider and two inches taller than the original. Mr Hallett added: ‘The original Mini is the best British car ever built according to the survey of our readers. 'Everyone loved and still loves an original Mini. ‘It ensured a fabulous drive every time, with a wheel literally at each corner and a low centre of gravity, plus it was cheap to own and run. ‘Many a former owner will undoubtedly be wishing they had held on to theirs, as good examples are now worth tens of thousands of pounds.’ Norfolk based Lotus was the most popular manufacturer as seven of its models made the 100 best British cars list. Hybrid: The McLaren P1, which came sixth, is a limited production plug-in hybrid car, launched in 2012 . Supercar: The Jaguar XJ220, which came seventh, held the record for fastest production car in 1992 . Eighth: The Aston Martin DB5, which rose to fame at the hands of James Bond, took eighth place in the list . Ninth: The TVR Griffith is a lightweight fibreglass-bodied car, produced between 1991 and 2002 . Tenth: The Ford Escort Mexico was inspired by the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally . Jaguar and Ford both had six cars in the top 100, including the Jaguar D-type and the Ford Sierra RS Cosworth, while Aston Martin had five, including the DB5 - a favourite with 007 James Bond. The ‘Lotus seven’ models that made the top rank are the Elise, Esprit, Elan, Cortina, Evora, Carlton and Sunbeam.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A brand new £440,000 ($800,000) Lamborghini unexpectedly went up in flames while the luxury Italian company was exhibiting its supercar at a media demonstration in Australia. Witnesses reported that the light blue V12-powered Aventador LP700-4 Roadster had completed dozens of laps around Phillip Island race track in Victoria when heavy smoke along with fire emerged from behind the cabin. Driving the sports car was Top Gear Australia editor Tim Keen who was quickly instructed to stop on the track and leave the vehicle, while a driving instructor was heard desperately yelling for people to grab fire extinguishers off the walls of the pit bays nearby. Inferno: This Lamborghini Aventador caught on fire during a media demonstration drive day at Phillip Island in Victoria, Australia . Embarrassing: The fire was caused by oil from the brake lines leaking onto the exhaust . Sources told Fairfax Media that 'a number' of fire extinguishers were needed to put out the fire, which is believed to have started due to an oil leak in the exhaust and spread to the rear taillight. It is understood oil from one of the brake lines leaked on the exhaust system and caught fire. A statement released by Lamborghini explained that the blaze was caused by the vehicle's 'extended track use in a high-temperature environment' and they consequently have no plans to modify the car. 'The investigation has also confirmed that the issue was not due to any fault in the design or construction of the vehicle,' the statement read. The Italian car-maker was further embarrassed when Lamborghini's head of south-east Asia and the Pacific, Sebastien Henry, asked media attending not to write about the incident or report about it on social media. Drive day: Media were invited to drive the cars and test them out, but the afternoon was cut short when the back of the car started burning . At least one media outlet was allegedly asked to delete video footage and images of the 515kW Aventador burning. But Mr Henry denied the company forced anyone to wipe the footage. 'We certainly did not force any of our guests to delete imagery obtained on the day,' he said in a statement. 'We did, however, kindly request that our guests refrain from making any assumptions through the media – particularly when, at the time, the cause of the incident had not been adequately investigated.' The car had been shipped exclusively from Italy to Australia for a number of demonstration and drive days. It's believed it was to be flown to the Beijing motor show after a stint down under but it has instead been sent to the repair shop. High-performance machine: The new Lamborghini Aventador is powered by a 515kW 6.5-litre V12 engine . Precious cargo: The Aventador that caught fire was flown to Australia direct from Italy and was due to be sent to the Beijing motor show, but has now been sent to the repair shop .

"By . Damien Gayle . A woman in China leapt into a river in a wedding dress in a bid to appease a water god she believes took her son. Yun Teng, 30, plunged into the river in Suzhou city in eastern China's Anhui province after her son went missing near its banks. Police said she had been 'driven to the brink of madness' by her loss. There were no leads as to the missing boy's whereabouts and no body has been found, but the woman was convinced he had been claimed by the river. Desperation: Police officer Zhang Cheng pulls Yun Teng from the water after she leapt in wearing a wedding dress in a desperate attempt to get the spirit of the river to release her son, who she believed it had taken . 'It is all very sad,' said a police . spokesman. 'She convinced herself that she had angered a river god and . that he would only be appeased if she offered herself as his bride, so . he would free her son and return him to the world.' Ms Yun lost her five-year-old son several weeks ago and has since returned to the river day after day to search for him. Her grief and sorry finally led to desperation earlier this week when she leapt from a bridge over the river. Police officer Zhang Cheng was among those who witnessed her attempted suicide. He pulled her to a small boat and called firemen for help. 'She was struggling, shouting that she wanted to be left there and claimed by the river, and that it was the only way the ""river god"" was going to let her son return to dry land,' he said. 'It is hard to save someone when they don't want to be rescued because she was very strong. But we managed to subdue her in the end.' Sad: Ms Yun lost her five-year-old son several weeks ago and has since returned to the river day after day to search for him. Her grief and sorry finally led to desperation earlier this week when she leapt from a bridge . Officer Zhang returns the woman to shore: He said she was shouting and struggling as he tried to save her because she wanted to be claimed by the 'river god' so that he would return her missing five-year-old boy . Ms Yun was in the water for half an hour before she was plucked to safety and ferried to the riverbank where emergency services took her to hospital. The body of her son has been found and he might not even have been lost in the river - thousands of Chinese parents face a similar anguish and uncertainty each year when their children are actually stolen. In 2011, Chinese police rescued 8,660 abducted children, but it is likely that at least double that number were kidnapped. China does not release official figures on child trafficking, so estimates are based on the numbers of missing-child reports posted by parents online and of children reported rescued each year. Estimates range from 10,000 kidnapped per year to as high as 70,000. Most parents who lose children stand very little chance of seeing them again. Often the children are kidnapped to be sold on to someone else for adoption or sometimes they are forced into prostitution. Firefighters lift distraught Ms Yun from the boat: Her son might not even have been lost in the river - thousands of Chinese parents face similar anguish and uncertainty each year when their children are actually stolen . At the national level, China takes child abduction very seriously. It has a national anti-kidnapping task force that investigates and infiltrates trafficking rings, and there are frequent anti-kidnapping campaigns that encourage citizens to report anything suspicious. But at local level, where the first, crucial reports will be made when a child goes missing, many parents say the police just do not seem to care.","Yun Teng leapt into the river near where her son went missing weeks ago .
