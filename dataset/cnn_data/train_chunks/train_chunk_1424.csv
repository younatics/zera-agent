"Favourite attractions were West End shows War Horse and Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert and Courtauld Gallery . Tube delays, soaring prices, feral youths, rioting... you would think such things would deter tourists from visiting London. But now, for the first time ever, Britain's capital city has been named the best place to visit on the planet - after jumping from eighth to first place. And with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics almost upon us, it could not have come at a better time. To celebrate the forthcoming Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, 147 Union flags are flying above Oxford Street. The display represents 147 years of fashion on the world famous high street . For the first time ever, Britain's capital city has been named the best place to visit on the planet - after jumping from eighth to first place . According to the research, carried out by tourist feedback website TripAdvisor, one of the favourite attractions is West End show War Horse . The league table, compiled by tourist feedback website TripAdvisor, is based on analysis of tens of millions of reviews by visitors to 440 destinations around the world, the Evening Standard reported. Emma Shaw, TripAdvisor’s director, said: 'The capital has been very much in the spotlight over the past few years, thanks to the royal wedding, Diamond Jubilee and, of course, the Olympics, and we’re seeing travellers experience London in an increasingly favourable way.' It is a remarkable achievement for a city that, a few years ago, was widely seen as grubby, grey and expensive. In 2010, London did not feature in the top three in Britain, beaten by Edinburgh, Brighton and York. London has 'more free galleries and museums than anywhere else in the world,' said one tourist from LA. Above, the British Museum . A great year for the capital, with the Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee on the horizon. Above, the monarch meets school children at a Mad Hatter's Tea Party in Sherborne, Dorset today . Traveller from Thailand: 'I love the flower market in east London on a Sunday morning, full of colours, and also Spitalfields market.'From Illinois, US: 'I . love London. There is so much to do, one almost needs a month to see . it. The city is rich in history, nostalgia. beauty… and pubs. It has . something for everyone.' From Rome: 'So much of what London has to offer is free. It’s unbelievable.'From Portugal: 'I totally fell in love with London, its history, its monuments, its river, its parks, shopping markets etc.'From Chennai, India: 'It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Nice parks, gardens and locations to visit. Go and check it out yourself.'From Hong Kong: 'Our visit would not be complete if we hadn’t visited a local pub and eaten fish and chips with a glass of beer.'From Haifa, Israel: 'The most interesting place I’ve ever visited.' But the combined draw of spectacles such as the West End show War Horse and free attractions, from great museums and parks to street markets such as Portobello Road, has transformed the capital’s global image. One traveller from Los Angeles wrote: 'London is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. It’s a virtual historical theme park. There are more free galleries and museums than anywhere in the world.' Gordon Innes, chief executive of the capital’s tourism agency, London & Partners, said its top position was 'a testament to the wonderful array of attractions, dining and accommodation that set London apart from all these other destinations'. The top-rated hotels were Hotel 41 in Victoria, and the Milestone and Egerton House, both in Kensington.

"Rupert Murdoch's media empire will not face prosecution in the US over the phone-hacking scandal. In statements filed with US regulators, Murdoch's News Corp and 21st Century Fox each said the the Justice Department would not be pursuing charges. Using identical language, the two statements said the Justice Department 'has completed its investigation of voicemail interception and payments to public officials in London and is declining to prosecute' either firm. News Corp executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch, seen here on October 31, 2013, split his empire into two entities following a phone-hacking scandal . Andy Coulson, pictured, the former editor of the newspaper was sentenced to 18 months in prison after being found guilty of intercepting voicemail . The scandal which erupted in 2011 led to the closure of Murdoch's News of the World after revelations that the tabloid had accessed the voice mails of a murdered schoolgirl, Milly Dowler. In the wake of the scandal and the subsequent investigations in Britain, Murdoch split his empire into two entities -- News Corp focusing on newspapers and publishing, and 21st Century Fox specializing in TV and film. The scandal has led to tens of millions of dollars in legal costs for the companies, including damages paid to victims. Murdoch's British media units have faced intense pressure following revelations that the hacking extended to celebrities including Prince William and Prince Harry, and actors Jude Law and Sienna Miller. Andy Coulson, the former British newspaper editor and one-time communications chief of Prime Minister David Cameron, served less than five months of an 18-month prison sentence after he was found guilty of conspiring to intercept voicemails. But Former Murdoch protege Rebekah Brooks, another key editor for the media group, was cleared of the charges last June. News Corp. operates The Sun and the Times of London, along with the US-based Wall Street Journal and newspapers in Australia.. Murdoch's 21st Century Fox includes the well-known Hollywood Fox studio and television operations and owns a stake in the Sky satellite broadcaster.","Justice department completed its investigation into Murdoch's empire .

"The father of Jules Bianchi admits his son's situation is 'desperate' and that it is a 'miracle' he is still alive but believes he will 'not give up' his fight for life. It is now nine days since Bianchi sustained brain injuries following an horrific accident during the Japanese Grand Prix on October 5. Upon his arrival at the Mie General Medical Centre in Yokkaichi, the 25-year-old Frenchman had immediate surgery, but remains in a critical condition.

All 21 drivers line up on the grid before the start of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix to show their support . Bianchi's father Philippe, mother Christine, brother Tom and sister Melanie have since maintained a bedside vigil. Speaking for the first time since the accident, Bianchi Snr said: 'The situation is desperate. 'Every time the telephone goes we know it could be the hospital to tell us Jules is dead. 'He will not give up, I'm sure of that. I can see it. I believe it.' In an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, he added: 'I speak to him. I know he can hear me. 'His doctors have told us this is already a miracle, no-one has ever survived such a serious accident. But Jules won't give up. 'His trainer Andrea (Ferrari) says if there is one person who can make it happen, with his will, it's Jules.' Following an investigation into the cause of the crash, FIA race director Charlie Whiting concluded there was 'a perfect storm' of conditions. With heavy rain falling and the light fading, Bianchi smashed into the back of a recovery vehicle that at the time was removing the Sauber of Adrian Sutil who had spun off the Suzuka circuit and into a tyre barrier one lap previously.

"Known as the generation of entitlement, Gen Ys have now proved critics wrong by claiming the title of Australia's smartest savers. CommBank has found Gen Ys, aged 18 to 30, have a savings IQ 4.2 points greater than the national average. In fact, those from Gen Y who participated in  a financial education program scored the highest score of 130.9, while people aged 50 to 59 who did not learn to manage their money scored the lowest, 117.4. Known as the generation of entitlement, Gen Ys have proved critics wrong by claiming the title of Australia's Smartest Savers from their parents and grandparents. Commbank spokesman Danielle Murrie said these findings will surprise many people because of the reputation of the younger generation. She said people tend to think Gen Y as having a 'less mature approach to personal savings'. 'Our research indicates Gen Ys have above average commitment and control when it comes to their finances. While many factors contribute to savings success, the findings suggest the key difference between Gen Y and older generations is more recent exposure to good money management programs taught at school. 'This, combined with better savings discipline and fewer external barriers to saving, such as kids or a mortgage, have proven Gen Y to be the ultimate savvy savers,' she says. Gen Y are not the only Australians who are great at saving, the study reveals Australians on a whole are great at money management with 86 per cent reporting to be so . The findings came from people's responses to questions that focused on four key aspects - commitment, discipline, control and savviness. However, no matter the age, research found if you had received education on money management your saving IQ would be greater. The questionnaire revealed 89 per cent said education has a positive affect on children's financial future. These programs also influenced people under 30 to be regular savers, revealing they typically place a large sum of their pay cheque in a savings account. 'It’s encouraging to see strong links between financial education programs and future financial success. I’m especially proud to see that our youngest adult generation, those that had the highest participation rates for early financial education, have the highest Savings IQ of all the generations,'  Ms Murrie said. But Gen Y are not the only Australians who are great at saving, the study reveals Australians on a whole are great at money management with 86 per cent reporting to be so. CommBank found 88 per cent that were good at saving made shopping lists and researched prices before purchasing. Despite these positive results among the Australian population, CommBank believes there is still room for improvement for those who are stressed out with their money management.

"Most drivers sent up the wrong lane by a satnav would curse and turn around – however when you’re Paul Daniels it appears the power of magic can summon help in the form of a police escort. The magician and his wife Debbie McGee, 55, were making their way back to their hotel after performing at a local theatre when they realised they were heading in the wrong direction. But with a wave of his wand and a tap of his black top hat, the pair encountered traffic officers who were more than happy to assist them. Scroll down for video .

"The tiny dog cage a foster mother kept the four-year-old child she is accused of murdering trapped in was wheeled out in court yesterday for jurors to see during the trial for first-degree murder, kidnapping and child abuse. Rilya Wilson vanished in 2000 under the nose of Florida's child welfare agency while she was under the care of Geralyn Graham, 66. Her body has never been found. Authorities long suspected Graham in Rilya's disappearance, but didn't charge her until 2005 when prosecutors said she confessed to an inmate while serving time on an unrelated fraud charge. Prosecutors brought the wire dog cage into the court room yesterday and placed it in front of the jurors as Graham's friend Detra Coakley Winfield testified she loaned it to her specifically to keep the child in. Vanished: Rilya Wilson, 4, was missing for two years before the state of Florida realized and began to search for her . Caged: Detra Coakley Winfield testifies in a Miami-Dade Criminal Court last November about the steel dog cage, left, she loaned Geralyn Graham to put Rilya Wilson in before the four-year-old child disappeared . She said Graham asked to borrow it . and told her it was so she could keep the four-year-old in it at night . 'to stop her from doing harm to herself'. However she did admit she had never seen her inside the cage. Graham has always maintained that a . child welfare worker took Rilya from her home in January 2001 and never . returned her. Her disappearance was not discovered until April 2002, . leading to major reforms at the Florida Department of Children and . Families. Winfield was also asked earlier in . the week about how Rilya was cared for and admitted she once saw her . confined to a laundry room as punishment for bad behavior, according to The Miami Herald. 'I saw her in timeout but I never saw . her in the dog cage,' she said, adding that she had never saw Graham . strike the child once. She also said she often seemed 'sad' during her eight-month stay at the Graham home and once saw her play with feces. 'To me, she had some issues, some mental issues,' Winfield told jurors yesterday. Trial: Rilya (right) disappeared in 2000 aged four. Her foster mother, Geralyn Graham, now 66, is on trial more than a dozen years later . Graham told her Rilya, who was taken . into care after being born to a crack-addicted mom, was taken to New . York by a Spanish lady who had befriended her before being taken away by . DCF. On Wednesday, another family friend, . Laquica Tuff, told jurors that she saw Rilya with scratches and a gash . on her forehead about two months before the girl’s disappearance. Lost: Rilya's body has never been found . She also said Graham told her the same story about her being taken to New York by a friend. In the afternoon, a crime scene detective dispatched to Graham's home in Kendall in 2004, more than three years after Rilya disappeared and after the family had already moved, testified that little forensic evidence was found at the home except for latent evidence of human bodily fluid or blood in the garage, according to Local10.com. Graham's attorney raised the possibility that Rilya could still be alive because her body has not been found. Attorney Scott Sakin suggested Rilya . could've been relocated to a new home and lost in a system that has a . history of caseworker incompetence. Sakin also reminded jurors that jailhouse snitches have much to gain for helping out prosecutors. 'Is there any evidence at all that . this child is dead?' Sakin said. 'Where is the body? We don't have to . prove that she's alive. They have to prove that this child is dead.' Prosecutors said Graham confessed to . killing Rilya, who would be 16 now, because she believed the girl was . evil and possessed by demons. Rilya and a younger sister were both . given over to state care because their drug-addicted, frequently . homeless mother could not care for them. Rilya's name is an acronym for 'remember I love you always' given by her birth mother. One now-retired DCF supervisor, . Willie Harris, testified that in April 2000 he received a call from . Graham claiming Rilya's first foster home was 'deplorable' and might be . unsafe. Accused: Geralyn Graham is sworn by a judge, pictured, at Miami-Dade Criminal Court where she is charged with the murder of Rilya Wilson, who was in her care when she vanished in 2000 . Testimony: Mrs Winfield told the court that she saw the girl in timeout but never saw her in the dog cage she provided, adding that she had never saw Graham strike the child once . Rilya's younger sister was living . with Graham and her unrelated companion, Pamela Graham, and Rilya had . recently visited their house. Harris said he decided to remove . Rilya from the first foster home when he was denied access to . investigate its condition. He took the girl to the Grahams' home. 'I thought it would be necessary to . remove the child because I couldn't prove whether she was at risk or not . at risk,' Harris testified. The key to the case, both sides agree, is the testimony of career criminal Robin Lunceford, who befriended Graham in jail. Lunceford claims that Graham, . referring to Rilya as 'it,' told her she smothered the girl with a . pillow and buried the remains near water 'because water represented . peace,' Weintraub told jurors. Another inmate also claims that Graham . confessed at a different time. Weintraub said Lunceford was reluctant to snitch but 'couldn't stomach' knowing about the death of a child. 'If you tell me you killed an . innocent child, I'm going to snitch, and I'm going to snitch proud. Because it's different,' Weintraub quoted Lunceford as telling . detectives. Lunceford had been facing a life . sentence as a repeat offender but has had her sentence reduced to 10 . years because of her cooperation, court records show. With time off for . good behavior, she could be released by the end of December, Sakin . pointed out. 'She's a rat,' Sakin said. 'Robin Lunceford would do anything, anything, to get out of prison.' Graham also has a checkered past, . including a history of convictions for fraud. Authorities said she has . used 47 different aliases and had 10 different driver's licenses when . she was arrested. Weintraub said Graham forged . documents falsely claiming she was Rilya's grandmother in order to . collect state benefits — even after police believed the girl was dead. The trial resumes on Tuesday.","Geralyn Graham on trial for murder 12 years after Rilta disappeared in her care .

"For nearly a decade, Denise Scott believed her husband had been killed on impact when United Airlines Flight 175 smashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. But last year, just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the horrific attack, she received a call that changed her life - and the story of her husband's death. A note in his handwriting and with a smudge of his blood had been found, reading: '84th floor. West Office. 12 people trapped.' Scroll down for videos . Found: Randy Scott wrote a note, '84th floor, west office, 12 people trapped', before the south tower collapsed on 9/11. It also shows a smudge of his blood. His family thought he had died on impact . The note had drifted to the ground outside the building just moments before it collapsed - and left Randy Scott's wife and three children horrified that he had been alive to experience fear. 'I spent 10 years hoping that Randy wasn't trapped in that building,' Denise, 57, told the Stamford Advocate from her Stamford, Connecticut home. 'You don't want them to suffer. They're . trapped in a burning building. It's just an unspeakable horror. And then . you get this 10 years later. It just changes everything.' Scott, 48, worked at Euro Brokers Inc. in the World Trade Center when he phoned the school where his wife taught to let her know that one of the Twin Towers had been hit by a plane. Heartbreaking discovery: Scott's wife Denise, left, and two of his three daughters, Rebecca, centre, and Alexandra, right, say they were stunned the note had made its way to them . Missed: The Scott family poses together before Randy's death in the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers . Believing the first crash was minor, he . asked to pass on the message that he was fine - and she only . discovered the full horror when her daughter Rebecca called from college later that morning. Loss: Randy Scott, 48, perished with his co-workers and thousands of others when the towers collapsed . In the days after the attacks, Denise . and her three daughters checked bars, restaurants and hospitals for . their husband and father, the Advocate reported. Nearly 10 years later, in August 2011, Denise received a call from Dr. Barbara Butcher, chief of staff and director of Forensic Investigations at the  Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York. Aware that the office called families if they came across fragments of victims, Denise asked what it was they had found. 'She said, ""No, it's not a fragment. It's something written"",' Denise said. 'And that's when I just fell apart.' The . note had been found on the street amid the chaos on 9/11 and handed to a . guard at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As he reached for his . radio to alert help, the tower crumbled. The Federal Reserve kept the note and eventually turned it over to the National September 11 Memorial & . Museum, which worked with the medical examiner's office. It . was linked to Randy Scott after a medical examiner carried out DNA . tests on a dark spot on the note, and discovered it was Scott's blood. After taking the phone call from the . Medical Examiner's office, Denise travelled to New York with Randy's . best friend to see the note. 'The minute I saw it I didn't need to see the DNA test,' she said. 'I saw the handwriting. It's Randy's handwriting.' Shock: The women said they never wanted to believe he had been trapped or suffered in the building . She added: 'I'm speechless that they actually . were able to identify it. This note was written on . September 11. It came out of a window. Somebody had it. People had their . hands all over it.' Butcher . from the Medical Examiner's office asked if the museum could exhibit . the letter and Denise agreed - but asked for them to keep it quiet until . she told her daughters. But . the months passed and the girl returned to college, and Denise . struggled to find the right moment, she told the Advocate. When her . father died in January, she realised it was time. Her daughters, Rebecca, Alexandra, and Jessica, were stunned to hear of the note. 'I was bawling, because I recognised his handwriting,' Rebecca, 29, recalled. 'I thought he was killed instantly.' Alexandra, 22, added: 'Everyone hoped that it was right on . impact. That he didn't suffer.' Impact: United Airlines Flight 175 smashed into the south tower of the . World Trade Center hitting near to where Randy worked at Euro Brokers . Inc. He survived to write a note - before the tower collapsed . Fallen: The note was found among the debris at the bottom of the towers and eventually passed to the Medical Examiner's office, which carried out DNA tests on the blood and matched it to Scott's . They had hoped the same for his . colleagues, too, she said, who also had children and families. The . Scotts began reaching out to other relatives of those killed alongside . Randy, to tell them the truth. Denise said that although it changed their knowledge of that day for the worse, she is so thankful she found out the truth - while other families have chosen not to be notified when fragments are found. Jan Ramirez, chief curator of the museum, told the Advocate: 'It's so amazing to think that Randy . Scott wrote it and it eventually ended up with his wife and three . daughters, which is an amazing arc of a day. 'We are incredibly proud to be able to show it and I think it . will be one of the most powerful artifacts in the museum.' After the 2001 attacks on New York City, the Office . of the Chief Medical Examiner had to contend with thousands of bodies, . many completely shattered and unrecognisable, buried among the wreckage . of the crumbled buildings. A huge 1.8million tons was eventually moved to a landfill for workers to . start sifting through, in the hopes of making positive IDs on the nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks. Nearly 11 years on, a small group of scientists are still desperately working to give grieving families the justice they crave. More than 9,000 pieces of bone, . some the size of just a Tic Tac, are kept at Memorial Park, a building . on 30th Street in Manhattan, New York Magazine reported last year. Five dedicated staff inexhaustibly sift through crushed remains of bone taken from the scene day after day, cross-referencing any clues they get with DNA samples from the victims' families. Last year, just two IDs were made, leaving 1,121 victims still unidentified. So far, the office has identified less than 60 per cent of the 2,753 people who died on 9/11. Just 17 of the remains were identified by sight alone, 305 were determined by fingerprints, 25 by photographs, 78 by personal effects, 534 by dental or body X-rays and six by tattoos. The work also involves profiling the DNA of the victims to match against the bones. Samples were collected by taking DNA from toothbrushes or by swabbing living relatives. Even though it is painstaking, families have praised the work as vital. Jim Riches, a former deputy chief of the FDNY who lost his son on 9/11, told the magazine: 'We recovered my son March 25, 2002 but it wasn't all of him. I would want to bring all his parts back to Queens and put them all in one place.'","Wife and three daughters believed Randy Scott had been killed on impact when second plane hit south tower on 9/11 .

"It’s been 70 years since an Indiana photographer visited New York City and returned home with an amazing collection of holiday snaps.

"Danny Welbeck is confident the goals will flow for both Arsenal and England if he is given a run of games as an out-and-out attacker. The 23-year-old begins a new chapter this week after swapping home-town club Manchester United for the Gunners in a £16million deadline day move. Welbeck had been with the Old Trafford giants since the age of eight, but dropped down the pecking order and grew increasingly frustrated at a lack of opportunities to lead the line. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Faith in Wenger key to Arsenal success . Danny Welbeck said he is confident goals will flow for club and country if he gets a run as a central striker . It was a position he shone in for England on Monday evening, netting a second-half brace in Switzerland to secure a winning start to their European Championship qualifying campaign. And Welbeck is confident goals will continue to rack up if he is allowed to play in his favoured role. He said: 'It is well known I prefer to play through the middle so when I get my opportunity I just want to show what I can do. 'Once I get into the box and get the opportunities I have got faith in my ability. 'Before I wasn't getting into the box because I wasn't playing too much as a striker and I had to worry about my defensive work. 'Listen, anyone can say what they want to say but I just know once I get the opportunity and a run of games up front I will do my best. Danny Welbeck scored twice as England beat Switzerland 2-0 in their European Championships qualifier . 'That's definitely what I need. It is good for any footballer to get a run of games. 'You become more confident and play much more at ease and to get a run of games would be absolutely perfect. 'That is my first 90 minutes this season so it is just the start of things and really looking forward to it.' Welbeck says he has not had a decent run of games since Christmas last year, suggesting Monday's display in Basle could be just a taster of what is in store for Arsenal and England. The forward impressed up top alongside captain Wayne Rooney, with his goals helping the Three Lions to a much-needed 2-0 win after the World Cup debacle. Arsenal signed Danny Welbeck from Manchester United for £16million on transfer deadline day . 'It was important,' Welbeck said. 'It was good for me to get the two goals but it was more important for the whole team to get the win and off to a flying start and to get three points from scratch and that was the most pleasing thing. 'I think what we have worked this week in training a lot of it showed and that is very pleasing because it showed your hard work is not going to waste and that is what we have got - players in midfield who can break on beyond the attackers and we know if they get behind us we are going to sit in for them.

"A British jihadist fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq is feared to be behind a cyber plot to empty British bank accounts to fund terrorism in the Middle East. Junaid Hussain, 20, escaped to Syria last year while on police bail, and has been posting extremist messages on social media pledging to conquer the world and kill infidels. Hussain, who is originally from Birmingham, is pictured online posing with a scarf over his face and a rifle in his hands, and tweets behind the alias Abu Hussain al-Britani. Jihadist: Junaid Hussain, who tweets from Iraq under an alias, has posed with a rifle and posted extremist messages online . He was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from Tony Blair, and is thought to be putting his hacking skills to use adding to the militants' huge war chest. According to reports in the Daily Mirror, British financial institutions are aware of the attacks and working overtime to prevent their customers' funds being extracted. A source told the paper: 'The hackers are targeting the accounts of the rich and famous, VIP clients of banks and big businesses. 'This is an international fraud on an unprecedented scale and the result could be a bottomless pit of money to fund their campaign of terror.' Court case: Abu Hussain, 20, pictured above at Southwark Crown Court, was jailed for six months in 2012 for stealing personal information from Tony Blair and posting it online . Hussain has not directly mentioned hacking in his stream of Islamist posts, but a fellow fighter boasted of being bought pizza using celebrity credit card details acquired by a jihadist hacker. When the fanatics swept across Iraq this summer, conquering huge swathes of the country, they also captured a central bank in Mosul, which they looted for hundreds of millions of pounds. The huge windfall immediately made them the world's richest terrorist organisation, and they have been expanding their financial clout as they storm across the country. A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association told the MailOnline that banks are always vigilant against attacks from all over the world, launched by anyone from petty criminals to major organisations. A spokesman said: 'Protecting their customers' money is the banks' number one priority. That's why they spend hundreds of millions of pounds a year hiring cyber security experts to combat these kind of threats. 'If you as a customer fall victim to fraud through no fault of your own you are almost certain to have your money quickly reimbursed.' A spokesman for GCHQ, the government's intelligence and security organisation, declined to comment on attacks from the Islamic State.","Junaid Hussain, 20, from Birmingham, is feared to be behind cyber attacks .

"The average American child consumes nearly 300 calories from liquid sugar alone each day - a combined total of 7 trillion calories each year, a public health professor suggests. Dr Steven Gortmaker, Director of the Harvard School of Public Health Prevention Research Center, is sounding the alarm and pushing for increased government involvement to keep sodas and sugary drinks away from kids, as part of his presentation at the Obesity Society's Annual Scientific Meeting in San Antonio, Texas on September 23. The sweet drinks are increasingly a poison to younger Americans, aged two to 19 - a population of an estimated 73.5 million, as they contribute to the ever-growing childhood obesity rates in the U.S. Scroll down for video. Just say no: Dr. Steven Gortmaker, in October 2011, speaking on behalf of Boston's anti-sugary drink initiative . Young people chug an estimated 270 calories per day due to sugary drinks, accounting for over 19 billion calories a day nationwide. Calorie recommendation for children (depending on age and gender)  range from 1,200 to 2,200, so calories from sugary beverages, on average, accounts from anywhere from 15 to 25 per cent of their daily recommended allotment. Sales of drinks for these mini-consumers totaled an estimated $24 billion in sales, according to Scientific America. New information on beverage consumption by children in the U.S., comes as the childhood obesity epidemic continues to spread with rates among adolescents having tripled since 1980. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 17 per cent of American youth (or 12.5 million) are obese. Gortmake's presentation in Texas comes on the heels of extensive research in the September issue of the New England Journal of Medicine on the impact of sugar-sweetened beverages on childhood obesity rates. 'During the past 30 years, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has increased dramatically. Compelling evidence supports a positive link between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and the risk of obesity,' the authors of the academic paper, Sugar-Sweetened Beverages and Genetic Risk of Obesity, wrote. On the rise: Obesity rates have been increasing in the past years . Dr Gortmaker has supported a . Boston-area initiative to ban the sale of sodas at public schools, which . was adopted in 2004, and he is calling for broader initiatives to be . implemented across the country. 'Populations in the U.S. drink tons of . sugary sweetened beverage. The average high school student actually . drinks more than 300 calories of sugar water every day,' the Harvard . professor said at a press conference in October 2011, on behalf of a campaign to curb access to sweet drinks. He said with fewer sugary options available at Boston schools, 'kids reduced overall consumption per day by 45 calories.' '45 calories a day is just the level . you need to start flattening out the obesity epidemic, if not to start . turning it around,' he added. Obesity rates: For children aged 2-19 in the U.S., obesity rates are highest among boys . But the beverage lobby was quick to respond that sugary drinks cannot bear all the blame for obesity in the U.S. 'Obesity is a serious and complex public health issue facing our nation . and the rest of the world, and we all must work together to solve it,' the American Beverage Association said in a statement. 'We know, and science supports, that obesity is not uniquely caused by . any single food or beverage.  Thus, studies and opinion pieces that . focus solely on sugar-sweetened beverages, or any other single source of . calories, do nothing meaningful to help address this serious issue,' the statement added.

Pint-sized guzzlers: Young people chug an estimated 270 calories per day due to sugary drinks, accounting for over 19 billion calories a day nationwide . The childhood obesity epidemic is different from children simply being overweight. According . to the CDC, being overweight means having an excess body weight for a . particular height from fat, muscle, bone, water, or a combination of . these factors. Obesity is defined specifically as having excess body fat. Growing obesity rates among . children has increasingly gained attention with First Lady Michelle . Obama launching an initiative to promote healthy eating and exercise - . while also lobbying for healthier school lunch options and companies to stop advertising junk food to children. Similarly, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg . recently introduced a measure to ban the sale of sugary drinks in . containers larger than 16 ounces, as a means to fight obesity in the Big Apple. But . the ban, which was approved by the New York City Board of Health in . September, has been met with disdain and irked the beverage lobby, who call it a violation of consumer rights.

"Tracked: Scientists have developed a formula to forecast our future movements through phone software . From telling us when our train is coming, helping us when we're lost and letting us watch our favourite TV shows, there seems no limit to how involved our smartphone is with our day-to-day life. Now the gadget promises something so advanced it verges on the supernatural: it will know exactly what we're doing tomorrow. Scientists have found a way of predicting an individual's future movements by analysing information their mobile phone. A team of computer . scientists at the University of Birmingham successfully predicted future . locations with an error margin of just 60ft, which has fuelled fears of . privacy invasions. While mobile phone networks can already track where a handset is in 'real time', the scientists have developed an algorithm - or formula - to forecast our future movements. They . compared data from one individual and their closest social network to . predict a person’s future location based on places and areas visited in . the past and the frequency of contact between those studied, The Sunday . Times reported. For example, if two individuals who have close contact visit a particular restaurant, it is highly likely that this is where they will be the next time they are both heading towards the area where the restaurant is. This means that mobile phone providers will be able to predict the future whereabouts of their customers . The study used mobile phone data from a group of 200 people living in the vicinity of Lausanne in Switzerland. Dr. Mirco Musolesi, who led the study, . said: ‘Information extracted from the usage of a mobile phone is an . intriguing source of data about people behaviour.' Social network: The study used data from phones of individuals and those whom they were in close contact with to calculate their future locations with surprising accuracy . He added: ‘We have shown that the accuracy of the prediction of an individual’s future locations could be improved if his or her previous movement and the mobility information of his or her social group are taken into account.’ He said that the formula may not reflect the general population and would be more accurate in cities where people’s moves tend to be synchronised. Although it will be of great help to marketing companies and possibly law enforcements, privacy groups such as Big Brother Watch fear it will invade privacy. ‘This development highlights huge privacy concerns’, Emma Carr, deputy director of Big Brother Watch told the Sunday Times. Mr Musolesi tweeted plans of releasing the algorithm as an API (application programming interface) which would open up commercial possibilities for app-wizards and mobile phone service providers. In terms of marketing it means that advertising agencies will be able to target individuals with personalised advertisements using information about where the person has been and where he or she might be going. But it could also be a tool for third-party apps offering discounts and other offers where the app would be able to provide real-time deals available at venues and areas where a person is predicted to beat a specific time and day. The team also expressed hopes that their algorithm could be used by the police force in prediction of the future location of criminal events.","Your future location is calculated using data from your phone .

"'Love u... miss you... love u... miss you.' This is the heartbreaking last text cricketer Phillip Hughes sent his best friend, two weeks before he died from a fatal accident at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Meagan Simpson, 26, was on holiday in Hawaii when she got the tender message.

Scroll down for video . Phillip Hughes' best friend Meagan Simpson, 26, says the cricketer was the best friend 'anyone could ask for' The pair bonded over late night phone calls, coffee and shopping trips and helped set each other up on dates, far away from the spotlight cast over Phillip as an international sports star. Meagan met Phillip three years ago, when he chatted to her in a Sydney pub, and they were inseparable ever since. ‘We were at his favourite pub in Sydney, The Palace at Breakfast Point… he tried to pick me up and told me he was a banker. I didn’t know who he was at that point,’ Meagan fondly told Daily Mail Australia. The sports coach was working for AFL team the Giants at the time and was probed by players on the team who spotted her in the pub, about how she knew Phillip. Meagan, a sports coach, and Phillip met three years ago in his favourite Sydney pub . This is the last text Phillip Hughes sent Meagan. She received it while she was on holiday in Hawaii . ‘They said “he’s an Australian cricketer”. I felt like a silly bugger. But that was him being humble.’ After their first meeting Phillip called Meagan ‘every day for the next week’. ‘We had both been through pretty bad breakups; neither of us wanted to start anything new and didn’t want to hurt each other. ‘He said “I really want you in my life forever” and we just became friends,’ Meagan explained. As she struggles to come to terms with her loss, Meagan said she still questions what Phillip saw in her that first night they met. ‘We clicked; we just got along so well. And from then it’s been weekly conversations or late night calls, or whenever we needed each other.’ Phillip told her he wanted her in his life 'forever' and would send her selfies via text message while they were apart . The pair enjoyed chatting over coffee and shopping trips and Phillip would ask Meagan's advice on what to wear . In this photo that Phillip sent Meagan he is on his farm in Macksville, the place he always hoped to return home to one day . They pair both loved sport and Meagan learned a lot about cricket by going to watch Phillip play. He ‘now loves the Giants because I worked there,’ she said. Heartbreakingly, Meagan described Phillip as ‘the best friend anyone could ask for’. ‘He was always there when you needed him and that says a lot when someone is so famous and when he has so many other things going on. Whenever I needed him he was there. ‘He was cheeky and funny and always made you laugh. He just had a genuine interest in you and invested time into our friendship. ‘I still don’t know how I got so lucky to have him as a friend; obviously he saw something in me.’ Meagan would go and watch Phillip at his cricket games and he started supporting the AFL team that she worked for . 'He sent me flowers on my birthday no matter how far away he was': Meagan described Phillip as a thoughtful and dependable friend . Phillip introduced Meagan to all of ‘the boys whether cricketers or mates’ and since his death, on Thursday 27 November, Australian Cricket Captain Michael Clarke told her: ‘You know he loved you so much, that’s all we need to say about it.’ ‘I did share him with two other best friends, they were male. I was the only girl best friend who was there purely as a friend, nothing else. ‘Some struggled with that. People always thought we were dating but in Phillip’s eyes it was “Meagan is just one of the boys”,’ she explained. Meagan said Phillip acted the same way in front of her as he did with the boys and she ‘really respected that about him’. The best friends kept in regular contact even when Meagan was living in the US and Phillip was in England, she laughed that he ‘could never figure out Skype’. ‘In the last few months he worked out Facetime. But we couldn’t talk via Facebook, he didn’t have Facebook or Instagram – he preferred a good old fashioned meeting and having a coffee. ‘He was always there though. He sent me flowers on my birthday no matter how far away he was.’ Australian Cricket Captain Michael Clarke, seen here at Phillip Hughes' funeral, told Meagan: 'You know he loved you so much, that’s all we need to say about it' Phillip was killed after he was hit in the head by a ball, during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, in a rare and tragic accident . On his frequent coffee catch ups, Phillip would sometimes have three or four in a row, going from café to café so he could continue talking. ‘We’d go from one place to another in one day. He loved taking me shopping. I have so many memories of him trying things on and him saying “what about this one”… he’d ask “which tie should I wear with my suit?” ‘He loved his fashion and a good fitting cap and shirt and suit. He always checked himself before he went out of the house,’ Meagan remembered.

Since Phillip was killed after he was hit in the head by a ball, during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground – in a rare and tragic accident – thousands of people around the world have laid out tributes and offered condolences to the batsman’s family and friends. Meagan said the support has been ‘phenomenal’ and Phillip ‘would be looking down laughing and thinking “all this for me”.’ ‘I don’t think he realised how truly loved he was. It’s so good to see but at the same time it is hard sharing such a personal thing with rest of world. You want to be selfish at times, but its’ a testament to Phillip the person. ‘We can’t thank the world enough.’ Phillip 'would be looking down laughing and thinking ""all this for me"",' Meagan says . Thousands of people around the world have laid out tributes and offered condolences to the batsman’s family and friends . When they weren’t joking around about ‘sexy cows’ at Phillip’s parent’s farm in Macksville, the pair would talk about their future and how one day Meagan would bring her children to see their Uncle Phil at the farm. ‘We spoke about a lot of things. Whether it was cricket or what present to buy his sister for her birthday, girl problems he may have had. ‘He talked about how he missed his parents. I’ve never seen someone love their parents so much, he would call his dad five times a day,’ she recalled. Despite his fame and success on the cricket pitch, Meagan said one thing was always clear: ‘His life goal was to go back to Macksville.’ Despite his fame and success on the cricket pitch, Meagan said one thing was always clear: 'His life goal was to go back to Macksville' Flowers adorned the gate at the Hughes' cattle stud in Macksville this week.

Meagan has vowed to visit Phillip’s parents in his hometown three or four times a year ‘for the rest of my life’ and has already book a trip there for between Christmas and New Year’s. She has so many memories of her time with Phillip and has ‘no words to truly say how amazing he is’. ‘We joked my kids would come up to see Uncle Phil and the cows.

"A Burbank woman was held in a jail cell for 10 hours for painting her nails on an aeroplane. Jeanie Daniels was on board a Southwest Airlines plane from Los Angeles to Houston, Texas on January 26, on her way to see her boyfriend when a flight attendant took offence to the smell of the varnish and asked her to put it away. ‘I said I’m sorry, I apologize and I put it away,’ Daniels told CBS Local. ‘About 10 minutes into the flight I discovered I only had two nails left to paint so I thought, well if I went to the bathroom and did it, it wouldn’t offend anyone.” 10 hours: Jeanie Daniels (left) was flying to see boyfriend Jimmy Hauser but was arrested after painting her nails on the flight . Jailed: Jeanie Daniels was put in handcuffs and jailed for 10 hours when she stepped off the Southwest Airlines flight . But when she left the bathroom she found another flight attendant lying in wait for her, angry that Daniels had gone ahead and continued to use the nail paint despite being told not to. The pair began to argue and it got heated, with Daniels swearing at the attendant. She told CBS that she told the attendant to ‘Stop bitching at me’. Daniels added: ‘She was getting so loud when I was sitting in my seat. I was like, just stop, and I was loud because she wouldn’t end the conversation.’ As she stepped off the flight 1536 plane she was handcuffed by two police officers. They interviewed Daniels, the attendant and a witness and carted her off to a police station on a charge of using ‘abusive profane language’. The charges were dropped by the DA, but not before Daniels spent 10 hours in jail.

"Dozens of corrupt police officers helped organised criminals hide evidence, intimidate witnesses and access details of ongoing operations, according to a leaked report. An internal investigation by the Metropolitan Police claimed officers were bribed to destroy surveillance logs and some officers even co-owned houses and racehorses with suspected gang leaders. The 2002 report, produced as part of Operation Tiberius, an investigation into police corruption, named 80 corrupt officers. More than half of them were still serving at the time. 'Corrupt': The report alleges that criminals had free access to information held by the Metropolitan Police . The documents, leaked to the Independent, concludes that organised criminals were able to infiltrate Scotland Yard 'at will' and access confidential information from secure databases. The report, written by a team led by Andy Hayman, the force's former assistant commissioner, spoke to informants, used intelligence from intercepted telephone conversations, interviewed officers and scoured old police files to reach its conclusions. The Metropolitan Police today insisted that the force has 'changed vastly' since the report was completed. But a recently retired senior officer, speaking anonymously to the newspaper, said that: 'The Met is still every bit as corrupt as it was back then.' Details of the report include a case in which a police statement from a sensitive witness was found in a nightclub controlled by a family of suspected gangsters. Other records claim that a man on trial for drug trafficking was able to pay officers £15,000 to destroy two 'crucial' surveillance logs. His trial later collapsed. At another point, a corrupt officer who discovered the existence of a highly sensitive informant was able to threaten his handler with reprisals if he any evidence about organised crime were to emerge. Another part of the report speaks of a corrupt officer who had 'an ongoing sexual relationship with a female drug supplier', and access police records for her. Speaking to MailOnline today, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police suggested that the report was 'outdated' and does not reflect the organisation as it is today. He said: 'I think everyone recognises that the police has changed vastly over the past five years - let alone the last 10 or 15 years.' A statement issued by the force also said that the Met continues to investigate corruption, and has 'no complacency' about the matter. It said: 'The dedicated Anti-Corruption Command (ACC), part of the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, proactively investigates any allegations or intelligence relating to either corrupt police officers and staff and those that may seek to corrupt our officers or staff. 'All such allegations and intelligence are taken extremely seriously and any any lessons learnt from resulting investigations are used to further our efforts to reduce the likelihood of such offences occurring in the future.'There is no complacency in the Met's determination to succeed in this task and the work of the officers and staff of the ACC is undertaken relentlessly and determinably, fully recognising that criminals who seek to corrupt our officers and staff will remain a threat.'","Internal investigation into corruption at the Metropolitan Police was leaked .

"David Cameron has laid down a challenge to European leaders to demand they stump up 1billion euros to help tackle Ebola. The Prime Minister said the spread of the deadly virus was the ‘biggest health problem for a generation’ - but that some leaders were not doing their bit. He has written to Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, to say Ebola should be placed on the agenda of next week’s Brussels summit. Mr Cameron said the 1billion euros would pay for 2,000 health workers to fly out to the affected West African countries, to help stem the spread of the disease. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron is calling for more funding to help tackle Ebola . So far, the EU has raised less than half of that sum. Britain, however, has already earmarked £125million to tackle Ebola - the largest sum in Europe and second in the world only to the US. The Prime Minister brought up the need for a more concerted international response to the Ebola crisis at Asia-Europe Meeting, a summit of world leaders from the two continents, in Milan yesterday. In the letter to Mr Van Rompuy and fellow leaders, the Prime Minister warned that ‘we need to act fast to contain and defeat this deadly virus’. He wrote: ‘If we do not significantly step up our collective response now, the loss of life and damage to the political, economic and social fabric of the region will be substantial and the threat posed to our citizens will also grow.’ He set out an ambitious package of measures to be agreed at next week’s EU summit. Top of the list is raising contributions from the EU and its member states up to 1billion euros in total. This would help pay for 2,000 workers to go the region to tackle the disease, including 1,000 clinical staff, by the middle of November. The PM meets Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a meeting on Ukraine's crisis yesterday . Mr Cameron said he also wanted to see increased co-ordination on screening at ports of entry to Europe, and better sharing of best practice on handling cases to help to reduce the risk of further transmission within the EU. Britain is also proposing that the EU could help further reduce the transmission rate in West Africa by better co-ordination amongst member states to ensure weekly flights from Europe to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia for frontline health staff. We want to see a duty of care package for health workers at European run or funded facilities that would, in the case they become infected, guarantee treatment based on clinical advice to a European standard in country or medical evacuation. Britain is also calling for better testing for ebola and further staffed labs. Calling on European leaders to agree this package, the Prime Minister wrote: ‘The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is an issue that requires a substantial global response. The RFA Argus left Falmouth for Sierra Leone today with her crew of RFA, Royal Navy and Royal Marine Commandos . ‘The rapid spread of the disease and recent cases outside the West African region demonstrate the magnitude of the task at hand. ‘I believe that much more must be done. The European Council next week provides us with the opportunity to commit to an ambitious package of support to help reduce the rate of transmission in West Africa, to reduce the risk of transmission within Europe, and to pledge long-term support to assist with recovery, resilience and stability in the region. ‘By co-ordinating our approach, I believe the EU and its member states can maximise the effectiveness of our response.’ Britain has set aside £125million to tackle Ebola - second highest after United States of America. The UK is also working with the World Health Organisation to train more than 120 health workers a week, and to develop an Ebola training facility to train over 800 health workers a week.

"Victim: The 28-year-old expatriate, who cannot be named, admitted to police she had had a drink when the alleged attack took . place (file picture) A British woman who was allegedly kidnapped and gang-raped by three men in Dubai found herself in the dock for drinking without an alcohol licence. The 28-year-old expatriate, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted to police she had been drinking when the alleged attack took place and was prosecuted and fined £169. Under Islamic law in the United Arab Emirates, drinking without an alcohol licence is a crime. Two of the Iranians accused of raping her are facing trial while a third defendant cannot be traced. The woman, who works in a managerial position, said her ordeal lasted hours with the alleged rapists filming the attack and taunting her, despite her pleas to be let go. Dubai Court of First Instance heard she was subjected to a sustained attack after being taken hostage and driven to a flat in Naif, a rundown area of Dubai. She eventually escaped when the defendants left her on a mattress to find her own way home. The defendants' lawyer Saeed al Gilani has claimed she made up the story after watching 'too many action movies'. He added: 'She has a boyfriend who threw her out of his flat when he heard she'd had a relationship with the defendants. She then went to police and claimed she was raped.' Prosecutors claimed the alleged victim had spent six hours at Rock Bottom, the same bar in Bur Dubai where missing Scottish sailor Timmy MacColl was last seen. However the woman, who cannot be named, said that she was out with her boyfriend and he went home but realised he didn't have the keys to their flat. She then went to Rock Bottom to meet a friend to get her car keys and because she was driving she said she did not have much to drink. It was at the bar that she believes her drink was spiked. She left at 3am on July 6 and got into a cab, asking the driver to take her to Arabian Ranches residential area. The 37-year-old Pakistani taxi driver told the court she was 'very drunk' and fell asleep on the back seat, but the victim believes that she appeared this way because of the drugs she had been spiked with. Drinks: The alleged victim had spent six hours at Rock Bottom, the same bar in Bur Dubai where missing Scottish sailor Timmy MacColl was last seen .

He said when she woke up, she changed . her mind and told him to go to Jumeirah Beach Residence instead, . stopping at a cash machine. She got out of the car but got back in . without taking out any money. When they finally reached their . destination, he told how she stumbled inside without paying the £10 fare . and had to be persuaded by security to return to the car. Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences. The . woman reportedly got into the driver's seat of the taxi, prompting him . to remove his car keys, when a red Hyundai pulled up alongside them. The three Iranian men in the car claimed they knew the woman, paid the taxi driver £17 and escorted her to their Hyundai. She was taken to the apartment in Naif, where the three men allegedly took turns to rape her while filming the attack. The woman said in a statement: 'I begged them to let me go but they didn't and were laughing at me.' When she tried to escape by running . toward the door and window, she was repeatedly dragged back onto a . mattress, injuring her hand and foot, the court heard. 'They ignored my pleas and laughed at me, speaking to each other in broken English,' she said. The men, all aged 20, left her dazed and lying on a mattress in the unlocked flat, giving her a chance to escape. She caught a taxi back to her apartment at 8.30am, where her flatmate found her in a 'confused' state. The 26-year-old friend said: 'She told me she had been raped. She changed her dress. 'We went to lodge a complaint at Rashidiya police station.' The . flatmate warned her not to shower before filing a complaint. Blood . tests taken later that day did not show any traces of alcohol. But . judge Jamal Abdel Majeed, sitting in Dubai Misdemeanours Court, found . the woman guilty of illegally consuming alcohol as she did not own an . alcohol licence and admitted she had been drinking. Two of the men accused of raping her are on trial but deny charges of kidnap and rape. The third man has not been traced. Investigating . officers said one of the accused, who has not been named, said he was . 'scared of kidnapping a British woman' but blamed his co-defendant for . persuading him to carry out the attack by saying: 'She is drunk and . won't recognise us.' First . corporal Marwan Salem, of Dubai police, said they lured her into their . car by pretending the vehicle was hers. He added her underwear and . belongings were found in the flat. A forensic report showed she was injured during the alleged incident. The trial will continue on Wednesday. Recruitment consultant Rebecca Blake, 29, (pictured) was sentenced to three months in a Dubai jail for having drunken sex in the back of a taxi. She was arrested earlier this year after partially stripping off in the back of the cab after a 10-hour drinking binge. DNA tests to find evidence of intercourse came back negative. Last year, British tourist Lee Bradley Brown, 39, was allegedly beaten to death by officers in a Dubai police station after being arrested for swearing. In 2010 Charlotte Adams, 26, from Essex, and Ayman Najafi, 25, of North London, were jailed for a 'peck on the cheek' in a restaurant. Vince Acors, 35, and Michelle Palmer, 37, were convicted of public indecency and having unmarried sex while on a Dubai beach in 2008. They were jailed for three months and ordered to pay fines of £155 each. BBC Radio One DJ Grooverider,(pictured) real name is Raymond Bingham, was jailed in 2008 for four years in Dubai after taking 2.16 grams of cannabis into the UAE. He was pardoned after serving seven months . British women, Sally Antia, 44, and Marnie Pearce, 40, have both been jailed for adultery in Dubai.

"Saudi Arabia's national airline is allegedly planning to separate male and female passengers on its flights, in accordance to strict rules enforced by the Gulf kingdom. Gulf media report that Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives. The move follows a spate of complaints from male fliers unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members. National carrrier Saudia will keep men and women segregated onboard, unless they are close relatives . Complaints were also recently made when male passengers claimed a flight attendant was being too 'flirty'. 'There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,' Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, told Saudi  daily, Ajel. It is thought that the airline will include instructions to flight booking staff at Gulf airports to keep these new rules in place. The carrier's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia: no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served onboard, a prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area. In addition, Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead.

The country is known for its gender segregation, with  women  requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home.

Women who are seen socialising with a man who is not a relative can even be  charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.

"Pregnant women who sleep on their backs are at greater risk of having a stillbirth . Pregnant women who sleep on their backs are at greater risk of having a stillbirth, a new study suggests. Mothers-to-be in Ghana who slept in this position were found to be five times more likely to have a baby with a low birth weight, and for some women this resulted in a stillbirth, the researchers said. The researchers also claimed that more than a quarter of cases of stillbirth might be avoided simply by ensuring that women change their sleeping position. The study was conducted in Ghana where between 20 and 50 of every 1,000 babies are stillborn, compared with just 3.5 per 1,000 in the UK. But a recent study in New Zealand suggests that supine sleep - the technical term for sleeping on your back - is linked to higher stillbirth rates in high income countries, too. The study's senior author, Louise O'Brien, from the University of Michigan, said: ‘If maternal sleep position does play a role in stillbirth, encouraging pregnant women everywhere not to sleep on their back is a simple approach that may improve pregnancy outcomes. ‘In Ghana, inexpensive interventions are urgently needed to improve pregnancy outcomes. ‘This is a behaviour that can be modified - encouraging women to avoid sleeping on their back would be a low-cost method to reduce stillbirths in Ghana and other low-income countries. ‘The data in this study suggests that more than one-quarter of stillbirths might be avoided by altering maternal sleep position.’ Experts suggest that pregnant women try to sleep on their side, ideally on their left side because this can improve the blood flow to the placenta. In the new study the researchers interviewed women shortly after they had given birth at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana. Scientists found that those who had slept on their backs during pregnancy risked compression on the vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower part of the body to the heart. This means the heart is not pumping as blood as effectively as it should, which may lead to stillbirth. Researchers said the study shows that giving pregnant women simple advice on how to sleep could radically reduce the number of stillbirths. This research supports a recent . Australian study which suggested that pregnant women who sleep on their . backs are six times more likely to have a stillborn baby. The researchers claim that a quarter of stillbirths in Ghana might be avoided by ensuring that women change their sleeping position . The study, known as the Sydney Stillbirth Study, looked at the pregnancies of 295 women from eight hospitals around Australia. The five-year study found that women who sleep on their backs are six times more likely to have a stillborn baby. Lead researcher Dr Adrienne Gordon, from Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, said previous research had suggested prolonged periods in this position restricted blood flow to the baby. The researchers added it was important that women who are currently pregnant 'don’t become alarmed if they sometimes sleep on their back'. Commenting at the time, Emma Laing, midwifery manager for baby charity Tommy’s, told MailOnline: 'Given the small number of women monitored in this study, it would be impossible to say whether the findings can provide accurate recommendations for pregnant women about sleeping on their back during the latter stages of pregnancy. 'What we do know is that 20 per cent of the 4,000 stillbirths that happen each year in the UK remain unexplained, and we certainly need further research to find out why stillbirth happens. 'Should women have any concerns or feel their babies' movements have decreased, they should contact their midwife or speak to our midwives here at Tommy’s for advice.' Tommy’s midwives can be contacted on the charity’s freephone PregnancyLine: 0800 0147 800. A stillborn baby is a baby born dead . after 24 weeks of pregnancy. If the baby dies before 24 completed weeks, . it is known as a late miscarriage. There . are around 4,000 stillbirths every year in the UK and 11 babies are . stillborn every day in the UK, making it ten times more common than cot . death. In almost half of stillbirths, the direct cause of the baby's death cannot be established. Ten . per cent of stillborn babies have some kind of abnormality and other . possible causes include problems with the mother's health or problems . with the placenta, which links the baby’s blood supply to the mother’s.","Women in Ghana were found to be at greater risk of stillbirth if they slept on their backs during pregnancy .
May be because the position reduces blood flow from the lower part of the body to the heart .

"The Israeli education minister burst into a laughing fit over the word 'penetration' during a speech about smuggling in prisons. Shai Piron, who is also a rabbi, could not get past the first sentence of the address because he was laughing so much. A video of the hysterical minister has now gone viral on Israeli websites. Scroll down for video . Shai Piron broke down in fits of giggles when he tried to read a speech with the word 'penetration' in it . Despite repeatedly attempting to regain his composure, Mr Piron could not get past the first sentence . Mr Piron was addressing Parliament on a new law against smuggling cell phones into prisons. However, despite repeated attempts he could not get through the speech without laughing. He eventually had to abandon the attempt and let a cabinet colleague take over. 'Mr Chairman, distinguished Parliament, the aim of this legislation is to deal with a serious phenomenon - the penetration of prohibited objects into prisons,' he said during a late night session on Monday broadcast on the official Knesset TV channel. He immediately began to giggle but then tried to recover his composure. The minister's hysteria got worse when legislators in the audience started laughing with him and some were giggling so much they begun to cry (left) However, when audience members also began to laugh, Mr Piron could not contain himself. He broke down again over the perceived sexual innuendo when the word 'penetration' came up in the text for a second time. Legislators in the hall joined in the giggling. Struggling to continue, Piron wiped tears from his eyes, took a sip of water, and coughed in a bid to stop laughing.

Flyer James Wilson said travellers on Monday's flight from San Francisco to Dallas knew something was wrong when they felt the fuselage begin to shake violently and heard popping noises outside the Boeing 757 shortly after take-off. Astonished travellers feared the plane would crash as interior panels on both sides of the cabin pulled apart from the walls, exposing insulation, and they felt a change in cabin pressure due to a possible blown air duct.

He told ABC7: ‘All of a sudden (we heard) this loud pop, pop, pop … really loud and this ripping sound. It sounded like bowling balls were falling from the overhead bins. ‘It was terrifying. We didn’t know what was going on. ‘We were all shouting for the flight crew, “Come look the walls are caving in!”.’ The 32-year-old race car driver, who was seated in Row 16, said crew members were ‘pulling the panels apart and looking for daylight behind there.’ Fearing the worst, he posted photographs and updates during a live-blog on his Facebook page and sent text messages to his wife, who was supposed to meet him in Dallas, so she would know what happened in case of a crash.

"A damning leaked ECB document exposes Kevin Pietersen as a hypocrite and a divisive influence. It also confirms the findings of a series of Sportsmail investigations into the controversial sacking of the England star. Pietersen has used his new autobiography to portray a bullying culture in the England dressing room and has accused Matt Prior, Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad of being at the centre of it. A dossier of information on Kevin Pietersen put together by the ECB has been revealed . The relationship between Pietersen and England's then head coach Andy Flower (right) had hit an all-time low . Pietersen, pictured during the last Ashes series, told his side of the story in his new autobiography . Sportsmail's Paul Newman reveals how Kevin Pietersen tried to woo England coach Andy Flower . However, in the report, he is said to have described the very same dressing room during the first Ashes Test in November 2013 as ‘the best environment I’ve ever experienced’. The dossier, which was leaked to the website ESPN Cricinfo, is a small section of a private first draft of a legal document that has been compiled in recent weeks by the ECB ahead of the publication of Pietersen’s book. Yet even though it is far from the full story of the fall-out that led to Pietersen’s international demise, it is revealing enough to make a mockery of the maverick batsman’s side of a bitter and rancorous story. Sportsmail revealed much of the content of the document both at the time of Pietersen’s sacking after the 5-0 Ashes humiliation and in the last few days but for the first time England fans can now chart on a day-by-day basis the behaviour that undermined captain Alastair Cook and coach Andy Flower. Batsmen Pietersen attempted to oust Andrew Strauss (right) as captain of the England team . The five-page section of the draft is marked STRICTLY PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL and reveals that: . In his book - and subsequent interviews - Pietersen states he was left crying and broken by a spoof Twitter account that parodied him. In a delicious irony, the leaked document reveals that Pietersen told his team-mates to ‘get a thicker skin’ when they complained about his friend Piers Morgan, who was making disparaging remarks about Cook on social media. The five-page section of the ECB dossier draft is marked STRICTLY PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL . Pietersen (right) has a series of high-profile supporters, including Piers Morgan (centre) As revealed by Sportsmail at the time, Pietersen whistled insouciantly on his way back to the pavilion after his second-innings dismissal in the fifth Test. The document also claims that, after the game was lost, Pietersen walked out, saying ‘I don’t give a f***’. It further alleges that Pietersen would pointedly look out of the window or at his watch while Flower was addressing the team. Earlier on Tuesday, the 34-year-old rounded on his critics during a lively start to the extensive promotion of his autobiography, condemning Swann and then storming out on the BBC’s Jonathan Agnew when he tried to ask him about the text scandal that could have ended his England career. Agnew, the BBC’s respected cricket correspondent, was brought in at the end of an interview on Radio 5 Live and was asked where Pietersen had gone wrong. Agnew brought up the derogatory texts sent by Pietersen to South African opponents about Andrew Strauss, a subject that he covered in an unsatisfactory manner in his book. Instead of tackling that issue, Pietersen responded by again bringing up his hurt at the parody Twitter account @kpgenius that he claims was operated by the likes of Swann and Stuart Broad. Then he walked out without listening to Agnew’s reply. When asked earlier about the BlackBerry messages, which were uncovered by Sportsmail’s Lawrence Booth two years ago, Pietersen admitted regret at sending them but was again evasive about their content. ‘It’s something I regret because I got Andrew Strauss involved in a situation he should not have got into and I am sad that our relationship got a bit iffy after that.’ Upon receiving his 100th cap, Pietersen described the England dressing room in November 2013 as 'the best environment that I have ever experienced' only to then describe and deride a 'bullying' culture within the team . Click here to read the view of respected cricket writer Michael Henderson . But what was in the texts? ‘I haven’t got a clue,’ he maintained. ‘There was a constant stream of messages and I know the theme was not complimentary towards Straussy because of the way he had been treating me. ‘The general feeling of the whole thing was that he was treating me badly. The South Africans picked up on it.’ Elsewhere during the interview by Adrian Chiles, Pietersen responded to Swann’s comment that his book was ‘a work of fiction’ by insisting that the retired spinner was at the heart of the bullying culture that he claims was rife in the England dressing room. Pietersen described Alastair Cook's captaincy of the England cricket team as 'weak' and 'tactically inept' ‘Swann is at the centre of this,’ said Pietersen. ‘I know that everything in this book I can stand by a hundred per cent. I put bullying into the perspective of the England dressing room, as to how certain individuals made others feel in that dressing room. Pietersen did not dispute the dossier but said: 'It's a joke. I don't even want to give it any thought' ‘Jonathan Trott lost it in Bangladesh, he started screaming at Swann and Broad because they kept going at him. We’re supposed to be able to enjoy ourselves, not be scared to take a catch or field a ball.’ Pietersen, who was sacked in the aftermath of England’s 5-0 Ashes humiliation, again insisted that the alleged involvement of England players in the fake Twitter account was at the centre of his problems. ‘They can be funny if they are run by someone outside the dressing room making fun of you,’ said Pietersen of an account that Richard Bailey, a friend of Broad, admitted operating. ‘But when it is run from inside the dressing room, as I was led to believe, then it paints a very different picture. These are guys you go to battle with, these are guys you share the dressing room with for days and days, years and years, and then I get this feeling of total horror that I find out this is going on.’ Yet there is a strong feeling within English cricket that Pietersen is exaggerating the extent of his hurt at the parody, which the players strongly deny being involved in, to somehow excuse his texts about Strauss which came at the same time. Pietersen did not dispute the contents of the dossier but said: ‘It’s embarrassing, they couldn’t even spell Cooky’s name right. It’s a joke. I don’t even want to give it any thought. I’m just getting on with my life.’ VIDEO Pietersen blasts former England 'regime'","Damning ECB document on Kevin Pietersen has been leaked .

"Tracey Sharp finally left the family farm she lived on with 'husband' Philip and his six 'wives' and now lives with her children in their own apartment . A mother who shared a man known as the ‘Rampant Rabbi’ with six other women has described their bizarre family life together – and explained why she finally walked out on him. Tracey Sharp, 46, claimed her ‘husband’ Philip, who has one legal wife, seven other ‘wives’ and 17 children, had ‘favourites’ and chose which woman shared his bed each night. She said he neglected her and forced her, like the rest of his women, to wear hats so that only he could see their hair. Finally she left, she claimed, because of his increasingly cold behaviour towards her. However, 53-year-old Mr Sharp, a self-proclaimed Rabbi, insisted yesterday that he told her to leave because she always insisted on being ‘top dog’ and was forever competing with the rest of his harem. Although the marriages are not legally binding, Mr Sharp, who never uses contraception, believes the women become his wives when they sleep with him. He claims to have received a message from God telling him he was a king from the Old Testament and should have many wives and children. Tracey met him in 1998 and ‘married’ him in 2001. She changed her surname to his by deed poll and went on to have two daughters with him – Naomi, nine, and Mischa, three. His other ‘wives’ also had ten children between them – on top of the five he had with his first wife – and all lived together on a farm in Whatlington, East Sussex. Although still legally separated from his legal wife Hadass, he now has six remaining ‘wives’ called Judith, Hannah, Vreni, Margo, Karyn and Chava, ranging in age from 29 to 68. The children are all home-schooled at the £675,000 farm, where the family exist on benefits of £1,500 a month, pensions and what they can make selling horses. Mr Sharp says he part-owns the property, which is up for sale, with two of his ‘wives’ and his mother-in-law. Togetherness: From left, Tracey, Judith Chava, Margo, Philip,Vreni Hannah and Karyn, with seven of the children they have had together . Rabbi Philip Sharp with wives (L-R) Margo, Tracey and Vreni and new daughters Shayna and Yanis . According to Tracey Sharp, after a . decade with her ‘husband’ his lack of attention and affection began to . get to her and she became ‘miserable, but still under his spell’. ‘We hardly had sex and he got on better with the other wives. He’d been a caring lover but, near the end, he was cold.’ Two years ago, she plucked up the courage to walk out on him. She is now training to be a physiotherapist and lives in Sussex. Mrs Sharp told Closer magazine that . she had made the right decision. ‘I was lonely for a long time after . leaving, but I’ll never regret it. I’m a lot happier. I love my . independence and feel stupid for getting into that set-up.’ By contrast, Mr Sharp said yesterday . that the whole family had asked Tracey to leave because her behaviour . had become intolerable. ‘Nobody could work with her because she was so . angry and nasty to people when she didn’t get what she wanted,’ he said. Three's no crowd: Philip Sharp with pregnant wives Vreni (left) and Margo . Tracey (second left) pictured with Philip (centre) and the other 'wives' (from left) Judith, Chava, Vreni,  Margo, Hannah and Karyn . The interview with Tracey Sharp can be read in this week's edition of Closer, which is available now . ‘It’s because she’s so dominant and so . competitive that all the problems started. She was one of my . favourites, but if she found I’d done something for one of my other . wives she would be furious and demand to know why I hadn’t done the same . for her. ‘We tried to help her to learn to live . with others, but in the end I said it’s best you get your own place and . learn these things yourself.’ He said that the separation was amicable . initially, but he was forced to go on the dole because his haulage . business was struggling and he faced the ‘desperate financial situation’ of supporting a large family. He said that Tracey became angry when . he could no longer pay her child support. ‘I’m not perfect, none of us . are, but I am not anything like the man she portrays me as. I’m not a . cult leader. I don’t keep people in chains. My wives and children who . live with me are happy and are here out of choice.’ Despite all the upheaval he remains . convinced that Tracey will return to the family. ‘There’s no book giving . advice on being married to several wives at the same time so you have . to work it out as you go along. ‘I’m still deeply in love with Tracey . and I believe she’s still in love with me. I do think we will be able to . work it out and eventually will all be back.’ Another of his ‘wives’, Vreni, claimed . that Tracey went on holiday with him a few months ago. ‘She acts like a . little child. I love her, but she has her moments when she gets angry . when she doesn’t get her own way. ‘I think she left because she couldn’t . be top dog and now she’s throwing dirt. She keeps coming back and then . something will happen and she’ll leave again. I wish she’d come home to . us.’ The full feature appears in this week’s Closer magazine, on sale now .","Tracey Sharp lived with 'husband' Philip and his six other 'wives'

"An anti-shake spoon is allowing people with frustrating and disabling tremors enjoy their favourite foods once more. The Liftware spoon detects and then cancels out shakes and judders, allowing soup, cereal and other hard to manipulate foods be eaten with ease. The technology, which has been bought by Google, is aimed at Parkinson’s patients and other people with tremors. Scroll down for video . The £180  spoon has revolutionary electronics in its handle, which can cancel out shakes by 70 per cent . Uncontrollable shaking of the hand or arm is one of the first symptoms of Parkinson’s. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy people, with four in 100 adults aged 40-plus suffering from an essential tremor that when severe can make eating, drinking and writing extremely difficult. Cutting-edge electronics hidden in chunky handle of the Liftware spoon sense the tremor. They then move the handle in the opposite direction, to cancel out the shake. Similar technology is used in cameras to compensate for unsteady hands. The spoon’s creators, at San Francisco-based Lift Labs, say that it puts the dignity and enjoyment back into mealtimes. And that in trials, it cut tremors by more than 70 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Mealtime brings people together. It is more than a time for nourishing the body, we nourish our spirit and relationships. ‘A tremor, whether from essential tremor or Parkinson’s disease takes away from this experience, forcing people to focus instead on the basic task of eating. ‘We’ve invented the Liftware spoon to cancel hand tremor and take the frustration out of eating. ‘We are proud to offer a product that allows people to take charge of their tremor.’ At £180 the electronic spoon isn’t cheap – however, it does come with a 30-day money back guarantee. While Lift Labs is marketing the spoon at Parkinson's sufferers, charity Parkinson's UK say that people with the disease suffer tremors when their hand is at rest, meaning the spoon may not be useful . One customer told how the spoon allowed them to eat a bowl of cereal for the first time in years. Another told how they have eaten ‘multiple bowls’ of soup and cereal without spilling a drop. Fork and key holder attachments are also planned for the handle, which is comes with an electric toothbrush-like charger. Announcing its purchase of Lift Labs, Google said the technology ‘could improve quality of life for millions of people’. Google is increasingly investing in health technology. Its co-founder Sergey Brin has a personal interest in Parkinson’s. His mother has the disease and he carries a gene that raises his odds of developing it. However, Parkinson’s UK has questioned how useful the spoon will be for the 127,000 Britons with the disease. Daiga Heisters, the charity’s head of education, said: ‘The majority of people with Parkinson’s only have a tremor when their hand is resting and so this technology won’t help them.’","£180 Liftware spoon detects and cancels out shakes and judders by 70% .

"Sesame Street's Cookie Monster has become a symbol for far right extremists after he was used to help recruit children, according to German police. In the latest incident Neo Nazi Steffen Lange, 31, dressed as the popular children’s TV character, walked into a school in Senftenberg, in the German state of Brandenburg, and together with another Neo-Nazi handed out pamphlets to children. The Monster and his accomplice were arrested after a teacher complained to police about the contents of the leaflets. A search of the home of the two men found computers with far right material and other Neo Nazi Cookie Monster-related pamphlets. German police say the Sesame Street Cookie Monster has become a symbol for far right extremists after he was used to help recruit children . A police spokesman also confirmed that the Sesame Street character was increasingly being abused as a symbol of the far right seen in Brandenburg and in particular in helping to recruit children and to get them interested in the right-wing scene. One of the images found on the Internet shows the cookie monster with Adolf Hitler and other admirers under the caption: 'Who ate my biscuit'. A police spokesman investigating the scene in Brandenburg said: 'There is nothing humorous about far right ideology despite the fact they are trying to trivialise it by getting the Sesame Street character involved.

"No huge banners, no pre-match announcement and no chants. Malky Mackay is back in management — but the hearts and minds operation might take some time. When there was a half-hearted call for a wave from fans early in the first half, the fallen star of the Cardiff pantomime was too busy directing Marc-Antoine Fortune to respond. A year is a long time to be out of management, yet no time at all in the context of the damage he has done to his reputation. He is back now, though, and the challenge will be to ensure Wigan owner Dave Whelan has not hurt his own name for no tangible reward. Patrick Bamford spoiled Wigan's party with his equaliser for Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium . Bamford celebrates with team-mate George Friend (top) after his goal levelled the scores at 1-1 . Shaun Maloney opened the scoring with a stunning free-kick that looped over the Middlesbrough wall . Wigan (4-2-3-1): Carson 6; Boyce 6 (Perch 83), Ramis 6.5, Barnett 6, Taylor 6; Forshaw 6.5 (Watson 82), McCann 7; McManaman 6, Espinoza 6 (McClean 70, 6), Maloney 7; Fortune 5.5 . Subs not used: Nicholls, Riera, Huws, Figueroa . Goals: Maloney 24 . Booked: McCann, Boyce . Middlesbrough (4-4-2): Konstantopoulos 6; Nsue 6 (Fredericks 70, 6), Ayala 6, Gibson 6, Friend 6.5; Adomah 6, Clayton 6.5, Leadbitter 7.5, Reach 5.5 (Bamford 56, 7); Tomlin 6.5, Kike 6 (Wildschut 82). Subs not used: Mejias, Whitehead, Husband, Vossen. Goals: Bamford 58 . Booked: Clayton, Adomoah . MOM: Grant Leadbitter . Referee: David Webb 6.5 . Attendance: 16,347 . The best way to do that will be through results. It might be disheartening but it is true and, in that regard, a draw against the Championship’s third-placed team will work wonders. It would have been more had Mackay’s new side held on to the lead gained through Shaun Maloney’s 25th-minute free-kick. But Patrick Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, levelled in the second half and ensured there were only half smiles for Mackay and Whelan. Against the backdrop of a rotten week, that should be enough. The toll was clear on Whelan’s face as he made his way to his seat ahead of kick-off. Like the League Managers’ Association in the summer, Wigan’s chairman attempted to defend Mackay’s conduct and only succeeded in shooting himself in the foot. He has until early next week to explain his Jewish and Chinese remarks to the FA, amid calls for him to step down. For his part, he has already claimed any suggestion from the authorities that he is racist will lead to his resignation. Speaking before this fixture, he said: ‘Should they even suggest I’m guilty I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic. Maloney scores his side's first goal in their Championship match against Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium . Maloney wheels away in celebration after giving Malky Mackay the perfect start in charge of Wigan . ‘I hope they don’t and I don’t see anything like that happening because I’m absolutely anti-racist, always have been, always will be. However, if they have any questions I’m willing to answer it.’ It is a dramatic threat and one that would not be popular in these parts. He was afforded an ovation before the game and 30 seconds into the game there was a chant of ‘One Dave Whelan, only one Dave Whelan’. Boro’s contingent responded by singing: ‘You’re a town full of racists.’ And: ‘He texts what he wants, Malky Mackay, he texts what he wants.’ Pure pantomime. Dave Whelan, who has received widespread criticism this week, celebrates Wigan's opening goal . Mackay's first game in charge of Wigan Athletic ended in a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium . Meanwhile, the manager at the heart of this storm was a blur of hand movements and skips in the technical area. His enthusiasm was obvious and, for a time, it seemed like his fortune might turn. Maloney sounded an alarm with a delightful free-kick in the 10th minute which dipped on to the top of the bar. It was from an identical position on the edge of the area that he scored. From there it was largely a game controlled by Wigan. In their previous 12 games, they had won only once; in the same stretch Boro had lost only once.

Lee Tomlin of Middlesbrough (right) evades the challenge of Chris McCann during the match . Boro almost levelled shortly before the break. In a move of brilliance, Albert Adomah and Lee Tomlin produced a one-touch sequence to put Kike through on goal, but the striker curled the ball wide of the far post. Bamford came on 10 minutes into the second half and within three minutes had equalised. Mackay buried his head in his hands, but said later: ‘I didn’t know what the crowd would be like but everyone was so welcoming. ‘I am very proud that on the day my father and son were here and the hairs were up on the back of my neck. I’ve been long time in the Championship and I’ve no doubts as to to the size of the task.’ Scorer of Wigan's first goal, Maloney (left) takes the ball away from Emilio Nsue of Middlesbrough .

She and her husband were two of more than 250 runners and spectators injured in the blasts. Three died from their injuries. Back on the horse: Boston Marathon bombings survivor Adrianne Haslet-Davis danced for the first time since losing her left leg in the blasts at the April 2013 race . Survivor: Before losing her leg, Haslet- Davis taught 20 types of dance at a studio in Boston . Rhythmic technology: Haslet performed at the TED conference in Vancouver, BC Wednesday night using a specially-designed prosthetic . First of its kind: Hugh Herr (left) designed the prosthetic for Haslet-Davis and calls it the first prosthetic specifically made for dancing . While recovering from her injuries at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Haslet-Davis met Hugh Herr, director of the Biomechatronics group at the MIT Media lab who thought he might be able to help her dance again. Herr, a double amputee himself from a rock climbing accident in 1982, built the bombings survivor the first prosthetic leg specifically designed for dance. At the conference on Wednesday, Haslet-Davis debuted the leg with a routine to Enrique Iglesias' 'Ring My Bells', performing with dance partner Christian Lightner. In sickness and health: Haslet-Davis and her husband Adam - a captain in the Air Force - were two of the more than 250 injured in the blasts . Active: Haslet-Davis pictured camping with her husband before losing her leg . 'I'm thrilled to have danced again,' Haslet-Davis said after her routine. 'It was invigorating to dance publicly with my new leg, but also to realize that my return to dance may have the power to inspire other people to reach for their goals and be proactive in their lives.' 'My first dance happening to be so near the anniversary of the marathon bombing stands as a reminder that I'm a survivor, not a victim,' she added. In her statement, Haslet-Davis thanked Herr for the prosthetic gift that made it possible for her to dance again. Herr also appeared at the conference to talk about the new prosthetic and his other work. 'We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and more efficient,' he said. For Haslet-Davis, the new prosthetic opens up the opportunity for her to appear on Dancing with the Stars again. She made a guest appearance on the show last May, but hopes to dance on the show in the future. An inspiration: Haslet-Davis shared her story on Dancing with the Stars last May, vowing to return to dance .

"The Ministry of Defence will not be bringing in mandatory pregnancy tests for women despite a British soldier who did not know she was pregnant giving birth on the frontline in Afghanistan. There has been growing pressure for testing servicewomen before they head to the frontline after a Fijian-born British servicewoman had a son in Camp Bastion on Tuesday – just days after the Taliban launched a deadly attack on the UK’s main base in Helmand. It has also been revealed that 200 women have had to be sent home from Afghanistan and Iraq since 2003 because they have been pregnant. But this is . the first time a UK soldier has given birth to a baby in Afghanistan. Camp Bastion, Afghanistan: A Fijian woman soldier stationed at the British base in Helmand gave birth on Tuesday. The super fit squaddie did not even realise she was pregnant . Unexpected task: The soldier, who has not been named, was taken to Camp Bastion's £10million field hospital where Army medics delivered her baby . Currently soldiers have hearing, sight, blood and weight-related tests but nothing to find out if they are carrying a baby. 'No, we will not be bringing in mandatory pregnancy tests. We do not test women for lots of things and believe it really is up to them to come forward if they are pregnant,'  a MoD spokesman told MailOnline. 'The problem is that we could test them before they go but they could only produce a positive test weeks later. So we do not do it. 'There is only about ten cases a year and as soon as they find out we sent them home.' The baby was born five weeks premature and both mother and child were said to be doing well. A 'specialist paediatric retrieval team' from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford will travel to Afghanistan in . the next few days to provide care for the soldier and her son on their . RAF flight home. The birth has stunned military chiefs and led to calls for extra medical checks on women who are sent to the warzone. The . soldier, a gunner in the Royal Artillery who helped provide covering . fire for troops fighting insurgents, was unaware that she was carrying a . child. This screengrab of a video released by a Taliban . media unit purports to show last weekend's raid on Bastion: The . pregnant soldier, a gunner in the Royal Artillery, was part of the forces mobilised to defend the base . She had been deployed with the 12th Mechanised Brigade since March, but two days ago complained of severe stomach pains. Can you be pregnant on the front line? The MoD says that nobody can be deployed on operations if they are pregnant and if they fall pregnant or are found to be pregnant on tour then they will be sent home immediately. If they are at sea then they will be taken to the nearest port and sent home. As soon as they get back their duties until maternity leave starts will ensure they are kept healthy and safe. Are there pregnancy tests carried out before tours? No, testing of this kind does not happen on the basis that they believe a person would not knowingly go on tour when they are pregnant. Personnel have hearing, eyesight and blood tests, as well as BMI measurements, but no pregnancy test at the moment. Although this new case may increase the pressure for one. What if they are on active service in the UK? A pregnant woman can remain in the job up until the 28th week of pregnancy then they must stand down. She will be medically assessed and must have another one before she returns to work. When can they return to front line duties? No servicewoman will be sent a warzone until at least six months after they have given birth, unless they volunteer - but this still may be subject to certain conditions. To her astonishment, medics informed her that she was about to give birth. She was in the 34th week of her pregnancy, meaning she conceived before flying to Afghanistan for her six-month tour of duty. She . was taken to Camp Bastion’s £10million field hospital where doctors – . who are  more used to carrying out amputations and treating bullet . wounds – delivered her son. Despite its location, the hospital is one of the best equipped in the world and has portable X-ray machines, an operating theatre, CAT scanner and an intensive care unit capable of treating up to 20 seriously-ill patients. A military source said: ‘This has left us completely gobsmacked. You prepare yourself for dealing with war wounded at Bastion – not a mother giving birth to a baby. It is the talk of the camp. ‘This is a very unusual case. The mother deployed not realising she was pregnant and had no idea she was pregnant until she gave birth. She has not done anything wrong.’ Lieutenant Colonel Andrea Lewis, commanding officer of the field hospital, said: ‘This is a unique occurrence, but my team is well-rehearsed in the unexpected and they adapted brilliantly to this situation. ‘I am pleased to report the mother and baby are doing well and we are all delighted at the outcome.’ The Fijian soldier had passed her tough pre-deployment training, which included a gruelling eight-mile march and five-mile run, without an inkling that she was pregnant. A senior Army insider said: ‘It is bizarre that she didn’t feel some side effects of the pregnancy. She is obviously pretty fit and strong. The strains and demands on soldiers working on the frontline make it surprising she didn’t realise. Emergency treatment: Bastion's medics are more used to treating bullet and blast wounds than delivering infants . 'But the conditions of deployment, the different diet, the heat of the Afghan summer, the different hours of working, mean that many soldiers feel a little odd and put it down to the change of environment. ‘The baby’s successful delivery is a wonderful testament to the outstanding job the medics do here. It shows how they can use their extraordinary skills to turn their hands from saving lives to delivering babies. ‘A lot of the medics are reservists and work in hospitals back in the UK so the concept of someone giving birth is not completely alien to them. But they do not have paediatric equipment here so they had to make do as best they could.’ At war: Prince Harry is currently deployed at Bastion as a gunner co-pilot in an Apache helicopter squadron . A woman killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul left a final message on Twitter weeks before she died, reading: ‘I am back in Afghanistan and wonder what lies before me this time.’ Jeni Ayris, pictured right, of Edinburgh, died alongside 11 fellow aviation workers when a female insurgent rammed a car laden with explosives into their minibus as they drove to the airport on Tuesday. She had been due to leave the country this weekend to see friends and her sister Patricia. Islamist body Hezb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack. It said the bombing was a response to a US film lampooning the Prophet Muhammad, which has sparked lethal riots across the globe. South African-born Miss Ayris, 46, had spent 17 years in the Scottish capital. She had been in Afghanistan to organise flights for charities and non-governmental organisations. A friend, Richard Kellett, said: ‘She loved her job. She would go out there for three months at a time . . . when she came home on leave she always looked forward to going back.’ A statement from Miss Ayris’s family described her as ‘a warm, kind and generous person with an everyday objective of  helping everyone she met’. Major Charles Heyman, who edits the . British Army handbook, said the incident was ‘astonishing’. He said: . ‘Commanders need to start thinking very, very carefully about what sort . of medical examinations female soldiers have before they deploy on . operations. 'A simple urine test would indicate if someone was pregnant. The Army now needs to tighten up its procedures.’ Since 2003 at least 70 British servicewomen have been sent home from Afghanistan after discovering they were expecting. And at least 102 female soldiers were evacuated from Iraq after it was found they were pregnant. Last year the Mail told how Private Kayla Donnelly, then 21, from Penrith, Cumbria, served in Helmand unaware that she was seven months’ pregnant. She had conceived before going to Afghanistan as a machine-gunner and thought her weight gain was due to high-calorie Army rations. It was only when she collapsed in Tenerife after her tour of duty that she realised she was pregnant. Around 500 British women are currently on duty in Afghanistan. They can serve in any unit except those whose primary role is to ‘close with and kill’ –  engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Eight women have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, two per cent of the total fatalities. They include Corporal Sarah Bryant, 26, from Carlisle, serving with the Army Intelligence Corps, who was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2008, and Second Lieutenant Joanna Dyer, 24, from Yeovil, a friend of Prince William and also of the Army Intelligence Corps, who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007.","Government tells MailOnline it is a matter of privacy and they expect women to come forward when they fall pregnant .

"Tensions between the major powers have led to the brink of a new Cold War, with failures to achieve security in Europe likely to make the continent irrelevant in world affairs, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has warned. The 83-year-old has accused the West, particularly the U.S. of giving in to 'triumphalism' after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the communist bloc a quarter century ago. Speaking at an event marking the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he said the result of the failures could partly be seen in the inability of global powers to prevent or resolve conflicts in Yugoslavia, the Middle East and most recently Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned of new Cold War tensions sparked by the Ukraine crisis . Gorbachev (pictured) also said Europe's inability to establish peace risked making it 'irrelevant' in world affairs . He warned: 'The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it's already begun.' Gorbachev called for trust to be restored through dialogue with Moscow, and suggested the West should lift sanctions imposed against senior Russian officials over the country's support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Failure to achieve security in Europe would make the continent irrelevant in world affairs, he said. His comments echoed those of Roland Dumas, France's foreign minister at the time the Berlin Wall fell. 'Without freedom between nations, without respect of one nation to another, and without strong and brave disarmament policy, everything could start over again tomorrow,' Dumas said. 'Even everything we used to know, and what we called the Cold War.' President Barack Obama appeared to share some of Gorbachev's concerns for Europe, though he blamed Moscow for the current tensions. A man carries debris from the front of a damaged building after shelling in rebel-held Donetsk, eastern Ukraine . A woman passes a damaged housing building in Donetsk, where shelling continues despite the creasefire . Paying tribute to the East Berliners who pushed past border guards to flood through the Wall on November 9 1989, Obama said in a statement on Friday that 'as Russia's actions against Ukraine remind us, we have more work to do to fully realise our shared vision of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace'. The calls for reconciliation come just as tensions in Ukraine begin to escalate once again following the signing of a peacefire agreement. More than 80 unmarked military vehicles were seen on the move today in rebel-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, indicating that intensified hostilities may lie ahead. Three separate columns were seen - one near the main separatist stronghold of Donetsk and two outside the town of Snizhne, 50 miles further east. More than 80 unmarked military vehicles were spotted moving through rebel-controlled areas today, sparking concerns about an escalation in the conflict. Pictured, a woman stands outside her damaged home . A resident of Donetsk holds pieces of shrapnel found after the latest round of shelling . Officials work to fix a building damaged in the suburbs of Donetsk . The vehicles were mainly transportation trucks, some of them carrying small- and large-caliber artillery systems, and at least one armored personnel carrier. Several of the trucks were seen to be carrying troops. Ukrainian officials said this week that they believe rebel forces have received substantial consignments of weaponry and manpower from Russia. Moscow denies such claims. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Volodymyr Polevoy said rebel reinforcements have also been observed moving toward front-line locations around 150 kilometers (95 miles) northeast of Donetsk, in the Luhansk region. Polevoy said rebel authorities are boosting their ranks by forcibly mobilizing residents in a number of occupied towns. Despite a cease-fire being reached in September, Ukrainian and rebel troops engage on a regular basis, with some of the heaviest fighting focused on Donetsk airport. A man walks past a mortar crater in the streets on Donetsk . One government paratrooper was killed Friday by a sniper at the airport, military authorities said in a statement. Polevoy said two other Ukrainian troops were killed on the same day, but gave no details. The statement added that Ukrainian positions came under artillery fire in several towns and villages east of Donetsk, including Debaltseve, which has begun to be increasingly encircled by rebel forces. Earlier this week, Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko said that additional troops were being deployed to the east to defend cities still under government control against possible incursions. That followed rebel statements of intent to expand the amount of territory under their control. The truce signed in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, by Russia, Ukraine and the separatists stipulates the pullback of heavy weaponry. In Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference for what was expected to be a discussion about the unrest in eastern Ukraine. Asked if Russia still respects the legitimacy of the cease-fire agreement, Lavrov said it is for the 'rebels and the government' of Ukraine to finalize a disengagement line - a process that he said is continuing. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia rose further after the rebels held an election last Sunday that Ukraine and the West denounced as a violation of the truce. Russia, however, quickly lent its support to the vote.","Former Soviet leader warns the world may already be in a new Cold War .

"The notebook of one of two 12-year-old girls suspected of stabbing their best friend 'to please' the fictional online character Slender Man was released to a Wisconsin court today, giving a frightening insight into her troubled mind. The disturbing hand-sketched pictures were revealed during the preliminary hearing of Morgan Geyser on Tuesday, where a judge was tasked with deciding if the girl should be charged with attempted first degree murder as an adult. Drawn by Geyser, one of the grotesque cartoons depicts a young cat-like girl armed with a scythe standing over a dead girl with a speech bubble that says, 'I love killing people'. Eerie and prescient sketches: This is one of Morgan Geyser's sketches. The 12-year-old is one of two girls accused of stabbing her friend Payton Leutner and leaving her in the woods in May 2014. In this frightening picture a girl who appears to be a cat-like and armed with a scythe stands over a dead girl while saying 'I love killing people' Other writings and cartoons profess her admiration and devotion to the Slender Man urban myth and will be a central part of the defense team's claim that Geyser is mentally unfit to stand trial as an adult. If the two girls are tried as adults and found guilty they will face up to 60 years in prison. Indeed, along with the sketches, the court was presented with the mutilated body of one of Geyser's Barbie dolls, which had its hair and limbs cut and what appeared to be satanic markings drawn onto the torso. In addition to that was a list of 'supplies necessary' which included a 'map of forest' and 'weapons (kitchen knife).' Childhood icon: The court in Wisconsin was presented on Tuesday with these images a evidence of Geyser's warped state of mind . Satanic symbols: The dolls, displayed in court in Waukesha, Wisconsin on Tuesday, were marked with cuts and had Slender Man symbols on them . Mutiliation: Barbie dolls of Geyser's were found missing limbs and a list of supplies found in her notebook includes a kitchen knife . Anissa Weier and Geyser are thought to have lured their friend Payton Leutner to the woods in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and stabbed her 19 times after inviting her to a slumber party for Geyser's 12th birthday. Ms Leutner was able to crawl out from the trees and has survived the May 2014 incident. Lawyers for Weier and Geyser, who could be tried as adults for attempted murder, are pushing to have the case moved to juvenile court, according to ABC News. Neither of the suspects has entered a plea as the attorneys attempt to get the charges changed. The two girls' attorneys have never denied they attacked and stabbed Leutner, but claim they were so disturbed they truly believed the Slender Man - a popular online urban myth - would kill their own families in three seconds if they did not do his bidding. Geyser's attorney began proceedings on Tuesday by trying to telling the court that his client is mentally disturbed and believed she had to kill to protect herself and her family from the creature. Taking the stand during the second day of a preliminary hearing, psychologist Deborah Collins testified that she has interviewed the Geyser several times and concluded she honestly believes Slender Man exists. '(Her belief) hasn't wavered and it's been unyielding to a rational perspective,' Collins testified. Collins also testified that the girl told her she uses Vulcan mind control to keep negative emotions at bay and believes Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort visits her when he's not away on business trips. Strange embrace: The Slender Man character is known for stalking and abducting children and became popular after fans of the creation did their own drawings of him . Urban myth: Obsession: On the left is a depiction of the urban myth of Slender Man - an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. His horror stories tell how he kidnaps children or forces them into murderous deeds . Checklist: This hand written note from Morgan Geyser's sketchbook shows a list of 'supplies necessary' before she and Anissa Weier stabbed their friend, Payton Leutner, in the woods last year. Noticeable is the reminder to bring a 'kitchen knife', a 'map of forest' and 'the will to live' State of mind: This sketch will be used by the defense to claim that their client was and is mentally unfit and should stand trial as an adult for murder . A private detective working for the defense testified he discovered more than 60 drawings of Slender Man in the girl's bedroom. Many of the sketches included notes such as 'not safe even in your house' and 'he is here always.' One drawing depicted a girl lying on the ground and a person standing over her with the message 'I love killing people' written over the figure. The detective went on to say he found more than a half-dozen Barbie dolls in the bedroom that had been marked with Slender Man's symbol. Some were missing their hands and feet. 'I think we did a good job showing she believed (Slender Man) was real ... across time and environment,' defense attorney Anthony Cotton said. 'She believed in Slender Man. She believed he would hurt the family.' Accused: Morgan Geyser, 12, (left), and Anissa Weier, 13, (right), face a collective 60 years in prison if tried as adults and found guilty . June court appearance: Morgan Geyser was led into a Wisconsin court room in shackles in June where she was arraigned for the attempted murder of her friend . Agony: Geyser's troubled state of mind appears evident in this scrawl in which she screams 'I want to die' According to court documents, the girls told detectives they had been planning to kill Peyton Leutner for months. They are accused of luring her to a park in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha on May 31 and stabbing her 19 times. Leutner barely survived; one stab wound just missed her heart. The alleged attackers were found walking toward the Nicolet National Forest, where they say they thought they would join Slender Man. All three girls were 12 years old at the time of the incident. The two alleged attackers face one count of being a party to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in adult court. They each could face up to 60 years in the state prison system if convicted. The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. Unnerving: The Slender Man with one of his chosen victims as depicted in a popular online meme . The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a Photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. The character has developed its own life online, with two feature-length films funded in part by Kickstarter appearing in 2012. The meme that appears most is that of a tall malevolent figure, who silently stalks down his prey. Over the past six or so years, the Slender Man meme has mutated liked all good scary stories into one that haunts the minds of those who become obsessed with it. Decision: Circuit Judge Michael Bohren presides over the second day of a preliminary hearing in Waukesha, Wisconsin for the two girls accused of stabbing their classmate to please horror character Slender Man . Laughter after recovery: Ms Leutner was able to drag herself out from the woods where she was stabbed 19 times and has since recovered . Unidentified: One of the two Wisconsin girls accused of stabbing their classmate appears in court where their attorney's are trying to convince a judge to move their case into juvenile court . Police detectives testified on Monday that both girls believed they had to kill their friend and join Slender Man in order to protect themselves and their families from his wrath. Cotton is trying to use that to move his client to juvenile court, where she couldn't be held beyond age 25. He contends that since the girl thought she was defending herself a charge of attempted second-degree intentional homicide is more appropriate. Since the girl is under 18, she would face that count in children's court. Prosecutors countered that a preliminary hearing - the stage of Wisconsin's legal process where a judge decides whether enough evidence exists to move to trial - isn't the proper venue for such an argument. Judge Michael Bohren declined to rule on anything Tuesday, asking all sides to submit briefs. He promised to issue a decision on March 13. The other girl's attorneys called only one witness Tuesday, a sheriff's deputy who arrested their client on the road. He testified the girl told him someone would kill her family unless she did something bad.

"A mild mannered father-of-one screamed ‘I am innocent!’ seconds before being burnt alive by a rampaging mob on an idyllic holiday beach, it emerged today. The last words of Frenchman Sebastien Judalet, 38, were recorded by the vigilante crowd in the popular tourist resort of Madagascar last Friday. Mr Judalet, a Paris bus driver with an 11 year old daughter, was caught by a gang of some 300 people along with Roberto Gianfala, a Franco-Italian hotel worker in his 50s. Frenchman Sebastien Judalet, 38, was burned alive and later mutilated by a mob in Madagascar who recorded the killing. In it the father-of-one can be heard begging for his life . This is the Robinson Crusoe hotel on the island of Nosy Be where Judalet was staying before being wrongly accused of murdering an eight-year-old boy and then lynched . They were accused of being paedophiles who had murdered an eight-year-old local boy after allegedly cutting off his genitals. But Madagascan police today said there was ‘no proof whatsoever’ connecting the men with child’s disappearance and that he may well have drowned on Nosy Be, an idyllic Indian Ocean island which attracts holidaymakers from all over the world including Britain. The chilling voice recording, which has been circulating locally, is of a desperate Judalet screaming: ‘I am the victim of a conspiracy. I am innocent’. Franco-Italian hotel-worker Roberto Gianfala rented this small hut before being killed by a lynch mob last week . It is then that a confusion in Mr Judalet’s words may have caused his horrific death. He shouts, ‘I do not like children,’ to which a member of the crowd replies: ‘You do not like children?’ Mr Judalet replied: ‘I love kids, I have a little girl.’ He can be heard crying and further begging for mercy, before he is stripped naked, mutilated, and burnt on a beach fire alongside Mr Gianfala. Both men were on holiday in Madagascar, and neither had any criminal record or association with paedophilia. Crowds sat calmly beside the burning bodies while many filmed the killings before circulating the recordings . After burning Judalet and Gianfala alive the mob went on to kill a third man, named only as Zaidou, who is the dead boy's uncle . In a further macabre twist, it emerged that a third man killed in the same manner was the boy’s uncle, referred to only by his first name of Zaidou. A neighbour of Mr Judalet in the Paris suburb of Montreuil said he was ‘mild mannered and extremely friendly’. ‘Sebastien would not have hurt anyone. It is clear that he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.’ The grisly killings happened here, on the small island of Nosy Be, on Wednesday last week . The idyllic islands of Madagascar are popular with tourists from across the globe. It was visited by 256,000 holidaymakers last year, and over half of them were French . French magistrates have now opened a murder enquiry, and detectives from Paris are expected to travel to the island to investigate. Madagascar police have, meanwhile, arrested 26 people for the three murders, where security has been stepped up to protect foreigners. All of those arrested live close to the palm-fringed Ambatoloaka beach, where the lynchings and burnings were caught on camera. Vincent Laza, a local community leader, said the boy's body was wet when it was found, suggesting he may have drowned, and that his genitals were cut off later. He confirmed that there had been ‘rumours’ that foreigners had been involved in the boy’s death – leading to the vigilante mob forming. Two members of the crowd were shot dead by police. Despite its upmarket tourist resorts, Madagascar is an extremely poor place, with some 90 per cent of its population of 22 million people living on less than two dollars a day.","Sebastian Judalet and Roberto Gianfala were killed on Madagascar holiday .

"Dominique Ansel, the chef behind New York's indomitable pastry craze, Cronuts, is trying to crack down on scalpers and also warn customers about the dangers of accepting second hand food. With only 200 cronuts made per day, and a line 40-people deep before the Manhattan bakery even opens its doors, the $5 croissant-donut hybrid has become a hot commodity for sweet-toothed New Yorkers. And now a new delivery service, Premium Cronut Delivery, which has no affiliation with the bakery, is charging $100 for delivering just one Cronut, $200 for two, or $3,000 for ten. Perfect pastry: The $5 Cronut was quietly unveiled by New York's Dominique Ansel bakery on May 10, and now a new delivery service which has no affiliation with the bakery, is charging $100 for delivering just one Cronut . Despite Mr Ansel enforcing a two-Cronut per customer limit in an effort to . ward off scalping schemes, the delivery company continues to make five deliveries every weekday. Although the chef has previously personally thrown scalpers out of the long morning lines, his major concern . about third-party delivery is actually food safety. 'I don’t . know much about the delivery service, but I do hope they give people . some sort of guarantee for hygiene,' he told TODAY.com. 'Here at the bakery, we have to . answer to the Department of Health, but once it’s out of our doors, I . can’t guarantee it hasn’t been handled or (even worse), left out for . days. Cronuts should only be eaten on the day of.' To deter Cronut opportunists, bakery staff members actively police the queue for scalpers. Recipe to success: The cronut is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian vanilla cream . Sweet and soft: Rose-flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer, which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake; finally, crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish . 'I open the door . for everyone every morning at 8am. And I say ‘hello’ to all my . customers,' explained Mr Ansel.  'It’s only a matter a time before something seems kind of . shady.' He recalled the first time he was confronted with a scalper, who he said was 'was obviously . drunk,' adding, 'it scared me to think someone bought second-hand food off of . him.' Last month, Cronuts were selling up to eight times their original . retail price on Craigslist, available for delivery by scalpers in . Manhattan ($20 each), Queens ($30 each), and Brooklyn $40 each). After the Cronut was quietly unveiled on . May 10, with a small batch of 50, by May 13, 200 had sold out by . 9.30am. One disappointed customer even 'flipped the finger' at staff on his way out of the pâtisserie. In the making: It took around ten recipes, and multiple time and temperature adjustments before Mr Ansel found 'the trick' to sheeting and frying the dough in grape-seed oil at one specific, and secret, temperature . The bakery's owner and chef, Dominique Ansel, told MailOnline last month that while he's flattered, the re-selling is illegal. '$20 for a Cronut. That's a 400% profit!' he exclaimed, adding, 'A lot of people ask me why we don't . just do more? 'Well, I'm a big fan of quality over quantity. . . It takes a lot to ensure . all our other pastries are up to par with standards as well.' The Cronut, which is now trademarked to Dominique Ansel after interest from curious pastry chefs in Hong Kong, . Melbourne, and Los Angeles, is made from thin layers of . flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled . with light Tahitian vanilla cream. Culinary magician: Chef Dominique Ansel, pictured in his kitchen, was named America's best pastry chef by the James Beard Foundation earlier this year . Hot spot: The Dominique Ansel bakery opened in New York's Soho in 2011 . Rose-flavored glaze . thinly coats the top layer, which peels apart like those in a . mille crepe cake; finally, crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish. 'A cronut is not as simple as frying up . some croissant dough,' said the chef. 'We actually make a special laminated dough that is . sheeted and folded different than a croissant'. The bakery, which opened in New York's Soho in 2011, makes the Cronut dough fresh daily in house, as well as the flavored sugars and vanilla ganache. 'Flakey but chewy, a little heavier than a croissant but fluffier than a donut' - Margot Peppers, Femail reporter . 'Tears of joy' - Micaela Mclucas, MailOnline assistant photo editor . 'The soft crunch was followed by an injection of cream and a whiff of a rose garden – thanks to the floral-infused icing. The perfect breakfast sandwich!' - Sadie Whitelocks, Femail reporter'There’s an element of the éclair about it, with the vanilla cream inside, which isn’t too sweet, allowing the rose icing to provide the sugar hit alone. They're insanely addictive – mine disappeared in microseconds. I could have devoured the box.' - Tamara Abraham, Femail editor . 'That's why the batches are limited. Hopefully people will bear with us . as we try to ramp up production,' the chef explained. With such a swift reaction to the new pastry, Mr Ansel has filed a trademark for the cronut, 'just for our protection,' he said. It took around ten recipes, . and multiple time and temperature adjustments before Mr Ansel . found 'the trick' to sheeting and frying the dough in grape-seed oil at one specific, and secret, temperature. For . the month of May, Dominique Ansel bakery is selling a Rose Tahitian . Vanilla Cronut. In June, the store will launch a new flavor: Lemon . Maple. And a new flavor every month after that. A quick quote from the Chef: 'A few tips on how to eat the Cronut. Please cut (if you must) with a serrated knife to avoid crushing the layers. 'Do not eat the next day, eat immediately (they have a six hour shelf life) and will get stale in the fridge. 'Finally, try peeling off the layers one by one like a mille crepe cake.'

"Google has announced a new smartphone and tablet, as well as the company's first TV streaming device. Both mobile devices will run the new version of the firm's mobile operating system, Android 5.0, which has been confirmed to have the name Lollipop. The Motorola-made Nexus 6 smartphone comes with a 5.96-inch Quad HD screen and a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera. Google has announced a new smartphone - the Nexus 6 -  and tablet, the Nexus 9 - as well as the company's first TV streaming device in a bid to compete with Apple and Amazon . The Nexus 6 also has dual front-facing speakers designed to offer better quality audio, says Google. The handset sports a feature called Turbo Charger, which can give the phone up to six hours of battery life from just a 15 minute charge. The phone also boasts new hands-free voice activated functions. It will come in two colours: midnight blue and cloud white and two storage options, 32 or 64GB. Meanwhile, one day before Apple unveils its updated iPad family, the search giant has shown off its new Nexus 9 tablet, made by HTC. The tablet, which is smaller than an iPad, but larger than and iPad Mini, is built for multi-tasking and has a brushed aluminium frame with a ‘soft grip’ back. An upgrade in terms of size as well as internals on Google's existing Nexus 7, the new Nexus 9 has a 8.9-inch screen, and weighs in at 420g, making it 50g lighter than an iPad Air. The Nexus 6 smartphone (pictured left) and Nexus 9 tablet (right) can be voice activated without opening any apps and both sport the new Lollipop operating system . Both the mobile devices will run the new version of the firm's mobile operating system - Android 5.0, which has been confirmed to have the name Lollipop . Manufacturer: HTC . Screen: 8.9 inches, 2048 x 1536 resolution . Platform: Android Lollipop . CPU: 64bit dual core processor . Memory: 16GB or 32GB with 2GB RAM . Sound: Dual front-facing speakers with HTC Boomsound . Camera: 8MP with front-facing 1.6MP camera . Battery: 6,700mAh . Extra features: Keyboard folio . Price: Not yet confirmed . Launch date: Tablet can be pre-ordered from October 17 and will go on sale on November 3. Because the 9 was built by HTC, it also takes advantage of their BoomSound speaker technology, complete with two front-facing speakers in the device, as opposed to the traditional down-facing output. This is for better quality audio, Google says. It is the first Nexus device to have a 64-bit processor for increased performance in terms of speed, particularly when playing games. There is  an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera and, like the Nexus 6, the Nexus 9 will be accessible hands-free thanks to a new feature that enables voice command to be accessed without touching the phone. Just saying 'Ok, Google' will activate Google Now, even when the phone is asleep, and while the voice command and personal assistant already existed on Android, with Lollipop it has been pushed to the front of the interface. The Nexus 9 also has Turbo Charger functionality with a 64bit dual core processor to make switching between tasks fast. Google's senior vice president of Android Sundar Pichai said: ‘Advances in computing are driven at the intersection of hardware and software. That's why we've always introduced Nexus devices alongside our platform releases. The tablet, which is smaller than an iPad, but larger than and iPad Mini, is built for multi-tasking and has a brushed aluminum frame with a ‘soft grip’ back. Like Windows' tablets, a case that doubles as a keyboard can be used to turn it into more of a laptop (pictured) The Nexus 6 smartphone (pictured) sports a feature called Turbo Charger, which can give the phone up to 6 hours of battery life from just a 15 minute charge . Manufacturer: Motorola . Screen: 5.96 inch display, 1440 x 2560 resolution (493ppi) Platform: Android Lollipop . Processor: Snapdragon 805 quad-core 2.7GHz with Adreno 420 GPU for graphics .

Battery: 24 hours with a full charge, plus TurboCharger for 6 hours life in 15 minutes of charging . Price: Not yet confirmed . Launch date: November, with pre-order beginning on October 29 . In a less expected move, Google also announced the company's first full TV streaming device that will run their Android TV software, the Nexus Player. The new streaming box enables users to watch TV shows as well as stream content from other devices to their TV, such as an Android phone, tablet or Chrome-based desktop computer. The Nexus Player also comes with a video game controller and can be used to play games from the Google Play Store on TVs. Amazon has recently introduced a similar device, called the Fire TV. Sitting alongside Google's existing streaming device, the Chromecast, the Nexus Player is likely to be aimed at more premium users than the £30 Chromecast. Google confirmed that the Nexus 9 will be available to pre-order in the UK from October 17 and will go on sale on November 3. It will come in three sizes: 16GB, 32GB and 32GB LTE. The Nexus 6 smartphone will also arrive in November, with pre-order beginning on October 29. The Nexus Player will be available to pre-order from October 17. UK prices have not yet been confirmed. The tablet has an 8.9-inch screen and HTC's BoomSound front-facing speakers.There is also an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera and, like the Nexus 6, the Nexus 9 can be voice activated without opening any apps . While Lollipop is being promised to be a redefining update by Google, we are yet to see it in action, thanks to a purely blog post-driven launch. The firm's latest Android operating system is designed to be flexible and to be used on different devices. It can now power a watch, TV and even a car. The new Turbo Charger is an impressive addition when combined with more detailed battery settings, and Google says this will lead to longer lasting devices. The battery saver feature extends the life of device by up to 90 minutes. The support for 64-bit processing for the first time on Nexus devices is also an upgrade, with some of Google's native apps like Chrome and Gmail supporting this feature, essentially meaning they will run faster and smoother than before. Songs, photos, apps and recent searches from one Android device are immediately accessible on another. Content responds to people's touch and their voice. The operating system is designed to be more intuitive and better at multi-tasking. For example, users will be able to read an email alongside seeing their inbox. Users can adjust their settings so only notifications from certain people and apps can get through and they will appear on the lockscreen. Devices can be secured using a pin, password or pattern - or now they can be linked to a trusted device like a watch or smart lock. Google has also confirmed that as well as being built into their new devices, Lollipop will be available on the existing Nexus 5,7 and 10 devices 'in the coming weeks'.","The mobile devices will run Android 5.0, which is called Lollipop .

"Ammunition has been pulled from the shelves of two Walmarts in Ferguson amid violent clashes over the police shooting of Michael Brown. Employees were ordered to lock all bullets in a store cupboard on Monday after demonstrators stormed one of the stores and formed a barricade outside another. Bosses in Ferguson and nearby Maplewood revealed they took the precaution in fear of looting and violence as racial divides in the Missouri city show no sign of resolve. It is the first time Walmart has taken such action since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, when assault rifles were removed from shelves in Connecticut. Scroll down for video . Fears: Bosses at this Ferguson Walmart and one in Maplewood have pulled ammunition amid violent clashes . Drastic: It is the first time the store has hidden weaponry since removing guns from shelves after Sandy Hook . Addressing Ferguson, Walmart spokesman Brian Nick told KMOV-TV: 'If there is a history of violence and looting and other activity that are going on or things that are putting associates and customers at risk - then yes, decisions can be made based on those circumstances.' Customers who wish to buy bullets will have to discuss their intended purchase with a sales assistant, he said. The move came just days before a report was leaked revealing Darren Wilson told a grand jury he shot Brown because he feared for his life - a claim that has stoked renewed anger across Ferguson. Protesters have taken to the streets every week calling for Wilson's resignation. On Monday, more than 43 people were arrested amid protests - many inside the Maplewood Walmart. The protests were held in memory of John Crawford, a black man who was killed in an Ohio Walmart days before Brown's shooting in Missouri. Action: Bosses said they took the precaution in fear of  violence as racial divides show no sign of resolve . Protests: Demonstrations against police violence and racial divides have been weekly since the shooting . Unrest: Protesters are seen doing a 'hands up' chant in a nod to the fact that Brown allegedly held up his hands . Demonstrations are expected to escalate today after the news that a grand jury has heard an account of the shooting that shines a favorable light on the police officer. In it, Wilson claims he was sat in his SUV on patrol when the teenager leaned through the window, punching and scratching his face. He insists he feared for his life, which prompted him to shoot twice from inside the car. However, he does not acknowledge subsequently shooting Brown four times outside the vehicle. A number of witnesses agree that Brown and Wilson were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window, but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening. They insist, however, the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands. Anger: Renewed outrage is expected today after a leaked report revealed Darren Wilson (pictured over Brown's body) claims he feared for his life and shot the unarmed black teenager in self-defense . One passer-by, Tiffany Mitchell, is certain Brown was leaning away but Wilson kept pulling him closer. Another, Dorian Johnson, said Wilson grasped Brown's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot. They then heard shots fired from inside the SUV. There remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired. The police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun. One witness, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.'","Two Walmart stores have locked away bullets as violent clashes escalate .

"England Under 20s drew with Turkey on Monday night to secure the point they needed to win the Four Nations Tournament in Holland. Having already beaten the hosts and Germany, Aidy Boothroyd's team just needed to avoid defeat in their third and final match to lift the trophy. And the Young Lions looked on course for a third victory in succession when Wolves' Kortney Hause put them in front on 21 minutes. England's Kortney Hause (pictured in Thursday's win over Germany) was on target as they drew 1-1 with Turkey to claim the Four Nations Tournament in Heerenveen, Holland . England's kitman Pat Frost tweeted this picture of the squad together after winning the tournament . England (4-3-3): Christian Walton (Brighton & Hove Albion); Lloyd Jones (Liverpool), Dominic Ball (Tottenham Hotspur), Kortney Hause (Wolverhampton Wanderers, on loan at Gillingham), Matt Targett (C) (Southampton); Harrison Reed (Southampton), Jordan Houghton (Chelsea), Paul Digby (Barnsley);Kwame Thomas (Derby County), Chuba Akpom (Arsenal), Callum Robinson (Aston Villa, on loan at Preston) Substitutions: Isaac Hayden (Arsenal) for Ball 68; Joe Rothwell (Manchester United) for Reed 75; John Swift (Chelsea, on loan at Rotherham) for Houghton 84 . Substitutes not used: Fankaty Dabo (Chelsea), Joe Wildsmith (Sheffield Wednesday), Ben Pearson (Manchester United), Jacob Murphy (Norwich City), Chris Long (Everton) Scorer: Hause 21 . In the end, despite dominating much of the game, they had to settle for a draw when Berat Tosun equalised for Turkey six minutes into the second half. Captain on the night Matt Targett and Isaac Hayden, skipper for the wins over Germany and Holland, lifted the trophy together on the pitch in Heerenveen at the final whistle. 'We're delighted with the way the tournament has gone and to win it is really, really pleasing,' said boss Boothroyd afterwards. 'For the players to get a few results like this and to win against such strong opposition is a real feather in the cap. 'It's a really big achievement to come away from home and get results against the host nation and against a very strong German side - and to get a draw against a much older Turkish team is a fantastic achievement as well. 'In the end it's all worked out really well and we're all very happy.' Brimming with confidence after their 1-0 win over Germany on Thursday and Saturday's 3-2 success over Holland, England started on the front foot. Pat Frost also captured the moment Isaac Hayden and Matt Targett lifted the trophy . And they gained their reward on 21 minutes when Targett's free-kick was headed back by Liverpool's Lloyd Jones for Hause to control on his chest and finish left-footed in one smooth movement. Turkey scored their leveller shortly after the break and both sides then saw a man sent off. Arsenal forward Chuba Akpom picked up a second yellow card for a late tackle before Cenk Sahin also went for a badly timed challenge. The contest threatened to boil over at time during the second half but England held out for the point they needed to wrap up tournament success. Aidy Boothroyd's team took seven points from their three matches to claim the trophy . Boothroyd added: 'We played probably the best football of the tournament in the first half. 'We were excellent. We were creating lots of chances, making really good decisions and we really dominated the game and we could have had two or three. 'In the second half it was a little bit different. They came out at us and we didn't start particularly well. They equalised and we got a bit complacent. 'We managed to hang on in there in the end.'","Kortney Hause, of Wolves, scored England's goal after 21 minutes .

"Lots of little girls dream of one day wearing the perfect wedding dress. But when six-year-old Hannah  Millington-Day designed this  elegant ivory number, she was thinking about eating it. She came up with the idea for a life-sized, edible bridal gown when she saw a picture of her mother’s wedding dress. Donna Millington-Day and her daughter Hannah - who challenged her mother to create this life sized wedding cake - add the final touches . A sweet treat: The six-foot edible bridal gown is made from 17 tiers of sponge cake, 22 kilos of sugar paste icing and 2lb of royal icing . A feast for all: Decorated from hundreds of sugar pearls, the cake would cater for over 2,000 wedding guests . Then it was down to her mother Donna, a confectioner, to bake it. She used a whopping 224 free-range eggs, 28lb of flour, 28lb of caster sugar and 28lb of butter, and spent a whole week cooking. The result – worth £6,000 – is 6ft . tall and made of 17 tiers of sponge cake. It is topped with 49lb of . sugar paste icing, 2lb of royal icing and hundreds of sugar pearls. It is filled with 17lb of Madagascan vanilla butter cream and around 7lb of raspberry jam. And it could feed as many as 2,000 guests – if anyone can bring themselves to cut into it. Mrs Millington-Day, 36, said: ‘Hannah . was going through my old wedding photos when she suggested we recreate . my dress. I thought it was a great idea. ‘Although it’s not an exact replica I have taken the details like the corset and styling on the side. Creator: Donna Millington-Day was inspired by her six-year-old daughter's drawing of a wedding dress cake . Challenge: Donna decided to rise to the challenge of bringing her daughter's design to life and one week later the stunning ivory dress heavily embellished with iced flowers and weighing in at 25 kilos was finished . ‘The satin finish was achieved using a pearl lustre and each swirl was hand-piped.’ Mrs Millington-Day runs the Fairytale Cake Company with her husband of eight years, Myles. The couple, of Wombourne,  Staffordshire, also have a son Edward, aged two. The enormous sweet treat was unveiled yesterday at the start of the National Wedding Show at the NEC in Birmingham. To get it there, a trolley was  custom-made to fit its 30in base. But it won’t be on the move too . often. Mrs Millington-Day said: ‘We’re not going to sell the cake, but . to buy it would cost around £6,000. ‘After the show we’re going to display it in our shop window.’","Donna Millington-Day from Staffordshire was inspired by 6-year-old daughter's drawing .

"The SAS has launched a mission to the Middle East to kill Jihadi John, the ISIS terrorist responsible for beheading two British hostages . The SAS has launched a dramatic mission to kill Jihadi John – the Islamic State terrorist responsible for beheading British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines – in the biggest Special Forces operation since the September 11 attacks. Official Government sources confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that SAS soldiers flew to a secret base in the Middle East last week. Travelling in groups of three and four, the crack troops boarded commercial flights dressed in civilian clothes. They mingled with unsuspecting businessmen and tourists to maintain operational security. After weeks of intense preparation at the regiment’s barracks in Hereford, the elite soldiers are now waiting for the order to strike Islamic State targets. It is understood that part of the SAS mission could also include an attempt to rescue the remaining hostages, including British photographer John Cantlie. The Mail on Sunday has been made aware of more detailed information about the mission but has agreed with Government officials not to publish it for security reasons. However, we can reveal that the soldiers are sharing a remote desert location with British intelligence agents and communications experts who are understood to be tracking Jihadi John’s movements and also intercepting IS radio and telephone messages. Final approval for any SAS mission inside Syria – where it is believed the hostages are being held – would have to be granted by the Prime Minister. David Cameron told Parliament in September that he would seize any opportunity to launch a rescue attempt. Last night, an SAS source described to this newspaper how, to respect political sensitivities in the region, British troops were keeping a low profile. He said: ‘The guys have left Hereford to carry out a strike raid on IS. They flew out there on commercial flights so that sorties by UK military aircraft can be kept to a minimum. ‘This is at the request of pro- Western leaders in the Middle East who are concerned about appearing to support the UK in the war against IS. ‘All the kit is ready and waiting for the guys and they’re on very short notice to strike IS. ‘It is more personal for the guys because Jihadi John is British and he’s killing British hostages. But now he’s basically a dead man walking.’ In September the Mail on Sunday published photos of British forces rehearsing surprise airborne assaults, which could be used by the SAS to rescue hostages . At the desert base, which is within striking distance of IS targets in Syria, the SAS troops are now carrying out final rehearsals for a raid and are using the most sophisticated weapons available to the British Army. In addition to this arsenal, the SAS troopers are backed up by teams from 264 (SAS) Signal Squadron who are equipped with mobile satellites. Using this equipment, the latest information about the whereabouts of Jihadi John and the remaining hostages in IS captivity is relayed to and from the frontline and back to SAS operational headquarters in Britain. The SAS troops are also supported by a 17-man crew aboard a British spy plane called ‘Rivet Joint’. The crew’s job is to record conversations between jihadis as the aircraft circles thousands of feet above the battlefield. These intercepts are fed to translators working with the SAS and are sent back to GCHQ, the Government’s secret communications headquarters. The messages between terrorists are matched against records of British jihadis believed to be fighting in Syria. Crack unit: The SAS troops have undergone intense training for the mission and have now flew to a secret base in the Middle East . The SAS is also rehearsing raids using video footage provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones. These aircraft, which can fly for up to 24 hours and can climb to an altitude of 18,000ft, fly over IS strongholds and provide up-to-the-second pictures of the enemy’s hideouts. This live information will play a vital role in any British Special Forces operation to strike Jihadi John and rescue the hostages. While he seems to speak with a distinctive London accent, it remains unclear just how much is known about Jihadi John. In September FBI director James Coney announced that the agency had established his real identity. However, no more information has been released. Since his reign of terror began in August, Jihadi John has murdered four hostages – Americans James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31, and Britons David Haines, 44, and Alan Henning, 47. Jihadi John has already killed British hostages Alan Henning, left, and David Haines, right . All of the executions were filmed and the videos were subsequently released on the internet . In the video showing the beheading of Mr Haines, Jihadi John challenged the Prime Minister, saying: ‘If you, Cameron, insist on fighting the Islamic State then you, like your master Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands.’ The Prime Minister subsequently made it clear that he would not necessarily wait for MPs’ approval before giving the order to the Special Forces troops to take their hunt for Jihadi John into Syria. He said: ‘In order to catch Jihadi John, you have to know where he is, right? We know he is in Syria. ‘I very clearly reserve the position that if you need to act immediately, either to secure a vital British interest or to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, you would act first and go to then the House of Commons afterwards.’ It is believed that there has been only one attempt by international troops to target Jihadi John. Following Mr Foley’s death, it emerged that US Special Forces had previously launched a failed raid on an IS stronghold where it was thought the terrorist was holding him. It is understood that part of the SAS mission could also include an attempt to rescue the remaining hostages, including British photographer John Cantlie, pictured . However, when the troops from the elite Delta Force unit arrived, the IS commanders and their captives had already fled. The town of Raqqa is IS’s strongest base in northern Syria. It is considered likely that the terrorists would choose this town to hold its remaining hostages and for Jihadi John to hide out there. SAS sources told The Mail on Sunday of the planned mission as US-led air strikes targeted a gathering of IS leaders in Iraq yesterday. The organisation’s most senior figure, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was among those reported to have been attending the gathering. News of the US attack in Iraq yesterday follows an escalation in violence around the capital Baghdad. The deadliest attack took place in the city’s south-western Amil district, where two car bombs killed eight people and wounded 16. On Friday, President Barack Obama authorised the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces.","Special Forces to head to a secret base in the Middle East for the mission .

"Murdered: Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, was beaten unconscious before being burned to death by neighbours who wrongly believed he was a paedophile . An innocent man was viciously beaten and then burned to death by vigilante neighbours who wrongly believed rumours that he was a paedophile. Bijan Ebrahimi, a keen gardener, had taken photographs of youths vandalising his hanging baskets and intended to hand them to police as evidence. But someone saw him with the camera and told police that the 44-year-old, who was registered disabled and unable to work, had taken pictures of children. Police went to his flat. As officers took Mr Ebrahimi away for questioning, other residents on his estate gathered in the street and chanted, ‘Paedo, paedo’. He was interviewed at a police station but officers soon realised he had been taking photographs only in an attempt to help catch the local yobs. Mr Ebrahimi, originally from Iran, was released from custody but two days later, in the early hours of Sunday July 14, his body was found burning in the road. He had been attacked by Lee James, who lived in the same street in Brislington, Bristol, a court heard. James, 24, beat Mr Ebrahimi unconscious and then with the help of another neighbour, Stephen Norley, dragged Mr Ebrahimi into the street, doused him in white spirit and set him on fire. James, who admitted murder, and Norley, 24, who denied murder but admitted assisting his friend, will be sentenced next month at Bristol Crown Court. The pair had decided to ‘take the law into their own hands’, the court heard. After the hearing, Avon and Somerset Police spokesman Martin Dunscombe said Mr Ebrahimi was an innocent man. He said: ‘Mr Ebrahimi was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence – breach of the peace – and after being interviewed he was released with no further action taken. We can categorically state he had not taken any indecent images and that nothing of concern had been found on his computer.’ Mr Ebrahimi’s family said police could have done more to prevent  ‘a callous act of unimaginable hatred’. They said the convictions of James and Norley ‘represent some measure of justice for Bijan’. In court: Lee James, pictured left, has pleaded guilty to the murder of Bijan Ebrahim while Stephen Norley, pictured right,  pleaded guilty to assisting an offender . Horrific crime: Police officers pictured investigating the scene in Bristol where Bijan Ebrahimi was found burned to death in July this year . But they added: ‘We are gravely concerned that the actions of those men may have been made possible by the failures of the police and others to protect Bijan.’ Six police officers – four constables, a sergeant and an inspector – are being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for possible gross misconduct over their handling of the case. Mr Ebrahimi’s family added in a statement: ‘Bijan was a quiet, disabled man whose only joys in life came from his horticultural interests and his cat. ‘Bijan was a caring, loving and unselfish man. He was an excellent uncle and a warm, supportive brother.’ Wrongly accused: Mr Ebrahimi was attacked outside this building in Bristol . Vigilante: Even though Mr Ebrahimi was cleared by police of any wrongdoing, local resident Lee James decided to take the law into his own hands and launched a brutal attack on the 44-year-old . Neighbours described how Mr Ebrahimi had a passion for the flowers and plants he grew in front of his maisonette. But after youngsters started destroying his garden he began taking pictures to show to the council, who owned his property, and to the police. Rumours that Mr Ebrahimi was taking pictures of young children quickly circulated in the neighbourhood. It is understood Mr Ebrahimi was subjected to harassment by mobs after James told locals he had taken photos of their children. One resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘On the Thursday evening [before Mr Ebrahimi’s murder] everyone came out and they were calling him a paedophile. ‘There were about 20 people out there all having a say. They had him down as a 100 per cent paedophile. ‘When the police took him away, everyone was cheering. Then he got released back into that.’ Targeted: Bristol Crown Court heard Mr Ebrahimi intended to hand the photographs to police as evidence against yobs who had been vandalising his garden . Another resident added: ‘Whoever started those rumours now has to live with that. ‘He wasn’t a paedophile and he’s now dead. That’s a hell of a conscience to have.’ Avon and Somerset Police say three of the officers under IPCC investigation have been suspended as a result of information about their conduct which came to light at an early stage of the investigation into Mr Ebrahimi’s death. The actions of a number of other members of police staff are also being investigated, the force says. The local council has also begun a review of the way the case was handled.","Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, took pictures of youths vandalising his flower baskets .

"Theresa May said the issue of tax credits for migrants was 'being looked at' Migrant workers could be stripped of up to £100million a week in tax credits under Tory plans to seize the initiative from Ukip on immigration. Home Secretary Theresa May has told the Daily Mail that the Treasury is conducting detailed work on ways to restrict access to tax credits, which are seen as a major ‘pull factor’ for migrants to the UK. 'The tax credits issue is something the Treasury has looked at and the Treasury is continuing to look at it,' she said. Britain spends £5billion a year on tax credits to migrants – from both inside and outside the EU. The subsidies – which are available upon arrival and top up lower-paid jobs – can treble the take-home pay of a worker with a family on minimum wage. Any attempt to restrict the right of EU nationals to in-work benefits will spark a ferocious row with Brussels. The dramatic plan emerged as David Cameron warned he will campaign to quit the EU unless it agrees to let Britain curb the free movement of workers to this country. Visiting Rochester, where the Tories face a must-win by-election against Ukip, the Prime Minister warned he was willing to give the EU 'one last go'. He called for a wholesale retreat from the principle of ‘ever closer union’ and a return to the founding purpose of the EU as a Common Market, declaring he did not want ‘a European army, European flag or a European country’. Ministers are pushing for a so-called ‘emergency brake’ on arrivals from EU states if numbers exceed expectations. In a public meeting with locals yesterday, Mr Cameron was asked if he ‘could really win back powers from Europe’. He said: ‘I think we can get what we’re looking for because the fact is it’s worth one last go trying to get a better relationship with Europe. 'I think it is worth one last go. I’m not happy with how things are at the moment – but I also think the rest of Europe actually wants us to stay.’ Scroll down for video . Speaking in Rochester ahead of a by-election triggered by Ukip defector Mark Reckless, the Prime Minister urged voters to consider 'one last go' of improving relations with Brussels . David Cameron said the Tories still could get what they wanted out of the EU. His comments came during a visit to Rochester where the Tories go against Nigel Farage's Ukip . Amid signs of growing Tory panic about the impact of Ukip, it also emerged Chief Whip Michael Gove was floating the idea of withdrawing from the European Arrest Warrant to prevent a damaging revolt. More than 100 Tory MPs are threatening to rebel on the issue, which is set to come back to the Commons next month. The scheme allows foreign police to demand the arrest of suspects here. Ministers have already acted to restrict access to out-of-work benefits for migrants in and outside the EU. But many experts believe the lure of in-work benefits is far greater. According to the Government’s Migration Advisory Committee, 415,000 foreign nationals are benefiting from the perk – worth the equivalent of almost £100million a week. The MigrationWatch campaign group found a migrant with no dependants earning the minimum wage has their net income of about £184 a week boosted to £254 by tax credits and housing benefit. If they have a partner and two children, it rockets from £184 to £543. The benefit increases depending on the size of a family. State handouts can constitute 66 per cent of a total annual income of £28,241. Compared with back home, a family from Romania and Bulgaria could multiply their take-home pay by eight. Mrs May said: ‘This is an example of the sort of thing where you constantly look to see if there are more steps you can take. It is something we look to see if, within the current arrangements, there is anything we can do.’ Mr Cameron yesterday made the first of five expected visits to Rochester, where the Tories are battling to defeat former MP Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip. He said: ‘We need to get back, frankly, to what we were told we were going to join in the first place and that’s why I’m very passionate about getting Britain out of what’s called ever-closer union.’","Home Secretary Theresa May said treasury is 'looking at' tax credits issue .

"A slideshow presentation shown to US Army Reserve recruits classifies Christians, including both evangelicals and Roman Catholics, as religious extremists, placing them in the same category as skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan, Hamas and Al Qaeda. The presentation also warned that members of the military are prohibited from taking leadership roles in any organization the Pentagon considers 'extremist,' and from distributing the organization's literature, whether on or off a military installation. The opening slide warns that 'the rise in hate crimes and extremism outside the military may be an indication of internal issues all [armed] services will have to face.' Citing a Southern Poverty Law Center report as evidence that extremism is on the rise, the Army Reserve presentation blames 'the superheated fears generated by economic dislocation, a proliferation of demonizing conspiracy theories,the changing racial make-up of America and the prospect of 4 more years under a black president who many on the far right view as an enemy to their country.' RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM: These groups were all lumped together in a slideshow for US Army Reserve recruits . EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS: The presentation described groups like the religious organizations as advocating force, violence or extremist causes . Presenters were instructed in accompanying notes to read this slide in its entirety. It warns that soldiers may not take leadership positions in any group the military considers 'extremist' in nature, nor may they distribute their literature . Later in the slideshow is a list of groups that exemplify 'religious extremism.' Included are 'evangelical Christianity,' 'Catholicism,' 'Ultra-Orthodox' Judaism, and 'Islamophobia.' Most of the list is populated by more widely accepted examples of religious extremist groups, including Al Qaeda, Sunni Muslims, Hamas, and the Ku Klux Klan. 'Men and women of faith who have served the Army faithfully for centuries shouldn't be likened to those who have regularly threatened the peace and security of the United States,' retired Col. Ron Crews, executive director of the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty, said in a statement. 'It is dishonorable for any U.S. military entity to allow this type of wrongheaded characterization. Are Catholic clergy like Pope Francis (L) and racist Klan wizards in the same boat? An Army Reserve training presentation described both groups as examples of 'religious extremism.' Crews also took a shot at the Southern Poverty Law Center. 'It also appears that some military . entities are using definitions of ""hate"" and ""extreme"" from the lists of . anti-Christian political organizations,' he added. 'That violates the apolitical . stance appropriate for the military.' He noted that the Army Chief of Chaplains has investigated the presentation and determined that it was 'an isolated incident not condoned by the Department of the Army.' The Army Reserve presentation defines religious extremism as 'beliefs, attitudes, feelings, actions, or strategies of a character far removed from the ""ordinary.""' It concedes that 'ordinary' is a subjective term, but condemns religious Americans 'who believe that their beliefs, customs and traditions are the only ""right way"" and that all others are practicing their faith the ""wrong way,"" seeing and believing that their faith/religion [is] superior to all others.' SPOT THE RELIGIOUS EXTREMIST: The ultra-orthodox Lubavitch jew (R) or the late Osama bin Laden? Trick question: the Army Reserve includes both men's religious movements . Many Christians and Jews, the presentation suggests, fit into that category, making them as objectionable as Muslim terrorists. The U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Chaplains did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services said it 'is astounded that Catholics were listed alongside groups that are, by their very mission and nature, violent and extremist.' 'The Archdiocese calls upon the Department of Defense to review these materials,' the organization said in a statement, 'and to ensure that tax-payer funds are never again used to present blatantly anti-religious material to the men and women in uniform.'","Pentagon based conclusions on Southern Poverty Law Center report .

"Google has deleted more than 18,000 web links following requests from this country under the controversial ‘right to be forgotten’ laws. Britons asked the internet search giant to remove links to more than 63,000 pages under EU legislation which has been criticised as an attack on free speech. In the first month of the ruling taking effect, 60 per cent of the Europe-wide requests came from fraudsters, criminals and sex offenders and one in ten reportedly came from paedophiles. The EU's ‘right to be forgotten’ legislation allows European citizens to request that links to ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant’ information be removed from Google search results . Requests from Britain included a former clergyman who wanted to remove links to articles about a sex abuse investigation and a doctor who botched a medical procedure. Google has received more than 146,000 requests from across Europe since May and reviewed almost half a million web links, of which 171,183 were deleted. A total of 18,304 requests – which usually involve multiple web links – were made by people in Britain, the third highest number per country after France and Germany. Google said it deleted 35 per cent, or 18,459, of the unwanted links Britons requested be removed. Critics have likened the ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling to restrictions in China, where the state imposes limits on what content is available through search engines. Newspaper websites have received notifications from Google that it has deleted links to their articles. MailOnline publisher Martin Clarke said: ‘It is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don’t like.’ The European Court of Justice ruled people had a right to ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ information about them to be dropped from internet searches. In total, members of EU countries have sent nearly 500,000 requests for links to be removed from Google . The decision – which cannot be appealed against and is binding for all EU states – affects only search results and not lawfully published and true information. But once search engines like Google drop links to such material, it becomes almost impossible to find on the internet. Facebook was the site which had the most links removed, followed by the social network search site Profile Engine and video sharing site YouTube. Google gave anonymised examples of requests it had received. In Britain, they included the former clergyman who asked for two links to articles about a sex abuse investigation while he was still a religious leader to be removed. The search engine refused his request, and said it considered ‘the rights of the individual as well as public interest in the content’ when assessing each request. Google also refused an application from a doctor who wanted more than 50 links to articles about a botched procedure removed. Three pages that contained personal information about the doctor but not about the procedure were removed from search results for his name, but links to reports about the incident were not deleted.","Law allows EU citizens to ask for links to be removed from Google searches .

"We may think of Napoleon Bonaparte as the fearsome ruler of Europe who tried to bring down Britain's greatest generals, but the emperor of France had a softer side too. The beautiful engagement ring he gave to his beloved wife Josephine is up for auction next week, and it shows that the leader was a lover as well as a fighter. The simple piece of jewellery comprises two tear-shaped gems, one diamond and one sapphire, set onto a gold band. It is going under the hammer at the Osenat auction house in Fontainebleau, near Paris, and is expected to fetch up to €15,000 (£13,000). Stunning: This beautiful engagement ring was given by Napoleon Bonaparte to his wife Josephine . True love: Napoleon and Josephine wed in 1796 and, although they later divorced, remained devoted . At the time Napoleon married Josephine in 1796, he was a 26-year-old revolutionary soldier and she was a widow who was six years older than her husband. Her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais, was an aristocrat who supported the French Revolution but later became a victim of guillotine. When she was re-married she already had two children - one of several factors which meant the groom's family was deeply scandalised at the match. The couple wed on March 9, 1796 after being engaged for just two weeks. Napoleon left France two days later to lead the French army on a successful invasion of Italy, which sealed his reputation as one of the dominant figures in the post-revolutionary state. Unique: The historic piece of jewellery is expected to fetch up to ¿15,000 (£13,000) when it is sold . He took charge of the government in a coup in 1799, and five years later was declared 'Emperor of the French'. The ruler was crowned at Notre Dame cathedral - and after placing the crown on his own head, he turned to Josephine and crowned her as empress. However, it soon became clear that the ageing wife would never bear her powerful husband a child. In 1810, they agreed to divorce - but during the ceremony, they read out statements expressing their devotion to one another. Napoleon married Marie-Louise of Austria two months later in the hope of producing an heir, and was heard to comment: 'I have married a womb.' Also up for auction: This silver sword was given to a nobleman by King Henri IV in 1592 . But he apparently never forgot the love he bore to Josephine, and he mentioned her in his last words on his death bed while in exile on St Helena. He is believed to have cried out: 'France. The army. The head of the army. Josephine.' The ring that symbolised their love is remarkably simple given its origins. 'At the time, Napoleon had very little money,' said Osenat's Jean-Christophe Chataignier. 'The ring is a very ordinary one.' The official estimate for the ring is €10,000 to €15,000. It is included in a major auction of historical items taking place next Sunday. One of the many other unique treasures included in the sale is a ceremonial silver sword given to an aristocrat by King Henri IV in 1592.","Gold ring with sapphire and diamonds goes up for auction near Paris .

"He is already the longest serving heir apparent in British history. So if Prince Charles ever gets too bored of waiting to accede to the throne, then he might just be tempted to have himself crowned King Carol 111 instead. Central European newspapers yesterday were alight with speculation that the Prince of Wales could be anointed the next King of Romania if the country’s monarchy is restored. Related: Speculation has mounted that Prince Charles could be crowned king of Romania after he revealed in a recent interview that he is related to bloodthirsty Romanian ruler Vlad the Impaler . The last royal ruler, King Michael – who . reigned from 1927 to 1930, and again from 1940 to 1947 - was forced to . abdicate by the country’s new Communist leaders, who threatened to carry . out mass executions if he refused to step down. Romania . went on to endure decades of communist government, most notably under . dictatorial party leader Nicolae Ceausescu who ruled the country with an . iron fist from 1965 until he was deposed and executed in 1989. Admittedly, it is unlikely that he . will ever be a serious contender for the throne as the deposed King, . Prince Michael, is still alive – albeit rather elderly at 90 – and has . family of his own. Despite the reintroduction of democracy, in recent years there have been increasing calls for the monarchy to be restored. And after he revealed in an interview just a few weeks ago that he is related to historical Romanian ruler Vlad the Impaler – the bloodthirsty nobleman who inspired Dracula – Charles’s name has now, bizarrely, been thrown into the ring. Connections: Prince Charles further cemented his links with Romania when he held a private meeting with Romanian tourism minister Elena Uldrea at Clarence House last week . But . local newspapers have taken great pains to point out that as well as his . ‘stake’ in the throne through his ancestor Vlad, Prince Charles’s . mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is also third cousin to the deposed King . whose great-great-grandmother was Queen Victoria. The . rumour mill went into further overdrive when the country’s powerful . tourism and development minister, Elena Udrea, flew to London last week . to meet with Charles at Clarence House. The meeting was not publicised in . advance, although pictures were subsequently released, and the glamorous . Udrea subsequently spoke of her host in glowing terms and said . Romanians should be more like Charles and ‘appreciate the country they . live in’. Links: Queen Elizabeth met Romanian President Ion Iliescu, at Buckingham Palace in 2004 (left) - but her ties with the monarchy are stronger - she is third cousin to Romania's King Michael (right) who reigned from 1927 to 1930 and again from 1940 to 1947 - but was forced to abdicate by the country's new Communist leaders . Newspapers have . even gone so far as to speculate that Charles could give up the British . throne in favour of his popular eldest son and heir, Prince William, to . become the next King of Romania instead. They . say the suggestion has such currency it is the reason its rattled . president, Traian Băsescu, has launched a series of attacks on the . former King Michael and the monarchy in general. Iron fist: Romania endured decades of communist government, most notably under Nicolae Ceausescu who ruled from 1965 until he was deposed and executed in 1989 . Intriguingly Charles is incredibly passionate about Romania. Indeed, he loves . the area around the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania so much that . he has bought a holiday home in the region and recently said in an . interview: ‘The genealogy shows I am descended from Vlad the Impaler, so . I do have a bit of a stake in the country.’ Charles secretly bought the simple, . white-washed property in the heritage site of Viscri in 2005 with the . help of the Mihai Eminescu Trust, a British-based charity which works to . preserve Romania's historic Saxon villages from destruction, of which . he is patron. He paid £18,000 for the three-bedroomed, 18th Century farmhouse. Viscri lies in a picturesque valley in the heart of Transylvania, north-west of Brasov, and is comprised of men and women of mainly of Romanian and gypsy origin. It has already won many of  Europe's highest awards for cultural restoration and economic regeneration. Charles has visited the village . several times and is so taken with the simplicity of local life that he . holidays there each summer. He . and his security team sleep in the traditional white-washed village . house - complete with wooden truckle beds and outside toilets - and . drink locally-pressed organic apple juice. The house is rented out to overseas tourists when the prince is not in residence. Clarence House last night confirmed the . prince had a meeting with the Romanian minister but declined to be drawn . on the nature of their conversations. A spokesman did, however, say the . prince was very fond of the country and pointed out that he already . owned properties in the region. But senior royal sources have dismissed the speculation as ‘ridiculous’. Passionate: Charles paid £18,000 for this property in the heritage site of Viscri in 2005, and has since holidayed there every year .","European newspapers claim Charles could be anointed should monarchy be restored .

"China has built an island fortress on a disputed reef, raising concerns over their military ambitions in the South China Sea. Satellite images show that an artificial island with two piers, a helipad and a cement plant has appeared within the past nine months at Hughes Reef in the Spratly Islands. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei have all registered claims to the territory, leading to increased military tensions recently. Original: The first satellite images, taken in March last year, showed the original 380 square metre platform that work started expanding from. US officials have described China's building expansion in the area as 'unprecedented' Progress: Within months, staff had built an artificial island and dredged a channel as they prepared to develop the fort on the disputed Hughes Reef . Concern: The pictures, released by military analysis firm IHS Jane's, show the area has now been expanded to a 75,000 square metre fort amid concern that China can develop its navy, air force, coastguard and fishing fleets in the region . The pictures, released by military analysis firm IHS Jane's, has been expanded from 380 square metres to a 75,000 square metre fort  in the Union Banks region. The reef is approximately 210 miles from the Philippines and 660 miles from China. Work originally began in March last year, and by the end of January, the original structure had been connected to the helipad. Pictures also showed that similar structures are being built at nearby Johnson South Reef and Gaven Reefs. Experts say the fortresses will allow the Chinese government to extend the range of its navy, air force, coastguard and fishing fleets in the region. American authorities have repeatedly asked China to stop their building projects in the region, which began after President Xi Jinping came to power three years ago. James Hardy, Asia Pacific Editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, said: 'Where it used to have a few small concrete platforms, it now has full islands with helipads, airstrips, harbors and facilities to support large numbers of troops. Military might: China's President Xi is expected to announce an increase in spending on the military next month . 'We can see that this is a methodical, well-planned campaign to create a chain of air and sea capable fortresses across the center of the Spratly Islands chain.' One western diplomat said: 'These reclamations are bigger and more ambitious than we all thought. 'On many different levels it's going to be exceptionally difficult to counter China in the South China Sea as this develops.' Last May, Chinese ships were accused of attacking Vietnamese vessels in the area, which is thought to be rich in oil and gas. The Chinese have employed workers to build ports and fuel storage depots that experts say would allow Beijing to project power deep into the maritime heart of Southeast Asia. A senior US official described China's building expansion in the area as 'unprecedented', and said: 'The Chinese have built up a head of steam on the land reclamation in the South China Sea over the course of 2014. If anything, it looks to be accelerating.' President Xi is expected to announce an increase in spending on the military next month. Last year China's defence budget rose to approximately £85 billion, second only to the US in terms of total spend. In March last year, the Philippine government revealed concerns that China was carrying out land reclamation activities in the region. Japan has been strengthening its military might as tensions in the area mount, and last month announced a record £28 billion defence budget.","Island fortress has appeared on Hughes Reef in South China Sea .

Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter, . however, is unconvinced by Lohan's excuse, telling reporters that she . has been to the morgue before so should have known where to go. Speaking later in the day, Winter told RadarOnline that Lindsay will not be allowed to turn up unannounced on Friday at the morgue because she will need to ask for permission first from her probation department and possibly Judge Stephanie Sautner. 'Ms. Lohan has to have permission from the probation department and/or the judge, that she can come back,' he told RadarOnline. 'I haven't heard from the probation department or the judge about whether or not Ms. Lohan will be allowed to come back.'

"A trip to a shopping center in Lake Worth, Texas, ended in a tragedy on Saturday when a 7-year-old girl was mowed down by an out-of-control pickup truck that also injured five other people. The incident happened at around 2:00pm in the parking lot of the Target and Ross stores in the 6300 block of Lake Worth Avenue when the driver of a black pickup truck, identified as 84-year-old Vincent Martinez, slammed into several pedestrians. According to paramedics, six people in the parking lot were seriously injured, among them two adults and four children between the ages of seven and 14, NBC5 reported. Horrific crash: A black pickup truck accelerated and came to rest on top of a white Lexus in the parking lot of a Lake Worth, Texas, shopping center . Innocent bystanders: A total of six people, including of four children, were injured in the crash, one of them fatally . Unnamed victim: An eyewitness said the impact of the crash threw the 7-year-old onto the windshield of his car before she fell to the ground . All of the kids were taken to Cook Children's Medical Center. One of them, a 7-year-old girl, died from her injuries, according to Lake Worth police. Authorities have yet to release the victims’ names. Martinez’s daughter, Ester Zenteno, said that her father is diabetic and may have gone into diabetic shock from improper insulin intake at the time of the crash. ‘He does take insulin and I can't say 100 per cent that he took it this morning,’ she told NBC5. ‘I'm assuming that his sugar went out of control.’ Zenteno said that her father would . rather be dead than hurt someone, adding that he is going to ‘go crazy’ when he finds out what happened. Driver: Vincent Martinez, 84, was described as being dazed and shaken when he climbed out of his mangled truck following the accident . Possible explanation: Martinez's daughter, Ester Zenteno, right, said her father is diabetic, and it's possible that he forgot to take his insulin in the morning . ‘My heart goes out to the family, the family that is hurt,’ she told MyFox DFW through tears. Martinez and the two adult victims were taken to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth. Eyewitness Paul Rahl said that he was sitting in his white Lexus waiting for his family at around 1:40pm when Martinez's truck crashed into him and came to rest on top of his car. Rahl said he saw the 7-year-old girl hit his windshield and then tumble to the ground. ‘Her little hair is still in my windshield,’ he told the station CW33. The first four victims were struck . outside the Ross clothing store, including one woman who was hit just . moments after she came out into the parking lot. Investigation: Police are reviewing surveillance tapes from the parking lot to determine the cause of the crash . ‘She was just on the ground, face down,’ witness Brittaney Scott told CW33.

"A terminally ill groom robbed of speech by cancer married his childhood sweetheart by squeezing her hand to say ‘I do’ before he died 11 days later. William Kent, 24 married Emma, 25, at his hospital bedside despite not being able to speak or blink because of nerve damage caused by the illness. For six months William, a teacher, fought the disease and would not let it ruin the moment he married Emma who he had proposed to three years ago on Valentine’s Day. Childhood sweethearts: William and Emma married in a hospital ceremony before he died 11 days later . Instead of saying his vows, he squeezed the registrar’s hand before his father supported his hand so he could make a mark on the marriage register. Family and friends from Ilkeston’s Ormiston Enterprise Academy, where William taught, crammed into the hospital room after being given just hours’ notice of the ceremony. Nurses had told William’s family and Emma earlier that day that they could arrange for the wedding to happen to fulfil the couple’s wishes. William died from lymphoma cancer 11 days after the whirlwind ceremony at Nottingham City Hospital on October 3. The look of love: William was not able to speak because of his cancer and so had to squeeze the registrar's hand to say 'I do' Emma, who wore a blue dress for ceremony, said William loved life and was adored by everyone. She said: ‘The squeeze of the hand was so tight, there was no doubt in my mind at all that he wanted to be married. ‘I rushed into town to buy wedding bands. They only stocked samples so I bought those. ‘The . wedding meant absolutely everything and it was amazing, I think it . spurred him on with the strength to keep going for another 11 days. ‘Everyone adored William, he made friends with everyone he met and he had a huge group of friends. ‘He’d . always act the fool and would spoil a couple of photos pulling faces. We first met properly in art classes at sixth form, we started talking . and then went to a pub quiz together. ‘William was really excited about everything, it was infectious his sense of joy at life, he was a cheeky chappy.’ Happier days: William and Emma met at school as children and started dating in sixth form . He graduated from Leeds Metropolitan University and worked as a teacher before the cancer struck . Emma said after a first round of treatment following the diagnosis in April William took her to eat out almost every night to build up his strength. She said: ‘When he came out we just ate out everywhere, he wanted to go out and eat. I have never been to so many restaurants in such a short space of time - Chiquitos, Pizza Hut, KFC, everywhere, so he could build his strength up for his next round of chemo.’ Emma and William met at school as children but it was not until the they were in sixth form that they started dating. While William went to Leeds Metropolitan to study a degree in IT, Emma went to Lincoln to study illustration. They stayed together and after they graduated, they saved up to buy their first house together in Derby. For six months, William fought the disease and refused to let it take away the moment he married Emma who he had proposed to three years ago on Valentines Day . He popped the question at his parents’ house in Holbrook in Derbyshire after decorating the room with pictures of beaches, saying he could not afford to take her to the exotic location he wanted to propose in. In order to save money for a house and because they had started new jobs, they decided to postpone the wedding until 2014. Their life together was dealt a bitter blow in April when William began getting pains in his arm and coughing. He went to the doctors who did not find anything wrong with him. The pain continued, however, and he returned to his GP who referred him to Royal Derby Hospital. They in turn referred him to Nottingham City Hospital where he was diagnosed with lymphoma, a type of cancer, and began chemotherapy. His strength declined, and his muscles and immune system weakened, forcing him to stay in hospital. Adored: William's wife Emma said that he made friends with everyone he met . When he was well enough, he was allowed home to spend the odd day with Emma, his family, and beloved dogs Poppy and Riley. The hospital tried a new form of treatment for the type of cancer William had but it was unsuccessful. The cancer spread to his nervous system and brain which stopped his speech. William’s mother, Helen, said: ‘At 11am on the morning of the wedding they weren’t getting married but then the nurses said how William and Emma had been speaking about it a few weeks beforehand. ‘They said that if they wanted to get married and William’s dad and I agreed, they could fix it for that day. ‘Right to the end he did not get angry or have outbursts. He would still crack jokes. It was a real comfort to us actually.’ William’s sister, Rachel, 26, said: ‘It was a really happy day, a lovely occasion. You might not think of that when you think of a wedding in a hospital but it was, it was really nice.’ William’s father said it had been university which had given William the determination to succeed as a teacher. He said: ‘He did change. He was the same character but he really got serious about wanting to do things, teaching for him was not just a passion but he had real flair for it. ‘ . William was a keen skier and he enjoyed family holidays to France where he showed off his skills. To his sisters, both older sibling Rachel, and Emily, 15, he was a caring brother.","William Kent, 24, suffered from cancer, which prevented him speaking .

"A Missouri couple have filed a lawsuit against a pair of obstetricians, . accusing them of decapitating their baby during his 2011 delivery and then trying to . hide it by shoving the child’s body and severed head back into the birth canal. In a court complaint that reads like the script of a horror . film, Arteisha Betts and Travis Ammonette, of Florissant, described how doctors . Gilbert Webb and Susan Moore had allegedly coerced them into a vaginal delivery . against their wishes, and then severed their son's head. The 10-complaint lawsuit cites Midwest Maternal & Fetal . Medicine Services, LLC, Signature Medical Group Inc and the two doctors. However, the suit does not list St John’s Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis, . where the bungled delivery too place in March 2001, as a defendant. Outraged parents: Arteisha Betts and Travis Ammonette are suing two obstetricians for allegedly decapitating their son during his 2011 delivery and then trying to cover it up . Touching tribute: Ammonette got a tattoo of little Kaden's hand prints on his chest last April honoring his deceased son . According to the court filing, Betts and Ammonette were told . by Dr Moore during a February 2011 appointment that the baby will have to be delivered . via C-section rather than vaginally because the child had an abnormally large abdomen, Patch Florissant reported. But when the expectant mother prematurely went into labor on . March 22 only 28 weeks and five days into her term, the complaint indicates that . Dr Webb 'would not agree' to the Cesarean and 'would only deliver her baby by . way of attempted trial of vaginal delivery.' Sued: Dr Gilbert Webb is a defendant in a complaint accusing him of forcing Arteisha Betts into undergoing a vaginal delivery against her wishes . The couple claim that the obstetrician also refused to let . them go to a different hospital for a Cesarian. ‘Believing that she had no other choice than to agree to a . trial of vaginal delivery, plaintiff Arteisha Betts consented to a trial of . vaginal delivery under duress and protest,’ according to the complaint. The infant's head was delivered in the first stage of the . birthing process, but in the second stage which got under way at around 10.30pm, . the lawsuit claims that his large abdomen became lodged in the birth canal. According to the complaint, Dr Webb applied traction to the . child's head in an attempt to dislodge his body, at which point the infant was . decapitated. Citing the complaint, the Courthouse News Services reported that blood shot out from the baby’s arteries and veins, spilling onto . the floor in full view of the mother and Ammonette, who was sitting only two to . four feet away from the birthing bed. The lawsuit states that Webb then 'pushed decedent's head and . body back into plaintiff Arteisha Betts' birth canal' and called for an . emergency C-section. The doctor started cutting into the woman's abdomen before . the anesthesia fully set in, causing her great pain and suffering in the process, the suit . says. During the procedure,  the doctor ‘surgically and completely removed’ the child's head from his neck and torso. Site: The bungled delivery took place March 2011 at St John's Mercy Medical Center in St Louis, but the hospital has not been listed as a defendant in the lawsuit . Before handing the little boy named Kaden Travis to his . parents, Webb had allegedly 'intentionally concealed' his neck wounds, although . the complaint does not specify how it was done. The Daily Mail was unable to reach the couple's attorney, Christopher Wright of the firm Millikan Wright in St Louis, on Thursday. Calls to the two medical centers cited in the lawsuit also went unanswered. The suit seeks unspecified damages to cover pregnancy . costs, funeral expenses as well as personal injury and wrongful death.","Arteisha Betts went into labor in March 2011 only 28 weeks and five days into her term .

"Philippe Senderos has spelled out to Roy Hodgson the expectation on England to make it to Euro 2016 ahead of their crucial first qualifier in Switzerland on Monday. England lag 11 places behind their Group E opponents in FIFA’s world rankings but Senderos insists Hodgson’s team are favourites because of the depth of quality at his disposal compared to Switzerland. The Aston Villa defender, who has played every minute for the Premier League’s joint-meanest defence so far this season, believes English players sometimes wear the Three Lions shirt heavily, including at the World Cup in Brazil where he says: ‘Everyone expected more.’ Clear warning: Philippe Senderos believes the pressure is on England to qualify for Euro 2016 . Disappointment: England crashed out of the 2014 World Cup during the group stages . But ahead of their clash at Basle’s St Jakob Stadium, Senderos believes the onus to deliver remains on the visitors. ‘I don’t think you can ever enter as favourites against a big team like England,’ he explains. ‘We are still a small country, we are developing very well and qualifying for big tournaments. But England are a massive country in football and they have a lot of players to pick from. ‘It’s different in Switzerland, because England are expected to win and go to every tournament. With the players and quality they have they should do that. ‘For Switzerland it’s a massive achievement to qualify for any competition. Now we’ve raised the bar really high, qualifying for the last three World Cups, every time we don’t qualify it will be a big disappointment. ‘We want our level of football to compete with the big nations.’ Under Ottmar Hitzfeld, Switzerland thrived to such an extent that they entered the summer’s World Cup as a seeded nation following an unbeaten qualifying campaign. In Brazil they won a thriller against Ecuador, experienced a chastening defeat to France but then rallied to beat Honduras. In the last 16 they only went out to Argentina by virtue of Angel di Maria’s late goal in extra time. Under pressure: England boss Roy Hodgson must guide the Three Lions to Euro 2016 . England were eliminated before 12 teams had even played their second game after defeats to Italy and Uruguay, before limping to a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica. Senderos declines to say what he thinks went wrong but concedes most seasoned observers had higher hopes. ‘It’s a big competition and it’s always difficult to go through,’ he adds. ‘I know we have a very tough game against them and that’s all I want to concentrate on. ‘We are going to try to battle hard and start this new campaign on a good foot. A win means you can do something special.’ Croatian coach Vladimir Petkovic, 51, has taken over from Hitzfeld, who retired aged 65, and despite losing the man who masterminded Switzerland’s recent success, Senderos describes the atmosphere in the camp as ‘very excited’. New reign: Croatian coach Vladimir Petkovic has replaced the recently retired Ottmar Hitzfeld . ‘He’s going to create something new, the whole country is up for it.’ It is nearly a decade since the 29-year-old made his international debut and he hopes to win his 55th cap against England. He is well placed to identify how a country of eight million has managed to compete at the last five major tournaments. He attributes their standing to an emphasis on youth development and the embracing of migrant families. Senderos, son of a Spanish father and Serbian mother, won the Under 17 European Championships in 2002. ‘The national team and every single club in Switzerland has done major work on youth. The next generation to mine (in 2009) were world champions in Nigeria, a massive achievement. Those players now have come through to the first team. ‘Also in Switzerland we have a lot of immigrants, born and raised here but with heritage from different countries, and have used that to our advantage. If you see our line-up we don’t have many Swiss names in the team. It’s very important for a small country to do that.’ Villa might have two representatives on the pitch in Basle, if Fabian Delph earns selection from Roy Hodgson. ‘He will bring his energy, his power, his will to move forward all the time,’ says Senderos. ‘He is a very positive player to have around.’ There are kind words too for maligned Wayne Rooney, and an explanation of why he is a nightmare for centre-backs. ‘It’s very difficult to mark him because he’s always moving around and finding these pockets between the midfield and the striker . ‘For us as defenders he brings you out of the spot where you are normally comfortable. He will thrive as England captain.’ Happy: Former Arsenal defender Senderos is delighted to be back in the Premier League . Senderos is thriving alongside Ron Vlaar for Villa, and the pair have only conceded once in three Premier League games as Paul Lambert’s side sit among the Champions League places. It is a brighter start than how his three-year spell at Fulham ended, before a six-month stint in La Liga with Valencia. ‘I’m very pleased to be back in the Premier League,’ he says. ‘We have started well but it’s very early and we have to continue working. ‘I’m sad about what happened at Fulham and wish them all the best. I went to a big club like Valencia, so I was very pleased with my move. ‘It was a good experience. We played in the semi-finals of the Europa League and were so close to going to the final.’ For England going close will not do. Hodgson must qualify.irmly in the thoughts of McLaren.","Philippe Senderos believes England are under immense pressure to qualify from a group which includes Switzerland and Slovenia .

"Nick Clegg's plans for free school meals have been met with criticism with some Liberal Democrats even admitting the scheme is a 'waste of money' Plans to hand free school meals to the under-8s across the country were mired in chaos last night  after senior Tories denounced  the proposal to pay for the lunches of affluent children. Less than 24 hours after Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed his plan to offer a hot lunch to every infant pupil, Liberal Democrat ministers were forced to admit they once branded the policy a waste of money. In addition, London Mayor Boris  Johnson rejected the plans, saying that better-off families should pay for their children’s food. ‘I am in no means against getting parents who can pay for to pay for it,’ said Mr Johnson. ‘I have no problem with the concept of dinner money.’ Mr Clegg confirmed his £600million plan during his speech at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow yesterday. It is due to be announced by Chancellor George Osborne in the Autumn Statement later this year. But former Tory frontbencher David Davis said the scheme was incoherent, saying the Lib Dems have created a new universal benefit just as the Treasury is cutting child benefit for the better-off. He said: ‘At a time when the Government is scaling back child benefit it seems very odd to add another universal benefit. ‘It’s hard to understand why families in the best parts of Notting Hill should have free school meals, particularly since the free school meals available when I was a child would probably fail a health and safety test.’ Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, dismissed the plans saying that better off families should pay for their children's food . The Lib Dems also faced embarrassment . after it emerged that they have opposed the very same policy when it was . enacted by Labour councils in London. A . letter signed by the party’s deputy leader Simon Hughes surfaced . yesterday in which he denounces the plans as a waste of money because it . helped better-off families. High Speed 2 will damage the environment and have a huge impact on irreplaceable ancient woodlands, a Lib Dem minister has said. Agriculture Minister David Heath said the route of the fast rail line needed to be examined carefully because ‘you can’t grow old trees’. He said officials would have to ‘look critically’ at the proposals for the £50billion railway linking London to Birmingham and on to Manchester and Leeds. His Somerton and Frome constituency is not affected by the route, but Tory MPs in the Chilterns bitterly oppose the proposal. The Woodland Trust says HS2 will directly affect 33 ancient woods, and the noise and vibration will impact on habitats in another 34. In a letter to a constituent, the MP for Southwark and Bermondsey said . Labour-run Southwark Council was ‘wasting extraordinary amounts of . money’. ‘They are spending £15million giving free school meals, some of this is going to the borough’s richest families, irrespective of whether they can afford to pay for them already. Labour-run Southwark Council can’t get the basics right and act like they have money to burn. ‘They are slashing projects that offer a hand up to those who need them – to fund handouts for those who don’t.’ Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said the Lib Dems can now afford to back the policy. He said: ‘In the council in that area, which was cutting budgets all over the place, they were concerned about the allocation of resources in the council. ‘As a national policy, which is going to be funded by the central government, it removes that pressure and they were welcoming what we were doing.’ Lib Dem Education Minister David Laws also prompted confusion by claiming the £600million cost of the scheme could be funded by plugging tax loopholes. It had been thought the money would be found by making further cuts in the education budget, but Mr Laws vowed that the money could be obtained from ‘tax loopholes that were abused by wealthy people’.

"A bride lost 11st after passers-by teased her for being fat as she posed for her wedding photos. Chloe Dodds, of Seaham, Durham, walked down the aisle in a size 30 gown after ballooning to 21st 8lb on a diet of Sugar Puffs, pizza and chips. She was reduced to tears as by-standers heckled her with comments such as 'you look so fat in that dress!' as she posed for pictures beside her wedding car. Scroll down for video . After being heckled for her size by passers-by on her big day (left), Chloe shed 11st to reach 10st 12lb (right) Despite her smiles for the camera, cruel comments from passers-by meant Chloe spent much of her special day in tears . The ceremony had to be delayed for 15 minutes as Chloe, 35, bawled her eyes out and she sobbed tears of despair - not joy - as she walked down the aisle. But the real shock came when her official wedding photos arrived - and she was so horrified by her appearance she vowed to lose weight. She shed 3st before having a gastric bypass and her weight has now plummeted to just 10st 12lb. Delighted carer Chloe, now a size 12, said: 'I was mortified when I heard those comments. 'It was my wedding day and people had heckled me - I was a curvy bride but did I really deserve such taunts? 'As I looked through the wedding pictures, I couldn’t believe how fat I was - I knew I couldn’t carry on like that.' Chloe, of Seaham, Durham, peaked at 21st 8lb before falling ill on a holiday to Ibiza in 2009 and losing 2st in two weeks. Chloe's diet of Sugar Puffs, pizza and chips saw her weight reach an unhealthy 21st 8lb . She was then diagnosed with type two diabetes and her weight settled at around 19st when she got engaged to long-term boyfriend Paul, who she met online aged 21. But when she went wedding dress shopping she realised most gowns were only available up to size 20 and she had to get a size 30 imported from America. She only invited 15 people to her wedding because she was so self-conscious about her appearance and hid her dress away in a wardrobe until the big day in August 2010. But when she slipped into the gown on the morning of the wedding she started to cry in despair at her appearance. Chloe Dodds two months after her weight loss surgery . She said: 'I checked myself out from every angle in the mirror, desperate to find a thin angle. 'But I was like a beacon in my dress. I just wanted to throw on my old, baggy black clothes and disappear. 'My mum wiped my tears away and assured me I looked beautiful.' A group of local residents had gathered around her wedding car outside, waiting to catch a glimpse of the bride. But when she stepped out she was horrified to hear taunts of 'You look awful!', 'Fat bride!' and 'You look so fat in that dress!'. Chloe, who is just 5ft 3ins, said: 'My heart broke into a thousand pieces. 'I thought I looked big when I’d put the dress on, but to hear it come from other people hurt so much more than my own criticism. 'I thought there was an unwritten rule that you always complimented a bride, no matter what.' Paul reassured her when she arrived at Sunderland Register Office but the cutting comments had ruined her big day. She said: 'We posed for photographs outside the registry office. I smiled and laughed and I was happy, but a part of me was still so upset. 'Our guests all complimented me, telling me I looked stunning. But their words fell on deaf ears. The damage was done.' Chloe quickly changed out of her wedding dress and into comfortable baggy clothes at the reception and vowed to change her ways. She visited her doctor and explained that all previous diets, slimming classes and pills had failed and asked to be considered for a gastric band. Chloe, who is now dwarfed by her old wedding dress, has even managed to reverse her diabetes through her weight loss . Chloe was referred to a specialist in February 2011 and was told to slim down to 18st before she could go under the knife. She took two years to lose the weight and finally had the operation at Sunderland Royal Hospital in June last year. Now, a year later, her diabetes has disappeared and she has slimmed down to a 10st 12lb and size 12. 'I physically can’t eat much and I don’t want to', said Chloe, who is a full-time carer for her mother Joyce, 59, along with husband Paul, 37. 'I eat a boiled egg for breakfast, a jacket potato with cheese for lunch and a small portion of shepherd’s pie for dinner. 'I have some excess skin, which is common in rapid weight loss. I’m saving up to have my bingo wings removed. And after we’ve had children, I’ll have a tummy tuck too. 'Those cruel jibes ruined my wedding day, but I think I got the last laugh. I’m finally who I want to be.' Proud husband Paul said: 'I thought Chloe looked beautiful on our wedding day. 'What those people did was just cruel. But I’m proud of Chloe for losing weight - she looks even more fantastic now.'","Chloe had to order her size 30 wedding dress specially from America .

"Chinese officials are building the first island large enough for its own airfield in the middle of disputed waters in the south sea. Satellite images revealed that since reclaiming the Spratly Islands in August, workers have expanded one stretch of sand to make it long enough for aircraft to land and take off. Dredgers are also creating a harbour to the east of the reef large enough to receive tankers and warships. The 3,000m patch Fiery Cross Reef forms part of the archipelago which has been at the heart of territorial disputes for years. Scroll down for video . Satellite images show that since reclaiming the Spratly Islands in August, workers have expanded one stretch of sand to make it long enough for aircraft to land and take off . While the islands, named after the British sailor Richard Spratly who discovered them in 1843, lie between the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, they are host to a plethora of military machinery and resources owned by the Republic of China. Fears that China intended to use the archipelago as a mineral-rich installation of military bases spread when officials began reclaiming the abandoned islands in August. While the Chinese army controls many of the 750 islets and reefs, it does not yet have its own airfield in the south China sea unlike Malaysian, Vietnamese and Filipino forces. According to imagery obtained by independent analysis company IHS, dredging has begun on Fiery Cross Reef to create a harbour large enough for military tankers. China has used dredgers to construct an island about 3000 metres long and 200 to 300 metres wide on the reef, which was previously under water . Workers had built a reinforced seawall around an island on Johnson South Reef in the Spratly Islands by August (pictured) This satellite image released in April 2014 showed substantial land reclamation, harbour redevelopment, and additional construction activity on Woody Island since October 2013 . Johnson South Reef, Cuateron Reef, and Gaven Reefs have all been expanded on since Chinese officials reclaimed the waters earlier this year, though the Fiery Cross Reef is the only island large enough for an airfield. Jin Zhirui, a colonel with the Chinese air force . command, declined to confirm plans to build an airfield on the reef but said China needed to build . facilities in the South China Sea for strategic reasons. 'We need to go out, to make our contribution to regional and . global peace. 'We need support like this, including . radar and intelligence.'

The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake.","Chinese officials have created a 3,000m-long reef in the Spratly Islands .

"A father who killed himself after being questioned by police over being snared by a 'paedophile hunter' would have been charged with attempting to meet an underage girl for sex, it has emerged. Father-of-one Michael Parkes, 45, of Daventry, Northamptonshire, was confronted and filmed in May last year by Stinson Hunter, who had arranged to meet him after posing as a child online. Hunter - whose real name is Keiren Parsons - has caused controversy by posting the videos of his meetings online, including that of Mr Parkes, and has been criticised by police for his methods. Death: Father-of-one Michael Parkes (left), 45, of Daventry, Northamptonshire, was confronted and filmed in May last year by Stinson Hunter (right), who had arranged to meet him after posing as a child online . At an inquest held today into Mr . Parkes’s death on June 2 last year, the senior coroner for . Northamptonshire Anne Pember recorded a verdict of suicide, with cause . of death as hanging. She . concluded Mr Parkes, a warehouse manager, was ‘feeling low and . depressed’ at the time of his death. ‘He made the decision he no longer . wished to live,’ said Mrs Pember. ‘He killed himself.’ In . a statement after the inquest, Northamptonshire Police, who arrested Mr . Parkes on May 29 last year on suspicion of meeting someone he thought . to be a 12-year-old girl for sex, said it would have sought a charging . decision based on the evidence supporting the allegation. A force spokesman also said: ‘It is clear that Parkes drove to Coventry with the intention of engaging in sexual activity with a child.’ However, the police went on to say they did not condone Mr Parsons’s actions and said investigating wrong-doing was best left to police. During the inquest at Northampton General Hospital, the court was told that Mr Parkes was found dead in his car. Police inspector Carol Fullerton was called to the scene by the fire brigade who had been responding to reports of a car fire at the location off Welton Road, near Daventry. When she arrived she found Mr Parkes’s ‘apparently lifeless body slumped across the front seats of the car’. Mr Parkes, identified at the scene from a driving licence and bank cards, was removed from the car where a passing doctor led efforts to resuscitate him. Despite their attempts, Mr Parkes, who lived with his mother in Daventry, died at the scene at 1.26pm. Ms Fullerton, who was aware of Mr Parkes’s arrest over the child grooming allegation, then radioed headquarters telling them to inform Northamptonshire Police’s professional standards department. Clip: A video from Stinson-Hunter.com capturing the moment Stinson Hunter confronted Michael Parkes . The court also heard evidence from GP Dr Alexander Wennekes who said he had prescribed anti-depressants on and off to Mr Parkes over recent years, for bouts of work-related stress and depression. Dr Wennekes stated that earlier in 2013 Mr Parkes got in touch with the surgery complaining of feeling depressed after splitting from his partner of three years while she was pregnant with their son. On May 30, that year, he said Mr Parkes - . who also had a wife from whom he had been separated for some years - . again contacted the surgery saying he was suffering depression. 'He made the decision he no longer wished to live. He killed himself' Anne Pember, Northamptonshire coroner . ‘When I saw him he said he was going through a bad patch, had financial difficulties, no access to his son and had been arrested by the police on what he said were false allegations - however he did not explain further,’ said Dr Wennekes. He added: ‘He admitted to some morbid thoughts but had no plans or intentions in that area, and was keen to restart anti-depressants and wanted something ""to feel a bit calmer"".’ Dr Wennekes prescribed anti-depressants and diazepam and Mr Parkes later booked himself in for a follow-up appointment scheduled for the following week. A long-term friend of Mr Parkes, Caroline Elston, said she received a text from him without explanation which simply read ‘sorry’, the day before his death. When she queried the message by text, however, she got no response. Richard Parkes, his brother, said Mr Parkes’s arrest had upset him and ‘had a significant effect on his state of mind and the actions he had taken’. Clip: Another still of the confrontation. An inquest has taken place at Northampton General Hospital today . Following the inquest, asked what he felt about the police investigation and the involvement of Mr Parsons, he replied: ‘The police have not provided me with any evidence that supports these allegations.’ He paid tribute to Mr Parkes and said: ‘Michael’s family are deeply shocked by his death. He was a loving father, son and brother and a caring person who put his family and others first.’ Northamptonshire Police offered its condolences to Mr Parkes’s family. ‘We have a duty to investigate and respond to child abuse allegations,’ a spokesman for the force said. ‘A decision to arrest Parkes was made when it became clear from the material supplied to us that he believed the age of the person he was in communication with was 12-years-old. 'A decision to arrest Parkes was made when it became clear from the material supplied to us that he believed the age of the person he was in communication with was 12-years-old' Northamptonshire Police spokesman . ‘It is also clear that Parkes drove to Coventry with the intention of engaging in sexual activity with a child. ‘In the light of Parkes’s subsequent death, a thorough review was carried out and it is clear that it would have passed the threshold test and that Northamptonshire Police would have sought a CPS charging decision.’ The spokesman added: ‘We do not condone or support the actions of Stinson Hunter. ‘Identifying alleged paedophiles is best left to the police and suspected incidences of online grooming should be reported to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre.’ Separately, Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police issued a joint statement yesterday stating they do not condone Mr Parsons’s methods and adding that his actions ‘could have several serious consequences’, including compromising continuing investigations. In January, Warwickshire Police threatened Parsons with legal action if he did not stop his activities. Assistant Chief Constable Karen Manners said he could be ‘compromising’ investigations. Although police insist Parsons has been repeatedly asked to stop his undercover activity, he claims he has been ‘encouraged and coached’ by officers from Warwickshire Constabulary. A force spokesman said they would investigate claims by Parsons that officers disclosed sensitive information to him. Asked what advice he had been given, the spokesman added: ‘None specifically. Officers have been consistently briefed that they should offer no encouragement to him.’ The Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and West Mercia forces have all reiterated the advice of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) on the topic of members of the public attempting to ensnare those they claim are out to commit sex offences against children. Acpo has previously stated: ‘We understand the desire to protect children but any member of the public who has information about child sexual abuse, online or otherwise, should get in contact with the police so we can investigate and bring people to justice.’","Michael Parkes was confronted and filmed by Stinson Hunter last May .

"A bride-to-be had her heart melted by her very own Prince Charming when he made her dreams come true with a Frozen-themed marriage proposal. Brian Davis, 23, from Denver Colorado asked his girlfriend Michelle Sequin, 22, to marry him disguised as Prince Hans from the hit film, while his bride-to-be dressed up as Princess Anna. Brian and Michelle went to see Frozen on a date together and so the film has always been particularly close to the couple's hearts. Scroll down for video . Brian surprised his bride-to-be Michelle by recreating a scene from the movie Frozen . 'We saw Frozen on a date together and both fell in love with the film. It gave me the idea for the proposal' says Brian. 'I wanted to create a perfect Disney scene, where a charming prince would woo his princess by riding up on his trusty steed and proposing in front of a castle.' Brian, a medical student, met Michelle when they were teenagers and knew from the start that he wanted her to be his wife. 'From the second day after I met her I knew I wanted to marry her' says the groom who decided to propose to Michelle, a biomedical engineer, shortly after she graduated from university. Fairytale romance: Brain had replicas of Frozen costumes run up for both of them to make the experience feel more authentic . The proposal took careful planning and Brian enlisted the help of Michelle's relatives to keep the plan a surprise . When it came to realising his dream of recreating the fairytale Brian spared no expense to ensure that the experience was 'completely authentic'. The devoted groom ordered custom-made tailored versions of Anna's coronation dress and Hans' regal outfit at a total cost of £180, working with her relatives to create the perfect fit. 'I had to estimate Michelle's size with the help of her mother in order to keep it a secret. 'The outfits arrived in time and they looked fantastic. I was excited and it was hard not to tell her what I was planning.' Prince Charming: Brian even hired a trusty steed to complete his royal entrance . Michelle was utterly surprised by the proposal as she had been lead to believe she was going out to dinner . Not satisfied with a simple costume change the committed groom then went in search for a castle to create the perfect romantic setting for his proposal. Unfortunately fairtytale castles are few and far between in Denver and Brian eventually settled on a venue called Castle Marne Inn a near-by mansion with castle-like features. Brian's proposal was given an extra flourish with his arrival on a 'trusty steed', like the character from the film. Setting the scene: Short of a castle, Brian opted for a nearby mansion as the location of his proposal . Brian based the custom-made dress  on Anna's coronation outfit from the film . 'I called the manager (of the Inn) and asked her if she would allow me to bring a horse onto the property. She loved the idea and was excited to be a part of it. I picked the date and reserved a private dinner for two.' Once his elaborate plan was in place Brian had to try and figure out how to lure his bride to the venue without raising her suspicions. 'I convinced Michelle we were going to go out for dinner for our fourth anniversary. 'I dropped off Michelle's dress at her house with instructions to wear it. I then saddled up the horse, which was called Romeo, and rode him to the Castle Marne Inn.' The proposal was completed with a romantic meal for two in the mansion house . Attention to detail: Brian presented the engagement ring in a pink, crown-shaped box, Michelle was utterly shocked by the proposal but immediately said yes . Despite his meticulous planning, Brian still suffered from nerves as he prepared to ask the life-changing question. 'As Michelle arrived I felt my heart beating fast but I never questioned what I was about to do. I was ready to ask her. 'I rode up on Romeo, dismounted and proposed to her beside the castle, under a vine arch.' Brian presented his bride-to-be with a white gold engagement ring featuring a diamond-studded design. Michelle was completely taken aback - but said yes immediately, adding that the proposal was a dream come true. Brian and Michelle announced their engagement to friends with a video of them singing 'Love is an Open Door' Anna and Hans' duet from the film . 'I can honestly say that I had no idea the proposal was coming but Brian has always been one to do crazy and romantic things.' 'The entire thing was a dream come true. Once I saw Brian down on his knee all of my nerves went away and became pure joy. I was quick to say yes to my very own Prince Charming.' The two lovers let their friends know about the engagement in a musical video where they mimed along to the song Love is an Open Door, which features in the film. The song ends with the lines: 'Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me? Can I say something even crazier? Yes.' In the movie, the relationship is destined for failure when Princess Anna discovers that Prince Hans is a fraud. But Brian is optimistic that his fairytale proposal will lead to happily ever after. 'It was the best proposal I could have planned for and she is the best princess I could have asked to be mine forever. 'I know our love story's ending will be so much more than happily ever after.' The pair became engaged in May 2014.","Brian Davis proposed to his girlfriend Michelle Sequin in May .

"A fiancé faked his own death by telephoning his partner and pretending to be his father breaking the bad news - so he could get out of his approaching wedding day, it was revealed today. Bride-to-be Alex Lanchester, 23, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, received a phone call just months before her wedding claiming that Tucker Blandford, also 23, of Stamford, Connecticut, had died in a car accident. She then rang the American’s parents to offer her condolences, but they told her he was alive and well - and Miss Lanchester quickly learned he had faked his death to avoid the wedding. Couple: Alex Lanchester met Tucker Blandford while studying abroad at the University of Connecticut . She said: ‘He has shattered my trust and I’m not sure I’ll ever be in a relationship again. All I ever did was love him. I’m so sick of being messed around and I’m glad to be rid of him. ‘Looking back, maybe I was naive. But I really loved him and never thought he would go to such extreme measures to dump me. I’ve cried until I felt numb but now I’m just really angry. ‘I’ll be spending our would-be wedding day making new memories without him. He’s a liar and a coward. He had put on a different voice on the phone and pretended to be his grieving father. What sort of sick person does that to his fiancé of two years? It’s sickening.’ Miss Lanchester first met Mr Blandford in August 2012 while studying abroad in the US. She took a job at the campus cinema at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, 25 miles east of Hartford, where she bumped into set painter Mr Blandford on her first day of work. Miss Lanchester said: ‘Tucker was such a gentleman and was always buying me dinner and beautiful vintage jewellery. I’d never been in love like that before. Every Sunday he would take me out for pancakes, it was so sweet. 'And to celebrate the day we got together, on the 10th of each month we would go out for a posh dinner. The worst thing was the idea that one day I would have to leave him and go back to England. The thought of that was breaking my heart.’ After spending a year together Miss Lanchester began to plan for her return to Britain - but Mr Blandford proposed. They spoke daily and began making plans to spend their life together. Miss Lanchester began to organise her dream wedding and set a date for the big day - August 15, 2014. She bought a handmade dress from eBay and picked out every detail for the occasion. She even agreed to pay for flights for Mr Blandford to fly to Britain to help with the wedding organisation and enjoy a holiday together. Miss Lanchester said: ‘I went all out even though I had hardly any money. In the weeks running up to his visit I was mad with excitement. Thinking of their future: After spending a year together Miss Lanchester began to plan for her return to Britain, but Mr Blandford proposed. They spoke daily and began making plans to spend the rest of their life together . 'A few days later when Tucker called me and said he’d booked the venue and we would be getting married on the campus where we met, I was ecstatic. I couldn’t think of a more romantic place to tie the knot.’ 'He has shattered my trust and I’m not sure I’ll ever be in a relationship again. All I ever did was love him. I’m so sick of being messed around and I’m glad to be rid of him' Alex Lanchester . Miss Lanchester rushed to get things sorted for the big day and spent £600 on photographers, invitations and bridesmaids’ dresses. But one week before Mr Blandford was due to land in Britain, she received a chilling phone call. She said: ‘I picked up my phone and there was a man saying he was Tucker’s dad. He told me Tucker had been deeply depressed and wanted to die, so had thrown himself in front of a car. ‘The man explained that they had been trying to send Tucker off to a psychiatric unit for help. But it was too late. I couldn’t breathe. It was absolutely devastating.’ Girl meets boy: Miss Lanchester rang Mr Blandford's parents to offer her condolences after his 'death', but they told her that he was alive and well - and Miss Lanchester quickly learned he had faked it . Miss Lanchester rang back after she . had calmed down a little only for Mr Blandford’s mother to tell her he . was fine and they had no idea what she was talking about. 'I’m a terrible, awful person. I know I shouldn’t have told her I was dead, but I didn’t know what else to do' Tucker Blandford . They told her Mr Blandford had made . them believe the pair had broken up when she left America. Mr Blandford - who lives in a four-bedroom house worth £650,000 - . has since admitted his deception, claiming he was 'scared'. He . told a reporter in a phone call: ‘I’m a terrible, awful person. I . know I shouldn’t have told her I was dead, but I didn’t know what else . to do. 'Alex is an amazing girl but I got . scared and wanted to get out of the relationship. It was moving . extremely fast and with us being in different countries, it was really . hard. Planning: Miss Lanchester bought a handmade dress and the wedding was due to take place last Friday . 'At the time I just felt like I couldn’t tell the truth and thought if I could just postpone everything it would be better.’ Mr Blandford's LinkedIn profile lists him as currently having three jobs - as an instructor for a painting tuition company, a designer/carpenter for a Connecticut theatre group and a freelance steel blender. It also lists his previous jobs as a lifeguard, audio-visual technician, sports coach, art gallery attendant and at a Blockbuster video store. He has also studied at Virginia Commonwealth University. His interests are said to be motoring, tattoos, art, movies, snowboarding, photography and lacrosse.","Alex Lanchester was told before wedding that Tucker Blandford had died .

"A video has revealed the gruesome step-by-step process that takes place when you die. From your bodily functions shutting down to the process of embalming to make you presentable for your funeral, all of the gruesome details are discussed. The video was created by the American Chemical Society on YouTube channel Reactions. Scroll down for video . A video by American Chemical Society explains what happens when you die. It explains the bodily functions that shut down after death. When blood stops circulating it pools in your body due to gravity (shown) your cells begin to die. This makes your body bacteria and fungi start to decompose your body . It begins: ‘Let’s say hypothetically that you were to just slump over dead in your chair right now, so what happens next?’ First, according to the narrator, your heart stops pumping so the flow of blood around your body ceases. This causes it to coagulate, forming clots and becoming thick and lumpy. It also gets pulled down by the force of gravity in a process called post-mortem hypostasis or livor mortis. ‘Without circulation your body temperature also drops and your muscles stiffen in a process known as rigor mortis,’ the narrator continues. This also stops you breathing, which means no oxygen gets to your cells. This prevents mitochondria in cells making ATP, a chemical used for many tasks, and ultimately they too die. They results in the release of enzymes such as Lysosomal enzymes, which create an environment that is very attractive to bacteria and fungi. These begin to decompose and putrify your body. ‘Before you’re buried or cremated your family may want a funeral,’ says the narrator. ‘To slow down the decomposition process and keep you looking tidy chemistry comes in handy via a process called embalming.’ ‘The embalming process happens in two steps. First, your body is going to be loaded full of conservative chemicals like formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde using a pump and your circulatory system. First your heart stomps pumping, so the flow of blood around your body stops. This causes the blood to coagulate, forming clots and becoming thick and lumping. Your muscles then stiffen in a process known as rigor mortis, which also stops you breathing and means no oxygen gets to your cells. Your cells thus too begin to die, releasing enzymes that make your body very welcoming to bacteria and fungi. These decompose and putrify your body and ultimately, within a year or so, most of the flesh on your body will have decomposed leaving just your bones behind. To stop your body decomposing this scientists can pump you full of chemicals - called embalming. This keep you presentable for about a week such as for your funeral (stock image of cemetery in Bath shown). But ultimately your body will decompose to bones in a year or so . Dissolving dead bodies to create a brown, foul-smelling syrup may sound gruesome, but that’s exactly what some people are hoping to happen to them once they pass away. The process is called alkaline hydrolysis and was developed more than two decades ago to get rid of animal carcasses. It’s a more efficient and environmentally-friendly of getting rid of dead bodies, according to scientists. Alkaline hydrolysis uses lye, 300°C heat and huge amounts of pressure to destroy bodies in big stainless-steel cylinders that look similar to pressure cookers. The process involves submerging the body in a solution of water and potassium hydroxide, which is then pressurised and heated for two-and-a-half to three hours. This leaves a green-brown tinted liquid containing amino acids, peptides, sugars and salts and soft, porous white bone remains which are easily crushed. Because of its environmental advantages, some in the funeral industry say it could someday rival burial and cremation. It also eliminates concerns about crematorium emissions, including carbon dioxide, which can be released into the air as part of the process. ‘Next all your stomach contents get sucked out and all the dark nether regions touched by the circulatory system are filled up with the same chemicals. ‘ . The embalming process allows your body to be displayed and buried without decomposing, but the process is only temporary; eventually your body will again decompose, usually in a week or so. The awful smell that comes from a dead body comes from two particular chemical bioproducts, putrescine and cadaverine, which ‘smell absolutely disgusting’ according to the narrator. Other bad smelling compounds include dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl trisulfide, which both contain sulphur, that ‘reek like rotten egg and skunk.’ These bioproducts also, together with many other gases, make your body extremely bloated as the decomposition process continues. Ultimately, within a year, most of the flesh on your body will have decomposed - and in 40 to 50 years your bones will be dry and brittle, but can last for hundreds of years. One common misconception, though, is also that hair and fingernails continue growing after death. As explained in the video this is not the case, but rather it just seems this way because skin contracts when it is dehydrated, making them seem to grow. ‘So hopefully now you’ve got a good sense of what happens when you can sense no more,’ the video concludes.","Video by American Chemical Society explains what happens when you die .

"It's rare that your WiFi's actual speed lives up to the number on your router's box - but that could be about to change if Samsung has its way. The South Korean company has developed a 60 GHz WiFi technology that it claims can send data five times faster than other electronics devices. This will allow data transmission speeds of up to 575 megabytes (MB) per second – enough to transfer a 1GB movie between devices in less than three seconds. Scroll down for video . Samsung has developed a 60 GHz WiFi technology that it claims can send data five times faster than other electronics devices. This will allow data transmission speeds of up to 575 megabytes (MB) per second – enough to transfer a 1GB movie between devices in less than three seconds . It also means that an uncompressed high-definition videos can be streamed from mobile devices to a television in real-time. 'Unlike the existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi technologies, Samsung's 802.11ad standard 60 GHz Wi-Fi technology maintains maximum speed by eliminating co-channel interference, regardless of the number of devices using the same network,' according to Samsung's announcement. The group says previous attempts to use the 60GHz band for WiFi have failed because they used millimetre waves that travel by line-of-sight. They have weak penetration properties, which means they often lose signal and data performance when they hit obstacles such as walls. Using something known as a 'wide-coverage beam-forming antennae', Samsung says it has solved the speed issues that come with millimetre waves. Samsung has revealed it has been working on a consumer virtual realtiy headset . Samsung is working with virtual reality firm, Oculus Rift,  to develop a consumer VR headset. Called the Samsung Gear VR, users slip a Note 3 tablet into the headset to provide the screen. The firm says it will start selling the headset to 'innovators' this year. 'Powered by Oculus technology, the Samsung Gear VR delivers a completely new way to experience and consume mobile content,' Samsung said. It is believed Samsung provided the hardware, while Oculus provided the software. It's consumer headset, called the rift, is not expected to go on sale to the public until next year. The firm has also partnered with several game development firms to develop content for the gadget. The headset, in development under the name 'Project Morpheus', is designed toproject images that shift along with the movements of a gamer'shead. The group hopes to commercialise its 60 GHz WiFi technology as early as next year, in audio-visual systems, medical devices and mobile phones. The technology is also likely to be key to the 'Samsung Smart Home' -  a vision of living in which home appliances are connected to the internet and controlled remotely. Last week, Samsung said its quarterly operating profit had fallen 60 per cent because of poor smartphone sales. It also announced a 15.6 trillion won ($14.5 billion or £9 billion) investment to build a plant in South Korea that would produce semiconductor chips.

"A nine-year-old schoolboy has become one of the world's youngest grooms for the second time - marrying his 62-year-old wife again. Looking a little taller in last year's silver tuxedo, baby faced Saneie Masilela clutched the hand of Helen Shabangu as they repeated their vows one year on. The second marriage ceremony was this time held at the home of the blushing bride in Ximhungwe in Mpumalanga, South Africa, in front of around 100 guests. Scroll down for video . Nine-year-old schoolboy, Saneie Masilela  and his 62-year-old bride Helen Shabangu, wore traditional attire as they renewed their wedding vows in South Africa . The duo first married one year ago, but they decided to follow through with South African traditions which involves a second ceremony to make the marriage official . Wide-eyed residents looked on as the married mother-of-five shared a piece of cake, a toast and even a kiss with her young groom Sanele - and long-term husband Alfred Shabangu, 66. Last year the boy, from nearby Tshwane, tied the knot with bride Helen after claiming he had been told by his dead ancestors to wed. Shockingly his family took the message from the heavens seriously and hurriedly forked out £500 for the bride and a further £1,000 for the big day. But little Sanele -the youngest of five children - wouldn't rest until the couple followed through with South African traditions insisting they have the second ceremony to make their marriage official. Despite stunned villagers branding the act 'sickening' the boy's family defended the union saying it was just a ritual and not legally binding. Last year the bride and groom tied the knot after Saneie claimed he had been told by his dead ancestors to wed and his family took the message from the heavens  very seriously . Helen's husband of 30 years, Alfred Shabangu, 66, (right) and their five children, aged between 38 and 28, all attended the ceremony . Alfred said that he and his childrne were happy about the marriage: 'we don't have a problem with her marrying the boy - and I don't care what other people say' Sanele's 47-year-old mum, Patience Masilela said: 'Sanele was fine and he was happy about the ceremony last year and it what he wanted - he was not shy.' 'He was just happy to get married, very excited and was not embarrassed about it. So much so he wanted to do it again. 'After the wedding last year people keep asking them question like will they live together, sleep together, have babies but I keep telling them that after the wedding everything went back to normal nothing changed. 'Sanele moved to Venda not long after the wedding because he wanted to learn a new language, but they are very close. Sanele's 47-year-old mum, Patience Masilela, insists that the marriage is simply symbolic and not legally binding and that her son is very happy about the arrangement . The young groom said he hoped to have a proper wedding to a woman his own age when he was older . 'Our families are very close. It was nice celebrate with a wedding once more, it was after all a calling from the ancestors. 'By doing this we made the ancestors happy. If we hadn't done what my son had asked then something bad would have happened in the family.' The widow, who works at a recycling centre, added : 'I didn't have a problem with it because I know it's what the ancestors wanted and it would make them happy.' Young groom Sanele said he hoped he would have a proper wedding to a woman his own age when he was older. 'I told my mother that I wanted to get married because I really did want to,' he said. 'I'm happy that I married Helen - but I will go to school and study hard. When I'm older I will marry a lady my own age. Sanele and his bride did not sign a marriage certificate and do not have to live together. Both have gone back to their normal lives . The groom's mother (right) strongly believes that the duos' unity is a necessity and a 'calling from the ancestors', saying: 'If we hadn't done what my son had asked then something bad would have happened in the family' 'I chose Helen because I love her and although we don't live together all the time we meet at the dumping site where my mother works regularly.' Old enough to be his grandmother, bride Helen, whose children are aged between 38 and 28, yesterday said she was still happy with the arrangement. The recycling worker- who donned the same dress - said: 'I'm very happy that the boy chose me and my family support and understand that it is part of making ancestors happy. 'One day Sanele would grow normally and have family of his own and get married one day, all this ceremony is for making ancestors happy. We are playing.' Sanele and his bride did not sign a marriage certificate and do not have to live together. Both have gone back to their normal lives. Helen's husband of 30 years and builder Alfred, attended both wedding ceremonies along with the couples five children. The 67-year-old added: 'My kids and I are happy because we don't have a problem with her marrying the boy - and I don't care what other people say.'","Saneie Masilela from South Africa, repeated his vows alongside his wife in a traditional second ceremony to make their marriage official .

"Booking a holiday when you cannot afford it and driving with a near-empty tank of petrol are the two best ways to live life on the edge, research has shown. Driving through a red light, buying something frivalous which will take you into your overdraft and crossing the road when the red man is showing are also considered as some of the top 'edgy' things to do. The study, which surveyed 2,000 people, also found that having an alcoholic drink at lunchtime, getting changed without closing the curtains and driving against the arrows in a car park were seen as daring.

"Grief: Steven Rudderham's parents Dave and Carol Matthews say their son was driven to suicide after he was accused of being a paedophile on Facebook . The grieving family of a man found hanged in a cemetery claim he was driven to suicide following paedophile accusations on Facebook. Steven Rudderham, 48, was traumatised when his name, address and photograph were published online, along with a message calling him a 'dirty perv' and claiming he was a paedophile. Within 15 minutes, the message had been shared hundreds of times and the bricklayer from Hull, East Yorkshire, began receiving death threats on Facebook, an inquest heard. He was found hanged in the city's Hessle cemetery three days later. Mr Rudderham's daughter Bethany Beaumont, 19, said: 'They've destroyed an innocent life for no reason. 'It was disgusting. It was slander.' His mother Carol Matthews said: 'I want to know why someone did something like that. I hope they rot in hell. It took a person's life. We will never get over it.' Police have confirmed they are . considering an investigation into the Facebook posts in the days leading . up to Mr Rudderham's death. A Humberside Police spokeswoman said no one had made any allegations of a sexual nature against him. Yesterday's inquest heard Mr Rudderham was working towards examinations as a building site manager before the internet accusations. He normally saw Ms Beaumont every day and she realised immediately the profound effect the paedophile accusations had on him. She said: 'He just couldn't believe it. He was just looking at the wall and he wouldn't eat. It was like someone had ripped his life apart.' Mr Rudderham was afraid of walking the streets in case he was spotted and decided to stay with his daughter to prevent him being targeted at his home. Distraught: Mr Rudderham's daughter says her father was devastated by the accusations . Ms Beaumont told the Hull inquest even people who had known her father for years joined in the cyber bullying. She said: 'There were people who had known him for years commenting on it, he was so upset. I had never seen him like that. 'He stayed at my house that night because of what the comments were saying, about people coming to his house and smashing it up.' On Saturday, January 26, his body was found by a member of the public. The Hull-based inquest recorded a verdict of suicide . Police were called at about 2pm but Mr Rudderham was pronounced dead at the scene. A memory stick was recovered on his body and police have also seized a computer hard drive. Mr Rudderham had discussed giving police a memory stick with evidence about the accusations on it in the days before his death. Mr Rudderham's mother was told of her son's death on her birthday and puts the blame solely on her son's Facebook accusers. She said: 'I went berserk when I found out what had happened, he didn't want to stay in his house because he was frightened.' Mr Rudderham's family say he served time in HMP Hull in 2010 for fighting but had no convictions for sex offences. Dr Latifu Sanni was also told about the paedophile accusations made against Mr Rudderham before he carried out the post-mortem. The inquest heard there had been no evidence of medical depression in the months before his death. No drugs and no significant amounts of alcohol were found by a post-mortem. The inquest was attended by his family, including his mother and stepfather David Matthews, his sister Lisa Elm and daughters Bethany, Anna and Danielle Beaumont. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Paul Marks said: 'The medical cause of death was hanging. 'He was actively pursuing a qualification to improve his status and job prospects. In the last few days of his life, he received a pejorative message on a social networking site which greatly troubled him.'

"Paedophile: Loren Morris, 21, was sentenced to prison after a court found that she had slept with a child 50 times . A female paedophile has been jailed for having sex with an eight-year-old boy more than fifty times. Loren Morris, 21, was 16 when she first slept with the schoolboy, who cannot be identified, and continued until he was ten years old. Morris, who has a child of her own, would have regular intercourse with the boy, now 14, and was only found out after he was overheard bragging about it at school. A judge today gave Morris a two-year prison sentence at Worcester Crown Court, following a trial last month where she was convicted of three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 16. She could be seen smiling and smoking outside the court today as she awaited her sentence. The judge in the case told Morris that he would be lenient with the sentence - which will see her released from jail after one year - because she 'realised it was wrong' and stopped having sex with the boy. West Mercia police said they started investigating Morris in March last year after the . boy's school told them that he had been heard bragging about having sex with her. Judge Robert Juckes QC said: 'I make no secret of the fact your case has given me cause for much consideration. 'I have come to the conclusion that due to the concern and embarrassment caused to both you and your family that you will not be offending again, let alone committing sexual offences. 'I am also aware of the effect this will have on your baby. I am pleased to hear your parents have started to build bridges with you. 'That does not stop the fact though that you had full sexual intercourse with a child when he was eight to 10 years old - by his evidence it was upwards of fifty times. 'It seems to me that I am bound to pass an immediate custodial sentence. I take into account what has been said to me and the fact that you stopped the activity yourself. 'You realised it was wrong rather than being caught and forced to stop. Therefore my sentence is one of two years. You will serve 12 months in prison before being released on licence.' Repeated: The court heard that Morris slept with the boy, who cannot be named, more than 50 times . Defence lawyer Antonie Mullers had told the court Morris was struggling to accept the facts of the case, and asked Judge Juckes to spare her a prison sentence altogether. He said: 'Her immaturity at 21 means she cannot accept the facts yet. She accepts her conviction but with time will accept more. 'Her parents have stepped in and are building bridges, I understand she has met with some of her family. 'This could be stifled by a custodial sentence so I urge your honour or try and suspend it if possible.' Morris, from Hereford, will serve two years each for the three counts to be served concurrently. Her sentence included a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning her from contact with a child under 16 without permission of a parent. She was also ordered to sign the Sexual Offenders Register, where her details will remain for ten years.","Loren Morris, 21, started sleeping with the boy five years ago .

"Nick Clegg’S £600 million free school meals plan has suffered a blow after a Government pilot scheme showed that children who switch from ‘unhealthy’ packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier. Supporters of the initiative to give free school meals to all pupils in the first three years of primary school say fattening food in packed lunches is fuelling rising levels of obesity among children. But a two-year scheme to test the school meals initiative, in which tens of thousands of children had cooked meals instead of packed lunches, has found there was no change in their health or body mass index, a measure of a person’s healthy weight based on height and gender. Nick Clegg's proposed school meal plan suffered a blow after Government pilot scheme showed children who switch from packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier . A report for the Department for Education found that although children ate fewer of the fatty and sugary items often found in lunch boxes, such as crisps, sandwiches, sweets and fizzy drinks, they made up for it by eating more roast potatoes and chips in the cooked school meals. Moreover, children who previously had a packed lunch and a hot meal  at home in the evening were eating extra because they had two cooked meals a day. The findings were seized on by critics of the Liberal Democrat leader’s initiative unveiled at the party’s conference in Glasgow. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘This is an expensive political gimmick and it is very doubtful that it will contribute much either to the health of the children or their education. ‘The reason why it won’t have much of an . impact on obesity is that children spend a relatively small part of . their lives at school, so any obesity will be down to their whole way of . life with their families, not just those few hours in school.’ The Department of Education study into the two-year scheme, published last year, said that although nearly all primary  children in the two pilot areas – Durham and Newham in London – were eating cooked meals rather than packed lunches, there was no weight loss. The report said that though children were eating fewer packets of crisps and more vegetables at lunch they could be eating more fatty food outside school hours to compensate. The study by NatCen, a social research charity, said there was ‘no evidence that the free school meal pilot led to significant health benefits during the two-year pilot period. For example, there was no evidence of any change in children’s body mass index.’ Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, described the scheme as 'an expensive gimmick' The researchers cautioned, however, that two years could have been too short a period to see health improvements, and pointed out there were other benefits such as a boost in the pupils’ academic achievements.itch from ‘unhealthy’ packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier.

"The majority of circumcisions are performed soon after birth . Men who are circumcised are in for some bad news - it puts them at a disadvantage in the bedroom, according to experts. A study found those who've had their foreskin removed as children or adults experience less intense sexual pleasure and orgasm than their peers. 'We're not saying less sexual activity or satisfaction, but sensitivity,' senior author Dr Piet Hoebeke, from Ghent University Hospital, said. The practice is common in the U.S, with three-quarters of men having the procedure for non-religious reasons. However, it is rare in the UK, with a rate of just six per cent, according to World Health Organisation figures. Some religions, such as Judaism and Islam, consider circumcision part of religious practice. British . doctors say that although it can reduce the risk of some types of . infection the risks associated with routine circumcision outweigh any . potential benefits. The latest study surveyed 1,369 men over the age of 18, who responded to leaflets handed out in train stations across Belgium. The . men were asked whether they were circumcised, and were then asked to . rate how sensitive their penis was, how intense their orgasms were and . whether they experience any pain or numbness when they are aroused. Overall, 310 men who took the survey were circumcised, and 1,059 were not. Each rated how sensitive their penis was on a scale from 0 to five, with higher numbers being the most sensitive. For example, uncircumcised men reported an average sensitivity score of 3.72 when they or their partner stroked the head of their manhood  compared to 3.31 amongst circumcised men. 'It's a significant difference,' Hoebeke said. Uncircumcised men also reported more intense orgasms. Male circumcision prevalence in 2007: Yellow is lower than 20%, orange is 20-80% and red is higher than 80% . One possible explanation for any potential difference in sensitivity is that a man's foreskin may protect his penis's head from rubbing against underwear and clothing. It's possible, the researchers write, that friction makes the head of the penis thicker, drier and ultimately less sensitive. The researchers also found circumcised men were more likely to report more pain and numbness during arousal than uncircumcised men, which Dr Hoebeke said is likely due to scar tissue. 'I'm amazed that people report pain during sexual pleasure… that was unexpected,' he told Reuters Health. However, Dr Aaron Tobin from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who was not involved in the study, said: 'The medical evidence and the benefits of male circumcision are abundantly clear.' The American Academy of Pediatrics says the benefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks, but stops short of recommending universal circumcision.","Men who had foreskin removed reporting feeling less intense sexual pleasure .

"A Japanese judge has ordered Google to remove search results of a man's unflattering past in a new 'right to be forgotten' order following a landmark ruling in Europe. The Tokyo District Court yesterday ordered Google Japan to remove search results  that hinted at the man's relations with a criminal organisation after he complained his privacy rights were violated. Google spokesman Taj Meadows said the company has a standard process for removal requests, and people can come to Google. A Japanese judge has ordered Google to remove search results of a man's unflattering past in a new 'right to be forgotten' order following a landmark ruling in Europe in May . It is unclear whether the case would prompt further requests for information to be removed in Japan . He said: 'We remove pages from our search results when required by local law, including Japan's longstanding privacy and defamation laws.' Google was reviewing the Tokyo court decision, Mr Meadows said. It is unclear whether the case would prompt further requests for information to be removed from websites in Japan. In the court decision, Judge Nobuyuki Seki said some of the search results 'infringe personal rights,' and had harmed the plaintiff. The case comes on the back of a decision by the European Court of Justice in May that ruled Google should delete references to negative past information, including old debts and past arrests, to protect what has come to be called 'the right to be forgotten'. Google chairman Eric Schmidt; the company is said to be reviewing the injunction . While the European ruling has no baring on privacy cases in Japan it is a further blow against freedom of speech and a sign of increasing moves by the courts and legislators to allow people to censor their past. In America where Google and other Internet giants are based, the decision has no effect and experts say it is in conflict with the US constitution's first amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. Examples of its use in the UK have already included hundreds of pedophiles applying to have their criminal pasts erased online. Within a month of the ruling coming into effect, over 12,000 people across Europe used an online Google form to request information about them be deleted. More than 10 per cent of the requests came from pedophiles. At one point Google said it was getting 20 requests per minute. The difference between Europe and the US means that results are deleted from local versions of google but not google.com. One man's attempt to have his debts kept secret has led to the 'right to forget' - which now seems to be spreading around the world. Mario Costeja González battle began in 2009 when he found a Google search of his name brought up an article in a Spanish newspaper from 1998 about an auction for his foreclosed home, and a debt he had subsequently paid. He initially complained to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, which rejected his request on the grounds the information was lawful and accurate. However, it asked Google to remove it. The company then challenged the matter in the Spanish courts before a ruling was made by the European Court of Justice. The decision was widely criticised. German professor Niko Harting said:'Privacy by default will encourage politicians, celebrities and other public figures to put their lawyers on track when they find inconvenient information online.' The impact of the ruling on Freedom of Speech, was highlighted by the removal from Google search listings of a blog Robert Peston, the BBC's respected economics editor, wrote in 2007 about Stan O'Neal, the former boss of investment bank Merrill Lynch, and how he was forced out of his job after the investment bank suffered colossal losses on reckless investments it had made. In fact the removal was because one person no longer wanted a comment they had made on the blog associated with their name - emphasising that the 'right' went far beyond 'forgetting' the distant past. In May the European Court of Justice ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the internet Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17. Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data'. European citizens can submit take-down requests directly to internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress from the courts. Following the decision, thousands of pedophiles and others criminals sought to have their criminals pasts erased from the internet. All requests are considered by Google, but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest, and the company has said it will not remove links in all cases. The risk which the ruling poses to a free press and free discussion of ideas has been repeatedly highlighted, particularly by news websites, among them MailOnline. MailOnline publisher Martin Clarke said of the European Court of Justice decision: 'It is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don't like.'","The search results hinted at the man's relations with a criminal organisation .

"Flight attendants claim that using gadgets while flying (stock image) is dangerous during take-off . These days tablets and laptops can be used onboard the majority, if not the entire duration of a flight. But flight attendants are now claiming that using gadgets while flying is dangerous. However, not because of interference with avionics systems, as previously thought, but because many passengers ignore flight attendants' emergency announcements. They also warn that the devices could become dangerous projectiles in turbulent conditions. The US’ largest flight attendant union is suing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in a bid to have the ban on the use of phones and tablets during take-off and landing, brought back. The FAA has relaxed its guidelines to allow ‘any other portable electronic device that the operator of the aircraft has determined will not cause interference with the navigation or communication system of the aircraft on which it is to be used’. The Association of Flight Attendants, (CWA) which has 60,000 members, argues that by ignoring safety notices such as the location of emergency exits, passengers are putting their lives in danger. It also says that the new rules contradict others that require all items to be stowed safely during take-off and landing. Scroll down for video . The US’ largest flight attendant union is suing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in a bid to have the ban on the use of phones and tablets during take-off and landing, brought back. It claims users of the gadgets (pictured left) ignore important safety announcements by cabin crew (pictured during the World Cup) Rules vary, depending on the airline, whether people can use electronics during take-off and landing. In the US, the FAA allows smartphones 'that the operator of the aircraft has determined will not cause interference with the navigation or communication system of the aircraft on which it is to be used'. In Europe, people can use mobiles on some commercial flights - most in 'airplane mode' – and some not during take-off or landing. Much research has been conducted as to whether electronics can interfere with aircrafts' navigation and communication systems. The US' Federal Communications Commission restricts use of smartphones to prevent disruption to cell towers on the ground. A 2010 study by Boeing warns that some gadgets used in the cabin can exceed the aircraft manufacturer's permissible emission levels for safety on some avionics, but others dispute this. The union warned that the devices allow ‘more things to fly around,’ in the cabin during take-off and times of turbulence. In response, a lawyer for the government told the judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, that smartphones and tablets are no more dangerous than books, which plenty of people read during take-off. It is a year since the FAA found that personal electronic devices, including smartphones and computers, do not interfere with a plane’s navigation and communication systems, as previously thought. The relaxed rules, which depending on the airline, allow passengers to type and play games on their phones – in airplane mode - as they take off, have proved a big hit with frequent fliers. Amanda Duré, an attorney representing the union told The Wall Street Journal: ‘Essentially we want to set the reset button to the way personal electronic devices were handled prior to October 2013.’ The union is apparently happy with a deal that means devices can be turned on, but not used by passengers, during take-off and landing. The law suit was filed in December, but has only just come to light.","Flight attendants claim gadgets are a distraction during take-off .

"A Rob Horne try and Bernard Foley's subsequent conversion one minute from time gave Australia a 24-23 victory over South Africa in a rain-soaked Rugby Championship encounter in Perth. The Wallabies trailed South Africa for much of the match but a 65th-minute yellow card for Bryan Habana, in his 100th Test, swung the game in the hosts' favour and their persistence paid off as the Springboks defence finally buckled in the closing stages. The result, Australia's first win over South Africa in the Rugby Championship in four attempts, means they also have their first victory of this year's competition and will look forward to next Saturday's encounter against Argentina in the Gold Coast with renewed confidence. Left it late: Michael Hooper and Adam Ashley-Cooper celebrate Australia's dramatic victory over South Africa . Try: Cornal Hendricks runs in for the Springbok only score of the game . Battle: Australia and South Africa players compete for the ball in a brutal encounter . A fortnight to reflect on a 51-20 defeat to New Zealand in Auckland saw Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie replace Kurtley Beale with Foley at fly-half and the men in gold made a blistering start as full-back Israel Folau scored inside 90 seconds. Inside centre Matt Toomua received quick ball from the breakdown, and having stepped inside opposite number Jan Serfontein, he offloaded to Folau who gathered the low pass to dive over. Morne Steyn, also returning to the number 10 jersey in place of Handre Pollard, reduced the deficit to two points four minutes later when he kicked the first of his six penalties as the Wallabies were whistled by Irish referee George Clancy for not releasing. Cornal Hendricks put South Africa into an 8-5 lead in the 13th minute, cutting inside from the right wing to touch down after the Springboks stretched the hosts' defence with some quick passing. All over: Australia's players celebrate their win . Eyes on the prize: South Africa's Morne Steyn takes a kick at goal . Divine intervention: Hendricks celebrates his try . Pass master: Nick Phipps spins a pass out for Australia . A marauding run by outside centre Tevita Kuridrani resulted in a penalty for the Wallabies which Foley duly converted to square the match at 8-8, but South Africa were in front immediately from the restart when the Wallabies gave away a needless penalty. Steyn's second penalty of the match stretched South Africa's lead to 14-8 in the 25th minute, before Foley narrowed the gap to three points with his second penalty of the night shortly before the half-hour mark. That proved to be the final score of the half as South Africa went into the interval with a 14-11 lead. Foley hit back with a penalty two minutes after the restart to square the match at 14-14 before a scrambling Wallabies defence was forced to concede another penalty which Steyn kicked to return the Springboks into the lead. The Stade Francais lynchpin then stretched his side's lead to 20-14 in the 49th minute after a collapsed scrum before he squeezed over his final penalty just after the hour-mark to stretch the visitors' lead to nine points. Stretching: Australian try scorer Israel Folou competes for the ball with Hendricks . Solid: Australia's Michael Hooper and South Africa's Duane Vermeulen clash in Perth . The momentum then swung back in the hosts' favour when Habana was sin-binned for a high tackle with 15 minutes left on the clock and Foley reduced South Africa's winning margin to six points with his fourth penalty with 10 minutes to go. With the clock ticking down to full time, a fine, one-handed offload from Folau found Kuridrani and he passed to Horne, who cut in from the left wing to score Australia's second try with less than two minutes to go before Foley held his nerve to slot the subsequent conversion to send the majority of those assembled in the Subiaco Oval into a frenzy.","Horne's last gasp score - followed by Bernard Foley's conversion - earned Australia a dramatic win in Perth .

"A family doctor has been struck off for secretly filming the intimate examination of hundreds of women patients using a camera hidden in his wristwatch. Dr Davinderjit Bains, 46, recorded hours of footage with the £60 spy device as he carried out ‘unnecessary and inappropriate’ inspections, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told. The abuse continued for two years until his 19-year-old lodger told police he had filmed her showering and assaulted her. Predator: Dr Davinderjit Bains, left, used his . 'spy watch' right to film himself sexually abusing female patients at . his surgery for more than two years before he was caught . When Bains was arrested at his surgery in Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, officers discovered 361 video clips filmed on the watch - some as long as 45 minutes. Around 3,000 potential victims were contacted but the exact number is thought to be ‘close to 300’ - aged between 14 and 51. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service banned Bains from practicing. The tribunal in Manchester was told that his conviction earlier this year means that his fitness to practice is impaired, and he should be struck off. In March, Bains appeared at Swindon Crown Court where he admitted 39 counts of sexual assault and voyeurism and asked for a further 65 offences to be taken into consideration. He is serving a 12 year prison sentence and is not represented at the hearing. Victims: After investigating a complaint, police found 361 high-quality images of Dr Bains abusing female patients at Tinkers Lane Surgery in Royal Wootton Bassett near Swindon, Wiltshire . The doctor was described as a ‘sexual predator’. He used an analogue timepiece - a 4GB Waterproof HD Spy Watch DVR - has . simple on and off buttons to record and can be bought online for less . than £60. Hidden in the . number six was a tiny high-definition camera, which he used to record . examinations between 2010 and 2012 that police said were ‘for his own . gratification’ and ‘could not be justified as an examination’. Detective Inspector Mark Garrett, of Wiltshire Police, holds up the hi-tech wristwatch used by the disgraced GP . Detectives tracked down the victims by matching their faces on the film with patient records. The GP, who is separated from his wife, was suspended by the General Medical Council following his arrest last year. Opening . the MPTS hearing Ben Fitzgerald for the General Medical Council said: . 'Dr Bains faces the allegation that his fitness to practise is impaired. 'He was convicted of a large number of sexual offences and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. Summarising, there were 13 counts of sexual assault on a female by penetration, 11 sexual assaults on a female, two counts of sexual activity with a female under 16, and 13 counts of voyeurism. 'Dr Bains, whilst being employed as a GP in Royal Wootten Bassett, used his position of trust and responsibility of those in his care to carry out a campaign of sexual assault and voyeurism between 2009 and 2012 on 29 different victims, all but one was his patient. 'His conduct came to light in June 2012 as a result of sexual abuse of Miss A, a lodger. 'He covertly videoed her on a number of occasions. 'She reported it to the police and as a result of the investigation unearthed evidence of a large number of sexual assaults and other victims. The police found videos on his computer taken by him which showed him performing intimate examinations between 2009 and 2012. 'The videos had been recorded using a specially constructed watch that he was using to record for his own sexual gratification.' He said the doctor had been of previous good character. He qualified in India in 1993 and came to the UK in 2003. He worked as a GP from 2007 and had been working at the Tinkers Lane Surgery in Wootten Bassett for four years at the time when he was exposed by Miss A. Disturbing: The disgraced doctor also had this watch containing a small camera . Many victims of the doctor thought his behaviour was strange but feared upsetting the delicate doctor-patient relationship. One 21-year-old victim told the Daily Mail of her horrific experience. She went to see Bains in May last year after experiencing vaginal bleeding following sex with her partner. She was offered an appointment with Bains. The surgery had no female doctors and, because of the intimate nature of the problem, she decided to take her mother with her. ‘He asked me why I was there and I explained briefly. He started asking very strange questions. My mum and I were looking at each other, a bit taken aback.’ Bains told Kate - not her real name - that he would need to examine her. ‘I had expected that,’ she said, ‘so I’d prepared myself. He asked if I wanted my mum to leave, and I said yes.’ Bains disappeared for a couple of minutes, telling Kate not to get undressed until he returned. She says: ‘I assumed it was normal procedure before a patient undressed — that maybe he was closing blinds somewhere, or locking a connecting door in case someone came in.’ When he came back, locking the door behind him, Bains told Kate to undress. He did not pull the examination bed curtain around her, close the blinds or offer her any privacy. ‘He watched me getting undressed,’ says Kate. ‘He was very quiet. I felt very uncomfortable. I was trying to pull my top down so he wouldn’t see. But I didn’t know what was normal. ‘He put some gloves on and asked me to get up onto the bed. He said he was going to do a visual examination and that if there was anything he didn’t like the look of, he’d take a sample.’ For the next 20 minutes, Bains ‘examined’ Kate, filming himself all the time. ‘It was a long, long time,’ she says. ‘but I just thought he was being thorough.’ Her mother assumed that they were talking and had not realised how long he had been intimately examining her daughter. Kate remembers that he was shaking and seemed very nervous. At the end of the consultation, Bains gave Kate the all-clear and told her to get dressed. Her mother said: ‘When she came out of the room, I commented on how long it had taken and she said she’d never felt so degraded in her life. I remember saying “Welcome to our world”, because all women have to endure that kind of thing at some point. I feel so stupid now.’","Dr Davinderjit Bains, 46, worked as a GP in Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire .

"James Milner fears he may have become a victim of his own stoicism after spending more time than he would like on the fringes for both club and country. Milner has struggled to command regular first-team football at Manchester City under manager Manuel Pellegrini and has lost a grip on his England place as a result. Typically, Milner knuckled down and fought his way back into Pellegrini’s team but has to admit there have been times when he wondered if his professionalism counted against him, making him easier to drop than more volatile team-mates. Milner (left), pictured playing for Man City against Aston Villa, has started the last four matches for his club . Despite his current form, Milner has struggled to cement a place in the first teams of both City and England . ‘There are two ways to react — a right and a wrong way,’ said Milner. ‘You can sulk and mouth off or work harder and working harder is the only way I know. ‘Maybe it counts against you if you’re not sulking or ruining training if the manager leaves you out. I’m not naming names. I’ve played with enough players for you to decide who it can be. ‘Maybe that does count against me at times. The manager knows I’ll just carry on training as hard as I can. It’s no good for the team if someone sulks or disrupts training. ‘The team comes first, whether it is England or Man City. It is no good for the team if you do alienate yourself from the group and start making things difficult.’ Milner (second left) believes that the good of the team is more important that personal performance . The 28-year-old believes his professionalism could have hindered his career for Manchester City . Milner has started City’s past four matches in the Barclays Premier League and his form has impressed but lack of action in 2014 did not help his international career in World Cup year. He won his 50th England cap in Switzerland last month and yet the 28-year-old has played only 223 minutes for the national team in 2014. The only games he started were a friendly against Ecuador, when he was used as an experimental right back, and the final group game in Brazil against Costa Rica, when the team’s fate was sealed. ‘It’s a dilemma for the England manager (Roy Hodgson),’ said Milner. ‘It’s difficult when someone’s not playing much at club level and he is seeing other people playing every week. It’s definitely frustrating but on the other hand it’s England. Milner believes that volatile teammates could be more likely to get picked ahead of someone who stays quiet . Milner made his 50th England appearance last month, but has only managed 223 minutes in the whole of 2014 . ‘I don’t think I could ever turn my back on my country and look back thinking I’d stopped, just to have a few extra days off. ‘It’s a massive honour to play for your country. I played 46 times for the Under-21s and never would have turned it down.’ Friends have jokingly tried to persuade him to shed the reputation which inspired the Twitter parody @BoringMilner, an account which was recently posting tweets about the virtues of skimmed and semi-skimmed milk. ‘People get a tag and it sticks,’ said Milner. ‘That’s the way it is. If I change my Yorkshire accent, it might change something but I’m stuck with that and proud of it. ‘At times, I do think if I was a bit lazier, just did the attacking side of the game, would people notice me more? But I play the game which is best for the team. I track back, I defend and sometimes might not have the energy to go forward because you’re doing that work. Milner is professional in his approach to the game, and thinks he plays the game which is best for the team . Manuel Pellegrini has selected Milner (right) for Manchester City's last four Premier League matches . ‘If I feel I’m not getting a fair crack of the whip I do go and see the manager. That’s the way I’ve always done it. Football is all about opinions. People who don’t rate you... I try to change their mind. ‘This is my fifth season at City and, with the trophies I’ve won, and to be there, to hold my own, I can’t be doing too badly.’ Milner has survived an exodus of English players from the Etihad Stadium — Joleon Lescott, Adam Johnson, Micah Richards and Jack Rodwell have all left the club. He is out of contract at the end of the season and in talks about a new deal. He added: ‘I seem to go through phases in my City career where at times I’ve played a lot and enjoyed it massively and there’s no place you’d rather be. It’s an amazing club, why would you want to leave? ‘Then at other times it’s a bit more frustrating when you’re not playing as much and it’s a bit more difficult.’ Milner has even taken the step of learning to speak Spanish to help him bond with signings from Spain and Argentina, as well as Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini. ‘I always wanted to learn another language,’ said Milner. ‘A few of the lads don’t speak great English, so it helps them and helps me improve, too. I don’t think you can be fluent until you live in a country but I can speak it OK.’","James Milner has struggled to cement his place in the starting eleven for both Manchester City and England over the last year .

"Attacked: Judge John Devaux had just jailed a motorist when he was apparently attacked by former fitness instructor Paul Graham in the courtroom . A judge was attacked and had his wig and robes pulled off after he jailed a motorist yesterday for causing death by dangerous driving. The driver’s brother allegedly ran up to the judge’s chair and ‘started battering the hell’ out of him while shouting that the 30-month sentence was too harsh. The man was restrained and the judge, 65-year-old John Devaux, continued to hear cases minutes after the attack. Apparently unflustered, he told the court: ‘I think we’re all unharmed.’ Paul Graham, 27, was arrested on suspicion of assault and contempt of court and held in the court cells. Witnesses said he was furious that his brother Philip had been jailed for 30 months for overtaking a car near the brow of a hill and killing a motorcyclist in a head-on crash. Jaimie Budd, who was in the public gallery at Ipswich Crown Court, said the man stripped to his vest before wrestling with the judge and hitting him at around 10.45am. She said: ‘We thought that he was going to reveal some sort of statement or tribute but instead he got up and ran to the judge’s bench. ‘He ran up the steps and started battering the hell out of the judge. He pulled his robes, his wig came off. It was extremely horrific.’ She said that the man shouted ‘arrest me’ and claimed that his brother was a victim of ‘injustice’. Two police officers in the court for the sentencing restrained the man after he left the public gallery and attacked the judge. John Weston, who was also at court, said: ‘I saw a couple of chairs had been turned over. I was grabbed on the back and told to “wait” by two security guards who rushed past me.’ Appearing before the judge in the afternoon, Paul Graham was told he would be kept in custody and be dealt with by another judge today. The brother of defendant Philip Graham, 30, pictured left, of Haverhill, Suffolk, allegedly attacked the judge who jailed his sibling for 30 months for causing the death of Derek Foster, pictured right, by dangerous driving . Judge Devaux told him: ‘It is not right that I should deal with this case.’ Graham, who was still dressed in his black vest, had blood on his left elbow and kept his eyes closed throughout the hearing. The drama unfolded shortly after . Judge Devaux sentenced employment consultant Philip Graham, 30, of . Haverhill, Suffolk, for causing a fatal head-on crash on July 4 last . year. He was driving to catch a train at . Audley End, Essex, when he pulled out to overtake a car near the brow of . a hill and hit motorcyclist  Derek Foster, 37, who was on his way to . work. The father of two,  a former soldier, died from multiple injuries. Court drama: Witnesses claim the male attacker pulled off Judge Devaux's wig and his robes at at Ipswich Crown Court, stock image pictured, earlier today . Philip Graham denied causing death by dangerous driving, but was found guilty at an earlier trial. Yesterday a former colleague of Paul . Graham, who previously worked as a fitness instructor, said: ‘He was . always quite a fiery character. He was very opinionated and always . thought that his point of view was right.’ The attack on Judge Devaux, who has . been a circuit judge since 1993, comes 12 years after a woman judge at . the Old Bailey was assaulted by a man accused of murder. Judge Ann Goddard needed five stitches after being punched repeatedly in the head by the man who had leapt from the dock. Last December, family court judges . spoke out to say they fear attacks by angry parents because of . inadequate security. They reported that a number have been attacked by . mothers and fathers, including one female judge who was seriously . injured. One judge said: ‘I have been . threatened. A very angry father stood up and shouted anti-Semitic . threats at me. Another father threw a cup of water across the courtroom. Another parent threw a book but fortunately I was too far away for it . to reach me.'

But as world leaders talked into the night, it emerged that the 12-day summit in Peru had generated more carbon dioxide than an entire African country. More than 12,500 politicians, diplomats, green activists and journalists flew to Lima for the United Nations summit, the latest in a 20-year series of annual climate meetings. Scroll down for video . Shocking: It emerged that the 12-day summit in Peru had generated more carbon dioxide than an entire African country . The talks have produced more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the UN admitted, giving the Lima summit the largest carbon footprint of any meeting in the two-decade history of the negotiations. That is more than the emissions produced by entire nations such as Malawi, Sierra Leone, Fiji or Barbados over the same 12-day period. The summit is to produce a legally-binding treaty forcing every nation in the world to reduce greenhouse gases. The talks were scheduled to have finished last night, but were expected to overrun into the weekend as the 192 nations failed to reach an agreement on crucial points. Britain alone has a team of 45 negotiators at the summit, including Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey and civil servants from three different Government departments. Jorge Alvarez, project coordinator for the UN Development Programme, said the emissions were so high because a plan to run the summit on green power went wrong. Dispute: The talks were scheduled to have finished last night, but were expected to overrun into the weekend as the 192 nations failed to reach an agreement on crucial points . UK representative: Britain alone has a team of 45 negotiators at the summit, including Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey (above) Instead the huge negotiating complex, built from scratch in the Peruvian capital, has been run on dirty diesel generators. Organisers had planned to draw power from Peru’s national grid, half of which is fed by green hydroelectric power. ‘We worked to upgrade transformers and generators but for some reason it didn’t work,’ said Mr Alvarez. Huge temporary structures were built on empty fields the size of 11 football pitches behind Peru’s army’s headquarters. Concrete was laid, plumbing installed and more than 300 buses hired to transport negotiators to the venue. Japan had donated 121 electric and hybrid vehicles for the summit – but they have been nowhere to be seen in Lima. ‘Unfortunately, most didn’t arrive,’ Mr Alvarez said, blaming shipping bureaucracy. The thousands of flights, from delegates across the world, has produced 30 per cent of the estimated total. Some 6,817 civil servants and politicians, 1,025 UN officials, 3,630 green activists and 1,060 journalists registered for the summit. The carbon emissions of the UK delegation to Lima are estimated at 220 tonnes. Mass attendace: Some 6,817 civil servants and politicians, 1,025 UN officials, 3,630 green activists and 1,060 journalists registered for the summit . Each British official attending has carbon footprint of 4.9 tonnes over the 12 days in flights and hotel rooms – it would take the average UK citizen more than seven months to produce the same amount. Mr Alvarez insisted 100 per cent of the emissions would be offset by Peruvian forestry schemes which would absorb carbon dioxide. Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Forum, a climate-sceptic think tank, said: ‘UN climate meetings are the most lucrative and most attractive perks for the tens of thousands of green bureaucrats and climate activists who are travelling around the world while telling others to curtail their carbon footprint. ‘It’s a wandering circus of champagne greens to the most outstanding beauty spots and most luxurious hotels on earth.’ Negotiators are trying to reach a global agreement on how to slow the pace of climate change, to replace the disastrous 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which was ignored by major powers including the US. Diplomats have been trying to build bridges ever since, with the aim of signing a final treaty in Paris in December 2015. They hoped to have a draft agreement in place by yesterday afternoon, with a firm roadmap expected as to how each country would commit to taking action over the coming months. But the talks stalled as nations bickering about the scope and extent of the pledges. A key hurdle is a bitter divide between rich and poor nations. US Secretary of State John Kerry called for poorer nations to step up and take responsibility for the problem . Many developing countries say the West should bear responsibility for taking more action on climate change because they industrialised earlier and have been polluting the atmosphere for longer. US Secretary of State John Kerry called for poorer nations to step up and take responsibility for the problem. ‘We simply don’t have time to sit around going back and forth about whose responsibility it is to act,’ he told the summit. ‘Pretty simple, folks - it’s everyone’s responsibility, because it’s the net amount of carbon that matters, not each country’s share.’ Britain and the US want the pledges to contain transparent details about how much each country plans to reduce their emissions. But China and Saudi Arabia rejected the call for public scrutiny – and said only Western nations should have to produce detailed information about their pledges. Mr Davey told the Mail last night: ‘It is important that we are the toughest, toughest negotiators. People need to know that when Paris concludes next year that there is a set of rules of governance structure which will force every country to adhere to them. ‘Yes we are going to play tough, because I think we have to.’ The cost of the trip to UK taxpayers is estimated to be between £300,000 and £400,000. A spokesman for the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat said: ‘The UN like many organizations and businesses use video conferencing and other communications technologies to “meet”. But no one has yet found a really credible alternative to face to face intergovernmental negotiations.’ A spokesman for the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘The size of the delegation is consistent with that in previous years. ‘Climate change is among the world’s most complex international negotiations - our delegation is an example of efficiency in engaging in such a huge and important process.’","Talks in Lima have produced more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide .

"Liam Andrews, 17, from Stockton-on-Tees, died from a brain haemorrhage caused by a sneezing fit . A teenager collapsed and died from a brain haemorrhage after having a sneezing fit. Liam Andrews, 17, had a seizure at his home in Stockton-on-Tees after sneezing six times in quick succession. His mother Suzanne, 35, rang an ambulance when he started vomiting and rolling around in pain, but he died four days later in hospital. Ms Andrews said: 'Liam came downstairs in the morning complaining of a headache and saying he had just sneezed six times in a row. 'I thought it was nothing serious at first and I told him I would get him some paracetamol but then he got poorly very quickly. 'Initially he was saying ""my head hurts, my head hurts"", then he started being sick. 'His eyes were going back and forward and he was rolling around in pain. 'He couldn’t work his hands. 'I gave him a glass of water but he threw it over himself as he was so hot. 'He was so hot I couldn’t touch him, then he started to fit. Suzanne Andrews, mother of Liam, said she was proud of her son after he had donated his organs . 'I was extremely worried, I rang an ambulance and they were here within minutes.' He was rushed to the emergency department of University Hospital of North Tees before being transferred to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Mr Andrews underwent surgery to remove a clot on his brain and spent four days in critical condition in intensive care. Liam Andrews and his brother Elliott. Liam's organs were donated helped save six lives . His mother said: 'I didn’t see him again for hours. I felt numb, shocked and empty. 'I was just watching the clock ticking. 'I could not think of anybody else but Liam. Fortunately I have a lot of friends who helped look after my other children.' Mr Andrews eventually died on his younger brother's 12th birthday last June. His mother said: 'I was shocked and devastated when he passed away. 'I never would have imagined that something as simple as a few sneezes could kill a healthy young boy. 'I couldn’t believe it, there was nothing to indicate that something like this would happen. 'I asked for a specialised post mortem and it came back that he was absolutely fine. 'It is usually more common for this kind of thing to happen in people over the age of 40, not in someone so young and fit. 'I don’t think there was anything anybody could have done to save Liam. 'It could have happened at any time or any day. 'I am just thankful that I was there to try and help and he wasn’t by himself.' Since his death, Liam’s heart, liver, pancreas and kidneys have been donated to help save the lives of six other people. Ms Andrews, whose other children are Amy, 17, Elliott, 12, Erin, nine, Lewis, three, and Evie, one, said: 'Of course I am amazingly proud of Liam for making the decision to become an organ donor. 'Just six months before his death Liam was telling me you should be prepared to donate organs if you are willing to receive, then six months later we were fulfilling his wishes. Mr Andrews' family - Elliott, Lewis, Suzanne with Evie, Erin and Amy - donated funds raised at his funeral to a Down's syndrome charity . 'Liam was very sensitive and loving, he was a real character. 'I could have mature conversations with him but he was still young and liked to get himself into mischief. 'I would never have swapped him for the world.' At his funeral, Ms Andrews asked for donations to the Education Centre for Children with Down's syndrome (ECCDS) - a charity which helps his Elliott, who has Down’s syndrome. The collection raised more than £500 and the charity paid tribute to Mr Andrews by presenting a series of prizes in his honour at its annual World Down's Syndrome Awareness Day celebration. Because of the violent nature of a sneeze and the strain it puts on the human body, people can die from a sneeze that triggers a pre-existing condition - such as a blood clot or a fracture. However, they can also die from the pressure that builds up in the brain, with no pre-existing conditions, although these cases are incredibly rare. One of the only other documented cases happened when a Cornwall father died in 2009 from haemorrhage and a heart attack caused by a violent and heavy sneeze. His sneeze caused a subdural haematoma  - trauma to the brain, but doctors detected no fractures or trauma caused the sneeze to be worse.","Liam Andrews, 17, from Stockton-on-Tees, sneezed six times in a row .

"A disturbed young man has shocked North America after he tried to kill himself by setting his room on fire while 200 people watched on an online messageboard. The 20-year-old, who identified himself only as 'Stephen', announced on the anonymous 4chan website that he intended to commit suicide and broadcast the event for others to see. Disturbingly, scores of online users signed up to watch the suicide attempt and helped the man to set up the video stream for the 'an hero' - online slang for suicide attempt.

Another who was frustrated at not being to watch the suicide attempt because the chat room was full wrote: 'Leave someone so we can join.' Another anonymous user wrote: 'PROVIDE PICS ROOM IS FULL DAMN IT.' As 200 viewers watched, 'Stephen' ingested pills and vodka, lit a fire with his toaster and hid under his bed . The disturbing video captured the moment firefighters pulled 'Stephen' out of the smokey room. It is not known whether he is still alive . A spokeswoman for the University of Guelph confirmed that the incident took place on campus.

"Defence chiefs fear plans for two giant wind turbines could allow enemy jets to evade radar as their own fighter plans would confuse them as threats. Officials at the Ministry of Defence say the 115ft (35-metre) towers are so big they could look like planes on monitoring equipment. The MOD say radar could classify the turbines as a threat - automatically sending in fighter jets to investigate and allowing real enemies to sneak in. A wind turbine could interfere with the Ministry of Defence radar system . They say if approved the green energy devices, in Cornwall, would confuse computer systems designed to protect the UK - and don't want them put up. Plans for the turbines have been submitted by Richard and Ian Lobb, who want to install the 50kW towers on their neighbouring farms in St Ewe, Cornwall. But their application prompted a written objection from the MoD which warned the installation would cause 'unacceptable interference' to an air traffic control (ATC) radar 30 miles away in Wembury, Devon. Radar operators have to treat any unidentified object as a genuine threat - and could even have to scramble fighter jets to investigate. Their objection said: 'Wind turbines have been shown to have detrimental effects on the performance of MoD ATC radars. Radar operators have to treat any unidentified object as a genuine threat - and could even have to scramble fighter jets to investigate the turbines . 'These effects include the desensitisation of radar in the vicinity of the turbines, and the creation of 'false' aircraft returns which air traffic controllers must treat as real. 'The desensitisation of radar could result in aircraft not being detected by the radar and therefore not presented to air traffic controllers.' MoD chiefs said controllers relied upon accurate radar readings to distinguish between military and civilian aircraft. Their letter added: 'The creation of ""false"" aircraft display on the radar leads to increased workload for both controllers and air crews and may have a significant operational impact. 'Furthermore, real aircraft returns can be obscured by the turbine's radar returns, making the tracking of conflicting, unknown aircraft much more difficult.' The wind farm proposal has also provoked opposition from locals who say the towers will be a blot on the picturesque Cornish landscape. Graham Chaplin, who owns a smallholding near the proposed site, has collected signatures of 109 villagers calling on Cornwall Council to reject the plan. He said: 'The turbine will really be right on top of us. It's so close that we are going to suffer from noise pollution. 'But what's more worrying is that there is a public safety issue with these turbines. 'The MoD clearly says that operators cannot assume that it's just the wind turbine. They have to deal with it as if it was a real problem.' Cornwall Council is due to report back on the application by May 13. A spokeswoman said the council does not comment on undecided applications.","Officials at the Ministry of Defence say .

"The most senior judge in England and Wales has rejected calls for specialist courts to deal with cases of child sexual exploitation but judges will be handpicked by a specialist panel . Sex offence trials involving vulnerable children are to be conducted by a team of specially vetted judges, the Lord Chief Justice said yesterday. The small group of highly experienced judges will also undergo ‘bespoke training’ to help protect weak and exposed child witnesses, Lord Judge said. His decision to introduce tighter restrictions on the list of judges who can run the most sensitive and potentially brutal sexual exploitation cases was sent to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee, who expressed concerns recently over the way some trials were conducted. The move follows deepening alarm at the treatment of children by lawyers and judges in cases involving paedophilia charges and alleged sex gangs. Lord Judge said the new rules will apply to the choice of judges who sit in serious sex cases in which one of the witnesses is regarded as ‘significantly vulnerable’ and is expected to give evidence ‘in circumstances that call for especially sensitive handling’. The system will also operate in cases that involve a number of defendants and are expected to go on for more than ten days. Judges in such cases are already chosen from a list of trained and experienced judiciary who are supposed to be versed in methods of stopping defence lawyers from subjecting child witnesses to ‘oppressive’ cross examination. But Lord Judge told committee . chairman Keith Vaz that while he thought the system worked ‘extremely . well’, he accepted that there were a ‘very few cases in which valid . criticisms have been made of the treatment of vulnerable witnesses’. The move is in response to concerns about how young people are cross-examined during cases . Under the new system, judges will be . on the sex case list only if they have been approved by the Presiding . Judge, who is in charge of a regional circuit of courts, and the . Resident Judge, who is the chief judge at the Crown Court involved. The Senior Presiding Judge, Lord . Justice Gross, will have final approval of ‘the limited number of judges . who are likely to be selected to try these cases’. A judge will be picked from the list for each case that qualifies. There will also be bespoke training . from the Judicial College, the body responsible for training judges and . providing guidelines on how to conduct trials. This will ‘focus . particularly on how best to conduct trials involving significantly . vulnerable witnesses, as well as addressing the undoubted difficulties . posed by multi-defendant trials’. Lord Judge also promised updated . guidelines on how to conduct trials and named three senior judges who . will try to find ways of protecting children who give evidence. Judge Peter Rook QC, who earlier this . year gave life sentences to five Oxford men who abused girls as young . as 11, will act  as mentor to judges on the sex case list. Judge Sally . Cahill QC will take part in Whitehall talks on fighting child sex abuse, . and Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot is already running a scheme . to try to ensure cases with very young witnesses come quickly to trial. But Lord Judge rejected the idea of . sending child sex trials to special courts. He said that could have . unintended consequences, including high expense and long waiting times . because of the limited numbers of courtrooms, judges and court staff. A victim was abused by a gang of Asian men from the age of 13 then had to endure a harrowing cross-examination in front of her abusers in court (picture posed by model) By Michael Seamark . She was a damaged and vulnerable teenage girl, who had been ‘passed around and used as meat’ by a gang of Asian men since she was 13 years old. Then she had to spend 12 days in the witness box, facing cross-examination from defence barrister after defence barrister, until she finally broke down. Her friend, who was also sold for sex by the men, had an even more horrifying experience, and ended up sobbing as she gave evidence. Jurors were visibly angry and dismayed at the aggressive tactics of one particular  lawyer. Another barrister walked out of court in disgust. Their appalling treatment, in a case that critics say shamed British justice, prompted yesterday’s moves to provide child victims of sex abuse with greater protection in criminal trials. The girls gave evidence in two trials, and at both they were cross-examined by barrister Mohammed Tayyab Khan. In the summer of 2011, seven men from  Telford went on trial at Stafford Crown Court accused of turning young white girls into ‘sexual commodities’, who were trafficked and sold to dozens of men. Among the defendants was Ahdel Ali, who was represented by Mr Khan. In the original trial the first girl, by now aged 18, was cross-examined by a succession of defence lawyers. Some of them challenged her evidence in a methodical way but others were far less restrained. During aggressive questioning, Leicester-based Mr Khan accused her of ‘telling lies’, giving ‘phoney evidence’ and being a ‘very dishonest girl’. He even asked her whether she repented her ‘sins’. Next the girl’s friend, now aged 19, gave evidence. Mr Khan accused her of being ‘very wicked’ and making ‘false and malicious allegations’. He then went on to question her about an incident unconnected to the men on trial.When she was 13, she had confided in her mother that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. Her mother called the police and the girl initially gave a detailed statement. But, as she explained to the jury, she withdrew it a day later because she was concerned about the impact on her mother. At times shouting at the girl, Mr Khan used it to argue that her evidence in court could not be trusted. His method was to force the sobbing teenager to read statement containing her original allegations against her stepfather out loud. The girl was distraught, jurors were shaking their heads, and concerned Judge Robin Onions asked whether it was necessary. Mr Khan said it was. After more complaints he agreed to read out lines from the statement himself, but the teenager’s distress continued. The trial eventually collapsed and was split into a series of retrials. Twelve months later, the second trial of the Crown v Ahdel Ali began at the same court with a new judge, Patrick Thomas QC, in charge. Judge Thomas made his opinion of the conduct of the original trial clear. ‘The way things went last time is just so wrong that we should all be ashamed that our justice system allowed it,’ he said. The two girls were again witnesses but Mr Khan’s questioning took a different course. Before Mr Khan cross-examined the second girl the judge warned him that he would not be allowed to repeat the distress caused at the previous trial. He rebuked the barrister when he attempted to delve into the incident involving the girl’s stepfather. The judge asked him: ‘Is it difficult for you to understand that she finds all this troublesome and embarrassing and it has nothing to do with the case?’ At the end of the second trial, Mr Khan’s 25- year old client was found guilty of rape, 11 counts of sexual activity with a child, inciting child prostitution,  inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and meeting a child after sexual grooming. Ali was jailed for 18 years. Mr Khan has said that he was doing his professional duty.","Senior judges will have to approve the trial judge for all serious sex cases .

"A woman was found guilty of culpable negligent manslaughter Friday for referring another woman to a transgendered phony nurse for illicit silicone buttocks injections that prosecutors say killed her in 2012. Natasha Stewart, of suburban Memphis, Tenn., was found guilty Friday in Jackson, Miss., in the death of 37-year-old Karima Gordon of Atlanta, who prosecutors say died at the hands of Morris Garner, who now refers to herself as Tracey Lynn Garner after gender reassignment surgeries. Ms Stewart had been charged with 'depraved-heart' murder, defined as a 'callous disregard for human life' resulting in death, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, and conspiracy to commit murder, but was found guilty of lesser charges. Guilty: Natasha Stewart, also known as Pebbelz Da Model was found guilty of culpable negligent manslaughter in the death of an Atlanta woman who received illicit silicone buttocks implants in 2012 . Jurors ultimately also convicted Ms Stewart of conspiracy to commit culpable negligent manslaughter. She faces up to 20 years in prison for each charge. A sentencing date has not yet been set. The former adult entertainer showed little emotion when the verdict was read. She was found not guilty on the charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Authorities say Stewart, also known as Pebbelz Da Model, took $200 for referring Ms Gordon to the alleged injector and falsely represented that the injector was a nurse. Miss Garner faces life in prison for her role in the scheme. Ms Gordon died only days after the silicone used in the faulty injected found its way into her lungs. Ms Stewart testified Friday that Ms Gordon was insecure about her body and wanted help fixing previously botched buttocks enhancements. Ms Stewart said she connected Ms Gordon with Miss Garner to help her out, not for money, but she said Ms Gordon insisted on paying her the finder's fee. Dead: Karima Gordon died in 2012 after receiving the faulty buttocks implants . Phony nurse: Tracey Lynn Garner, formerly known as Morris Garner, is charged injecting the silicone that eventually killed Ms Gordon . In court: Ms Stewart and co-counsel Kevin Camp listen Friday as the prosecution address the jury . Stewart also testified that she thought the woman performing the injections at a Jackson house was indeed a registered nurse and had gotten the injections herself more than 20 times over seven years. 'She told me that she was an RN,' Ms Stewart testified. Miss Garner is charged with depraved-heart murder in the deaths of Ms Gordon and another woman, Marilyn Hale of Selma, Ala. She has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is scheduled for March. Emails introduced Friday in Ms Stewart's case showed that Ms Gordon was a fan of the entertainer's and was persistent in asking for help to get buttocks injections at least as far back as 2010. The two were introduced by another woman known only as 'pebbles.' 'I won't give up my mission to ultimately achieve a tastefully great butt enhancement,' Ms Gordon wrote in one of the messages. HIs honor: Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Bill Gowan pictured Friday prior to the verdict being read . Anglean Barber, testified Thursday that she and Ms Gordon flew to New York to meet Ms Stewart in February 2012 and that the woman later referred them to Ms Garner. Ms Barber said she and Ms Gordon wanted the same kind of buttocks enhancement that Ms Stewart had gotten with hopes of becoming models in the hip-hop industry. The two women drove to Ms Garner's house in Jackson on March 16, 2012, with plans to get the injections, Ms Barber testified. Ms Barber said she was unsettled by the supposed nurse's appearance and decided not to get the injections. Her friend Ms Gordon fell ill during the car ride back to Atlanta in the hours after the procedure. The phony nurse then told Ms Gordon to take cough syrup during a phone call asking what was wrong, according to court documents. Other lethal injections: Loretta Cheek (left) and Oneal Ron Morris were also charged with murder for fatal buttocks implant injections performed without medical licenses . A doctor testified Thursday that Ms Gordon died in a Georgia hospital on March 24, 2012, of silicone embolism in her lungs. During closing arguments, Ms Stewart's attorney, Kevin Camp, said that the jury should find his client not guilty because 'nobody knew that this situation was going to cause any imminent death.' Prosecutors, however, argued that Ms Stewart charged money and lied when she told Ms Gordon that the person performing the injections was a registered nurse. The Gordon case was one of a handful that shocked the nation over the past few years. Also charged with murder were Loretta Cheek and Oneal Ron Morris, who also provided backroom cosmetic surgical procedures that killed unwitting victims.","Natasha Stewart had been charged with 'depraved heart' murder and conspiracy to commit murder .

"Tragedy: Megan White, 11, died after suddenly collapsing at school last year . A healthy 11-year-old girl suddenly collapsed at school and died just 24 hours later after suffering a rare brain haemorrhage, an inquest heard. Popular Megan White, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was 'merry and laughing' with her friends during the morning at All Saints’ Academy. She had even told her mother not to pick her up from school that afternoon as she was having dinner at a friend's house. But, just after lunch, she fell ill and was rushed to a nearby hospital where tests revealed she had suffered a small bleed on her brain. Avon Coroners’ Court heard Megan then suffered a second, larger, bleed when she was in the accident and emergency ward, causing her to lose consciousness. She underwent emergency surgery but did not recover from her brain injuries. An inquest into Megan’s death at Flax Bourton in Somerset was told the haemorrhage was 'rare', with experts unable to pinpoint what had caused it. Gail Elliman, deputy coroner for Avon, ruled Megan died from 'natural causes' following the tragedy in January last year. She said: 'Megan collapsed at school on January 13. She was taken to hospital where investigations showed a large bleed on her brain. 'She was transferred to Bristol Children’s Hospital where despite treatment, she died on January 14. I am sorry that the experts have not been able to make it any clearer as to why this happened. 'She died of natural causes.' Dr Margrid Shindler, a consultant in paediatric intensive care at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, told the inquest: 'While she was in the emergency department, she had a larger bleed which caused her to go unconscious and at that point she was put on a breathing machine. 'She was taken to Frenchay Hospital and underwent neurosurgery. After that, unfortunately she was still showing signs of a very severe brain injury. 'This bleed occurred in an area very deep inside the brain where even a small bleed can cause a large amount of damage. 'We probably see two cases like this a year, where people come in with a small bleed then the second bleed occurs. 'Mostly, despite our best efforts, we are unable to save these children. It is very, very sad - going from someone who is quite normal to such devastating injury.' 'The family very kindly consented for organ donation and we thank them very much for their kind gift.' Dr Craig Platt, who conducted a post-mortem examination, said he had consulted with other experts about what could have caused the haemorrhage. Sudden: She arrived 'merry and laughing' friends at All Saint's School in Cheltenham in the morning but fell ill shortly after lunch . 'It was clear that there had been quite a large haemorrhage which was the cause of death,' Dr Platt said. 'But I don’t think that we can say what the cause of this bleed was.' The cause of death was recorded as cerebral haemorrhage and raised inter cranial pressure. Speaking after Megan’s death in January last year, her parents Rebecca and Paul White, who attended the inquest, paid tribute to their daughter. Mrs White said her daughter was 'always smiling' and 'generous beyond belief'. 'She’d been happier than usual on the morning of Friday the 13th when she died. 'Her teachers and friends said she was merry and laughing. Just after lunch she fell poorly immediately and the ambulance came. 'It was instant and quick and the surgeons said she wouldn’t have known anything.' Mrs White added: 'Children seemed to gravitate to her. 'Megan was beautiful, but never vain - she always thought others were more beautiful.' The schoolgirl had been particularly good at maths and loved performing as she . was a 'bit of a drama queen'. All . Saints’ principal, Peter Kingham, said last year: 'Megan was a very popular . student who loved being part of All Saints’ Academy. Megan was bright . and cheerful and stood out as an excellent student.","Megan White died last year after falling ill at All Saint's Academy, Cheltenham .

"A woman with a desire to put wrongs to right . combined with the ability to keep cool in a drama.

"Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson has urged his team-mates to use their disappointment at Newcastle as extra motivation for a daunting double. The Merseysiders lost 1-0 at St James' Park on Saturday as their lack of cutting edge without the departed Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge was exposed once again. However, they have little time to lick their wounds with a Champions League trip to Real Madrid looming on Tuesday evening ahead of Saturday's visit of Premier League leaders Chelsea to Anfield. Liverpool's Jordan Henderson sees the trip to Real Madrid on Tuesday as a chance to rediscover form . Henderson told the club's official website, www.liverpoolfc.com: 'They are two big games, two games to show that we can score goals and defend better. 'We'll look forward to that still. We'll work hard during the week and put in two good performances, hopefully, against two top teams.' That, however, may be easier said than done with manager Brendan Rodgers admitting as he started to analyse an unproductive day on Tyneside that '80 per cent' of last season's goals had been taken out of his team with the absence of SAS double-act Suarez and Sturridge. Spanish striker Ayoze perez celebrates scoring the winner  as Newcastle beat Liverpool 1-0 on Saturday . Newcastle celebrate after Ayoze's goal inflicted Liverpool's fourth Premier League defeat  in ten games . Liverpool enjoyed plenty of possession at St James', particularly as midfield general Steven Gerrard worked his way gradually higher up the pitch as the game wore on. However, with Mario Balotelli static and Raheem Sterling, who spent most of his afternoon wide on the right, largely becalmed by full-back Paul Dummett, home goalkeeper Tim Krul had little of note to do. Newcastle always looked the more dangerous through the pace of Gabriel Obertan, until he tore a thigh muscle 23 minutes into the game, and then substitute Rolando Aarons, Sammy Ameobi and the marauding Moussa Sissoko. But it took them until the 73rd minute to find what proved to be the winner when substitute Ayoze Perez capitalised on Alberto Moreno's hesitation on the edge of his own six-yard box to hammer the ball past helpless keeper Simon Mignolet. Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored a 17th league goal at Granada on Saturday, will look to help defeat Liverpool . The Belgium international then pulled off a superb save with his foot to deny Remy Cabella a second, but his efforts were to count for nothing in the end. Henderson said: 'It was very disappointing. We came here for confidence and to get a result and we didn't manage to do that, so we're very disappointed. 'Throughout the game, I thought we dominated the ball but we didn't really get in behind them or create many chances. 'We had one or two through Philippe Coutinho and Martin Skrtel from the corner, but overall, we're disappointed not to get something out of the game. 'I felt as though we started the game well and we quietened the crowd down, kept the ball. But the ball wasn't the problem - we were dominating the game through possession, but it was just getting into that final third and creating an opening. Henderson talks to striker Mario Balotelli, who once again struggled to make an impact at Newcastle . 'We struggled with that, so we'll have to improve on that and kick on for the next game.' That next game - Real at the Bernabeu - could hardly be any more difficult with the Spaniards having won 3-0 on Merseyside at a canter on October 22, and clear-cut chances are likely to be even more difficult to come by. However, Henderson insists that is a collective responsibility despite the growing pressure on summer signing Balotelli. He said: 'It's down to the whole team, especially the midfielders and the attackers, to make runs in behind and create lots of options and movement and combination play as well. 'I just thought we didn't do as well as we know we can, so we'll have to improve.'","Liverpool put in a poor performance to lose 1-0 at Newcastle on Saturday .

"'Not acceptable': Theresa May fears relaxing visa rules for Chinese tourists could open the door to an influx of organised crime gangs . Theresa May has blocked plans to make it easier for Chinese tourists to get visas because she fears it would lead to a rise in organised crime, it has been revealed. The Home Secretary has warned that national security would be threatened and criminals would be brought in if checks on Chinese visitors were relaxed. A leaked letter from Mrs May's private secretary to the Prime Minister’s private secretary reveals her staunch opposition to the plans by Cabinet colleagues. According to the Daily Telegraph, the letter said: 'The proposal... is not acceptable to the Home Secretary for national security reasons. At Cabinet, the issue of asylum claims was discussed. 'We also face significant challenges with Foreign National Offenders and organised crime including drugs, money laundering, fraud, criminal finances, intellectual property, immigration and cyber crime.' Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt has raised concerns that potential tourists are being put off visiting the UK because of the expensive and difficult visa system. He is understood to be supported by the Chancellor, George Osborne, and Business Secretary, Vince Cable. But Mrs May has rejected the proposals to let Chinese tourists apply for European and British visas at the same time as she believes their checks ‘do not match the UK decision quality’. Economic boost: Official figures show that Chinese visitors typically spend an average of £1,700 per trip to the UK . She has also pointed to figures that show 400 Chinese criminals are awaiting deportation and there were 1,000 applications for asylum from Chinese citizens last year. Official figures show that Britain is losing out on the potential income generated by Chinese visitors, who typically spend £1,700 each per trip. Around 147,000 came to the UK last year compared to 1.2million who went to France. The Home Office said last night that improvements had been made to the Chinese service, including bringing in more visa officers and introducing an online application process, but declined to comment on the letter.",Leaked letter reveals Home Secretary's opposition to Cabinet proposals .
"Meet the Tiler girls - the three sisters who are turning their brute strength into weightlifting gold. As the head of the clan, 13-year-old Rebekah is quickly making a name for herself in the sport and looks set to be one to watch at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Her trophy cabinet is bulging with more than 100 medals and prizes. But it isn't just Rebekah who holds the talent. Girl power: The Tiler sisters - (L-R): Lisa, 7, Rebekah, 13, and Sophie, 9, show off their skills at their gym in Mytholmroyd . Also on the podium are Sophie, nine, and seven-year-old Lisa, who are following in their sister's footsteps and bagging their own trophies. And even their youngest sister, four-year-old Emily, is keen not to miss out and often tries her hand at the famous 'clean and jerk' move, practising with a broom handle. Rebekah's strength became apparent when she was a baby and could lift herself up off the floor, amazing her parents Chris and Emma. The summer Olympics inspired Rebekah who, having been invited to train for Team England, and as a new member of Team GB, is well on the way to Olympic glory. Head of the clan: 13-year-old Rebekah's trophy cabinet is bulging with more than 100 medals and prizes but her sisters aren't far behind her . Rebekah, from Denholme, West Yorkshire, said: 'I go to Team GB camp weekends where we are tested. 'I'll be training with them for the next four years.' But her success doesn't come without hard work. The teenager faces a daily demanding schedule and has to stick to a strict diet. She said: 'I train three times a week for two hours at a time. And I have to keep to a strict diet, with lots of protein, eggs and spinach. 'This is very important, especially when competitions approach as you have to make sure you are within your weight category.' Following in her footsteps: Sophie, nine, and Lisa, seven, who are following in their sister's footsteps are bagging their own trophies . As well as the Olympics, Rebekah is also focusing on the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in 2014 and hopes to take part in next year's European youth championships. Speaking about the sporting opportunities, she said: 'I'm really excited. My school friends think it's great and there's a noticeboard at school showing all my achievements.' Rebekah attends special camps where her speed work and reaction times are tested. 'I just find weights really easy to lift. I like clean and jerk best,' she added. Last year, Rebekah won numerous new records, including setting a new title for the snatch and clean and jerk in the 58kg class in the British under-13 contest. Focus: As well as the Olympics, Rebekah is also focusing on the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in 2014 . In September alone, the teen, who has been praised for her technique, broke an astonishing nine British records at the National Weightlifting Bergson Trophy in Myetholmroyd, including two at under-15 level set by Britain's best known female weightlifter Zoe Smith. Rebekah has now moved up to the 69kg body-weight class, and smashed 47 British and regional records, in under 14, 16, 18, 20 and senior categories. She often outclasses contestants far older than herself. In the British under-20 and under-23s category, she set new Northern Weightlifting records in her class. But Rebekah's sisters are firmly following in her footsteps and each one recently won their weight category, taking home three gold trophies. Keen sportswoman: Rebekah's weightlifting interest began when she was just a baby when she would lift herself up, amazing her parents . Keen: Four-year-old sister Emily is keen not to miss out and often tries her hand at the famous 'clean and jerk' move, practising with a broom handle . Sophie is the British schools' champion for her group. Rebekah added: 'I was about five when I started lifting weights. My dad used to bodybuild and I would copy him.' Chris, who is still involved in bodybuilding, advises his daughter, and Emma provides refreshments at competitions. Emma said: 'We are usually away every weekend. Bodybuilding has taken over our lives but we love it and really enjoy it. Family support: Mother Emma says she and her husband are 'really proud' of their daughters . 'We are really proud of Rebekah and her sisters. We get nervous but sometimes I'm shaking as I watch. 'I know Rebekah's trained and won't drop the weight but it is nervewracking.' With so many titles to her name, Rebekah's Olympic future looks hopeful. She said: 'I'm very excited about it. I really love it and I've met so many nice people too.'","Eldest sister Rebekah Tiler, 13, has more than 100 medals and trophies .

"David Cameron will have to resign if Scotland votes for independence, according to some Tories amid growing fears that the Yes campaign could win this autumn’s referendum. One senior Conservative said Mr Cameron would ‘go down in history as the Prime Minister who lost the union’ and would have no choice but to quit Downing Street. It came as Tory MPs called for a law change to block Scottish voters from taking part in the 2015 general election if they back independence later this year. Senior Tories warn David Cameron could go down in history as the Prime Minister who lost the union . Votes in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18. Recent polls have suggested that support for going it alone is rising, with the no campaign’s lead narrowing. In a major political headache, if Scotland votes for independence it will not break away officially until 2016. It means that in theory voters north of the border will still be able to take part in the 2015 general election to choose MPs for Westminster. Senior Tories now want to ban all 59 constituencies north of the border from taking part in the general election. The move would make a dramatic difference to the outcome of the election next year, wiping out a significant section of Labour's powerbase and a sizeable number of Liberal Democrats. In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP. First Minister Alex Salmond has been buoyed by polls showing a narrowing between the Yes and No campaigns . So far, there has been no decision on what would happen to Scotland's Westminster seats between parliamentary elections and March 2016, when it would become an independent nation, in the event of a yes vote this autumn. It is widely assumed that elections would continue as usual but Scottish MPs would then vacate their seats when links are severed. Tories believe it would unacceptable, however, for them to hold their seats while London and Edinburgh were negotiating the break-up of the UK . Scottish-born John Stevenson, who represents Carlisle, told The Times: ‘Why should the peoples of Northern Ireland, Wales and England have laws passed in this House by MPs who for all intents and purposes are about to be part of a foreign country?’ Downing Street insists Mr Cameron is focussed on winning the referendum to keep Scotland in the UK, so the issue will not arise. But privately many Tories believe his position will be untenable if voters back independence. A minister said: ‘It would be very difficult because he would go down in history as the Prime Minister who lost the union.’ A No 10 source said: ‘The Prime Minister is focused on making the case for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.’ A record 4.1million Scots are now registered to vote as more people sign up to take part in the independence referendum. The . figure is almost 60,000 more than in December 2012 and has been fuelled . by 16 and 17-yearolds who are not eligible to take part in General or . Scottish elections but can do so in the referendum. Around 92,000 out of a possible 120,000 young Scots have signed up. The . figures have been compiled by the Electoral Commission's 15 Scottish . electoral registration officers (EROs), following an annual canvas of . voters between October 2013 and March 2014. The . deadline to register to vote in the independence referendum is . September 2, 2014. Andy O'Neill, head of the Scotland office at the . Electoral Commission, said: 'The snapshot provided by the publication of . the electoral registers gives an indication of the hard work already . put in by electoral registration officers, but that hard work doesn't . stop now. 'The EROs will . continue to encourage as many people who are eligible to register to . take action and get themselves registered before the September 2 . deadline, in order to take part in the referendum. 'The . commission will support EROs activities by launching a public awareness . campaign in the summer, reminding people that the only way to vote at . the referendum is to be on the register.'","Narrowing of opinion polls heap pressure on David Cameron .

"A Chilean television channel has come under fire after a broadcasting the moment when a teenage boy was shot dead by police. The 16-year-old boy had stolen a car in San Bernardo, south Chile, and a policeman on motorcycle chased him down the road and shot him.

Police officials have defended the fatal shooting, saying the teenager had already run over and injured one person, and was threatening to cause further injury and therefore needed to be stopped. Defending the officer on the motorcycle who fired the killing shots, they added that there was no way of knowing the boy was just 16. The teenager had earlier stolen the car and was being chased by police officers on motorbikes when he became stuck in a traffic jam. When the young man saw the armed officers tried to break through the glass of the car, he had smashed the vehicles in front of him out of the way running over another rider and continuing on his wrecking spree. A police spokesman said: 'As a result of the threat to other drivers, the police officer decided to use his gun to eliminate the threat.'

"A 10-year-old boy needed extensive plastic surgery after being left with horrific facial injuries when a jet ski crashed into his head. Daniel Clamens was enjoying a banana boat ride with his friend on Al Mamzar boat beach in Dubai when the pair were thrown into the sea. The jet ski, which was allegedly being ridden by an off-duty policeman, crashed into the child's face before continuing its journey. Struck: Daniel Clamens, aged 10 at the time of the incident, was struck in the face by a jet ski after falling into the water on Dubai's Al Mamzar beach, pictured, in 2011 . Arrests: Sharjah Police arrested a 23-year-old Emirati policeman from Dubai and his cousin with a jet ski attached to their Nissan Patrol - they have been charged with mistakenly injuring the child (stock image) The child, who was aged 10 when the incident occurred in June 2011, was left with a 15cm scar across his head and fractures to his cheek and eye socket. Daniel was only saved when his 13-year-old neighbour Peter, who he was on the boat ride with, turned him over and dragged him back to the boat. A family friend, known as JP, who was driving the boat then lifted the heavily bleeding child out of the water before calling an ambulance. The jet ski rider is understood to have sped off, before briefly returning. JP said: 'He raised his hands and covered his face in a . gesture indicating that a grave mishap had happened.' The jet skier then left once more before the ambulance arrived. Daniel was in Dubai with his father Roberto, a commercial pilot, older brother Bryan and his mother. Sharjah Police arrested a . 23-year-old Emirati policeman from Dubai and his cousin as they headed . towards the emirate with a jet ski attached to their Nissan Patrol. Injuries: The child was rushed to Rashid Hospital's  Intensive Care Unit after the incident, in which he was left with a 15cm scar across his head and fractures to his cheek and eye socket . They were both charged with . mistakenly injuring the child and with violating regulations governing . sea vessels by not registering the jet ski. After the incident, Daniel was rushed to Rashid Hospital's Intensive Care Unit . where the wound on the left side of his face was treated and a metal plate was inserted into his face. After surgery he was unable to close his left eye and could only open his mouth minimally. He was flown back to the US where he was treated at Miami Children's Hospital. Surgeons performed five procedures on the child, including the repositioning of his eye and the removal of the implant fitted in the previous surgery. Doctors told the family that one of the bones had been misplaced and the previous reconstruction had been incorrect. The . policeman denied the charges during prosecution interrogations, claiming he had not entered Dubai waters. 'I'm only guilty for violating . regulations regarding the jet ski,' he said, according to . prosecution records. 'When my cousin and I were in the sea, we reached . the Dubai side and saw many coastguard patrols. I thought the shore must . have been shutdown for some reason and told my cousin we should return . to Sharjah waters.' The policeman was not present at a court . hearing on January 7 this year, though . his cousin arrived with a lawyer. The case has been adjourned until January 28.

"The Department of Defense awarded a contract on Wednesday to a Connecticut company that will build a fleet of helicopters to replace the Marine One fleet that ferries U.S. presidents short distances. The contract, given to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, will cost an initial $1,244,677,064 'for the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the Presidential Helicopter Replacement program.' For that price the U.S. Navy will get six test aircraft and all the necessary research & development. The Pentagon made a similar attempt to replace the aging fleet of Sikorsky choppers, spending $3.2 billion on a landing pad to nowhere. Adding in the likely $17 billion price tag for the new project – a number estimated by the Congressional Budget Office – the $20 billion total makes the fleet the most expensive helicopters ever built. Marine One-to-be: An artist's rendering shows what Sikorsky's proposed 'VXX' presidential helicopter might look like . Seeing double? If the current fleet of presidential choppers looks a lot like the new one, it's because the same company will build them, and it was the only firm to bid on the project . The CBO reports that the projected cost also 'does not include costs to keep the 19 existing presidential helicopters in operation until they are replaced by new helicopters.' During a White House fiscal responsibility summit a month after President Barack Obama took office, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain mocked the boondoggle helicopter upgrade project that was later shelved. 'Your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One,' McCain said. 'I don't think there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.' Obama replied that he had asked then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates for a 'thorough review of the helicopter situation,' and joked that he didn't see the project as very important. 'The helicopter I have seems perfectly adequate to me,' he told lawmakers in the room. 'Of course, I've never had a helicopter before. Maybe I've been deprived and I didn't know it.' The Daily Beast reported Friday that the 23 or more new choppers based on the Sikorsky S-92 medium helicopter will be delivered, but not until 2022. That means Obama, whose administration has green-lighted the expense, will likely never ride in the shiny new aircraft. The aircraft will meet exacting standards, including the capability for encrypted communications and secure videoconferencing with people on the ground. They must also have systems that can defend against missile attacks, and shielding to guard electronic components against energy waves produced by nuclear explosions. Not exactly bullet-proof: President Dwight Eisenhower was the first to use a helicopter to travel to and from the White House, using this Bell UH-13J Sioux until Sikorsky could deliver a specially designed replacement . All-weather beast with built-in snow blower: Marine One took off in the snow in March with President Obama aboard, en route to Andrews Air Force base . The challenge has proven daunting, even for the most experienced military contractors. According to the U.S. Naval Institute, . Sikorsky was the only company to bid on the project, raising questions . about whether or not the military is paying a fair market price. A former senior Pentagon official told MailOnline on background that the Department of Defense tried to . encourage other aircraft manufacturers to compete for the award, but . none were interested. He joked that for what the military is paying, 'Marine One should be able to have a solid gold toilet for the president – except that it would add too much weight.' The need for 23 choppers to serve one president can be explained by the minimum of two decoys – and as many as five – that fly to Andrews Air Force Base whenever he hops from the White House to a waiting Air Force One. And whenever Obama travels, duplicate helicopters are flown on cargo planes in advance, so one can be fueled and waiting when the plane touches down.","The tab for a new helicopter fleet will likely top $20 billion, including $3 billion spent between 2005 and 2009 on a program that was later canceled .

"Capitulation: Boehner called the decision a 'disappointing moment', it sets aside a difficult and divisive issue through the 2014 congressional elections in November and clears the way for Republicans to focus their campaign efforts on the rocky launch of Obama's health care reform law . The GOP-controlled House has backed away from a battle over the government's debt cap and passed a measure extending Treasury's borrowing authority with overwhelming support from President Barack Obama's Democratic allies. The 221-201 vote came hours after Speaker John Boehner announced that his fractured party would relent and not seek to add other items to the must-pass legislation. Twenty-eight Republicans voted yes. The bill would permit Treasury to borrow normally for another 13 months and would diffuse the chance of a debt crisis well past the November elections. Just Monday, Republicans suggested pairing the debt measure with legislation to roll back a recent cut in the inflation adjustment of pension benefits for working age military retirees. Unwilling to risk spooking the markets, and leading a fractured GOP majority, House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday stepped back from a confrontation with Democrats to let Congress vote on increasing the government's borrowing cap without trying to extract any concessions from the White House. The move risks more displeasure from the tea party but came after most Republicans in the House made clear they had no taste for another high-stakes fight with President Barack Obama over the nation's debt ceiling, which must be raised so the government can borrow money to pay all of its bills. Victory: President Barack Obama spent today with French President Francois Hollande but he secured an important political victory over Republicans today as they backed away without a fight on the debt ceiling . Walking away without a fight: Caving into President Barack Obama's demands for a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase, Republicans in the House of Representatives agreed on Tuesday to advance legislation that extends U.S. borrowing authority for a year with no strings attached . The vote comes four months after Washington diffused a government shutdown and debt crisis that burned Republicans politically - an experience they did not want to repeat. Tuesday's developments, which many Capitol Hill insiders saw coming, marks a major reversal of the GOP's strategy of trying to use the debt limit to force spending cuts or other concessions on Obama. The president yielded to such demands in 2011 - before his re-election - but has since boxed in Republicans by refusing to negotiate. Boehner, made the announcement after conservatives failed to rally around his latest plan, floated Monday, to tie lifting the debt ceiling to a measure to reverse cuts to military pensions that were enacted less than two months ago. Earlier plans to tie a debt cap increase to approval of the Keystone XL pipeline or repeal of part of the new health care law failed as well, stymied by a group of hard line conservatives who vowed never to vote for increasing the government's debt, which stands at more than $17 trillion. President Barack Obama hosts a state visit by French President Francois Hollande today - while over at The Capitol Democrats celebrated their decisive victory over the Republicans . The measure does not raise the debt limit by a set amount but would suspend it through March 15 of next year to allow Treasury to borrow the money it needs to pay bills like Social Security benefits, payments on government debt, and checks for federal workers. The move reflects a return to the old ways of handling the politically tricky debt ceiling vote in which the president's party is expected to carry most of the load to pass it. 'We'll let the Democrats put the votes up,' the speaker said. 'We'll put a minimum number of (GOP) votes up to get it passed.' 'That's how it's supposed to work,' said Vice President Joe Biden at the Capitol after swearing in the newest senator, John Walsh, D-Mont. Boehner said his inability to assemble 218 GOP votes - enough to win a floor vote - for any debt limit plan left him no alternative but to turn to Democrats. Winners: Senator Charles Schumer, the Democratic Policy Committee chairman, (left), and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, arrive for a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on Thursday last week, where they told  reporters that Republicans were preparing to battle attempts to raise the debt ceiling. In the end the Republicans gave in and voted for the ceiling to be raised . Unfounded fears: (from left), Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Democratic Policy Committee chairman, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., chair of the Senate Budget Committee, tell reporters last week that Republicans are thwarting Democratic efforts pass a bill to extend unemployment benefits . 'When you don't have 218 votes, you have nothing,' Boehner said. 'We've seen that before and we see it again.' He said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., promised him sweeping Democratic support in the vote. More than 180 Democrats have signed a letter pledging to vote for a clean increase in the debt cap. The White House applauded the move. Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said the administration hopes Tuesday's development means 'that the tactic of threatening default or threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for budget debates is over, off the table and never is going to happen again. And if so that would, I think, be a boost for confidence and investment in the US.' Obama's refusal to negotiate, GOP disunity, and Boehner's determination to avoid the possibility of a market-cratering default on U.S. obligations gave the Ohio Republican little choice but to announce the vote on a 'clean' debt ceiling increase. 'It's disappointing but we have an intractable White House,' said Rep. Doug LaMalfa, D-Calif. 'This is a hard deal for us but it's also important that we keep the country operating and the financial markets stable, so this is the thing we have to take until somehow there's a change in attitude in the Senate or the White House or a change of occupancy of the Senate or the White House.'

New day: Morning breaks over the U.S. Capitol as the federal government reopens after a 16-day shutdown, in Washington, October 17, 2013 . The announcement amounted to resigned defeat for a party that has sought to use must-pass debt ceiling measures as leverage to force spending cuts on Democrats. Republicans won more than $2 trillion in spending cuts in a 2011 showdown, but gave Obama two debt limit increases last year with only modest add-ons. 'The Democrats got burned when we negotiated and that led to the sequester, and we learned our lesson,' said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt. 'And the Republicans got burned when they shut the government down.' The House voted 326-90 Tuesday on separate legislation to restore full cost-of-living increases that were to have been cut by 1 percent for retirees under 62. The cuts, which had just passed in December, were backed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Repealing them would cost $7 billion over the coming decade, the Congressional Budget Office said Monday. The reduction sparked an uproar among advocates for veterans, and lawmakers in both parties are scrambling to repeal it.","Republicans caved into President Obama's demands for a 'clean' debt ceiling increase .

"Tragic: The devastated mother of nine-year-old Aaron Dugmore uploaded the last photo she ever took of her son to Facebook after she sound him hanged at their Birmingham home . A boy of nine who was found hanged is believed to have killed himself after he was ‘bullied for being white’ by an Asian gang at school. Aaron Dugmore – thought to be one of the youngest children in the UK to commit suicide – was discovered in his bedroom after being tormented for months, his parents said. They said Aaron was threatened with a plastic knife by one Asian pupil, who warned him: ‘Next time it will be a real one.’ He was also allegedly told by another pupil that ‘all the white people should be dead’ and he was forced to hide from the bullies in the playground at lunchtime. Aaron’s mother, Kelly-Marie Dugmore, 30, and stepfather Paul Jones, 43, said that despite complaints to the school, nothing was done to stop the bullying. Aaron had recently started in Year Five at Erdington Hall Primary School in Birmingham, a school where 75 per cent of pupils come from ethnic minority backgrounds. According to staff at the school he had already ‘settled in quickly’ with his classmates after he joined the school last September when his family moved nearby. The school, which caters for 450 pupils aged three to 11, received an ‘inadequate’ rating by Ofsted inspectors last year. 'It's better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all': The message written by Aaron Dugmore's mother Kelly on her Facebook page . Aaron was discovered by Miss Dugmore . hanged in his bedroom at the family home in the Erdington district of . Birmingham at about 6pm on February 11. He was taken to Birmingham Children’s . Hospital where doctors desperately attempted to revive him but he died . the  following day from a suspected cardiac arrest. 'Gone but not forgotten': Friends and family paid tribute to the young schoolboy . His mother said she was convinced the taunts led to her son killing himself. ‘Aaron got on with all the children at . his last school, and for him to have been bullied because of the colour . of his skin makes me feel sick to my stomach,’ she said. Mr Jones said that from Aaron’s first day of joining the school he had noticed a change in him. ‘He became argumentative with his brothers and sisters, which wasn’t like him at all,’ he added. ‘Eventually he told us that he was . being bullied by a group of Asian children at school and had to hide . from them in the playground at lunchtime.’ His mother claimed she went to see the . head teacher of the school several times only to be told: ‘You didn’t . have to come to this school, you chose to come here.’ A neighbour of the . boy’s grandmother  earlier told how ‘he had been targeted by a gang of . older bullies at the school’. She said: ‘They made fun of him because he was the new kid but no one really thought it was any more than playground stuff.’ An inquest was opened at Birmingham Coroner’s Court last week but was adjourned to a date to be fixed.

"The world’s first test-tube burger will be served in London next week. It is made from meat grown in a laboratory, rather than cattle raised in pastures. And its developers hope it will show how the soaring global demand for protein can be met without the need for vast herds of cattle. The 5oz ‘Frankenburger’, which cost £250,000 to produce, is made from 3,000 tiny strips of meat grown from the stem cells of a cow. The raw meat is said to be grey with a slippery texture similar to squid or scallop. World first: One lucky person will be able to try the first test tube burger, but it cost £250,000 . It has been created by Professor Mark Post, from the University of Maastricht in Holland. His research has been funded by an anonymous businessman – who may be the first to try the burger. He told The Independent on Sunday: 'Right now, we are using 70 per cent of all our agricultural capacity to grow meat through livestock. You are going to need alternatives. If we don’t do anything meat will become a luxury food and will become very expensive.’ A four-step technique is used to turn stem cells from animal flesh into a burger. First, the stem cells are stripped from the cow’s muscle. Next, they are incubated in a nutrient broth until they multiply many times over, creating a sticky tissue with the consistency of an undercooked egg. This ‘wasted muscle’ is then bulked up through the laboratory equivalent of exercise - it is anchored to Velcro and stretched. Finally, 3,000 strips of the lab-grown meat are minced, and, along with 200 pieces of lab-grown animal fat, formed into a burger. The process is still lengthy, as well as expensive, but it could take just six weeks from stem cell to supermarket shelf. Time: Once optimised, Professor Mark Post's method could mean that the time from stem cell to supermarket shelf could be reduced to six weeks . Biology: Dutch scientist Mark Post with samples of in-vitro meat, or cultured meat grown in a laboratory, at the University of Maastricht . His work is funded by the Dutch . government, as well as an anonymous donation of 300,000 euros - but it . remains to be seen, however, whether the pioneering development will . find favour with a public that likes to think of its chops, steaks and . sausages as having their roots in nature, rather than in test-tubes. He first attempts involved mouse . burgers. He then tried to grow pork in a dish, producing strips with the . rubbery texture of squid or scallops, before settling on beef. His burger consists of about 20,000 thin strips of cultured muscle tissue. The cell-grown burger is produced . with materials — including fetal calf serum, which used to grow the . cells — that will eventually be replaced by materials not orginating . from animals, the New York Times reported. In-vitro meat or cultured meat is an . animal flesh product that has never been part of a complete, living . animal, and is quite different from imitation meat or meat substitutes, . which are vegetarian foods made from vegetable proteins like soy. Scientists say that it is possible the meat will be sold to the public within ten years. It also reduces the amount of feed, water and fuel needed to produce beef. Every kilo of meat requires 10 kilos of plant feed and oil, but cultured meat would only need two. According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation we will be eating twice as much meat as we do now by 2050. Each individual in Briton eats on average 85kg meat a year. Professor Post added: ‘It comes down to the fact that animals are very inefficient at converting vegetable protein into animal protein. This helps drive up the cost of meat.’ It is thought that the new form of meat could be acceptable to vegetarians, and animal rights organisations have already given their approval. Environmentally friendly: Cultured meat uses 99 per cent less land than regular livestock . Peta spokesman Ben Williamson said: We do support lab-grown meat if it means fewer animals are eaten. Anything that reduces the suffering of animals wold be welcome.’ Peta also runs a competition offering a $1million prize for the person who invents an artificial form of chicken meat. Oxford university scientists said in 2011 that cultured beef would need 45 per cent less energy that natural beef. They added that it would require 99 per cent less land than regular livestock and produce between 78 and 95 per cent less greenhouse gas. But, the difficulty may be persuading the public to eat an artificial product. Professor . Post said that it is possible to add fatty tissue and nutrients to it, . changing the taste and making it more palatable for the public. But . before it became commercially viable, the Food Standards Agency have . said that they would have to provide evidence showing it is safe for the . public to consume and nutritionally equivalent to regular meat.","The artificial burger will be cooked and served for the first time this week .

"While it may sound to many men like more of a blessing than a curse, Dale Decker claims that his 100 daily orgasms are a hell that has ruined his life. The 37-year-old, from Wisconsin, developed persistent genital arousal syndrome in September 2012 after slipping a disc in his back while getting out of a chair. Speaking on ITV’s this morning, the father of two explains: ‘It’s completely changed everything I have ever done. I can’t do anything, I can’t get a job. You have to understand that in America 90 per cent of the jobs are service industry and nobody would ever put me in front of their customers so working is pretty much out of the question.’ Dale spoke about his rare and little understood condition on ITV's This Morning via video call . Dale’s condition has affected not only his ability to hold down a job but his family life, even occurring during his own father’s funeral . Unable even to do simple things like play baseball with his two sons, Dale feels particularly awkward when it happens around children. Becoming obviously tearful as he spoke, Dale says: ‘I don’t go around kids. My own children didn’t even know what the word orgasm was until Tuesday when some kids in school had apparently seen the video on YouTube. How do you explain an orgasm to an 11-year-old child?’ The 37-year-old became very distressed when discussing the consequences of his condition . According to medical literature, trauma to the pelvic nerves can trigger hypersensitivity in this area. The painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated, through fear of suffering a public orgasm, with some even causing him to drop to the floor. ‘There are different intensities. The ones that cause me to fall to the floor feel like all the muscles from my chest to my thighs have gone rock hard and everything just seizes up. ‘It hurts and it feels good at the same time and you have all these things running through your head as they happen. You don’t want to be around anyone and you don’t want anyone to see it,’ Dale explains, speaking via video call from America. The painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated, through fear of suffering a public orgasm . Mr Decker lives in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, with his wife April and two sons Christian, 12, and Tayten, 11. While doing all she can to support her husband, Mrs Decker said his condition is 'hard to live with'. She said: 'We really struggle right now as he is unable to work and supply for his family and I feel like all the strain is on me. 'It's really upsetting, we don't do things that man and wife should do and we argue over things that should not be affecting us. Despite suffering from a near constant erection Dale and his wife April (right) rarely have sex . 'Because he sometimes has episodes at night we took the decision to sleep in separate beds.’ 'He struggles to be a good father to the children because they obviously don't understand what is happening,' his wife added. 'He can't take them to practice - can't play ball with them, it's really hard.' Despite suffering from a near constant erection Mr and Mrs Decker rarely have sex. 'Occasionally we will but it's very frustrating for both of us,' Mr Decker said. 'I've tried reading about it, tried going to doctors but nobody can help me - I don't know what I'm going to do. 'I just want to get my old life back - I just want to get back what this condition has taken from me.'

"Vladimir Putin is suffering from Asperger's Syndrome, a study by a Pentagon think-tank has claimed. The study claimed the Russian President's 'neurological development was significantly interrupted in infancy,' resulting in his Asperger's diagnosis. In order to come to the conclusion that Putin suffers from an autistic disorder, the think-tank cites work by autism specialists and movement pattern experts. Scroll down for video . 'Autistic': Russian President Vladimir Putin, pictured staring down Russian Foreign Minister Srgei Lavrov last week, has been 'diagnosed' with Asperger's Syndrome by a Pentagon think-tank . President Putin has 'an autistic disorder which affects all of his decisions,' Brenda Connors, an expert in movement-pattern analysis at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, wrote in the report obtained by USA Today. After studying Putin's movement in public settings, Connors concluded that 'the Russian President carries a neurological abnormality.' Two studies on Putin, one in 2008 and another in 2011, were written for the Office of Net Assessment, an internal Pentagon think-tank on military strategy. The study also quotes Dr. Stephen Porges,  Professor in psychiatry at University of North Carolina, as saying 'Putin carries a form of autism', but following the report in USA Today he told the website that he would not go as far as to say the Russian leader has Asperger's. The results of the studies have been published as French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepare to join US Secretary of State John Kerry in Kiev  ahead of talks with Putin about the situation in Ukraine. Proof?: An expert in movement-pattern analysis studied Putin's movement in public settings and concluded that hat 'the Russian President carries a neurological abnormality' Warning: Speaking at a news conference in Paris this morning French President Hollande said 'diplomacy cannot go on forever' as world leaders prepare to meet Putin to discuss an end to war in the Ukraine . Not forever: Francois Hollande told journalists that while France and Berlin had chosen diplomacy rather than arming Kiev troops against the pro-Russian separatists, negotiations could not drag on indefinitely . Tomorrow, Merkel and Hollande will travel on to Moscow to meet with Putin in the hope of producing a conflict-resolution deal that would be acceptable to all parties, . Asperger's Syndrome is a life-long condition which falls within the autistic spectrum. It affects about 1 in 200 people, more commonly in men than women, and sufferers experience difficulty in social interaction, social communication and imagination, and cognitive flexibility. These are often displayed, predominantly in males, by a lack of empathy, impaired imagination, difficulty in making friends, intense absorption in a special interest. Whilst people with Asperger's will exhibit some or all of these characteristics to a greater or lesser degree, many tend to experience isolation and a lack of understanding in their everyday lives, which often results in frustration, anger, depression and a lack of self-esteem. Source: aspergerfoundation.org.uk . The flurry of high-level diplomacy aimed to end the resurgent fighting in eastern Ukraine that is threatening European security. France and Germany hoped this time they could come up with a peace deal that both Ukraine and Russia could agree to. Kerry is already visiting Kiev and in Brussels, NATO prepared to boost its forces today in response to Ukraine's unrest and Russia's increased military forcefulness. Fighting between Russia-backed separatists and government forces picked up in January after a month of relative calm, with more than 220 civilians killed in the past three weeks alone, according to the United Nations. The UN has sharply criticized both sides for indiscriminate shelling and called for a temporary truce. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that Putin, Merkel and Hollande will discuss 'what the three nations can do to help put a quick end to a civil war in southeastern Ukraine, which has exacerbated in recent days with mounting casualties.' The study has been criticised by autism organisation National Autistic Society (NAS), saying this kind of speculative diagnosis is 'fraught with risks and unhelpful'. 'Autism is a complex condition and a diagnosis should only ever be made following a thorough, holistic face-to-face process involving both the individual and the diagnostician,' Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs and Social Change at NAS said.","Vladimir Putin has Asperger's Syndrome, according to two studies .

"Authors Jonathan Safron Foer and Nicole Krauss have called it quits on their 10 year marriage. A rep for the literary power couple confirmed that they 'split amicably a year ago', according to The New York Post, and 'have chosen to live in close proximity in order to raise their [two] children.' Last October, in what was to be a real-estate omen, the pair listed their six bedroom townhouse in Brooklyn, New York, for $14.5million, and although they have both moved out, the house remains unsold.

In 2012, just one year before the couple separated, Mr Foer told The Guardian that 'the best kiss of his life' was: '[The] First date with my wife, beneath a costume shop awning, in the rain.' In the same interview, he declared that 'the love of his life', was 'life itself.'

However, the device was not a remnant of the bombing campaign endured by the capital during the Second World War, but a discarded gas canister found by workers in Peabody Avenue in Pimlico, a short distance south of the major transport hub. A British Transport Police spokesman said that no trains were leaving or entering the station and a 'controlled evacuation' took place - causing travel misery for thousands of passengers. London's Victoria Station was evacuated after a gas canister discovered nearby was mistaken for an unexploded Second World War bomb . Twitter user Matt Jones on the incident at Victoria Station in London . He added: 'British Transport Police (BTP) officers were called to London Victoria mainline station at 10.36am on Tuesday, 10 June, after the discovery of what was believed to be a suspicious item at a site near the station. 'The device was discovered by maintenance workers at the site on Vauxhall Bridge Road and a police cordon was established around the surrounding area to allow emergency services to carry out an investigation. 'BTP officers attended alongside colleagues from the Metropolitan Police Service and discovered the item in question was a camping gas cylinder. Not a bomb: The device in question was actually as a gas cylinder. File picture . 'Some trains were briefly delayed and cancelled at Victoria while the investigation was carried out, and the incident was resolved at 11.07am.' A Network Rail spokeswoman said it is not yet clear how many services had been affected and how many passengers were stranded, but said the incident resulted in around an hour of disruptions and delays. She added: 'As the incident was close to the tracks leading into Victoria it was necessary to shut the station and halt trains for a time.' With more than 73 million passenger . entries and exits between April 2010 and March 2011, Victoria is the . second-busiest terminus in London after Waterloo. The London Fire Brigade press office confirmed 10 firefighters were at the scene, which was cordoned off. The discarded gas canister was found by workers in Peabody Avenue in Pimlico, a short distance south of Victoria Station . All train journeys to and from the station were halted after the bomb was uncovered . They were called at 10:50am and said it’s a police-led incident. The spokesman added that the firefighters left at around 11.20 after the area was made safe. Experts have said there could be up to 21,000 unexploded bombs in Britain because one in ten dropped by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War never detonated. The cities with the highest numbers are London, Plymouth, Bristol, Manchester and Birmingham. Five years ago Landmark Information Group used aerial images taken by the RAF after the war to map likely spots where unexploded bombs might have fallen, although exact locations remain a mystery. London's East End suffered badly during the Blitz, and work on the Olympic Park at Stratford had to be halted after a 1,000kg bomb was found. It later emerged there could have been up to 200 unexploded devices there.","The 'bomb' was discovered by builders in Peabody Street .

"The secret of happiness may be to not expect too much from life. For if you start off with low expectations you could end up pleasantly surprised, according to a scientific study into human happiness. British scientists found that day-to-day wellbeing does not reflect how well things are going, but whether things are going better than expected. The secret of happiness may be to not expect too much from life. For if you start off with low expectations you could end up pleasantly surprised, according to a scientific study into human happiness. A stock image of a group of smiling friends is pictured . The ‘ebb and flow’ of mental happiness - the way our mood shifts moment-to-moment - is profoundly impacted by our expectations of life, they suggest. The researchers even created a formula for predicting happiness. Although the formula itself is complicated, put simply it looks at the event (t), how important or significant that event is to that person (w) and when the event occurred, also known as the 'forgetting factor'. The 'forgetting factor' in particular looks at what has happened in the past to determine the current expectations. EVj is the average reward from taking part in a certain event, and RPE is the reward compared to the expectation the person had beforehand. The researchers created a formula (pictured) for happiness. Although the formula is complicated, put simply it looks at the event (t), how important or significant the event is (w) and when the event occurred (y). EVj is the reward for taking part, and RPE is the reward compared to the expectation . Dr Robb Rutledge of University College London said his team were surprised to find just how important expectation is. He said: ‘It is often said that you will be happier if your expectations are lower. ‘We find that there is some truth to this - lower expectations make it more likely that an outcome will exceed those expectations and have a positive impact on happiness.’ But his team of researchers, who tested their theory on 18,000 people, also discovered a converse force affects our mood. While low expectations can make us happy . if they are exceeded later, having high expectations to begin with make . us happy earlier. Scientists found that day-to-day wellbeing does not reflects whether things are going better than expected. They also discovered that expectations affect happiness before an outcome is certain. For instance, going to a friend's favourite restaurant (illustrated) with positive expectations can instantly lift someone's mood . Dr Rutledge said: ‘Expectations also affect happiness even before we learn the outcome of a decision. ‘If you have plans to meet a friend at your favourite restaurant, those positive expectations may increase your happiness as soon as you make the plan.’ British . scientists found that day-to-day wellbeing does not reflect how well . things are going, but whether things are going better than expected.

Expectations also affect happiness even before we learn the outcome of a decision. His team combined the contrasting aspects of expectation and its impact on happiness and wrote it into an equation, which they discovered accurately predicted people’s happiness. The equation accurately predicts how happy people will say they are based on recent events. The formula, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was put together by studying 26 people who completed a decision-making task in which their choices led to monetary gains and losses. They were repeatedly asked how happy they were, and their brain activity was measured using MRI scans. The scientists used the data to build a computer model, which was tested on 18,420 people using a smartphone app. The results confirmed that people who started off with lower expectations were happier when they had better results. The authors wrote: ‘Conscious emotional feelings, such as momentary happiness, are core to the ebb and flow of human mental experience. ‘Our computational model suggests momentary happiness is a state that reflects not how well things are going but instead whether things are going better than expected. ‘This includes positive and negative expectations, even in the absence of outcomes.’ A recent study found that the articiulation of vowels influence how we feel and that the most positive letter is 'i' while the most negative - and likely to make us feel sad or grumpy (stock image) is 'o' Researchers from Germany found the articulation of vowels influence how we feel. During tests, they tracked participants' emotions by measuring changes in facial muscles linked with smiling and frowning, and found the most positive letter is 'i’ and the most negative is 'o'. The team, led by the Erfurt-based psychologist Professor Ralf Rummer, was able to demonstrate the articulation of vowels systematically influences our feelings and vice versa. The scientists focused on the sound of the long 'i' vowel and that of the long, closed 'o' vowel. In the first experiment, the researchers asked participants to watch film clips designed to put them in a positive or a negative mood, and then asked them to make up ten artificial words and to speak them out loud. They found the artificial words that contained significantly more i's than o's when the test subjects were in a positive mood. In a second experiment that looked at the link between the sounds, mood and people's facial muscles. They found that participants making the 'i' sounds found things funnier than those making 'o' noises. They believe that the tendency for 'i' sounds to occur in positively charged words, such as 'like', and for 'o' sounds to occur in negatively charged words, such as 'alone', in many languages appears to be linked to the corresponding use of facial muscles.","British scientists found that day-to-day .

"A group of 11 terrorists with links to Al Qaeda were yesterday being interrogated on whether they are behind the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The suspects were arrested in the capital Kuala Lumpur and in the state of Kedah last week and are members of a violent new terror group said to be planning bomb attacks in Muslim countries. The interrogations come after international investigators, including the FBI and MI6, asked for the militants, whose ages range from 22 to 55 and include students, odd-job workers, a young widow and business professionals, to be questioned intensively about Flight MH370. Scroll down for video . A Malaysian Airlines aircraft takes off from Kuala Lumpur Airport: Questions have been raised after the airline refused to reveal details of 2.3 tonnes of cargo aboard missing jet MH370 that was not listed on its manifest . Nearly two months after the . Beijing-bound plane vanished soon after take-off from Kuala Lumpur, no . trace has been found despite a huge sea search costing hundreds of . millions of pounds. It is thought to have crashed into the Indian Ocean . with 239 people on board. An . officer with the Counter Terrorism Division of Malaysian Special Branch . said yesterday the arrests had heightened suspicion that the flight’s . disappearance may have been an act of terrorism. ‘The . possibility that the plane was diverted by militants is still high on . the list and international investigators have asked for a comprehensive . report on this new terror group,’ the officer said. In . interviews conducted so far, some suspects have admitted planning . ‘sustained terror campaigns’ in Malaysia but denied being involved in . the disappearance of the airliner, he added. During the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law, Saajid Badat (left) said he had been instructed to give a shoe bomb to the Malaysians. He claimed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed masterminded the plot . During the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law, Saajid Badat, a British-born Muslim from Gloucester, said he had been instructed at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan to give a shoe bomb to the Malaysians. He said: 'I gave one of my shoes to the Malaysians. I think it was to access the cockpit.' Badat, who spoke via video link and is in hiding in the UK, told the New York court the Malaysian plot was being masterminded by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the principal architect of 9/11. A . mystery surrounding the cargo being carried by the missing Malaysian . Airlines plane emerged on Friday when it was discovered that it had been . loaded with items not specified on the manifest. The . aircraft was carrying 4.566 tonnes of mangosteens - an exotic fruit - . and a shipment of lithium batteries, which were part of a separate . consignment. The batteries . weighed 200kg, but that separate consignment totalled 2.453 tonnes. So . what was being carried to make up the 2.253 tonnes in that separate . shipment? Questions have been raised as Malaysia Airlines said it will close assistance centres in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur for the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the Boeing 777-200ER jet. Relatives of passengers aboard flight MH370 prepare to leave a hotel where they have been staying in Beijing after Malaysia Airlines said it would close all its assistance centres for relatives the missing . The closures come after rescuers . abandoned their fruitless air search for the missing jet, which had . focused on a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast. The . mystery was sparked by a spokesman for the company that shipped the . batteries telling a Malaysian newspaper that he would not reveal what . the remaining 2.253 tonnes of cargo were. 'I . cannot reveal more because of the ongoing investigations,' the . spokesman told The Star newspaper. 'We have been told by our legal . advisers not to talk about it.' The . spokesman said he could not even name the company which manufactured . the batteries, insisting that the matter was confidential. Questioned . about the fact that a mystery cargo was not stated in the manifest, . Malaysian Airlines told the paper that the rest of the consignment was . 'radio accessories and chargers.' A . statement from the airline said that the freight not specified had been . 'declared as radio accessories', despite there being no reference to . this in the manifest released publicly last Thursday. What the manifest does say is that NNR . Global shipped 133 pieces of one item weighing 1.99 tonnes and 67 . pieces of another item weighing 463kg for a total 'consolidated weight' of 2.453 tonnes. Just how . many lithium batteries had been loaded, or their weight, are not . specified in the manifest, although Malaysian Airlines boss Ahmad Yahya . told a media conference in Kuala Lumpur on March 24 that the batteries . weighed a total of 200kg. What . the manifest does say, in respect of the lithium batteries, is that . 'the package must be handled with care and that a flammability hazard . exists if the package is damaged. 'Special procedures must be followed in the event the package is damaged, to include inspection and repacking if necessary.' Still praying for answers: A relative of a missing passenger inside a prayer room at Lido Hotel in Beijing . There has been earlier speculation that a fire involving the batteries might have been the cause of the aircraft's fate. According to The Star, shippers NNR Global are located at an air freight forwarding warehouse located less than 100 yards from the Penang International Airport. 'The complex is guarded by the police and only those with passes are allowed entry,' the newspaper said, following its investigation into the unspecified cargo. A consolidated shipment combines several individual consignments to make up a full container load. At . the port of destination, the consolidated shipment is separated back . into individual consignments for delivery to their respective . consignees. The lithium . batteries and the other mystery items that are said to be radio parts . were addressed to NNR Global Logistics in Beijing, but a company named . JHJ International Transportation Co.Ltd of Beijing was to collect the . cargo on its behalf. A policeman naps beside a board written with messages for passengers aboard the missing fight at the hotel . Among the conspiracy theories that have already emerged following the Boeing 777's disappearance on March 8, is that its fate was linked to 20 of the 239 people on board - they were employees of a semi-conductor manufacturing firm which develops components for hi-tech weapons systems and aircraft navigation. They were employees of Freescale Semiconductor, a Texas technology firm, working in several manufacturing sites in Kuala Lumpur and Tianjin, China, a fact confirmed by a spokeswoman for the company. The citizens news site Beforeitsnews, said earlier that it was conceivable that MH370 was 'hiding' with its high-tech electronic warfare weaponry. 'In fact, this type of technology is precisely the expertise of Freescale, that has 20 employees on board the missing flight,' said the website. However, until a detailed description of the 'radio parts' that have not been itemised in the MH370 manifest has been made available, the conspiracy theories are likely to be given an added thrust.","Suspects were arrested in the capital Kuala Lumpur and the state of Kedah .

"Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson issued a grovelling apology yesterday after being caught shoplifting from Tesco. He pledged to ‘seek the treatment that is clearly needed’ following a caution from police for sneaking out cheese and wine without paying. Worrall Thompson, a father of four, stole from the store five times over the Christmas period before being confronted by security guards in front of shoppers. Apology: Antony Worrall Thompson being driven by a friend after being exposed for shoplifting . The 60-year-old former star of Ready Steady Cook described the thefts as ‘stupid and irresponsible’ and said he was ‘devastated’ for the family and friends he had let down. He also apologised to staff at the store in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, where he has shopped for many years. Worrall Thompson, whose restaurant business went into administration three years ago, was filmed on the store’s cameras using the self-service checkout machines. He was said to have been caught ordering blocks of cheese at the delicatessen counter and taking bottles of wine, but putting only some items through the scanner and walking out with the rest. On suspicion of shoplifting: TV chef Antony Worrall Thompson (centre), pictured with Michel Roux and Aldo Zilli, has apologised . Security staff were said to have filmed him in the act several times so they could be certain that it was not a genuine mistake. Worrall Thompson said yesterday: ‘I am . so sorry for all my recent stupid and irresponsible actions. 'I am of . course devastated for my family and friends, whom I’ve let down, and . will seek the treatment that is clearly needed. ‘I am not the first, and I certainly . won’t be the last person to do something without rhyme or reason – what . went through my head, only time will tell. 'Of course, I must also . apologise sincerely to Tesco, with whom I’m had a long and genuine . working relationship, and to all the staff at the Henley branch, many of . whom I’ve got to know over the years. ‘Once again, I am so sorry and hopefully in the future I can make amends.’ Last night, in a rambling interview, the chef admitted on one occasion he stole bread and two pack of discounted coleslaw. On another occasion, he paid £180 for three crates of champagne and then stole £4 of goods. He said he did not need the money and was comfortably well off, so could not fathom why he had stolen low-price and discounted items. Suffered a downturn: Antony Worrall Thompson with wife Jacinta and children . Worrall Thompson mulled over . everything that could have pushed him to steal. He spoke of the stress . of moving house, the death of two close friends, giving up smoking, . anaemia, long working hours, his inability to relax, his age and . dementia. Over Christmas, he said, he had personally flambeed every Christmas pudding at his restaurant, which had left him exhausted. He went on: ‘I hope I’m not going . totally gaga in my old age. I have wondered if it’s something like that . but I hope 60 is too young for something like Alzheimer’s.’ The former I’m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! contestant described the moment he was approached by security guards. He said: ‘It was like a dream or a nightmare. ‘I went back to the office with them and I’d taken a newspaper, three onions and a sandwich that time. ‘I was just thinking over and over, 'Why, why, why, are you taking three onions?' I’d taken £6 of stuff and the rest of the bill came to about £30.’ Worrall Thompson was arrested on suspicion of theft and cautioned on Friday. He was taken to a police station and had his photograph and fingerprints taken, along with a DNA saliva sample. Security staff secretly filmed Worrall Thompson at the Tesco superstore in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire . Antony Worrall Thompson's company AWT was forced into administration . He was questioned about shoplifting on five occasions at the Tesco superstore between December 22 and January 6. The total value of the goods taken was . £70.68. To receive a formal caution from police, a suspect must admit . guilt. He will not have a criminal record but his details will remain on . police files. Worrall Thompson’s previous connection . with Tesco was as a judge in the supermarket’s competition to discover . Britain’s best unknown cheese in 2003. It was won by Goat’s Caerphilly, . from Ditcheat, near Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Forced out: The former home of celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson, in Lower Shiplake, Henley . The chef lives with his third wife, Irish-born Jacinta ‘Jay’ Shiel, 46. The once-booming AWT empire has been hit badly by the economic downturn. He put his chain of six restaurants, pubs and cafes into administration . in February 2009, blaming his bank for being too cautious with credit. But administrators said the business was ‘overstretched’ with debts of . more than £800,000, papers from a meeting of creditors at Reading County . Court showed. He has since bought back and reopened the Greyhound, a gastropub in . Oxfordshire, and the Windsor Larder, a delicatessen and cafe. The chef . also used his own funds to keep open two restaurants, in Kew and . Windsor. Two years ago he quit his £1.6million home in Henley for a house in Cadmore End, near High Wycombe. Antony Worrall Thompson has been a regular fixture on television cookery shows for more than a decade. The . chef, who was born in Stratford-Upon-Avon, grew up in a theatrical . family. Both his parents were actors and he is the godson of Richard . Burton, who was his father's understudy at the Royal Shakespeare . Company. Worrall . Thompson, who said he comes from 'a posh sort of family, in a way', was . sent away to boarding school at the age of three. His parents split up at around the same time and he was 21 before he saw his father again. Worrall Thompson appeared on ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2003 . He was 16 when a rugby accident left his face badly disfigured and he needed surgery to repair the damage. A . course in catering management was followed by a series of jobs learning . his trade at various restaurants in Essex, much to the horror of his . grandmother who refused to write to him because she could not bring . herself to write the word Essex on the envelope. He really shot to fame in the early 1980s when he opened a restaurant called Ménage à Trois in London's upmarket Knightsbridge. The restaurant, which was patronised by the Princess of Wales, only served starters and puddings. The . boom in cookery programmes in the 1990s propelled him into a different . league and he was soon making regular appearances on shows including . Food and Drink, Ready Steady Cook and Saturday Kitchen. He . has also made appearances on Question Time, The Weakest Link and went . into the jungle for I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! But his career has not always run smoothly. In . 2008, he apologised after mistakenly recommending a potentially fatal . weed as part of a healthy living regime and a year later he was forced . to put his restaurant company into administration. The three-times married chef has spoken candidly in the past of the toll his restaurant career has had on his private life. In 2003, he told the Observer: 'I've lost two wives to restaurants, and a fantastic Japanese American girl. 'I . mean, some of it was my own fault - too much dabbling in other women. But it's like a drug: you finish work, you can't sleep because the . adrenaline is rushing round, so you end up in a club. You're never at . home. Things start to fall apart.' Richard Madeley stood trial for shoplifting in a branch of Tesco but was cleared . A number of celebrities have been accused of petty theft despite in many cases having huge wealth. In one of the most bizarre cases, Liverpool footballer Glen Johnson was given a £70 on-the-spot fine in 2007 after he and a friend allegedly tried to steal a toilet seat and other bathroom fittings from B&Q in Dartford, Kent. Last autumn, Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea was challenged by Tesco staff after he allegedly ate a doughnut and tried to leave without paying for it. The footballer, who earns £70,000 a week, said he intended to pay but wandered out when he realised he’d left his wallet in the car. Staff dropped the matter without calling police. Richard Madeley found himself in a similar predicament in 1991, but this time the store decided to press charges. He stood trial for shoplifting after staff in a Manchester branch of Tesco said they saw the This Morning presenter pushing trolleys of alcohol through the checkout without paying. He denied the charges, claiming he was simply absent-minded and was later cleared. In 2002, Winona Ryder was convicted of theft after a shoplifting spree in a Los Angeles department store. The actress, who had a history of depression, was fined £12,000 and told to attend counselling. And last year, actress Lindsay Lohan was sentenced to 360 hours community service for stealing a gold necklace from a jewellery store in the U.S. Peaches Geldof has also been accused of shoplifting – although no prosecution has ever been brought. In October last year she was reportedly caught stealing make-up from Boots, leading her to be banned from the store. Several months before, staff in a retro clothing store in Bristol accused her of taking clothes – a claim her spokesman dismissed as ‘nonsense’.","Celebrity chef issued grovelling apology after being caught shoplifting from Tesco .

"A soldier who spotted a boy with a terrible deformity while on patrol in Bosnia has spent ten years fundraising to finally deliver his promise of giving him a new face. Former Staff Sergeant Wayne Ingram, 44, met four-year-old Stefan Savic a decade ago while on peacekeeping duties in Eastern Europe. Stefan was born with a debilitating condition called Tessier facial cleft, which meant his eyes were 4.5cm further apart than normal and he had no proper nose. Former Staff Sergeant Wayne Ingram has raised more than £100,000 to pay for a Bosnian boy, Stefan Savic, to have surgery at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London . But father-of-two Mr Ingram, formerly of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers, was so moved by Stefan's plight he vowed to get him state-of-the-art medical help. He collected an amazing £85,000 with a fundraising drive across Bosnia and the UK before bringing Stefan to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital in 2003. The youngster underwent 12 hours of surgery with plastic surgeon David Dunaway, who cut his face in half before moving his eyes closer together and building him a nose. The operation was a success but Mr Dunaway warned that a second operation would be needed a decade later. Mr Ingram kept in touch with Stefan and his parents Slavenka, 36, and Milos, 44, raising a further £20,000 to bring him back to the UK to finish his treatment. Stefan, now 14, returned to Great Ormond Street this week for his second operation with Mr Dunaway to improve his face and help his breathing. When Mr Ingram first met Stefan a decade ago he promised to help raise the money for him to have the surgery he needed on the facial deformity he was born with. Stefan has now had the treatment (pictured) Stefan (pictured at the age of four) born with a debilitating condition called Tessier facial cleft which meant his eyes were 4.5cm further apart than normal and he had no proper nose . Mr Ingram, from Weymouth, Dorset, said he was just happy to complete the remarkable job of helping Stefan lead the life of a normal little boy. He said: ‘I was on a routine patrol in Bosnia when I was introduced to his father and went to meet Stefan. ‘The condition had been left untreated and had grown between Stefan's eyes, crushing his skull, forcing his eyes apart to the point he couldn't see what was ahead of him. A facial cleft is an opening or gap in the face, or a malformation of part of the face. It occurs when separate areas of the face do not join together properly when a baby is developing in the womb. There are many different types of clefts, one group of which are called Tessier clefts. These are clefts affecting the centre of the face. The clefts are very rare and most children with them need multiple operations to help them breathe and eat. ‘But aside from the facial deformities . he was just a normal, playful little boy. He was confident and cheeky, . climbing all over me as we played football in the yard. ‘He was too young then to be self-aware. But his facial cleft was blocking his airways and without medical attention, could kill him. ‘I had two young sons myself at the time and there was no way I could stand back and do nothing. I knew in an instant I had to do everything I could to help.’ As Mr Ingram set about raising funds, he wrote to a long list of celebrities. Only David Beckham replied, politely explaining he had already chosen his charities for that year. Mr Dunaway, the surgeon, was offering his services for free but Mr Ingram still needed to pay for flights, accommodation for the family, as well as essential hospital costs. He raised 6,000 Euros by staging a charity football match in Banja Luka, with Muslim, Serb and Croat players setting aside their conflicts to help Stefan. And back in the UK, Mr Ingram launched a massive fundraising drive, persuading his local Asda to put collection boxes beside their tills. He said: ‘Donations poured in and I was bowled over by the generosity. ‘Stefan needed three operations back then - one to remove his teeth, another to reconstruct his nose and another to reconstruct his skull. Thanks to Mr Ingram, Stefan has had a series of operations and procedures at Great Ormond Street. The pair are pictured during one of Stefan's previous trips to London for treatment . Stefan (pictured after his latest operation) is expected to need one more operation and Mr Ingram has promised to be there for him and to help raise the money for this operation as well . ‘He was back and forth to the UK many times, staying for as long as a month at a time. ‘The doctors warned us it wasn't over, however, and that ten years later Stefan would need follow up surgery. ‘But we have kept in touch ever since and as ten years neared I let Stefan's family know I would raise the necessary funds - over £20,000.’ As Mr Ingram set about raising a second lot of cash to pay for visas, hospital costs and flights, he was once more amazed by people's generosity. In his native Dorset, one anonymous donor, calling herself simply 'the kind granny' contributed a ‘large, undisclosed’ amount. And this time celebrities including comic Jim Davidson and musician Billy Bragg also answered his letters. After his latest operation, Stefan (pictured on his first trip to London in 2003) said: 'This is the best thing that has ever happened to me' Stefan's operations have been carried out by surgeon David Dunaway (right) who has waived his fee on each occasion. This meant Mr Ingram only had to raise money for flights, accommodation and hospital costs . With the funding in place, Stefan underwent his four-hour follow-up operation with Mr Dunaway on Saturday and is making a good recovery. Mr Dunaway, who once more waived his fees, said: ‘This operation was really about reconstructing his nose and improving his nasal airway. ‘His nose was very wide and he basically didn't have a tip to it at all. ‘We took a cartilage from one rib, fashioned it into the shape of a nose, then used it to reconstruct his nose. ‘This will allow him to breath more easily, eat more easily, it will improve his speech and he will look much more like the rest of us. ‘To have the opportunity to greet him again and finish it off so he can lead a normal life and not worry about these things is just great.’ Without treatment, Stefan's condition could have killed him because his airway was being blocked . Mr Ingram (pictured with Stefan before his latest operation) was so inspired by Stefan that after leaving the army he became a paramedic . Stefan will likely need a further operation on his nose and orthodontics to realign his teeth before one final surgery to correct the roof of his mouth. Mr Ingram, who was so inspired by Stefan's medical progress he became a paramedic after leaving the army, says he'll be there every step of the way. Mr Ingram, whose own sons Harry and Toby are now 18 and 16, added: ‘Stefan has never moaned or complained the whole time I've known him. ‘His mum says that after his latest operation he looked in front of the mirror and said: “this is the best thing that has ever happened to me”. ‘For me this was about honouring a promise I made all those years ago and doing everything I could for Stefan. ‘He's changed my life as well and inspired me to become a paramedic. We'll always have an inseparable bond.’ Mr Ingram’s fundraising efforts have been supported by the Facing the World charity, which provides life-changing surgery to children from developing countries with severe facial disfigurements.

"The FBI is investigating the hanging death of a black North Carolina teenager after his family questioned an official ruling that he committed suicide, it was today revealed. Lennon Lacy, 17, was found hanging by a dog leash and a belt from a swing set in a largely white trailer park in Bladenboro, Bladen County, less than a mile from his home, in August this year. Although the state medical examiner ruled Lennon's death a suicide based on reports from law enforcement and a county coroner, his family argued that it was a 'race-based homicide'. They pointed out that the teenager - who had no history of mental illness - had washed his uniform and packed his bag in preparation for a big football game just hours before he was found hanging. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Lennon Lacy (pictured), 17, was found hanging by a dog leash and a belt from a swing set in a trailer park in Bladenboro in Bladen County, North Carolina, less than a mile from his home, in August this year . They also said he was discovered wearing a pair of white sneakers that did not match the shoes they had last seen him in, that he did not own, and most remarkably, that were two sizes too small for him, . And they said at 6ft 4ins, Lennon could not reach up and touch the 7ft 5ins  beam he apparently hanged himself from. There was no  item present he could have used to reach the bar, they said. Some relatives even went so far as to say that Lennon's relationship with a 31-year-old white woman - who lived across the road from him - could have led to his death. The pair's relationship had apparently not been well received by the predominantly white community. Meanwhile, Lennon's teammates refused to believe he had killed himself before their high school game, which the starting linebacker had reportedly spent the entire summer training for. One of his teammates, Anthony White, told The Inquistir that his friend had huge NFL dreams, saying: 'He was real excited... he was looking forward to doing good in the game.' As Lennon's family, friends and teammates spread the word of their unease, a coalition of church leaders, lawyers and activists in the state called on federal authorities investigate Lennon's death. NFL fan: Although the state medical examiner ruled Lennon's (pictured) death a suicide, his family argued it was a 'race-based homicide'. Now, the government has launched a federal investigation into his death . Scene: Lennon, who aspired to be an NFL player, was found hanged from this wooden swing set (pictured) The North Carolina branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) claimed police had reached a 'quick four-day call' that Lennon had taken his own life. 'Given evidence uncovered by the (North Carolina) NAACP, there are several other possible explanations for his death besides a simple suicide,' the Association said in a letter. The Reverend William Barber, president of the chapter of the NAACP, said many questions remain unanswered, including why the teenager was hanging from a dog leash and a belt he did not own. 'We don't know what happened that terrible night,' Mr Barber said. Speaking to Yahoo, he added: 'The call was made so quick. And what concerns us about that is that if Lennon Lee Lacy was white and was found hanging in a... predominantly black trailer park that was known to have some drug involvement and other things, we just don't believe that it would have been this quick rush to say it was a suicide. Mother and son: Lennon's (right) mother, Claudia Lacy (left), also backed calls for further investigation into her son's death, saying: 'I just want to know what happened to my 17-year-old son; all I want is justice' 'It would have been a very, very, very intense investigation.' Lennon's mother, Claudia Lacy, also backed calls for further investigation into the death of her son, . 'I just want to know what happened to my 17-year-old son; all I want is justice,' Mrs Lacy, who identified her son's body in the back of an ambulance at the scene, told the Guardian. She dismissed the coroner's findings that Lennon had been depressed over his uncle's death, saying the loss would not have driven him to suicide and that he was, in general, a very happy person. And she added that a number of cuts and abrasions had been found on her son's body following his death, alongside a large bump on his head that may indicate he was hit by someone. Speaking to AP, she said: 'When I saw him, I just knew automatically he didn't do that to himself. Gifts: Mr Lacy added that a number of cuts and abrasions had been found on Lennon's body following his death, alongside a large bump on his head. Above, Lennon's friends leave gifts at the scene of the hanging . Tribute: Candles spell out 'L' for Lennon in a tribute to the teenager, who reportedly had big NFL dreams . 'Seventeen years old — he had no reason to. I know my child. As a mother, I would have sensed if something was wrong to the point that he was going to harm himself.' Days after he was buried, Lennon's grave was defiled - an act of vandalism that Lennon's family believes supports their claim that he was killed in a racially-motivated homicide. Following months of campaigning, the same coroner who ruled Lennon's death a suicide has now questioned his initial verdict due to the high number of 'unanswered questions' in the case. On Friday morning, Bladen County District Attorney, Jon David, confirmed to AP that an FBI agent has finally been assigned the case after being made aware of the coroner's concerns. Lennon's family hopes the probe could be the detailed investigation they have been waiting for. However, Teresa West, a spokesman for the State Bureau of Investigation, said agents have already addressed all viable leads in the hanging. And the Bladen County District Attorney’s office said in a statement that it has not received any information to counter the initial 'asphyxia due to hanging' cause of death verdict. 'While the investigation is ongoing, and no final determinations have been made, to date we have not received any evidence of criminal wrongdoing surrounding the death,' it said. The state chapter of the NAACP has organizing a march  in Bladenboro, a tiny town with a largely white population of fewer than 2,000 people, on Saturday. An investigation is now ongoing.","Lennon Lacy found hanged from North Carolina swing set in August .

"A pilot who was forced to make an emergency landing on a busy road has said he is considering giving up flying - because it is his second plane crash in just six years. Danny Hall, 48,  from Torrington, Connecticut, walked away from crash landing his plane  in West Hartford after the power failed with just a sore back. In 2008 the roofing company owner was forced to land his plane in a river in similar circumstances after the engine failed. Danny Hall was forced to crash land his plane (pictured) on a bus route near a busy road - no one was hurt . Mr Hall said during the incident on Saturday afternoon his single-engine Skyline Cessna experienced engine problems and lost power while flying from Robertson Field in Plainville to Hartford-Brainard Airport. He said he radioed a controller at Hartford airport while looking for a place to safely put the plane down. 'I said, ""Tell my kids I love them if I don't make it."" He said, ""OK. Good luck,''' Mr Hall said. Mr Hall said while he was looking for a place to land he noticed a road only a few miles from Hartford airport that did not appear to have any traffic on it. He said: 'What I thought was a road was actually the bus route I guess they just built. 'I was kind of questioning why there were no cars on it, but I figure if I'm going to land a plane, I'm going to try to put it somewhere where no one is going to get hurt.' The plane narrowly missed several homes and businesses and a wing broke off during the crash. Mr Hall was flying to Hartford-Brainard Airport (pictured) when the engine of his Skyline Cessna lost power . Mr Hall said: 'When I got out of the plane after it put down I noticed a little smoke coming up where the engine was. 'I popped my seatbelt, opened the door, got out of the plane and as I was [walking] away from it I realised I was safe,' The $567 million bus-only corridor between Hartford and New Britain is nearing completion and is set to open early next year. Mr Hall added: 'The most important thing, I'm just happy no one got hurt, especially on the ground. 'I did what I had to do,' The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating why the plane lost power. Six years ago, Mr Hall survived a plane crash into the Pawcatuck River in Westerly, Rhode Island. He said the engine on that Cessna failed about two miles from Westerly Airport. An FAA investigation at the time found mice had built a nest in the plane, and when he pulled a device that prevents icing the mice and their nest were sucked into the carburetor, causing the engine to seize up.","Danny Hall, 48, was forced to make emergency landing after engine failed .

"There are some debts which can never fully be repaid: the freedom which Britain and her people owe the mighty little Spitfire is one of them. When Britain stood alone against the threat of Nazi Germany, the Spitfires and ‘the Few’ who flew them protected our skies and all that lay beneath. Even today, almost three-quarters of a century after the Battle of Britain, the air-rending thunder of a 1750-horsepower Merlin engine and the sight of those curved wings slicing through the clouds can still lay claim to the heart of the nation. Scroll down for video . Boultbee Flight Academy in West Sussex can offer passenger flights to non pilots in their £2 million Spitfire TR9 aircraft built in 1944 . And now, remarkably, ordinary members of the public can experience the thrill of flying along Beachy Head in this unique aircraft. This is because back in September, the historic rules limiting Spitfire experiences to those who hold a pilot licence were lifted by the Civil Aviation Authority. Boultbee Flight Academy in West Sussex is the only company approved by the Civil Aviation Authority to offer passenger flights in their Spitfire TR9 aircraft, which was originally designed to train fighter pilots. Yesterday I was lucky enough to soar out over the white cliffs of Southern England, the Channel limpid below and the late afternoon light torching into an orange parabola around the wooden propeller. It was an extraordinary experience; the closest any of my generation will come to knowing what the Few knew, that this is flying at its most graceful and elemental. We arced and turned and dived and climbed into the setting sun, the smell of hot grease and engine fuel wafting into the cockpit, the thrumming and throbbing of the plane’s tiny carcass beating into our backs. And as we did so we felt the decades rapidly slip away – for the Spitfire is an icon of aviation, the years have not withered her magnificent power nor her silvery allure. At 280mph – using a mere fifth of the engine’s capacity – and 500ft above the waves, we carved our own little bit of history along the fortress of white cliffs which would once have welcomed Britain’s fliers home. I was flying in Gilda, a Mark IX Spitfire built in 1944 which is worth £2 million – and is one of just seven two-seater Spitfires in the world. The aircraft, which has a 1,750 horse-power Rolls Royce Merlin engine, is one of only seven two-seat Spitfires in the world . The flight in a Spitfire, pictured, could just about be the best Christmas present any Briton might receive for next year . I climbed in behind pilot Matt Jones into a rear cockpit where space is so tight it’s measured in fractions of an inch and there is no floor above the constantly moving controls. As the chocks are pulled away, the flaps lifted for take-off and the canopy closes over your head, it’s almost like the Spitfire claims you. That much was expected, but what came as a surprise was the gentleness of one of the most brilliant war machines ever built; so soft are the controls that the merest movement of the stick up or down or from port to starboard will send it skimming into another corner of sky. After flying over the Channel, we turned inland, reaching 2,500ft as a pale autumn mist rose beneath us. Then we crossed the Thames up into East Anglia towards the Imperial War Museum at Duxford where Gilda is to spend the winter. Shortly before we landed, Matt pulled back the worn leather casing of the joystick, glanced at me in the cockpit mirror and gently pulled the nose up while turning the plane a full 360 degrees: a victory roll. As we turned, pulling 2.5 times the force of gravity (Gs), I watched the world spin on its very axis and waited for my stomach to catch up. A few minutes later we accelerated to 300mph and performed a Half Cuban, a partial loop from which you also emerge in a roll, pulling 3.5Gs, the swiftness and sharpness of the Spitfire’s manoeuvrability giving some small clue to her prowess in battle. Now you can win your own flight in a Spitfire, which could just about be the best Christmas present any Briton might receive for next year – the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. The little plane, which saved so very many lives, gave me the ride of mine.

"A Gold Coast woman who is the 'crucial witness'  for the prosecution of Gable Tostee has given a graphic account of Warriena Wright's final moments before she plunged to her death in Surfers Paradise on August 8. In an affidavit filed to the Queensland Supreme Court by Gable Tostee's lawyers during his bail application,  Emily Ellis, who lived  below Gable Tostee's 14th floor apartment, provides a graphic re-enactment of 26-year-old Ms Wright's fatal plunge. Police re-enacted the fall by lowering a female officer over the balcony of Tostee's apartment in the days following her death. Scroll down for video . ""Oh God she's coming over': Police (inset) recreated the moment that Warriena Wright came over the 14th floor balcony of the Avalon Apartments (pictured) as observed by a neighbour in the flat below . ""I just want to go home': Neighbour Emily Ellis,a crucial prosecution witness in the alleged murder of Warriena Wright (pictured) heard Ms Wright cry out and then came out onto her balcony to witness feet dangling . Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Ms Wright and plans to strenuously defend his case when he goes to trial in late 2016 or early 2017 . Tostee has denied murdering Ms Wright and plans to strenuously defend his innocence. Ms Ellis said she and two males, Ryan and Nick, were first drawn out onto her balcony of the Avalon Apartments in the early hours of August 8 this year primarily because of what she could hear going on from above. 'I heard a girl say ""I just, I just want to go home, please let me go home "" and she was quite scared,' Ms Ellis said in the re-enactment for Gold Coast detectives. Emily Ellis saw Ms Wright's 'legs dangling' from above in the Avalon Apartments (pictured)and then said, 'Oh God, she's coming over' 'We were trying to look out. We said 'it's right above us, there's something going on right above us here"" ... because you could hear her. she was trying to get away, there was a lot of movement. 'We were trying to see what was going on and because of what we could hear I looked over and as I looked over ... I've said to Ryan ... ""Oh God, she's coming over, she's coming over the balcony"". 'I've said to [Ryan] ""I don't,  l don't know what, what is she doing? Like I don't know what she's doing"". 'Cause I couldn't work out the logic of why she was the way she was. All I could see, cause I'm quite short ... I could see the bottom of her feet. 'I couldn't work out what why or what she was doing ... and she wasn't gripping either, she wasn't on a ledge, so um her feet were dangling. I couldn't work out, is she trying to get down, or was she trying to get somewhere else? 'And then by the time I've tried to work out what she was doing, was she trying to get down to another level or where she was going, um, she was gone, she'd fallen, she, there was just shock in her voice.' Ms Ellis said Ms Wright's fall was just [snapping her fingers] split instant. She was just gone.' She described seeing 'the bottom of her feet, and um, her toes'. 'I thought she was wearing shoes, but I think stockings. 'I'm pretty sure it was stockings ... I've run it over ... through my head. I had said ""she's coming over"" and then her feet are there and it was as if she was trying to do something, get down. Final moments: Emily Ellis saw the soles of Warriena Wright's (pictured) feet and couldn't understand why Ms Wright was coming over the balcony of Gable Tostee's 14th floor apartment at 2.20am on August 8 this year . 'She wasn't trying to do anything significant to make her ... I don't know if it was just a miss-grab. I don't know what she's done to [snaps fingers] fall.' In the police re-enactment, a female officer  is lowered on a harness over the balcony and Ms Ellis says of Ms Wright's descent, 'When she was coming down ... she started twisting herself. 'I did see a lot of her body which alerted me, like she's coming out on the edge. I don't know what she was thinking because ... her feet were coming towards me first, it wasn't as if she was crouching or anything . Fatal date: After several hours of drinking and in the early housrs of the morning 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk Warriena Wright (left) came over the balcony of Gable Tostee's( right) 14th floor apartment, as neighbours watched from below . 'Her legs were there first ... it wasn't a lowering or a gentle, cautious ... she wasn't hanging on, she wasn't facing that way ... she wasn't facing that way to hold on.' The police then repositioned the female officer re-enacting Ms Wright's fall, so that her 'feet were pointing away from the building, her back was towards the building ... and she was a little bit lower'. Ms Ellis agreed that the female officer was in the right position and said Ms Wright had been 'flush against the building'. 'I couldn't see her upper body at all and she was out like that and um her legs had reached that point. I couldn't see her upper body and that's why I turned and said ""I don't know what she's doing"" because I was trying to work out is she trying to lower herself that way?'

"Think Liza Minnelli and Joel Gray in Carberet. Think West Hollywood, Greenwich Village and Provincetown and the Castro, known as hotbeds of homosexuality. But they are nothing like the uninhibited urban gay sexual scene and vast homosexual subculture that flourished in Berliin under Germany's Weimar Republic. Sexual experimentation between the same sexes and medical advances of helping genders ‘trapped within the wrong body’ in Germany more than one hundred years ago shaped our understanding of gay identity today. The city's liberal years - before the rise of Hitler - are detailed in a new book, Gay Berlin. The science of ‘transsexuality’ was founded in Berlin at the Institute of Sexual Science where the first male-to-female surgery was performed. The words ‘homosexual’ or ‘transvestite’ were German innovations. Police mugshots of Berlin prostitute Johann Scheff, arrested in July 1932. Youths dressed in women's clothing who successfully passed for women, descended on department stores en masse stealing large quantities of merchandise. The cover of Die Intel, December 1930, advertising a serialized installment of Men for Sale (Manner zu verkaufen). German gay magazines also offered gay and lesbian friendly services to the gay subculture including medical doctors specializing in 'sexual disturbances', detective agencies offering to investigate blackmail threats, as well as dressmakers and restaurants . Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey starred in the film version of Carbaret in 1972 . Male prostitution, homosexual bars and nightclubs, cabarets populated by gay men, lesbians and transsexuals flourished in a wild, incomparable sexual subculture that was exciting yet dangerous. It was in Berlin where scientists concluded that ‘same sex love was a natural, inborn characteristic and not merely the perversion of a ‘normal’ sexual tendency’, author and scholar Robert Beachy writes in his compelling book, Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity by Knopf Publishers. The Weimar Republic emerged out of the wreckage of Germany's war. The Kaiser was gone, the 1919 Versailles Treaty saw the abolition of the German Empire and the loss of significant amounts of its territory. It was a troubled and tortured time for Germany, but Berlin, the old imperial capital became its most liberal city. High living, a vibrant urban life and relaxed social attitudes, along with the influx of American money defined the Golden Twenties in Berlin that was the most creative period in German history. Writers, poets, artists from London, France, the United States arrived in the German city to witness and experience the wild erotic sexual freedom along with curiosity seekers, voyeurs, and homosexuals. Western Europeans, Scandinavians and Russians all came to indulge their sexual appetites in the hedonistic nightlife and party culture of the German capital – or they came to witness the ‘luridly licentious Berlin’, spiking their own voyeuristic impulses. ‘The pervasive prostitution (both male and female), the public cross-dressing, and the easy access to bars and clubs that catered to homosexual men and lesbians were just a few of the features that supported Berlin’s sex industry’. Transvestite prostitutes sitting on the laps of gay men in the popular Berlin gay bar Marienkasin . Hansi Sturm, was the winner of the Miss Eldorado transvestite pageant in 1926 . There were twenty-five to thirty separate homosexual German-language periodicals that were appearing in Berlin, weekly or monthly. There were no other journals published anywhere else in the world until after 1945. Openly nudist and homosexual titles were displayed in the kiosks. Same-sex bars, clubs and cafes advertised as well as the professional services of doctors, dentists, lawyers, stationers…all with the implied ‘friends patronize friends’. In those magazines, anyone facing blackmail found private detectives to track down extortion threats. Cross-dressers found dressmakers who tailored for large sizes. There were the single ads placed by individuals forever in search of love. The American modernist artist, poet and essayist Marsden Hartley, a habitué of 1920s Berlin, ‘attended large transvestite balls and patronized homosexual bars frequented by male hustlers. He later recalled, ‘Life in Berlin then was at the height of heights – that is to the highest pitch of sophistication and abandon. None of us had seen anything quite like the spectacle’. Acclaimed American Architect Philip Johnson often considered the dean of American architects, ‘availed himself of Berlin’s male prostitution’. ‘Paris was never that hospitable’, Johnson said. He became fluent in German later saying, ‘I learned it the best way, using ""the horizontal method"".' Transvestites having drinks in the Eldorado club that was not hidden away but celebrated in the golden age of the gay bar and club scene in Weimar Berlin. It was a hot spot for high society and partying until dawn was the norm . Dr Magnus Hirschfeld opened the Institute for Sexual Science in March 1919, the first such facility in the world to offer medical and psychological counseling on sexual issues to heterosexual men and women, homosexuals, cross-dressers and intersex individuals also known as hermaphrodites or individuals caught between male and female. ‘The institute represented the first attempt to establish ""sexology"", or sexual science, as a topic of legitimate academic study and research. ‘Nowhere else in the world was there so much as a university department or chair devoted to the subject, much less an entire institute,' writes author Robert Beachy. The Institute also emphasized public education and had a museum of sexuality, the Hirschfeld Museum, with not only wall charts and photographs but also cases filled with phalluses and fetishes from around the globe. Photographs of homosexuals dressed in huge hats, earrings and makeup adored the walls as well as women in men’s clothing and top hats. When Dr William Robinson, a New York physician and prominent activist for birth control, visited the institute in 1925, he stated: ‘It is an institution absolutely unique in the whole world…which I hoped to establish in the United States but which I felt would not thrive on account of our prudish, hypocritical attitude to all questions of sex.’ It was at this institute that Hirschfeld and his colleagues pioneered some of the first sex-reassignment surgeries as well as primitive hormone treatments . Dr Hirschfeld studied cross-dressing, men and women who wore the clothing of the opposite sex. Previously interpreted as a symptom of homosexuality by psychiatrists and sexologists, and associated with prostitution and criminal activity, Hirschfeld believed cross-dressers were often heterosexual. Picture postcard of the gay club Silhouette, popular in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Always under a blue haze of cigarette and cigar smoke, film stars, cabaret artists and wealthy nobility were regulars including a young Marlene Dietrich alongside princes, counts and barons. Nazi officials sort through 'un-German' and 'perverted' materials in the debris of the Institute for Social Science, that was ransacked on May 6, 1933, for a book burning event they staged four days later. Male and female impersonators drew huge crowds at cabarets, circuses and variety theatres – as well as providing entertainment at the big transvestite balls and homosexual clubs, but they faced the possibility of being arrested by the police and harassed. Dr Hirschfeld helped reform the practices of the Berlin police and convinced them to issue ‘transvestite passes’ so that performers could work without fear of harassment although there was no law prohibiting public cross-dressing. But dressing like the opposite sex sometimes inspired the desire for a physical metamorphosis. So the doctor performed one of the first (primitive) male-to-female sex-reassignment surgeries on a twenty-three year old officer who had fought in World War I. From childhood on, he felt he was trapped in the wrong body and only went into the military to demonstrate his masculinity. But that didn’t subdue his feminine feelings and when the war was over, he felt suicidal. Hirschfeld’s colleague, Dr. Arthur Kronfeld removed the man’s testicles and the effect was quite successful leading to a ‘psychic relaxation and a permanent feeling of harmony and balance’. His facial hair disappeared and now he passed for a woman. He visited a Dresden gynecologist, Dr. Richard Muhsam, who made a ‘vagina-like structure’ and tucked his member up in there in what was the first attempt to construct a vagina for a man. Five months later, the former officer was back and reported having erections. He also had fallen in love with a woman, abandoned his cross-dressing and was now masculine. The doctor successfully undid the surgery and restored his masculinity. Afternoon teas and large costume balls were held at the Institute as another venue for flamboyant cross-dressers. The balls attracted young male prostitutes along with the cross-dressers and prominent, open homosexuals. Hirschfeld wanted homosexual men and lesbians to experience greater erotic fulfillment that wasn’t connected to procreation. With the Great Depression of 1929, and the crash of the American stock market, the Golden Age was slipping away to a Hitler-led government by spring 1930, the Nazis were on the rise with the new Reichstag election.

"A new book out in Germany reveals how President Kennedy was a secret admirer of the Nazis.

President Kennedy's travelogues and . letters chronicling his wanderings through Germany before WWII, when . Adolf Hitler was in power, have been unearthed and show him generally in . favour of the movement that was to plunge the world into the greatest . war in history . Secret: A new book out in Germany reveals how President Kennedy was a secret admirer of the Nazis . 'Fascism?' wrote the youthful president-to-be in one. 'The right thing for Germany.' In another; 'What are the evils of fascism compared to communism?' And on August 21, 1937 - two years before the war that would claim 50 million lives broke out - he wrote: 'The Germans really are too good - therefore people have ganged up on them to protect themselves.' And in a line which seems directly plugged into the racial superiority line plugged by the Third Reich he wrote after travelling through the Rhineland: 'The Nordic races certainly seem to be superior to the Romans.' The future president's praise is now . embarrassing in hindsight - a few years later he fought in War . War Two against the Nazis and his elder brother Lt. Joseph Patrick 'Joe' Kennedy, Jr was killed. Revealing: Presidential diaries and photographs are among more than 500 items from a collection of John F. Kennedy documents and artifacts . Tour: Kennedy recovers, right, from jaundice in a London hospital in 1937 and left juggles on a street in Amsterdam during a trip to Europe . Trip: Kennedy and one of his sisters ride camels in Egypt in 1939 . As a young man, the future president had desperately wanted to go into the Navy but was originally rejected - mainly due to a back injury he sustained playing football while attending Harvard. In 1941, though, his politically connected father Joe P Kennedy used his influence to get him in to the service and he joined the Navy. In 1942, Kennedy volunteered for PT (motorized torpedo) boat duty in the Pacific. On 12 June 1944 he received the Navy's highest honor for gallantry for his heroic actions as a gunboat pilot during World War II. The Navy Marine Corps Medal and the Purple Heart were presented to Lt. Kennedy for his heroics and injuries sustained in the rescue of the crew of PT 109 during on August 2, 1943 when the motor torpedo boat was struck by a Japanese destroyer. His back was hurt during duty and Kennedy was released from all active duty and finally retired from the U.S. Naval Reserve on physical disability in March 1945.

Other musings concern how great the autobahns were - 'the best roads in the world' - and how, having visited Hitler's Bavarian holiday home in Berchtesgaden and the tea house built on top of the mountain for him. He declared; 'Who has visited these two places can easily imagine how Hitler will emerge from the hatred currently surrounding him to emerge in a few years as one of the most important personalities that ever lived.' Kennedy's admiration for Nazi Germany . is revealed in a book entitled 'John F. Kennedy - Among the Germans. Travel diaries and letters 1937-1945.' When World War II did arrive, the future president's father, Joe P Kennedy, strongly opposed going into battle with Germany and made several missteps that severely damaged his political career. He adopted a defeatist, anti-war stance and tried to arrange a meeting with Adolf Hitler without the approval of the Department of State. The reasons for this are unclear - some speculate he was eager to do anything to avoid war because he feared that American capitalism - which he profited from - would not survive the country’s entry into the conflict. In his role as US ambassador to Britain he also opposed providing the UK with military and economic aid. He said in an interview 'Democracy is finished in England. It may be here [in the US]. During the World War II, JFK's older brother Joe volunteered for a secret mission testing an experimental drone plane packed with explosives - a weapon the Allies hoped to use as a guided missile. On the first test flight, the explosives detonated prematurely and the plane exploded - his body was never found.

"Tottenham will launch a bid for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez in the coming weeks. Although the England forward is recovering from surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, the White Hart Lane club are convinced he will be back in action before the end of the year. Southampton have already fielded bids of £25million from Manchester United for Luke Shaw and £20m from Liverpool for Adam Lallana and are now braced for Tottenham's opening gambit for Rodriguez. Earning his Spurs? Jay Rodriguez is a summer target for Tottenham . In good form: Rodriguez scored 17 goals for Southampton before his season was cut short by injury . The 24-year-old was in excellent form for Southampton prior to his injury scoring 17 goals and was pushing for inclusion in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad. Tottenham, who could yet appoint Southampton coach Mauricio Pochettino as their new manager, want more homegrown players to blend with the large influx of foreign players they invested heavily in last summer. Some of those will go, with Romanian centre-back Vlad Chiriches, Erik Lamela, Etienne Capoue, Roberto Soldado and the more established Jan Vertonghen all attracting interest - predominantly from Italian clubs. Rodriguez can play from the left of the attack or behind a main striker and his pace and intelligence gave Southampton a cutting edge that had hem pushing for European contention at one stage of the season. They face a difficult summer and will be fighting off more bids with Calum Chambers, Morgan Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Dejan Lovren all subject to interest from Premier League rivals. Reunited? Mauricio Pochettino and Rodriguez could both be at Spurs next season . Hammers eye move for defender Peruzzi . West Ham are showing an interest in Catania right-back Gino Peruzzi. The 21-year-old was due to sign for Sunderland last summer but the club pulled the plug on the deal as he had failed to recover sufficiently from a knee ligament operation. Argentina international Peruzzi had flown to England and agreed personal terms but medical reports meant Sunderland did not want to take a chance and a £5m move from Velez Sarsfield was put on hold. Peruzzi, however, went on to prove his fitness and secured a move to Italy for £4million. Hammer time: Catania's Gino Peruzzi (left) is a target for West Ham . He has gone on to play 22 games this season but was sent off for a second bookable offence at the weekend. Manager Sam Allardyce will hold a meeting with co-chairman David Sullivan tomorrow about the club's summer plans and will also find out about his own future. If the club wish to change manager it may mean Peruzzi will stay in Italy. Allardyce has been looking for around six new players and is also considering the likes of Norwich City's Robert Snodgrass, AC Milan striker M'Baye Niang and Southampton target Aaron Cresswell at Ipswich Town. One-time Allardyce target Josip Drmic at Nuremburg has signed for Bayer Leverkusen. Norwich, Cardiff, Wolves and Boro keen on Huddersfield's Clayton . Huddersfield are struggling to hold on to highly-rated midfielder Adam Clayton. The former Manchester City trainee has 12 months left on contract and is attracting a lot of attention from rival Championship clubs after another impressive season in which he was voted Huddersfield's player of the year. Wanted man: Huddersfield's Adam Clayton celebrates scoring is attracting interest from a number of clubs . Huddersfield rejected a £1million offer from Brighton in January for a player they bought from Leeds for £350,000 in 2012. They want him to stay but the 25-year-old is ambitious and Brighton remain keen while Norwich, Cardiff, Wolves and Middlesbrough also have an interest. Burnley set to move for Mallorca captain Nsue . Premier chance: Burnley could move for Emilio Nsue . Burnley could be poised to allow Real Mallorca captain Emilio Nsue to finally realise his Premier League dream. The 24-year-old was due to sign for Arsenal in 2009 only for personal tragedy to shatter his hopes. The former Spain U21 international had had his medical and was due to discuss terms with Arsenal when news came that his father had collapsed and died. Nsue cancelled the move to be with his grieving family and returned to Mallorca. The highly-rated right winger was part of Spain's European Championship U21 winning squad in 2011 along side Juan Mata and David de Gea but has since opted to play for Equitorial Guinea in tribute to his late father. Nsue, however, is now ready to make his mark in England and Burnley are among those to have shown interest with the possibility he can leave Mallorca for free. West Bromwich Albion have also shown an interest. Sunderland, Spurs, Southampton, West Ham and Hull keen on Swansea's Taylor . Swansea defender Neil Taylor is in demand this summer as well as teammate Ben Davies. The left-back who was the subject of a failed £4million bid from Fulham in January, is weighing up his next move ahead of a summer of change at Swansea. Taylor, who has started 18 games this season, is keen to be playing more regularly and will discuss his future with Swansea boss Garry Monk over the coming weeks. In demand: Neil Taylor could leave Swansea this summer . The 25-year-old has two years left on contract but has interest from Sunderland, Tottenham, Southampton, West Ham and Hull City. Gosling set for Bournemouth move . Dan Gosling is expected to sign for Bournemouth over the coming days. The Championship side made their first approach for the Newcastle midfielder in March and are proposing a long term contract to persuade the 24-year-old to move back to the south coast. Gosling, who began his career at Plymouth, has failed to reach his potential following his acrimonious move from Everton to Newcastle. He made 24 appearances this season including a loan spell at Blackpool where he scored two goals and has made four starts for Newcastle since returning in February. Heading south: Dan Gosling is set to join Bournemouth . QPR keen on midfielder Sammir . Queens Park Rangers are planning ahead for the summer by watching Getafe midfielder Sammir. The 27-year-old was born in Brazil but has been capped by Croatia and holds a Croatian passport. An attacking midfielder, Sammir rose to prominence at Dinamo Zagreb where he replaced Luka Modric and scored 46 goals in 173 games. Heading to England? Getafe's Jorge Sammir is being watched by QPR . He joined Getafe in February but is interested in a move to England with Getafe three points above the relegation zone with one game left. QPR are expecting a high turnover of players this summer regardless of whether they go up or stay in the Championship. Sammir, full name Jorge Sammir Cruz Campos, is affordable at around £3million. Blow for United as Reus commits future to Dortmund . Marco Reus has seemingly ruled out a summer move to Manchester United by insisting he is staying with Borussia Dortmund. United were poised to bid for the 24-year-old who has a release clause of £27.5million. Yet in an interview with Kicker-Sportmagazin, he said: 'It's safe to say I will be playing for Borussia Dortmund also in the 2014/2015 season. Staying put:  Marco Reus says he is staying at Dortmund . 'Basically I do not need to stress all the time that I am feeling great being with the club. As far as leaving (Borussia Dortmund) that is no issue for me, and I am not affected by it (the transfer release clause).'","Spurs keen to strengthen strike force with move for England man Rodriguez .

"Most grandmothers are known for baking cookies and pinching cheeks, but Willie Murphy doesn't stop there. At 77 years old, this 105-pound grandma can lift twice her weight...and maybe even yours too. Murphy is a self-taught, self-trained, competitive powerlifter and can effortlessly do one-handed pull-ups, one-handed push-ups and fingertip push-ups, according to the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. She began lifting five-pound weights four years ago after seeing a sign about a local weight-lifting competition. In November, Murphy won her division in the World Natural Powerlifting Federation World Championships in November. But wait, there's more. This super-ripped granny won multiple awards this year at the WNPF New York State Powerfest competition in Henrietta including the WNPF 2014 Lifter of the Year award with several first-place awards in lifting exercises including power curl, bench press, and bench press repetitions, the Democrat & Chronicle reports. 'I wanted to become better, to have a little edge in life,' Murphy told the Democrat & Chronicle, 'So I started the weight training. So, little by little, I got stronger and stronger.' Murphy told USA Today that her strength is completely natural, 'none of those steroids for me,' she said. She said she works out three times a week and eats what ever she wants including pizza and rum with cranberry juice. Murphy credits her weightlifting as the reason she can shovel her own snow, carry her own groceries, lift her grandchildren, and even push her own car when it gets stuck in the snow. The septuagenarian lifts 215 pounds and told USA Today that she hopes to inspire women, seniors, and people of color who suffer higher rates of high blood pressure and diabetes. 'She is so spunky, sweet and inspirational,' Lisa Greer, director of administration and member services at the Maplewood Family YMCA, told the Democrat & Chronicle. 'I couldn't do half the things she does.' Murphy has reportedly received a lot of praise from people at her gym since her recent powerlifting wins. When people congratulate her, the Democrat and Chronicle reports, Murphy says thank you and curtseys. 'They see I'm old and I'm not being pushed around in a wheelchair,' Murphy said. 'I'm almost 80 years old and I am still living life.'","Willie Murphy is a 77-year-old powerlifter who just won multiple awards at a world championship powerlifting competition .

"An unruly pig and its owner were escorted from a US Airways flight after it began defecating on the floor and squealing uncontrollably, a passenger has told Mail Online. Rob Phelps was travelling from Hartford, Connecticut, to Washington's Reagan Airport for Thanksgiving on Wednesday morning when he saw the animal being led into the cabin on a leash. The 65-year-old described how the 80-pound pig was screaming 'three times louder than a child' as its female companion coaxed it down the aisle with her feet because it struggled to move on its own. 'It was ridiculous,' he said. 'It started to smell and flight attendants told her to clean the mess up.' Ordeal: A passenger has described how a pig that was escorted from a US Airways flight was defecating everywhere and squealing uncontrollably, forcing flight attendants to escort its owner off the plane . Interaction: Rob Phelps, 63, described how the woman was talking to the pig like a human during the ordeal, calling it a 'jerk' for not behaving. He added that the pig weighed around 80 pounds . Mr Phelps from Havenville, Western Massachusetts, who was with his wife at the time, said after five or ten minutes a number of passengers began to complain as the pig got more and more distressed. He added that during the encounter the woman was talking to the animal like a human being, calling it a 'jerk' for not behaving. She had been allowed to take it onto the plane for 'emotional support', based on guidelines released by the Department for Transportation. Staff realized it wasn't going to work, so the animal and passenger were led out of the cabin. Mr Phelps said that they did not encounter the pig until they boarded the plane, saying everything was normal. Describing the moment passengers saw the creature, he said: 'There was instant silence. There was a mixture of controllable laughter and shock. You couldn't write this. 'I have seen dogs and cats in cages on a plane - but never a pig. 'This was not a small pig. When she held it over her shoulder it reached her waist. 'I don't even know how it got through. You have the TSA and intense security and yet it still was let on board.' Mr Phelps said that the pig was the only thing the rest of the travelers spoke about the rest of the flight, and he was still laughing about it when he sat down for his turkey on Thursday. American Airlines, the parent company of US Airways, said the woman had the pig as an emotional support animal - which is allowed under Department for Transportation guidelines . In 2012 it was revealed that the Department of Transportation had certain guidelines allowing animals, including pot-bellied pigs, could be taken on flights. Along with monkeys and miniature horses, they could be designated as 'Emotional Support'. Transportation officers would have to determine whether the animal is permitted on the plane by running through a list of guidelines. Pigs are favored service animals for people allergic to dogs. Guidelines suggest they are intelligent companions and attuned to dangerous situations. American Airlines, the parent company of US Airways, said the woman had the pig as an emotional support animal and was asked to leave the plane after it became disruptive.","Woman boarded US Airways plane in Hartford, Connecticut on Wednesday .

"Russia issued a thinly-veiled warning to Moldova not to forge closer links with Europe after pro-Western parties sneaked an election victory yesterday. The three main pro-Europe parties in Moldova have about 44 per cent of the vote, despite the pro-Russian Socialist party receiving the highest number of votes in yesterday's election. This will see them hold 57-58 seats in Moldova's 101-seat parliament, while the two pro-Russian opposition parties will get 43-44 seats. Deputy Prime Minister of Russia accused Moldova of rigging the election results by banning one pro-Russian party on the eve of the vote. He also criticised the country for depriving about 500,000 residents of the Russian-backed breakaway region of Trans-Dniester from voting. He said: 'Kishinev (Russian name for Moldova capital) better think, ""Comrades have you chosen the right road?""' Scroll down for video . Moldovan residents voted in the crucial election yesterday, which saw the three pro-European parties record the highest number of votes - it is thought they will now form a 'grand coalition' The sign which translates as 'I vote pro-Europe' demonstrates the feeling of pro EU sentiment in the country . Moldovan students gathered today with signs 'I vote pro-Europe', 'We want democracy' and 'we want justice' Serving Prime Minister Iurie Ciocan has seen Moldova establish closer ties with Europe since 2009 . In the election results, the pro-Russian Socialist Party led with more than 21 per cent of the vote. The Communist Party - a Soviet era survivor that still uses the hammer and sickle as its symbol -  was in third with almost 18 per cent. In second place were the pro-EU Liberal Democrats with 19 per cent. The party wants Moldova to achieve EU candidate status by 2017 and full membership by 2020. Two other pro-Europe parties - the Democrats and the Liberals - are on 16 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. It is now thought they will try to form a pro-European 'grand coalition' although that is likely to face opposition from Vladimir Putin's Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Turkey today, has already shown his displeasure for the country establishing closer links with the EU by banning imports of wines, vegetables and meat . The pro-European coalition is likely to face opposition from the Russian President . The elections have taken on greater significance as Moldova, one of Europe's smallest and poorest countries, borders on war-torn Ukraine. Ukraine has been in crisis since November last year, when the former leadership made a last-minute U-turn, refusing to sign a landmark association and free trade deal with the EU - under huge pressure from Russia. That resulted in mass protests in Ukraine that toppled President Viktor Yanukovych, and the country later signed the EU deal. But the protests, in turn, led to Russia annexing southern Crimea peninsula in March and backing rebels in eastern Ukraine. Since then, the two countries have been locked in a bitter conflict that is the most dangerous to grip Europe since the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Vladimir Voronin, leader of Moldova's Communist party, casts his vost in Chisinau, Moldova . A child casts her father's ballot at a polling station in Chisinau during yesterday's election . Russia believes NATO is destabilising northern Europe and the Baltic states, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Meshkov has said. He has accused NATO of  strengthening ties with east European countries that were once dominated by the Soviet Union and Moscow. Mr Meshkov said: 'NATO are trying to destabilise the most stable region in the world - northern Europe. 'The endless military exercises, transferring aircraft capable of carrying nuclear arms to the Baltic states. This reality is extremely negative.' He added: 'The Russian authorities are and will be taking every step to firmly safeguard the security of Russia and its citizens ... no matter which part of our country it concerns.' Moldova’s breakaway pro-Russian enclave of Transdniestria - which did not take part in the election - gives Russia a potential foot-hole in the country of 3.5 million. However, Moscow has so far shown no desire to intervene. But it has shown its displeasure for the pro-EU policies by prohibiting imports of wines, vegetables and meat from a struggling economy that relies on agricultural exports. However, analysts say that with Moldova already gaining from the recent EU deal that enables its citizens to travel visa-free to western Europe - the pro-European sentiment in the country will be hard to overcome. A three-party coalition, led by prime minister Iurie Leanca’s Liberal Democrats, has seen Moldova establish closer ties with Europe since 2009. He has said he wants full EU membership for Moldova by 2020. Turnout at yesterday's election was just under 56 per cent, the central electoral commission said, out of a total of 2.7 million eligible voters.","Three pro-Western parties in Moldova have about 44 per cent of the vote .

"It's one of the most advanced robots under development by the US military. The cheetah, described as the 'Ferrari in the robotics world', could be used on the battlefield in just ten years, according to its creators. The stealthy machine can run faster than Usain bolt, jumps 16 inches (40 cm) and gallops for 15 minutes - all while using less power than a microwave. Scroll down for video . It's a robot unlike any other: inspired by the world's fastest land animal, controlled by video game technology and packing sensors - including one used to maneuver drones, satellites and ballistic missiles . It is the creation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who had to design key elements from scratch because of a lack of or shortcomings in existing technology. That includes powerful, lightweight motors; electronics that control power for its 12 motors; and an algorithm that determines the amount of force a leg should exert within a split second. This allows the machine to reach speeds of up to 30mph (48kph) over difficult terrain. Insight gleaned from the design of their prototype could have real-world applications, including the design of revolutionary prosthetics, wearable technologies and all-terrain wheelchairs. There are hopes the robot will be able to be used in search and rescue operations in hazardous or hostile environments where it's too risky to send a human rescuer. The elegant machine can run faster than Usain bolt, jumps 16 inches (40 cm) high and gallops for 15 minutes . The cheetah, described as the 'Ferrari in the robotics world', could be saving lives on the battlefield in just ten years, according to its creators. Researcher Hae Won Park is shown here plugging batteries into the cheetah . 'In the next 10 years, our goal is we are trying to make this robot to save a life,' said MIT Professor Sangbae Kim. 'When the robot is running, at every step, we calculate the appropriate amount of the force to the legs so that the robot can balance itself,' added MIT research scientist Hae-Won Park. Sensors inside the robot measure the angle of the leg and that information is sent to an onboard computer that also organises data from the Inertial Measurement Unit which is also used to manoeuvre drones. The project is funded by the US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, who is developing a similar robot being alongside Boston Dynamics. The cheetah is Earth's fastest land animal, able to accelerate to 60 mph (96 kph) in a few seconds . Speed and agility are hallmarks of the cheetah. The predator is the fastest land animal on Earth, able to accelerate to 60 mph (96 kph) in just a few seconds. As it ramps up to top speed, a cheetah pumps its legs in tandem, bounding until it reaches a full gallop, the MIT team say - and their robo-cheetah can do the same . The flexible spine, as well as unique leg muscles, give a cheetah's legs abroad swing range, allow the animal to achieve a stride of 25 ft (7.6 metres). The MIT team say the act of running can be parsed into a number of biomechanically distinct gaits, from trotting and cantering to more dynamic bounding and galloping. In bounding, an animal's front legs hit the ground together, followed by its hind legs, similar to the way that rabbits hop — a relatively simple gait that the researchers chose to model first. 'Bounding is like an entry-level high-speed gait, and galloping is the ultimate gait,' Kim says. 'Once you get bounding, you can easily split the two legs and get galloping.' As a cheetah bounds, its legs touch the ground for a fraction of a second before cycling through the air again. The percentage of time a leg spends on the ground rather than in the air is referred to in biomechanics as a 'duty cycle'; the faster an animal runs, the shorter its duty cycle. 'In the next 10 years, our goal is we are trying to make this robot to save a life,' said MIT Professor Sangbae Kim, who is pictured here alongside a prototype of the robotic cheetah . MIT researchers Randall Briggs, left, and Will Bosworth monitor the robotic cheetah during an early test run . MIT scientists said the robot (left), modeled after the fastest land animal, may have real-world applications, including the design of revolutionary prosthetics, wearable technologies and all-terrain wheelchairs. The machine could beat Usain bolt (right) in a race . The company says its version is powered by an off-board hydraulic pump and uses a boom-like device to keep it running in the centre of the treadmill. Crafting the cheetah robot took five years of designing, testing, tweaking and plenty of confidence to ignore those who said electric motors aren't strong enough to propel a running mechanical cheetah powered by batteries. Researchers had to exercise a lot of patience during test runs. The robot broke dozens of legs manufactured by 3D printers and reinforced with Kevlar strips and carbon fiber. Strong, lightweight components make untethered running possible, including a carbon fiber-and-foam sandwich frame that can absorb the forces generated by running and jumping. Some off-the-shelf components, including an Xbox controller for manoeuvring the robot and wireless internet communications for sending commands, were also used. Each leg is propelled by three motors that can generate powerful forces at slow speeds. Still, researchers continue to tweak their prototype, looking to add additional sensors that would eventually make the robot autonomous.

"A man who had racially abused a stranger was knocked out by one punch and left unable to even drink through a straw after his victim's brother 'saw red' and hit him from behind. Zack Collins had made insulting remarks to random people in the street as he staggered home from a nightclub in Plymouth with a friend. One of these comments was aimed at the brother of Sami Krasniqi - who later hit Collins after he had become fed up with his family enduring racist abuse on an almost daily basis. Krasniqi knocked out Mr Collins with a single punch - leaving him with six missing teeth, a broken bone in his ear canal and a fractured jaw. Mr Collins was unable to eat solid foods for two weeks because of the injuries to his jaw, and was in so much pain he could not suck up blended food through a straw. Zack Collins (circled left) was knocked out by a single punch, leaving him with a fractured jaw and in so much pain he could not drink through a straw, after Sami Krasniqi heard him racially abuse his brother and another man as he walked home from a night out. Krasniqi (circled right) walked up to him and punched from behind . Plymouth Crown Court heard that Krasniqi, who pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, had only intended to give Mr Collins 'a fat lip' when he walked up to him and hit him from behind. CCTV showed Krasniqi putting Mr Collins in the recovery position when he fell to the floor after he punched him. Krasniqi was arrested and jailed for eight months for the attack. The court heard Mr Collins had been out clubbing with a friend in Plymouth and was highly intoxicated when he left and the pair began walking home at 6am on June 22. He made a number of abusive comments to strangers in the street, including to a man who turned out to be Krasniqi's brother. Mr Collins's friend told police he held him back and apologised for his comments, before dragging him away from Krasniqi's brother, who he had just insulted. CCTV operators spotted the pair and tracked them, apparently catching Mr Collins making a comment to a black man, while Krasniqi and his brother walked behind. The court heard then the 'red mist came down' for Krasniqi - and despite only intending to give Mr Collins a 'fat lip' - Krasniqi punched him once, hard, to the back of the head. This single punch knocked Mr Collins out and he fell to the floor. Alistair Verheijen, prosecuting, said Mr Collins lost two of his upper front teeth, four of his lower front teeth, and suffered a cut to his cheek, a fractured jaw, and an inch-long cut to his tongue. A bone in his ear canal was also fractured. Mr Collins was seen on CCTV staggering home through Plymouth with a friend when he insulted strangers . After he saw Mr Collins insult a black man Krasniqi walked up to him and punched him hard in the head . He said Mr Collins was in such pain and discomfort he was even unable to suck up blended food through a straw. Officers who arrested Krasniqi also found he had a knife with a two-and-a-half inch blade, but the court heard this was not used in the attack and he had it with him because he used it for work. Nigel Hall, defending, said Krasniqi had not realised the man he was following was Mr Collins, who had earlier abused his brother. He also said members of his family had endured 'some form of racial abuse' on a daily basis and a 'red mist came down.'  Krasniqi had become fed up with the constant racist abuse, having also been subjected to a tirade of comments from a woman earlier that evening who he had accidentally bumped into. Krasniqi was arrested by police and jailed for eight months after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm . Mr Hall said Krasniqi was 'absolutely remorseful' and never intended to seriously harm Mr Collins. He said Krasniqi 'has to realise he can't take the law into his own hands – he knows that racial abuse isn't going to stop and he has to learn how to deal with it.' The court heard Krasniqi was already subject to a 12 month sentence, suspended for 18 months after an incident the previous December where he threw a glass at a woman in a pub. Judge Alan Large sentenced Krasniqi to four months for breaching the suspended sentence and eight months for the latest offence to run consecutively, totalling 12 months.","Zack Collins was staggering home from a nightclub in Plymouth at 6am .

"Lax border regulations in Eastern Europe are providing a back-door route into the EU and fuelling an alarming trade in illegal passports, The Mail on Sunday has discovered. Many former Soviet countries are keen to offer citizenship to ethnic minorities who want to return to their homelands. But this has also fuelled an illicit trade, mostly controlled by agencies with links to the Russian mafia. Scroll down for video . Many potential new EU citizens are being created as some former Soviet countries are keen to offer citizenship to ethnic minorities . The Latvian government has begun granting citizenship to descendants of Stalin’s victims deported to Siberia in the 1940s. Poland, Germany, Romania and Hungary have similar schemes for descendants of their own people trapped in the former USSR. Potential new EU citizens created by this perfectly legal route could run into millions but it also opens the way for major passport fraud. The Mail on Sunday has tracked down agencies offering to broker EU passports for citizens of Russia and war-ravaged Ukraine who are not entitled to these documents. One Kiev agency boasts that for between €7,500 (£6,000) and €15,000 (£12,000) its lawyers ‘have built up some relatively quick methods to acquire Romanian citizenship and passports, as well as citizenship of a number of other EU countries’. It also boasts Ukrainians with an EU passport will get the right to work ‘in England’. The agency boss told our researcher: ‘Once we find your Romanian relatives, you have to prove in court that they are authentic.’ On researcher said she was keen to get an EU passport as it would give her the right to work anywhere in Europe, including the UK . When she insisted she did not have any such relatives, she was told: ‘No matter. What we do is just find someone with a matching last name who lived in the country before 1940.’ Another option, she was told, was a Hungarian passport, at a cost of €22,000 (£17,500). When the researcher said she didn’t speak Hungarian, again she was told this did not matter. ‘Our specialists will go through the church books and other databases. Once we find the person, it’s almost done. You just have to show up in Budapest to get your passport and an ID card. You’ll get all the benefits of being a Hungarian and EU citizen.’ When our researcher explained she ultimately wanted to live and work in the UK, she was told: ‘Like any Hungarian citizen, you’ll get the right to work anywhere in Europe, including the UK.’","Some former Soviet countries are offering citizenship to ethnic minorities .

"Think of a Stone Age hand axe and you may imagine a simple teardrop shape hewn from flint. But archaeologists in Denmark have uncovered a rare 5,500-year old axe complete with its wooden handle. The Neolithic tool was revealed during a dig to prepare for a tunnel and may have been rammed into the ground as some sort of ritual offering. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists in Denmark have uncovered a rare 5,500-year old axe with a wooden handle (pictured). The Neolithic tool was revealed during a dig to prepare for a tunnel and may have been rammed into the ground as some sort of ritual offering . The flint axe’s wooden handle was preserved because the tool was shoved into the clay seabed, where oxygen could not reach it, according to archaeologists at the Museum Lolland-Falster. The team uncovered the tool in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which will be connected to the German island of Fehmarn when the tunnel is built. ‘Finding a hilt axe that is so well preserved is absolutely incredible,’ said Søren Anker Sørensen, archaeologist at the museum. The team uncovered the tool in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland along with other wooden tools, while they were excavating the site of the Femern Belt Tunnel (marked). The island will be connected to the German island of Fehmarn when the tunnel is built . A flint halberd was found less than one metre from the axe, also placed vertically in the mud, suggesting it too was a ritual offering . Archaeologists working on excavations of the Femern Belt Tunnel in Lolland found evidence of at least two people's footprints, dating back to the Stone Age. The experts believe they were left by fishermen attempting to protect nearby river barriers during poor weather. 'It is quite surreal to have found human footprints,' said archaeologist Terje Stafseth. 'We normally find historical clues in the form of human waste, but here we have found an entirely different clue and a first in Danish archaeology: a physical print left behind by a human.' 'We know about animal footprints being found from the past, but human footprints have, as far as I know, never been found in Danish Stone Age archaeology.' The footprints were found running along a 3.2ft-long (one metre) system of fishing weirs used to feed a nearby Stone Age community. Their close proximity to these barriers, as well as their depth and position, suggest that a storm caused the barriers to flood and become covered in sand. Using the size of the prints as a guide, experts from Lolland-Falster Museum believe that the poor weather threatened the barriers, and the fishermen would have waded into the water to try to protect them. As each print was made, sand was pushed into the seabed and became preserved over time. ‘Because of the unique preservation conditions, we have found much organic matter in the course of the excavations, including a large number of…candlesticks. Dr told MailOnline: 'Two wooden paddles, also placed verticalyl in the seabed, eight wooden spears and six axe handles without the axes, are some of the many spectacular finds we discovered. 'In the same area we have found depositions of ceramic and animal bones, in one concentration we found about 60 jaws from different animals, together with two antler axes made from red deer antler, both with small pieces of the wooden handles preserved in the shaft holes. Dr Sørensen said that then the team saw most of the axe stuck 12 inches (30cm) into the ground, they knew they had ‘a unique find’. Stone Age people living in the area used such axes for working wood and they played a role in converting Europe into an agricultural region, because dense forests had to be cleared to make way for fields in which to grow crops or let animals graze. But the experts believe the axe played a role in religious life at the time too. With the introduction of agriculture, societies became more hierarchical and religion became more important too. The archaeologists say that the communities of south Lolland may have used the coast as an offering area and nearby marshes and wetlands show signs of burial customs and rituals, in the forms of large stone graves. ‘The vertical objects found in the excavations east of Rødbyhavn, clearly shows that people have used the coast [as a] sacrifice area,’ they said. The experts believe that objects such as the axe were ‘deliberately’ stabbed in underground clay as part of a ritual. Dr Sørensen explained: 'The interpretation as a ritual find is mainly based on the fact that many of the artefacts are placed vertically in the ground, which is not the normal way for artefacts in an archaeological context. 'It tells us that the axe and other artefacts are placed on purpose in the shallow water just off the coast and there are no obvious functional or profane explanation for this. That’s why we see it as ritual depositions. So far, the excavations have also revealed uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints and archaeologists hope to discover more interesting offerings buried in the clay.

"More than 200 people were safely evacuated from an American Airlines plane that landed at New York City's Kennedy Airport  on Sunday afternoon following a bomb scare. Flight AA67 from Barcelona, Spain, landed and was taken to a specially designated - and remote - hanger just after noon. Firefighters and PAPD K-9 units conducted a thorough search of the Boeing 767 and the FDNY tweeted two hours later that the incident was under control and no bomb had been found on board. More than 200 people were safely evacuated from an American Airlines plane that landed at New York City's Kennedy Airport on Sunday afternoon following a bomb scare . Once the plane had safely landed, passengers were allowed to take their carry-on luggage and they were directed them to a grassy area on the side of the runway to await buses to take them to the terminal . The bomb threat was made on Sunday morning about an American Airlines flight landing at JFK from Barcelona that was searched by the bomb squad on arrival . Emergency services were placed on standby and twenty-five units and 105 firefighters responded to the airport. All 200 passengers and nine crew were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. The incident isn't believed to have any impact on other flights at the airport and the FBI has been notified. Joe Pentangelo with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police said all is now clear after the bomb threat. 'It was apparently a telephone bomb threat,' said Pentangelo and authorities have begun investigating where the call came from. One passenger told the New York Times that the plane landed early, but instead of heading to a gate it was taxied away from the terminal and then stopped without explanation. All 200 passengers and nine crew were safely evacuated off the plane without injury . Eventually a member of the crew announced via the intercom that there had been a bomb threat made against American Airlines and 'this was just a precaution,' said Teresa Dietrich. 'It’s a little nerve-racking, because you’re not quite sure exactly what’s going on,' she said. Passengers were however allowed to take their carry-on luggage as they left the plane and they were then directed them to a grassy area on the side of the runway to await buses to take them to the terminal. 'It never seemed rushed; it never seemed panicked; it was fairly orderly,' Dietrich said.

"Beards may have seen a resurgence over recent years, but they have been used as status symbols for millenia. The discovery of a 4,000-year-old blade in Russia, said to have been used for shaving and trimming, reveals the importance of looking well-presented during the Bronze Age. Archaeologists explained that the thin bronze plate had been sharpened on both sides and added that it may have even doubled up as a knife. The 4,000-year-old blade (pictured) is said to have been used for shaving during the Bronze Age. Archaeologists said the thin plate had been sharpened on both sides and believe it was used to trim beards, cut hair, and may have even doubled up as a knife . Vyacheslav Molodin, the deputy head of the Siberian Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, told The Siberian Times: 'The site was long ago classified as belonging to the developed Bronze era but the bronze object was the first found there. 'It is a thin bronze plate, sharpened on all sides [and] was a more universally-used tool.' Mr Molodin found the blade during an expedition to a site of ancient settlement in the Vengerovo region of Novosibirsk. The oldest razor ever found is believed to date back to 18,000 BC. Early implements were made from clam shells, shark teeth and flint sharpened on rocks. They rose in popularity during the Bronze Age, when they were made of metal and were oval. In particular, they are often linked with members of an early Celtic culture called Hallstatt, that spanned Iron and Bronze Ages. Men used razors as status symbols, and many were personal to their owners. Some were elaborately decorated, and often buried with their owners. Straight razors were introduced during the 18th  century and became common place in barbers, before double-edge and safety blades were manufactured by King Camp Gillette in the early 1900s. Following World War I, men had to shave daily so their gas masks would fit, and safety razors become standard issue during the WWII.

"Kirsty, 31, decided that she needed to lose weight after her brother announced his engagement . A mother of five who dreaded the thought of attending her brother's wedding because of her size has lost 10 stone ahead of his big day. Kirsty Armstrong, from Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, dropped half her body weight slimming from 20 stone and a size 28 to 9st 6lbs and a size 10-12 in time for the big day. The 31-year-old had struggled with her size for years but finally found the inspiration to shed the pounds when she found out her brother was tying the knot - swapping takeaways and junk food for fresh fruit and vegetables. Kirsty said her inspiration behind her weight loss was the thought of being overweight in the wedding photos. She said: 'My brother was getting married in July and I wanted to lose weight for his wedding. 'I never had the confidence but I would try to eat healthy and it wouldn't ever really work.' Kirsty added that no matter how big her efforts had been in the past, her bad habits had crept into her eating, taking her to 20st 1lb. 'I would just pick off the kids' plates and snack on crisps during the day and then have a takeaway meal for dinner after they went to bed,' she said. But in January, determined to change her ways, Kirsty joined New Herrington Slimming World group which meets once a week at St Aidens Parish Centre for support. Kirsty said that the slimming group was more effective than going it alone as there was a sense of unity. 'The slimming group is just a massive support for me,' she said. 'There's loads of us in there. There's a girl who is 14 up to a man who is in his 70s. It didn't take long to see changes. In the first two weeks I lost 6.5lbs and in the third week 7lb.' Scroll down for video . Kirsty may have seen quick results but she said losing weight wasn't easy. Kirsty's routine had a complete overhaul adding exercise to her schedule as well as changing almost everything about her diet in order to shift the weight. 'I eat loads of fresh fruit and vegetables. I don't have takeaways and I cook a lot from scratch. I have proper meals now,' she said. Kirsty lost half her body weight - from a size 28 (right) and to a size 10-12 (left) in time for the wedding . 'I always cooked for my kids but now because I have loads of fruit and veg they snack on that too. 'I also did loads of walking. I started walking my dogs for three or four miles.' By the time of her brother's wedding, Kirsty had reached her goal having lost 8 stone. However, spurred on by her success she continued to slim and lost an additional 2 stone. Kirsty's weight loss was so dramatic that it even saw her shortlisted in the Slimming World's Woman of the Year competition where she got to meet Hollyoaks, Casualty and Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps star Will Mellor. Kirsty says that the whole experience left her completely star-struck. 'It was a once in a lifetime experience meeting Will Mellor, absolutely amazing. He was really lovely. He told me I'd done amazing and looked great.' Aside from the celebrity perks, Kirsty says that her weight loss has also helped to improve her relationship with her children. 'I can do more with the kids and it's given me more confidence,' Kirsty added. 'I can run around with them which I couldn't do before.'","31-year-old Kirsty Armstrong was a size 28 and weighed 20 stone .

"Car-free Sundays could be introduced to central London, Boris Johnson suggested today, after being inspired by cycling alongside thousands of Indonesians in Jakarta. The London mayor took part in a mass cycle alongside the recently-inaugurated President Joko Widodo on the latest stop of a high-profile six-day regional tour. Every Sunday, several main boulevards of Jakarta are closed to all traffic from 6am, allowing tens of thousands of Indonesians to pour into the streets on bikes and on foot, with street stalls and music offering a carnival atmosphere. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson in Jakarta yesterday, said he was impressed by the 'Car Free Sunday' Every Sunday several of the main boulavards in Jakarta are closed to all motor traffic . After breakfast with the president, Mr Johnson said: 'Wasn't that sensational? I have to admit I was blown away by the popularity of the car-free Sunday here in Jakarta. 'We have been thinking about it for ages - I don't think you are going to get the British people out of bed at six in the morning to do it quite like that but it is certainly food for thought. 'I will certainly be asking TfL (Transport for London) to dust down those old ideas and let's have a look at them again. 'I think it would probably take time to bed in and it would take a few years before people got into the swing of coming out into the streets and making use of the space that a car-free Sunday provided. But it was very stimulating.' In a later interview with the BBC Radio 5 John Pienaar's Politics show, Mr Johnson said it would be important to look at the traffic implications and other logistics of such an event. For the past two years, several miles of central London streets have been closed on a Saturday in August for the Freecycle event, a key event in cycling festival which also include the Ride London 100 mass participation and pro-cycling races. Mr Johnson, pictured, said he was 'blown away' by the experience and said he would consider it for London . Hundreds of cyclists take to the streets of Jakarta, pictured, every Sunday while the cars are banned . Jakarta's event has been running for 16 years and become a weekly, rather than monthly, event when Mr Widodo was governor. Since his meteoric rise to the presidency earlier this year, Mr Widodo has met only a handful of foreign leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and US Secretary of State John Kerry. Prime Minister David Cameron had a brief encounter with the new president at the G20 meeting in Brisbane earlier this month. Following the business breakfast, Mr Johnson said it had been a useful meeting. He said: 'We discussed co-operation in the financial sector, the investment Indonesia is hoping to attract from Britain and other European countries... transport infrastructure. 'We talked about the coming Asian Games and our experience in London of dealing with the Olympics and the lessons of some of the ideas we could share about security, providing for the athletes' village, which is always a very difficult issue. 'All those sorts of things - exchanges of students, we are very keen to have more Indonesian students come and study in London. We had a very wide wide-ranging discussion.' Asked by the BBC if Mr Widodo had tips on 'fulfilling the dream of going from mayor to head of state', Mr Johnson laughed off the question and added: 'No... it was a very interesting conversation. 'I think genuinely there is a real eagerness to see more investment from Britain but also to discover more about what Britain has to offer by way of trade and the opportunities for Indonesians to invest in our country. 'That was the bulk of it.'

"Researchers have uncovered an 'underwater Pomepii' in the sea off the Greek coast. Remains of an ancient settlement, complete with a ruined pottery workshop, were discovered on the bottom of the Aegean sea off the small island of Delos. Archaeologists found 16 terracotta pots and remains of a kiln embedded in the sea floor. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists found 16 terracotta pots and remains of a kiln embedded in the sea floor. The area was previously thought to be part of a port. Dubbed by the Greek media 'a small underwater Pompeii,' the structures lay at a depth of just 6 feet on the northeastern coast of Delos, according to Discovery News. 'In the past these ruins were identified as port facilities,' the culture ministry said. The new investigation by the National Hellenic Research Foundation and the Ephorate of Undersea Archaeology, found that rather than a dock, a pottery workshop and other buildings once stood at the site. Archaeologists found 16 terracotta pots and remains of a kiln embedded in the sea floor. 'Similar workshops have been found in Pompeii and Herculaneum,' the ministry said. Large stones were found lined in front of the workshop remains. According to the archaeologists, they were probably part of the settlement's waterfront. Structural elements such fallen colonnades and walls were found along the coastline . Large boulders were identified as part of the original breakwater, at one time used for stopping the power of the sea from battering the workshop and settlement. Structural elements such fallen colonnades and walls were found along the coastline, and large boulders were identified as part of the original breakwater, at one time used for stopping the power of the sea from battering the workshop and settlement. Possibly related to commercial and crafting activities, the settlement somehow collapsed. The man-made ruins have remained hidden on the sea bed ever since. Further research on the underwater findings is expected to add new information on the commercial role of the island during the Roman period. The island of Delos, near Mykonos, is one of the most important mythological, historical and archaeological sites in Greece. The excavations in the island are among the most extensive in the Mediterranean. Delos had a position as a holy sanctuary for a millennium before Olympian Greek mythology made it the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. During its height from the 8th until the 1st centuries B.C., it was a busy commercial port and a main center for slave trade. According to Greek mythology Hera, wife of Zeus, had banned a pregnant Leto from giving birth on 'terra firma' after discovering that Zeus was the father. Delos was a floating island, tethered neither to the land nor sea, which suited Leto's needs. She gave birth to Apollo and Artemis, and Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean.

For much of antiquity people were not allowed to die or give birth on the sacred island. It's cecline came as the troops of Mithridates VI of Pontus attacked the island in 88 BC, slaughtering 20,000 inhabitants. Raided by pirates and invaders, Delos was abandoned around the 5th century A.D., and many of its ancient marbles were used as building materials by the inhabitants of the nearby islands.","Dubbed by the Greek media 'a small underwater Pompeii'

"An expert claims the loud bangs which baffled Britons last night sounded like a type of experimental jet engine  - which conspiracy theorists enjoy linking to a rumoured spy plane. Dr Bhupendra Khandelwal added his comparison to a debate which began when hundreds of Twitter users from Aberdeen to Devon - and even New York - reported 'explosions' which shook windows and disturbed sleeping children at around 10pm. One resident in Croydon, South London, recorded the sounds on her phone in a mystery that has left Britons blaming meteors, an 'alien invasion', 'the end of the world'... or just fireworks. Could it be? An artist's image of the so-called Aurora project. Enthusiasts say one possible power source is a 'pulse detonation engine', whose sound is said to resemble that caught on an audio clip last night (below) Dr Khandelwal, an engineering research associate from Sheffield, is among a team of scientists working on the technology behind types of 'pulse detonation engine'. 'It makes the same kind of pulsing sound as the one on this audio,' he told MailOnline. ‘When we run a test engine it’s a real industrial noise and you can hear it for miles. We have people coming to us asking to make less noise or keep it to the daytime.' The engine works by using the force from a series of explosions, caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake, to thrust itself forward. It can theoretically power planes at five times the speed of sound. The technology builds upon 'pulsejet' principles which first emerged in the early 1900s and were used in German V-1 flying bombs. Test flights using the most recent forms of the technology have lasted only a few seconds, but it is still listed by conspiracy theorists as a possible way of powering the so-called Aurora spy jet. The theorists have cited 'Aurora' – a name which appeared in a Pentagon budget report in the 1980s – as an ongoing spy plane project for several years. Officials routinely deny it exists. Of course, that has not dampened the spirits of the theorists, who point to a sighting of a mysterious triangular object by a North Sea oil engineer in August 1989. Last year Lockheed Martin also unveiled plans for a spy plane that could fly at Mach 6, twice as fast as its famed SR-71 Blackbird, and said a missile demonstrating the new technology could fly as early as 2018. Dr Khandelwal was keen to distance himself from the world of conspiracy theories, though he conceded there could always some things unknown to the public. ‘Of course we can’t know for sure if someone else could have the technology already,' he said. Loud noises: People from Croydon (left) to Glasgow (right) were left baffled by a string of bangs last night . One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere, which would result in a sonic boom - but this was dismissed by another expert . ‘We can’t say for sure what this sound was,' he added. 'It's possible, but even if it was a PDE, I think half an hour would be a bit too long!' Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said: 'If an aircraft is responsible, then it’s worth noting that it may not be local at all. 'Because the sound wave that causes the boom can be reflected by the stratosphere, the source of the event could conceivably be hundreds or thousands of miles away from the place where it is heard on the ground.' But Dr Andrew Taylor, a senior lecturer in aviation at Buckinghamshire New University, said the noises did not sound like a normal sonic boom. 'With smaller fighter jets just a single boom would be heard, or, as with Concorde, a ""double boom"" might be heard from larger aircraft as both the nose and tail cause shock waves,' he said. 'It sounds like gunfire or other ammunition, similar to what I used to hear as a child growing up in Lincolnshire when the RAF & USAF aircraft used to do bombing runs on the east coast bombing ranges. 'It could be geological or meteorological, but certainly not aeronautical in my opinion.' Many Twitter users suspected sonic booms, similar to ones which shook Kent last month when two RAF jets intercepted a Latvian cargo plane in British airspace. But a Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline last night she had no records of any jets being scrambled. Some suggested unusual weather conditions might be the source, but the Met Office dismissed those claims and said there was nothing out of the ordinary. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'It definitely wasn't meteorological'. The Metropolitan Police said there had been a fireworks display in Croydon, but Twitter users insisted that could not explain sounds in Bedfordshire, Glasgow, North Devon, Leicestershire and West Sussex. At around the same time, a loud boom was reported by a number of people in the upstate New York areas of Buffalo, Cheektowaga and Clarence more than 3,000 miles away. People described it as loud enough to shake their homes and rattle windows. Theories: There was no shortage of ideas when it came to the possible source of the noises . Claudia Angiletta, who recorded the sounds in Croydon, south London, said she was watching TV at home when the unexplained sounds started. She told MailOnline: 'I was just at home watching TV when I couldn't hear the program due to the loud noises. It was very distracting as it went on for ages. 'I went out to look for fireworks but I couldn't see anything in the sky. That's when I recorded the clip to send to my family to see if they could hear the same thing.' The 27-year-old said that her family, who live roughly seven miles away in Norbury, south London, could also hear the sounds, which lasted for about 30 minutes. She then turned to Twitter to see if anyone could explain what they were. Within minutes Twitter users had started spreading hashtags from the straightforward (#loudbangs) to the slightly melodramatic (#omgwereallgoingtodie). Reaction: There was an explosion of activity on Twitter, where some users came up with their own theories . Many of the reports were picked up by Twitter user Virtual Astronomer, who said space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere could have been responsible. 'Space debris such as old satellites and things can cause sonic booms heard over very large areas,' he told MailOnline. 'It's the same for big meteors or rocks that come in. 'There was very little wind last night so conditions were perfect for sound to travel very long distances.' Science writer David Dickinson was among the experts who dismissed the meteor theory. He told MailOnline that there was one piece of debris from Russian satellite Kosmos 2251 scheduled for re-entry, but said that the timing was 'not a good fit' for it to have been over the UK. He added: 'I do not think it was a meteor or a piece of space-junk, as the noises mentioned spanned a large segment of time. Plus, unless it was cloudy over the U.K., there would've been visual sightings. #Spooked: Was it an alien invasion, a meteor, the Third World War - or simply a few stray fireworks? Dave Reed, who lives in Fareham, Hampshire, said his dogs 'went crazy for a couple of minutes' after hearing what he had assumed were fireworks. The noises prompted conspiracy theories and immediate claims of a 'media blackout'. Twitter user Carrie Proctor wrote: 'This is how we'll find our that WW3 has begun. It'll be a Twitter hashtag long before any official announcement!' One MailOnline reader heard similar noises in Belgium. Hyacinth Fahsi, who lives in Grimbergen, near Brussels, said the sound at 11pm local time - the same time as it was heard in Britain - woke his daughter and matched the recording in Croydon. Describing the sound as 'repetitive explosions', he said: 'I first thought it was firework but it was different. Maybe thunder, but the sky was clear and I didn't see lightning, even far away. 'I wasn't thinking about it until my wife read your article.'","Sounds reported last night from Aberdeen to West Sussex to Devon .

"When Stewart Watts returned home on leave from the army he decided to buy his 11-month-old daughter Poppy a present. But Mr Watts, who is based with the Yorkshire Regiment, was shocked when he gave his child a toy tool kit to play with and saw her pull out a five-inch knife and place it in her mouth. Gina Barratt, 24, also spotted the blade and managed to quickly grab it from her daughter as she played with the new £11.99 toy at their home in Sheffield. 'We are just relieved she wasn't hurt, but I am disgusted,' said Miss Barratt. 'How could something like a sharp blade get into a children's toy?' Gina Barratt, 24, found a five-inch long knife in a toy tool set her partner had bought for their 11-month-old daughter Poppy for £11.99 from Poundstretcher, which the baby girl then put into her mouth as she played . Mr Watts was on leave from Catterick army base in north Yorkshire last month and bought the tool kit from Poundstretcher. The kit comes in a train-shaped case and has several plastic tools inside including a spanner and a drill. Miss Barratt said: 'My partner opened the tool set, but he didn't see the knife. 'He put the set down for Poppy to play with. 'The kit is in a train set and there are spaces for the tools to fit inside. Poppy took all the tools out and they were on the floor. 'She picked up the knife and that was when Stewart noticed it. She put the shiny bit of the knife in her mouth. It's a knife with a long blade with cardboard wrapped around part of it. 'Luckily Poppy did not get hurt, because Stewart was with her, but she is at the age where you can leave her to play with things. She's always putting things in her mouth, it's what children her age do.' The toy cost £11.99 and had been reduced but Miss Barratt said it was properly sealed when Mr Watts bought it. She said she was concerned there could be more blades in other toys being sold by the company and felt they had not taken her complaint seriously. Poppy (right) was not injured after she put the blade into her mouth but Miss Barratt is worried about the toy . The  five-inch knife was packed in the tool set, which was sealed when it was bought from Poundstretcher . 'I called quite a few times and nobody phoned me back for a few days,' added Miss Barratt. 'I couldn't believe that they didn't react straight away because there could more of these blades about.' Poundstretcher said an investigation had been launched into the 'unfortunate incident' and they believed it was an isolated case. A spokesman for the company said: 'We would like to apologise to Gina and her family. 'Our products are rigorously tested by the manufacturers and we are investigating how this unfortunate incident happened.'","Stewart Watts bought a toy tool set for his 11-month-old daughter Poppy .

"An Indian father has told MailOnline how he tortured and murdered his 14-year-old daughter's rapist - who also got her pregnant in a sickening attack. The 36-year-old father lured the suspected rapist to his Delhi home and cooked him dinner before slipping him a sleeping pill, torturing him and killing him. He said: 'Initially, I didn’t want to kill him and asked him to quietly leave my home and life but he taunted me. I became very, very angry and lost my mind. 'I wrapped a towel around his neck and tied his hand, and dragged him to the floor. I switched on the gas and put the iron tongs and made it hot. 'I lost my mind and I wrapped a towel around his neck': The father who killed his daughter's alleged rapist reveals his torment . Horror: The Indian father took revenge for raping his daughter, 14, when she was home alone (file photo) Strangled and 'tortured': The victim of the attack, left, was accused of rape by the girl's father and mother, right . 'I thought he was dead but he was still breathing, so with one hand I strangled him and also put the heated tong on his genitals. 'He screamed so loudly so I put a part of the towel in his mouth to silence his noise. 'I burnt his genitals a second time, his body twisted and I was so enraged that I did it a third time in succession. After some time he stopped breathing and collapsed on the ground.' The father-of-six, who cannot be named but is from the Khajuri Khas region, said: 'I killed him to avenge what he did to my daughter. He spoilt her childhood. She was not be same girl as she was.' He then turned himself in to the police who arrested and charged him with murder - a crime carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment in India. From his prison cell he said: 'It was not easy for me after that. I drank half the cold drink left in the bottle and soothed my mind. When I got some composure I realised what I had done. I decided to surrender to authorities. 'I could have run away and even destroyed the body but instead I went to police after three hours and told them about what I had done. He was a blot on society and a constant threat to women.' The murdered attacker, who was a tenant of the girl's father, reportedly attacked the girl when he found her home alone and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. She eventually confessed to her father when symptoms of morning sickness began to surface. He kept the secret to himself for two months, afraid the revelation would tarnish the honour of his daughter and his family. He said: 'After my daughter told me about what happened to her I became very worried and was not able to sleep or eat properly for few days and then I got scared about the future of my girl. 'I didn’t share this info even with my own parents or brother who all live with me. I told my wife and told her not to speak to anyone about it because it would bring bad name for us and also would make it difficult for my daughter to get married. 'Even my little daughter stopped smiling and stopped eating properly or going out with her friends while he continued with his normal life and had no remorse. 'Can you imagine this man is the father of two married daughters - yet he dared to do this my young innocent daughter.' The number of rapes being reported in India has risen annually over the last five years, according to the country's Ministry of Home Affairs. The frequency of reported attacks against girls aged 14 to 18 has almost tripled in that time. Shock: Inspector Arvind Pratap Singh (pictured, right), who headed the murder investigation, said he's never encountered such a horrifying case . Protests: Anti-rape rallies have become common in India. Indian students in Hyderabad (pictured) burned an effigy to protest the gang rape of a 23-year-old Delhi girl in early November . Activists say this could be in part down to increased awareness which has inspired more women to report sexual violence. According to Mandakini Surie, a Senior Program Officer at the Asia Foundation, the 'Nirbhaya' incident in 2012, which involved the gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a private bus, thrust the issue of women's safety into the spotlight. She said: 'More and more women are coming forward to report instances of rape, assault, domestic violence and abuse even as the government has introduced more stringent legislation on sexual assault and introduced fast track courts to deal with rape cases.' However, victims of rape can face personal and professional discrimination. Surie added: 'Despite the rapid economic progress that India has made over the last decade, it remains - socially and culturally - a deeply patriarchal society. 'Victims who have come forward have reportedly faced social ostracisation, finding it difficult in many cases to find employment, marry and live full lives.' Violent protests erupted in India in 2012 when the girl known as 'Nirbhaya' was thrown off a moving bus following her sexual assault. Campaigners said it highlighted the incompetence of local police authorities in protecting women against sexual violence. More recently in the northern region of Kumaon, thousands of angry protesters took to the streets over the rape of a seven-year-old. Kahsish Shand's dead body, found five days after her uncle's wedding in Haldwani, showed signs of serious hemorrhaging through sexual assault. The father of the 14-year-old, assaulted by a man he considered family, believed he needed to take the law into his own hands. He said: 'I started thinking what is point of living this life if I can’t get justice for my daughter. 'I do not regret that I took revenge of what he did.","Daughter became pregnant after alleged horror attack .

"Almost as many Poles have moved to Britain as live in their country’s second city Krakow. They make up around half the 1.3million eastern Europeans in the UK. Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday revealed the true impact of expanding the EU to include members of the former Eastern Bloc in 2004. Scroll down for video . By 2013, there were 679,000 people from Poland who had moved to Britain. Krakow is home to 750,000 people. When other ex-Soviet countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia are included, the total of eastern Europeans in the UK rises to 1.27million. This represents 25.8 per cent of all foreigners living in the country last year. The total is now likely to be even higher since the figures pre-date Romanians and Bulgarians being given open access to the UK jobs market on January 1 this year. Figures released last week show that, in the year to September 2014, around 135,000 people from these two countries had registered for national insurance numbers. It comes at a time of continued controversy over government efforts to control immigration from within the EU which was a major factor behind the Conservatives last week missing their target of reducing net migration – currently 260,000 – to the ‘tens of thousands’. Statement: Prime Minister David Cameron delivered his long-awaited speech on immigration last week - pledging to make Britain less attractive to migrants . David Cameron said he now planned to make migrants wait for four years before they could claim both in-work and out-of-work benefits. However, to the anger of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, he stopped short of imposing an ‘emergency brake’ on EU citizens after Germany made it clear the proposal would be unacceptable. Overall, the OECD said the number of foreign nationals living in the country rose by more than 3 per cent to 4.9million last year, representing 7.9 per cent of the UK’s total population. Poles were the largest foreign group, accounting for 14 per cent of all foreign citizens in Britain. The OECD report said that in 2013 a record 2.66million foreign nationals – migrants who have not been given UK citizenship – were working in the UK. More than a third of them were highly skilled and almost four in ten worked in London. However, the unemployment rate for foreign nationals was higher than for Britons at 9.2 per cent compared to 7.6 per cent. The foreign national category does not include people who arrived in Britain as immigrants but who have since been awarded citizenship and a UK passport. Abroad: There are almost as many Poles in the UK as there are in the country's second city of Krakow (pictured) - home to 750,000 people . Deutschland: Germany - not the UK - is the main destination of free movement within the European Union, an international economic organisation has said . Figures for each country in the OECD for 2012 show that in that year the UK was the third most popular destination for long-term migrants, behind only the US and Germany. Last month it was revealed that Britain is handing out citizenship to more migrants than any other EU country after an influx of foreigners lasting more than a decade. Official figures published by Eurostat, the official statistics organisation of the European Commission, showed this country gave citizenship to 193,900 people in 2012. At 23.7 per cent, that was the highest proportion of almost 820,000 foreigners given citizenship by any of the 28 EU nations. In total, more than 2.1million people from overseas have been given British citizenship since the turn of the century. For migrants moving from one EU country to another, Germany is the main destination. Nearly 30 per cent of migrants moving under free movement rules within the EU in 2012 travelled to Germany, compared to 7 per cent that moved to the UK, the OECD said.","More than a quarter of 5million foreigners in UK from eastern Europe .

"There was only one present Daniel Tennant wanted for Christmas this year. The brave tot has just been given a new hand for Christmas - after being born without fully formed arms or hands. It means that little Daniel, five, can now open his Christmas presents and pull crackers with his mother Stephanie, 29. Stephanie who lives in Bathgate, West Lothian, said: ‘We are going to have a wonderful Christmas this year. ‘Daniel is thrilled with his new hand. He can’t stop smiling. It means that he can do so much more now that he can grip things like his presents and pull crackers too. Five-year-old Daniel Tennant is delighted with new hand which means he can now open his own Christmas presents and pull crackers . The youngster was born without fully formed arms or legs, but preferred to live without the prosthetic arm he had fitted at six months . 'He is so excited for Christmas now he’s got his new hand.’ It wasn’t until he was born that Stephanie realised there was anything wrong with Daniel. Nothing had been picked up during her pregnancy scans and it was only when he was born that she was told that there was a problem with the development of his arms. She said: ‘It was a massive shock to me when I found out. My mum and aunty were in the delivery room at the hospital with me and I saw the shock on my aunt’s face when she saw him for the first time. ‘Then the midwife told me that he was perfect, but there were some problems with his arms. I could see that his left arm stopped above the elbow and he only had a very small arm on his right side. ‘There was no explanation for why it had happened in the womb, I was told it was just one of those things. But it was a massive shock to me as I hadn’t imagined anything would be wrong with him.’ Daniel had a prosthetic arm fitted at six months old, to help him balance when he crawled, but he preferred to try without it. Stephanie, who is single, said: ‘He never used his prosthetic arm that he had when he was a baby, and he managed fine without it. He learnt to crawl and walk and he would also pick things up like a ball by balancing it between his two stumps. Doctors at Edinburgh's Astley Ainslie Hospital made Daniel a new hand with fingers that open and close and it was fitted last month, just in time for Christmas . Daniel's mother Stephanie said: 'It really is the best present that Daniel could ever have wished for' ‘When he was a baby he just played with his plastic arm just like he would do a toy, then as he grew into a toddler he ignored it. ‘He never needed anything else, he just adapted to doing things without any proper hands. But then a few months ago he started to say that he really wanted a hand with five fingers, just like everyone else. ‘He started school in September and he just wanted to be like the other children.’ So Stephanie took him to the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh and doctors made him a prosthetic hand with fingers that opened and closed. He was fitted for the prosthetic arm and it was finally ready earlier this month - just in time for Christmas. Stephanie, who is supported by REACH, a charity that helps children with upper limb deformities, said: ‘It really is the best present that Daniel could ever have wished for. 'He was thrilled when he tried on his new hand for the first time, and could pick things up properly. He is able to pick his toys up for the first time too. It has given him so much more independence and confidence. ‘He has always managed really well, but now he can feel more like the other children now that he’s got his new hand. 'It was wonderful to see him being able to pull Christmas crackers for the first time this year. It’s something that I never thought I’d be able to see.’","Daniel Tennant was born without fully formed arms or hands .

"The woman who is known for giving Katie Price her literary success has died at the age of 49. Author Rebecca Farnworth aided the model and businesswoman into a career as an 'author' by ghostwriting her novels and autobiographies. The mother of three wrote 14 books under Price's name over the past decade (nine novels and five autobiographies), with the first - Being Jordan - selling in excess of a million copies. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Farnworth died on November 24 after battling cancer. She was the author behind 14 of Katie Price's successful novels . Katie's second ghostwritten novel, Crystal, sold 160,000 copies in the first three months and stormed straight to the top of the hardback best-sellers list. Rebecca's literary agent Maggie Hanbury, announced on Monday that the mother and author had died last week following a battle with cancer. Reports stated that she died on November 24, surrounded by friends and family. Rebecca had first teamed up with the model and businesswoman after forging a career as a radio producer and print journalist. Prolific writer: Rebecca ghostwrote 14 of Katie Price's titles including five autobiographies and nine novels . Katie, who has yet to publicly comment on Rebecca's death, made no secret of the fact her books where ghostwritten and often praised Rebecca for her writing talent. She said on BBC Radio 4 in 2012: 'I feel sorry for Rebecca. She's been with me about 10 or 11 years. I speak in the dictaphone.' She added: 'You've definitely got to have a talent to sit there and write the book. I mean she's amazing at it. 'So, I come up with the plot, and then we go through each chapter together. She fills out the bits. She's just amazing how she does it. She really is good.' In an interview with beachhutwriters.co.uk in 2013, Rebecca had said getting the deal to ghostwrite Kate's books had been a 'life-changing moment'. She said: 'The turning point in my career as a writer came when I was interviewed by the literary agent, Maggie Hanbury, who was looking for a ghostwriter for Katie Price’s autobiography. 'It was one of those life-changing moments, though I didn't know it at the time.' In another interview with novelicious.com in 2013 she revealed how she never expected to go from being a radio producer and magazine and newspaper writer to the voice of a tabloid celebrity. She explained: 'I hadn't set out to be a ghostwriter, in fact before I landed the job of ghost writing this particular celebrity autobiography, I would have been hard pressed to say what a ghost actually did!' Katie often praised Rebecca's writing talent and made no secret of the fact she hadn't penned her novels and memoirs herself . Despite being most famous for her work with Katie, the Brighton-based writer had also published several works of fiction in her own right, beginning in 2009 with Valentine, followed by two other books A Funny Thing About Love and Swimming Pool Summer. Maggie Hanbury described Rebecca as 'talented' adding that the fact that everyone knew of her work with Katie made her well-known and respected. 'Rebecca Farnworth had a rare talent. She wrote three romantic novels under her own name but perhaps ironically achieved greater fame - because it was an open secret - ghostwriting Katie Price's books.' She said the first volume of Price's memoirs - written when she used the name Jordan - had been a hit, 'much to the amazement of the publishing industry'. Maggie added that Rebecca's work on the autobiography blazed a trail for a whole new breed of celebrity writing. 'The book broke a mould,creating a new genre that went on to spawn countless other celebrity memoirs. 'At every turn, Rebecca was totally professional, with a journalist's ability to get to the heart of the matter, always delivering on time a near-faultless manuscript.' More than a ghostwriter: Rebecca also wrote a number of novels in her own name after establishing a career as a journalist and radio producer . Maggie ending by saying that Rebecca was not only a huge success professionally but also a pleasure to work with. 'Vibrant and full of life, Rebecca was huge fun to work with, always ready with a quip to set the room alight with laughter. She created memorable authentic characters that seemed to have a life of their own.' 'Her natural empathy, humour and zest for life shone through in her work.'","Rebecca Farnworth died on November 24 surrounded by her family .

"Pope Francis has condemned the West for selling chemical weapons responsible for thousands of civilian deaths to Syria. Returning from a three-day trip to Turkey the pope said the Middle East state did not have the ability to manufacture the chemical weapons that were deployed against Syrian civilians last year, adding they must have been supplied them by its 'accusers'. Nerve agent Sarin, described by chemical weapons experts as one of the 'deadliest agents known to man', has been linked to several attacks during the three-year civil war in Syria. Accusation: At a press conference on board the plane returning him to Rome from Turkey, Pope Francis told journalists that he held the West responsible for selling chemical weapons to the Syrian regime . Anger: Speaking to journalists on board the plane, Pope Francis condemned arms trafficking as 'terrible' and lamented that it was currently one of the strongest fields of business . Popular Pope: In this photo made available by the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, Francis poses with refugee children in Istanbul . Both British and the US governments threatened military action against President Bashir al-Assad after an attack in which almost 1,500 people were killed, including 426 children last year but ultimately were defeated by votes in Parliament and the US Congress. Pope Francis told journalists on the plane returning him to Rome: 'Last year between September and December it was said that Syria had chemical weapons. I don't believe that Syria was capable of making chemical weapons. So who could have sold them to them? One of those who accused them. ' Francis condemned arms trafficking as 'terrible' and lamented that it was currently one of the strongest fields of business. He said that we are 'living through a third world war', being fought piecemeal all over the planet. 'The causes of this are historical enmities, political problems, economic problems, all working to prop up this system that places money and not the human person at the centre. And behind this there are also commercial interests.' Syria established its chemical program with Soviet military assistance as a deterrent to Israel. Foreign Minister William Hague admitted as he left office that in the 1980s Britain sold Syria precursor chemicals that Damascus later used to manufacture sarin. The Newsnight programme revealed this summer that the UK was the sole supplier of the three key ingredients used to produce sarin; dimethyl phosphate (DMP), trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and hexamine. regarded as the 'building block' of sarin. Horror: Nerve agent Sarin, described by chemical weapons experts as one of the 'deadliest agents known to man', has been linked to several attacks during the three-year civil war in Syria, including the one that left the boy pictured left suffering respiratory problems in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus last year . The UK also supplied electrical fans to Syria as late as 2003, it said, components of which were used in Assad's chemical weapon programme. At the same time the Blair government were invading Iraq for allegedly stockpiling weapons of mass destruction. But even as late as 2012, British firms were planning to honour contracts to export dual-use chemicals those with civilian or military applications. Pope Francis firmly opposed Western intervention in Syria.","Pontiff held press conference on flight taking him from Turkey to Rome .

"A 23,000-year-old limestone statue of a woman with large breasts and buttocks has been discovered hidden in a small pile of rocks by archaeologists in northern France. The Ice Age figure was unearthed during the second day of an archaeological dig at a Paleolithic site in Renancourt, west of Amiens. The team conducting the excavation found a broken pile of limestone that included fragments which appeared to have been worked by human hands. Scroll down for video . The Venus of Renancourt is said to depict a woman's shapely body with large breasts and buttocks but does not have any hands or feet while the head is virtually featureless, much like other similar Venus statues . They then began piecing the fragments together to reveal a statuette of a shapely woman that matches the characteristics of so called 'Venus' figurines. Venus figurines are usually carved from bone, ivory or soft stone such as limestone. Some examples have also been shaped from clay. Around 100 such figures have been found in Europe, mostly in Russia and central Europe. They all depict curvaceous women with large breasts, bottoms, abdomens, hips and thighs while their heads are often small and usually faceless. There have been many attempts to explain what their importance was to the prehistoric cultures who made them. Some experts speculate that they are emblems of security or were fertility icons and some figures appear to represent pregnant women. Experts have described the statue, named the Venus of Renancourt, as 'exceptional'. It is one of only 15 similar figures to be found in France and the first in around 50 years. 'We were expecting to find classical vestiges such as tooled flint or bones,' said archaeologist Clement Paris, who led the excavation at Renancourt. 'That same night we carefully pieced together the 20-odd fragments and realised it was a female statuette. 'The fact that the sculpture is not totally realistic shows the intent was to produce a symbolic image of a woman linked to fecundity.' Carbon dating of organic material found at the site alongside the broken statue  showed it to be around 23,000 years old. Once pieced together, the Venusmeasured around 4.7 inches (12cm), depicting a woman with a large chest and behind. The head and limbs are less detailed, however. Around 100 such figures have been found in Europe, mostly in Russia and central Europe. Venus figurines are usually carved from bone, ivory or soft stone such as limestone. Some examples have also been shaped from clay. They all depict curvaceous women with large breasts, bottoms, abdomens, hips and thighs while their heads are often small and usually faceless. The Venus statue was found at a paleolithic site in the suburbs of Renancourt , just to the west of the town of Amiens. It is one of the few Venus figurines to be found in the north of France . There have been many attempts to explain what their importance was to the prehistoric cultures who made them. Some experts speculate that they are emblems of security or were fertility icons and some figures appear to represent pregnant women. Most have been discovered in settlements in caves or open air sites around Europe. The statue was painstakingly pieced together through the night by archaeologists after they discovered a pile of limestone that did not seem natural at an old Paleolithic settlement in Renancourt, near Amiens . The exact purpose of the statue, which was carved from a piece of limestone, is still unknown but Venus figurines were believed to be fertility icons or used as symbols of status or power . The statue is just 4.7 inches long is thought to have been created around 23,000 years ago. Only 15 other venus statues have been found in France and it is likely to be prized among the country's most precious relics . The oldest Venus statue was uncovered in 2008 in Germany. Known as the ""Venus of Hohle Fels” it was carved from a mammoth's tusk and is thought to be at least 35,000 years old. However, the discovery of a Venus in northern France is seen as being particularly unusual as most of the Venus figures found in the country so far have been in the south west. Nicole Phoyu-Yedid, the head of cultural affairs in Picardy, said: 'The discovery of this masterpiece is exceptional and internationally significant.' The Venus of Willendorf (left) is the oldest known example of a Venus figurine to be found and is thought to be 13,000 years older than the one found at Renancourt while other Venus figures have been found in France including this 25,000 year old limestone carving (right) that is held at the Musee d'Aquitaine, in Bordeaux .","Broken limestone statue was discovered  at Renancourt, near Amiens .

"A driver has been sent a bill for £18,500 after she spent a year ignoring parking fines stuck to her windscreen. Carly Mackie has been parking outside her garage in Dundee for more than a year and has ignored the fixed penalty notices she has received on an almost daily basis, wrongly believing she was entitled to park there. But the 26-year-old has now been sent a formal letter from a private parking firm demanding she pay £18,500 to cover the cost of the dozens of parking tickets. Carly Mackie has been sent a bill for £18,500 after she ignored parking fines for more than a year after she continually parked on cobbles outside her garage - wrongly believing she was entitled to park her Mini there . The firm said Miss Mackie has not challenged a single fine issued to her over more than a year and was not entitled to leave her car there because motorists are not allowed to park in covered passage ways, and also need a permit to leave their cars in the area. Miss Mackie, who said she came to regard the daily tickets as an annoyance, has been parking her Mini on the cobbles outside her driveway for more than a year. She said: 'We have a right to park in front of our own property. I've considered moving out. It just makes my life so hellish. 'I always make a point of parking in front of my own garage, where nobody else could park, and never parking on the double yellow lines on the road.' But Vehicle Control Services Limited, which sent her the letter demanding money for the fine, said she is wrong and is not entitled to park in front of her garage. A spokesman said: 'The site in question is covered by a contract that restricts use of the rear car park to permit holders only and prohibits motorists from parking in the covered vehicle access passage ways. Miss Mackie said she believes she should be able to park outside her garage and is being unfairly penalised . But Vehicle Control Services Limited said she cannot park on the cobbles, and has been fined each time . 'The terms and conditions are clearly displayed on prominent signs around the site. 'It is therefore not unreasonable to expect motorists to adhere to these terms and conditions by not parking in restricted areas and displaying a valid permit in the car park. 'Ms Mackie has constantly breached the terms and conditions of this contract by repeatedly parking in a restricted area/parking without displaying a valid permit.' The company said every time Miss Mackie has parked in the area she has been issued with a ticket, and each time she received a ticket had the opportunity to appeal the fine. But each time she failed to do so. The spokesman said the fine is so high because they have also had find out the details of who owned the car to trace it back to Miss Mackie and demand the total parking fine be paid. Ms Mackie came to regard the fines as an annoyance and discarded them, but the bill has now racked up . He added: 'In the absence of any contact from Ms Mackie coupled with the fact that she continues to contravene the terms and conditions of this site, which we are contractually bound to enforce, we have had no alternative but to initiate Court action via our Agents in Scotland, Gordon & Noble.' Miss Mackie, who lives with her parents, said the situation has become so stressful she is considering moving house. She said she feels she has been targeted by the parking firm and believes other cars in the area have not been given tickets. She added: 'They say the route is pedestrian access, but there are old cobbles that wouldn't be suitable for a wheelchair, and just across the road is a smooth path.'","Carly Mackie regularly parks on cobbles outside her garage in Dundee .

"Families taking a ferry across the Channel in the New Year face a 30 per cent hike in ticket prices as the EU brings in tough new green rules. Britain’s biggest ferry operator, P&O Ferries, said a return ticket for a family of four from Dover to Calais will jump from £160 to £210. The UK Chamber of Shipping says the move could be the death knell for the ferry industry, adding: ‘Routes teetering on the edge of economic viability will be pushed off the edge.’ Scroll down for video . Britain’s biggest ferry operator, P&O Ferries, said a return ticket for a family of four from Dover to Calais will jump from £160 to £210 as a result of new EU green laws . Experts say it will cost the industry £300million a year – much of which will be absorbed into ticket prices. File picture . The new EU rules – which force shipping firms to buy expensive low- emission fuel – will push traffic on to the roads, drive up the cost of diesel for cars and result in the loss of 2,000 jobs, it was predicted last night. And a European committee has warned that the fuel switch could lead to engine breakdowns and fires, leaving boats floating dangerously without power in busy shipping lanes. Brussels has ordered that all ships in the English Channel, North Sea and Baltic Sea act to reduce sulphur emissions from January 1. A European committee has warned that the fuel switch could lead to engine breakdowns and fires, leaving boats floating dangerously without power in busy shipping lanes. File picture . Firms will have to switch to expensive low-sulphur fuel or install filtering equipment at the cost of millions of pounds. Experts say it will cost the industry £300million a year – much of which will be absorbed into ticket prices. Independent consultants Amec say ferry companies will have to cut routes and slash jobs. Freight traffic to Europe will be forced on to the roads and through the Channel Tunnel – resulting in more pollution. And increased demand for low-sulphur shipping fuel could lead to higher prices on forecourts. The price at the diesel pump could rise by 2.8p a litre, Amec said, because there is not enough capacity in refineries to cope with the demand for both vehicle and shipping fuel. A route from Harwich to Esbjerg in Denmark was scrapped in September because of the expected rise in fuel costs. Most operators are expected to switch from heavy fuel to lighter marine gas-oil – which is 60 per cent more expensive. A spokesman for P&O Ferries, which runs 15 ships in the Channel and North Sea, told the Daily Mail: ‘Consumers will be picking up the bill for this because shipping companies cannot bear this cost alone. 'Marine gas-oil is considerably more expensive than the fuel we use today, so we can predict price increases for both freight and tourist customers. ‘All shipping companies will be affected – but our biggest rival, the Channel Tunnel, will not be affected. Peak-time sailings might cost 30 per cent more than people paid last year.’ Jonathan Roberts, of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: ‘There is no doubt that the additional cost has to go somewhere – it will have to put up ticket prices. This will be the final straw for some routes.’ Brussels has ordered that all ships in the English Channel, North Sea and Baltic Sea act to reduce sulphur emissions from January 1. Pictured, the European Parliament . The decision to reduce sulphur emissions was agreed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2008. But Mr Roberts said the EU has insisted on a ‘gold-plated’ version of the agreement. He said: ‘The IMO said implementation of the regulations could be done by 2020 – but the EU has insisted on 2015. ‘The IMO said there should have a degree of flexibility, to allow companies to transition into the new era without damaging their business. The European Commission removed this flexibility and pragmatism – and jobs will be lost as a result.’ Ryanair passengers were stranded in Lanzarote for more than two days after bad weather there grounded the budget airline’s planes at the weekend. One passenger, Corinne Redfern, detailed her frustration at the airline in more than 40 tweets as she was forced to wait 51 hours to get back to London. She accused Ryanair of announcing it had booked a hotel for passengers but the hotel had no record of the booking, and refusing to give out meal vouchers. A Ryanair spokesman said: ‘Affected customers were provided with meal vouchers and hotel accommodation, and sent regular updates by email and SMS text.’ The EU Sulphur Directive requires all commercial ships to use 0.1 per cent sulphur fuel by midnight on January 1, or install sulphur filters known as ‘scrubbers’ – which usually will cost more than the ship itself. The policy could also have grave safety consequences. A report to be presented to the European Commission on Thursday warns that smaller shipping firms are not ready for the switch. When a similar policy was implemented off the Californian coast in 2012, the US Coastguard said the number of power failures doubled. The European Sustainable Shipping Forum says breakdowns – including engine fires – in the much-busier English Channel could have dangerous consequences. A European Commission spokesman said: ‘Sulphur dioxide emissions result in acid rain and fine dust that causes respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. 'They are a direct health hazard in particular near major ports – like Dover. ‘The savings on healthcare and the environmental benefits will far exceed the costs of implementing the agreed International Maritime Organisation measures.’","UK shipping experts say move could be death knell for the ferry industry .

"Like any bride-to-be, Pauline Bailey was thrilled when she finally found her dream wedding venue. After touring the landscaped grounds of the stunning Stoke Park – a five-star country house hotel that has featured in two Bond movies – Miss Bailey decided it was the perfect setting. She and her fiancé Paul Carty were happy to pay £10,000 for their big day, and wrote to ask about possible dates. Scroll down to hear from Pauline and Paul . Snub: Bride-to-be Pauline Bailey believes the five star hotel didn't want to host her wedding because her fiance Paul Carty has a pierced eyebrow and two earrings . Seemingly amicable discussions ensued with the venue’s wedding planner, Michele Connelly. Then Miss Connelly dropped a clanger that revealed her true feelings about her would-be clients. She sent an email to her manager Carlo Zoccali – but also forwarded it to Miss Bailey by mistake. It read: ‘Hi Carlo, I need your advice on this wedding, I know this probably doesn’t sound very nice, but I am trying to put this wedding off as I don’t think they are the type of people that we would want to have at Stoke Park.’ Miss Connelly added that she had ‘put the bride off for now’ then signed off with the word ‘Help!!!’. Miss Bailey, a law graduate, said she burst into tears when she read the message. ‘I was horrified,’ she said. ‘Effectively she was asking her boss how she could get rid of us. We were hugely offended. The suggestion was that we were undesirables, which we definitely are not. ‘We’re a respectable, middle-class, hard-working, well-educated couple. Paul and I can hold our own anywhere and in anyone’s company. We are thoroughly decent people and didn’t deserve this humiliation.’ The couple believe they were snubbed because Miss Connelly took objection to either her husband’s eyebrow piercing and two small earrings, or the age difference between them.

Miss Bailey and Mr Carty had been planning to marry in its Fountain Room but Miss Connelly –  described on the hotel’s website as its ‘caring face’ – had other ideas. After a viewing in April, she managed to stall the couple. Mr Carty said he felt something was amiss when they were told it would cost them £1,000 to light their own fireworks. ‘Whatever we wanted, it felt like they were throwing obstacles in our way,’ he added. Then the email arrived. Miss Bailey was so offended that she hired a solicitor to explore the possibility of taking legal action against the hotel for defamation. ‘How could she or anyone else judge us after only a ten-minute meeting?’ she said. In an emailed apology to Miss Bailey, Mr Zoccali invited her to meet him to discuss the wedding. He wrote: ‘Firstly on behalf of Stoke Park, I would like to humbly apologise for the email which was sent to you by accident. I have spoken with Michele about this, who also sincerely apologises and I will deal internally with regards to her comments.’ The couple spoke out about the incident after settling on an alternative venue for next June’s wedding: Parklands, a 17th century mansion on the Essex/Hertfordshire border.

"A British businessman battered his millionaire girlfriend to death after a furious drunken row in their £1,000-a-night Paris hotel room, a court heard yesterday. Kinga Legg had been so scared of Ian Griffin during their volatile three-year relationship that she had sent a friend a text message saying ‘in case I die’, prosecutors said. Polish-born Miss Legg, 36, was found dead in the bath at their room in the Hotel Bristol hours after Griffin had fled – putting a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. Scroll down for video . Ian Griffin, pictured right arriving at the Criminal Court in Paris today, denies murdering girlfriend Kinga Legg, left, who was found dead in a bathtub in 2009 . She was naked and had 92 bruises on her body. There was blood on the walls and signs that a stun gun had been used on her. She had regularly told friends about their abusive relationship and said Griffin had forced her to take so many drugs that she feared she might not wake up, the Paris Assizes was told. A later text said Griffin had beaten her up, but she subsequently asked her friends to delete the messages, the court heard. Griffin, 45, who fled to England in his Porsche 911 sports car after Miss Legg’s death in May 2009, denies murder and claims she died by accident. He appeared in the dock on crutches as he now suffers from a neurological disease. The British businessman, centre, arrives in court with his partner Tracy Baker, left, and lawyer Francis Triboulet, right . Mr Griffin, who is originally from Cheshire, is assisted up the stairs as he arrives at the Criminal court of Paris . Supporting him in court was his fiancee Tracy Baker, 34, with who he had been in a relationship before he met Miss Legg. They got back together when she visited him in prison in France after he was extradited from Britain in 2011. Miss Legg, who was briefly married to an Englishman and also used her maiden name Wolf, ran a successful firm exporting tomatoes from Poland to major companies such as McDonald’s, Tesco and Carrefour. She and Griffin – who had owned tanning salons and a chain of gadget stores but was declared bankrupt in 2006 – rented a £3million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey. The couple were briefly arrested in 2008 after Miss Legg attacked Griffin with a knife, but there were no charges. He was said to have been violent towards her during the relationship, while she was said to be hugely jealous of Miss Baker. On May 25, 2009, they were seen arguing in an upmarket Paris restaurant, where they ordered aperitifs and two bottles of wine. Miss Legg was found naked and had 92 bruises on her body in a bathtub in a £1000-a-night suite in the world-famous Bristol hotel in Paris .

They returned to the Bristol separately and a member of staff said he saw them still arguing when he took another bottle of wine to their room. Francis Triboulet, defending Griffin, said his client ‘woke up after eight hours in a devastated room, Kinga was still sleeping. As he tried to wake her, he saw she was frozen. He gave her a bath. By 2pm, he realised she was dead.’ Miss Legg’s body was discovered that evening after her brother became concerned that he could not contact her. Ian Griffin, pictured with girlfriend Tracy who is attending the trial, says he's determined to clear his name . Tracy Baker, 33, is said to have rekindled her relationship with Griffin while he was in custody in Britain . Hotel staff found blood spattered on a mattress and walls, furniture smashed and two stun guns, including one disguised as a tube of lipstick, in the room. Griffin later phoned his father and said ‘something terrible has happened’ and that Miss Legg had killed herself by taking an overdose, the court heard. Griffin, originally from Warrington, Cheshire, was arrested five days later in woodland outside Macclesfield, where he had been living in a tent. Since his release on bail last year to await trial, he has lived in Cannes. Griffin, who wore a dark grey suit, blue shirt and tie, looked in pain in the dock. He faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty. The trial is expected to last five days. In August Miss Baker appeared on BBC’s Dragons’ Den and was offered £60,000 by Duncan Bannatyne for a stake in a venture producing adhesive hooks and stickers – but the Scottish entrepreneur pulled out when he discovered her link to Griffin. The businesswoman took home a £60,000 investment for her franchise of Um!Brands tech business on BBC's Dragons' Den this year but the deal was revoked after it was revealed to be linked to Griffin . Mr Griffin, pictured on a personal hovercraft, fled the scene after putting a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door of the suit he was staying in with Ms Legg, left, and was arrested in Cheshire .

"Earth could be hit by a series of damaging solar flares after the largest sunspot to be seen on the star for 24 years aligns with our planet. The sunspot, previously known as Active Region 12192, began facing Earth in October but did not produce any coronal mass ejection (CMEs). CMEs are the most energetic events in our solar system, involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun's surface into space. Scroll down for video . The sunspot, previously known as Active Region 12192, began facing Earth in October but didn't produce any coronal mass ejection (CMEs). After disappearing for two weeks, it is once again facing our planet . The region, renamed Active Region 12192, has now rotated around to face Earth again, and is likely to create CMEs, Nasa scientist Holly Gilbert told Space.com during a video interview. 'This time around, it's more likely to have some coronal mass ejections associated with it, even though the solar flares might be smaller,' she said. 'We have a good idea, based on the structure of that magnetic field and the sunspot, that it's very possible that it will create some mid-level flares.' Magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy, but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap, releasing their energy as explosions called flares. Earth could be about to be hit by a series of damaging solar flares as a huge sunspots aligns with the planet . A view of the visible sun showing the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24, AR12192, as seen on October 22 . According to Dr Gilbert, the sunspot is still large enough for 10 Earths to fit inside it, and is believed to be the 33rd largest of 32,908 active regions recorded since 1874. The Jupiter-sized sunspot produced six eruptions in October and early November, before disappearing for two weeks. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. Earlier this year, Ashley Dale, who is a member of an international task force, dubbed Solarmax, warned that solar 'super-storms' pose a 'catastrophic' and 'long-lasting' threat to life on Earth. A solar superstorm occurs when a CME of sufficient magnitude tears into the Earth's surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart. Such an event could induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines, causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components. Mr Dale, carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at Bristol University, said it is only a 'matter of time' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards Earth. He says such a storm would wreak havoc with communication systems and power supplies, crippling vital services such as transport, sanitation and medicine. Without power, people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations, get money from cash dispensers or pay online,' he said. 'Water and sewage systems would be affected too, meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip, with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning.' The huge sunspot produced six eruptions in October and early November, before disappearing for two weeks . The largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event, named after the English astronomer Richard Carrington who spotted the preceding solar flare. This massive CME released about 1022 kJ of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the Earth at speeds of up to 3000 km/s. However, its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles (200,000 km) of telegraph lines. Mr Dale says these types of events are not just a threat, but inevitable. Nasa scientists have predicted that the Earth is in the path of a Carrington-level event every 150 years on average. This means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent. Sunspot AR12192 is 14 times larger than Earth and almost as big as Jupiter. The Met Office told MailOnline it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years. It is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from Earth's surface (shown in this image from pilot Brian Whittaker)","Sunspot, known as Active Region 12192, began facing Earth in October .
It disappeared for two weeks but is now facing Earth again, claims Nasa .

"Five St. Louis Rams players entered the football field with their hands raised. A day later, people walked out of work or school showing the same gesture of solidarity with Ferguson protesters. The pose has come to symbolize a movement, even though witnesses offered conflicting accounts of whether 18-year-old Michael Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was killed by Ferguson officer Darren Wilson in August. The power of the symbol was evident again Monday. Protesters across the country walked off the job or away from class in support of the Ferguson protesters.

At the University of Missouri-St. Louis, not far from Ferguson, sophomore Amber Whitaker was among about 30 students who chanted 'Hands up. Don't shoot!' Whitaker, who is white, said the symbolism is what matters, not whether Brown literally had his hands in the air. 'There are black men and women who are shot with their hands up,' Whitaker said. 'There are black men and women who are shot unarmed. It may not apply exactly to Mike Brown, but it still happens.' The exact circumstances surrounding Brown's death will forever be in dispute.

Wilson told the grand jury that he shot Brown in self-defense. But several witnesses said Brown had his hands up in surrender. Within hours, 'Hands Up. Don't Shoot!' became the rallying cry for protesters. Witness accounts contained in thousands of pages of grand jury documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed many variations about whether Brown's hands were actually raised - and if so, how high. Some people were offended by the hands-up gesture. The St. Louis Police Officers Association said the display by Rams players Tavon Austin, Kenny Britt, Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens was 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory.'

The group, joined by the St. Louis County Police Association, met with Rams leaders Monday. In a statement, the two organizations called the discussions 'productive but very preliminary' and said they planned to talk again later in the week. In Springfield, Missouri, Rodney Shetler, watched the players' action from his home. He said the move was 'in pretty poor taste' and was divisive and disrespectful to law enforcement. 'It's a gesture proven by the grand jury not to be appropriate or accurate,' said Shetler, the 44-year-old owner of a copying and printing business. A similar episode unfolded more than four decades ago at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. John Carlos, the American 200-meter bronze medalist, set off a political firestorm on the medal stand when he and teammate Tommie Smith gave the black power salute. He stood by the Rams players.

'If they choose to come out and raise their hands in support of whatever their emotions are, they have the right to do that,' Carlos told The Associated Press. 'I don't think the whole story has been told about the Michael Brown tragedy, and the pros and cons on both sides. They can just go by their emotions. I don't think anyone got injured or shot by expressing emotions.' The White House on Monday announced the conclusion of a three-month review of the Ferguson situation. President Barack Obama wants more officers to wear cameras to promote trust, but he is not seeking to reduce federal programs that provide the type of military-style equipment used to dispel the unrest in Ferguson and elsewhere. Brown's family wants to see every police officer working the streets wearing a body camera. Boulder, Colorado . Hands up!

Also Monday, the Ferguson Commission appointed by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon met for the first time. The 16-person panel will study the underlying social and economic conditions - from failing schools to high unemployment- that have gained attention since Brown's death. About 80 residents attended the group's first session, a five-hour meeting devoted primarily to organizational issues. As the meeting lingered, several audience members ran out of patience, angrily imploring commission members to discuss practical solutions, not murky goals and vision statements. 'People have waited for three months stewing in anxiety and pain,' activist Charles Wade told the panel. The panel includes a Ferguson construction-supply company owner, two pastors, a university professor, a community activist and a St. Louis police detective who is also president of the state chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police. Two of the 16 members were in Washington meeting with Obama. Nixon dropped plans Monday for a special legislative session to approve additional spending for the state's public-safety response to protesters in the St. Louis area. The governor reversed course after lawmakers said he could tap into an existing budget for the State Emergency Management Agency to cover the costs of the National Guard and Missouri State Highway Patrol.

"A 16-month-old girl was sent back to her 'paralytic' mother hours after she had abandoned her, an inquest has heard. Chloe Valentine was four when she died of massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home in January 2012. But social worker Katrina Heading told the inquest on Monday she considered removing Chloe in November 2008 after her 'paralytic' mother Ashlee Polkinghorne left her with a 15-year-old friend while she drank at the beach. Chloe's grandmother reluctantly agreed to take her but when an angry and abusive Polkinghorne finally surfaced, a supervisor decided Chloe should be returned to her mother. Scroll down for video . Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 . Mother Ashlee Polkinghorne (pictured left and right) at court at an earlier date. The inquest has heard she and her boyfriend Benjamin Robert McPartland, 28, forced Chloe to ride a motorbike over three days which repeatedly crashed and caused massive head injuries . Ms Heading said Chloe was sent home unsupervised with a private chauffeur because there were only two crisis care staff working that night. She said the chauffeur company conducted police checks on its workers but Families SA did not have access to those checks. Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned whether it was appropriate for a 16-month-old child to be left unsupervised with a private driver. She asked why Ms Heading had not pushed harder to have Chloe removed, given Families SA had received multiple abuse notifications. 'You knew that this woman had left her child with a 15-year-old so that she could consume alcohol ... that's concern enough, isn't it?' she asked. Ms Heading said she had backed her supervisor's judgement, despite having reservations about Polkinghorne. 'It took me by surprise but I had faith in my supervisor ... (to make) tough calls in tough situations,' she said. 'When you're caught up in the moment, you can get over-emotional.' The inquest into the girl's death has heard her short life was marred by horrific squalor and chronic neglect. Chloe died from massive head injuries after she was forced to ride a motorbike over a three-day period that repeatedly crashed at her Adelaide home . Government agency Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old. After 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Polkinghorne, 22, and her boyfriend Benjamin Robert McPartland, 28, forced her to ride the motorbike over three days, which lead to the four year old's death who had massive head injuries. Earlier in the inquest, evidence revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting the teenager about her drug use. One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food. It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends. In October, social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months . Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home. The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking. Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, also told the inquest in October Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house. Ms Stewart said she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother. But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships. Ms Polkinghorne and Mr McPartland, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest continues.","Chloe Valentine, 16 months old, was sent back to her 'paralytic' mother hours after she abandoned her .

"Two top £11,000-a-year independent schools have sparked outrage among parents by organising a Christmas trip to west Africa – just 400 miles from the deadly Ebola zone where even doctors have decided it is too dangerous to visit. Teachers are facing a backlash from parents after arranging the trip to The Gambia for 25 pupils from Cheadle Hulme School in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and Withington Girls' School, in Fallowfield, Manchester. Parents are now urging the school to 'see sense' and cancel the week-long excursion, which costs £700 per pupil, branding it 'unnecessary' and 'very dangerous'. Scroll down for video . Teachers are facing a backlash from parents after arranging a trip to The Gambia, west Africa for 25 pupils from Cheadle Hulme School in Stockport (pictured), and Withington Girls' School, in Fallowfield, Manchester . Parent Dr Magdi Hanafy (pictured), a leading surgeon who recently cancelled an aid trip to Ghana due to the Ebola outbreak, is urging the schools to 'see sense' and cancel the visit over fears of the deadly disease . The Gambia, where the pupils are planning to visit, is surrounded by countries which have been hit by Ebola . The trip, organised by the geography department at Cheadle Hulme, is planned to give youngsters an insight into the country's way of life – but The Gambia is situated just a few hundred miles from the main concentration of the Ebola outbreak. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are the worst affected areas to be hit with Ebola, where the death toll has reached almost 7,000. In total, more than 16,000 have been affected in the three countries alone since the worst outbreak of the deadly virus on record began 12 months ago. With 500 new cases reported in west Africa each week, parents have expressed concern about sending schoolchildren to an area where they could become infected. Dr Magdi Hanafy, a leading surgeon whose daughter was due to go on the field trip, has urged the 1,400 pupil school to cancel the trip after he and an international group of leading medics postponed a humanitarian medical mission to nearby Ghana because of the epidemic. The 58-year-old and his wife Sue, 45, are also vowing to keep their 17-year-old daughter Laura away from school for the incubation period of 21 days if her classmates go on the trip. Father-of-two Dr Hanafy, who has alerted the Department of Health and the Department of Education of his concerns, said: 'There is no necessity or vital need for the trip. 'In normal circumstances, yes, The Gambia is a good experience for them, but in abnormal circumstances why would you take the risk? 'The whole of west Africa is very dangerous and for the school to feel they are safe is naive. 'Even if they are safe they will be able to transmit diseases which could affect the community on their return. 'This is not only about my daughter it's about what will happen when they come back. They need to see sense.' The school trip to The Gambia has been planned to give an insight into the country. Pictured: Cheadle Hulme pupils visiting the country on a previous trip in 2010 during which they helped build new school facilities . The school's geography department arranges the trip every other year. Pictured: Pupils during the 2010 trip . Dr Hanafy, based at Leighton Hospital in Crewe, has been a consultant surgeon for almost 20 years and is a member of Hernia International, a group which annually travels  to deliver self-funded humanitarian  surgery in poverty-stricken African nations. He and a team made up of English, Canadian and German medical professionals were due to travel to Ghana this month to perform free surgery on patients suffering with hernias in the country, but were forced to cancel the trip over Ebola fears. The school field trip is the ninth biennial trip to The Gambian High School, which last year featured the opening of new school buildings, new wells and a village soap making business. Dr Hanafy met teachers to discuss his concerns regarding Ebola but was told staff had received advice from Public Health England saying it was safe to travel to The Gambia. He added: 'In those countries there are no borders - nothing in the terms we understand here. 'People just walk around. The decision was based on the presentation the school had and I was possibly the only one who opposed the idea and on a show of hands many who agreed with going were students. 'It's an irresponsible decision for something so trivial. They could go next year or go somewhere else. 'They could go outside Africa - money is not an issue, whether we get that back or not. Our decision to postpone the aid trip wasn't taken lightly. The Ebola death toll currently stands at 6,928, according to the World Health Organisation, with the total number of people infected having surpassed 16,000 in West Africa. Pictured: Health workers in Liberia . The health agency had launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in West Africa - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by December . December 6, 2013 - Ebola claims the life of its first victim in Guinea, thought to be a two-year-old from a remote village. The toddler, scientists believe was patient zero, suffered a fever, black stools and vomiting. March 25, 2014 - The Guinean authorities report the outbreak to the World Health Organisation after diagnosing the virus as Ebola. By this stage deaths from the virus was still confined to Guinea. May 2014 - It appeared as though the outbreak may be slowing, as the death toll tailed off. May 2014 - A very well-known woman from Guinea, a traditional medical practitioner and leader of a secret society died from the virus, Professor Piot said. Hundreds of people attended her funeral, travelling from three countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Dozens were infected and the disease spread across Guinea's southern border to both neighbouring nations. July 2014 - The virus crossed into Nigeria as Liberian man Patrick Sawyer died en route back to the US. He had been at the funeral of his sister, who died of Ebola. August 8, 2014 - The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. 'We already had our visas and 40 boxes of medication. My daughter is too upset about not going to understand the danger and to understand we are protecting her.' His wife Sue added that the school was 'gambling' by continuing with the trip despite the deadly outbreak. She said: 'When Ebola erupted we changed our minds on the trip because there are a lot of unreported cases in African countries. 'We know they say there is no travelling between the three affected countries but that doesn't interest me because a lot of African people walk across the border. 'You can't guarantee it isn't there. The school said ""if you don't want your children to go, that's fine, but the trip will go ahead"". 'I tried to explain that the risk doesn't stop there and there needs to be a 21 day incubation period. I'm really not happy because what if any child catches the virus, how do you know? 'Even if they go and come back and nobody contracts the virus I will still be disappointed in them because they are gambling. They still took the risk.' Sarah Cookhill, whose daughter goes to nearby Manchester High School, has also expressed fears for the community as pupils from fee-paying Withington Girls' School are also due to go on the trip. She said: 'Manchester High School get on the same bus as Withington Girls', so everybody is concerned. 'There's just no sense for the school trip to carry on with the risk involved. If it is going ahead surely the children should be kept away for 21 days afterwards. 'For the sake of a school trip it seems an absolute farce. Either people are downright stupid or they're happy gambling with safety.' There are 500 new cases of Ebola (above) reported in west Africa each week, according to the health agency . Parents fear there could be some unreported cases of Ebola in The Gambia which could infect the pupils .

"The White House said on Monday that it would veto a bill baring federal agencies from using their funds to implement President Barack Obama's immigration actions if conservatives in Congress successfully pushed it through. The spokesperson for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had been hesitant in the past to say outright that Obama would veto such legislation if it were to pass, but with the proposal gaining steam, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today that the president would send the bill back to Congress should it land on his desk. The veto threat comes as a group of conservative House members reviewed specific language they want inserted in an upcoming spending bill prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security from using any funds whatsoever to the distribution of work permits and green cards for the roughly five million illegal immigrants Obama has instructed the agency to stop deporting. Scroll down for videos . President Barack Obama is pictured here signing two presidential memoranda associated with his actions on immigration in his office on Air Force One on Friday, Nov. 21. Conservatives in Congress are trying to block them from taking effect by placing restrictions on how relevant immigration agencies can use their funds . A draft copy of the language, obtained exclusively by MailOnline, states that 'no part of any appropriation,' including 'funds or fees collected or otherwise made available for expenditure, may be used by any agency to implement, administer, enforce or carry out any of the policy changes set forth' in the president's recent directives to DHS. Resolute in their opposition to the president's unilateral decision to defer the deportation of up to five million illegal immigrants, staunch conservative lawmakers are pressuring Republican leadership to include the prohibitive language in a must-pass bill that would keep the government from shutting down next week. Conservatives are charging ahead with the plan to restrict the spending of government agencies that handle immigration, specifically the distribution of green cards and work permits Obama has promised illegal migrants, even as Republican party leaders continue to balk at the strategy and appropriators in the House claim it's not possible. GOP House members will hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday during which both sides will have the opportunity to make their case to the entire caucus. The outcome of the intra-party battle will be a telling sign of how much influence the Tea Party wing of the GOP will have over the party's agenda in the coming legislative session when Republicans take full control over both chambers of Congress for the final two years of Obama's tenure in the White House. It will also show just how thirsty Republicans are to reign in Obama's authority as chief executive of the country. If the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate are unable to come to an agreement on appropriations legislation by Dec. 11 - the day before lawmakers are scheduled to leave town until early next year - non-essential government services will go dark until new spending legislation is passed. While Senate Majority Leader Harry has accused Republican legislators trying to use the critical appropriations bill of 'holding our government hostage,' conservatives on the Hill say they don't believe it will come down to a shutdown. Faced with the possibility of a second stoppage in normal government functions in less than two years, they believe Senate Democrats will cave under pressure and allow their bill to come to the floor, setting up a separate confrontation with the White House. Still under discussion is whether the language would be part of a standalone bill to fund DHS that is separate from an omnibus bill funding the rest of the government through at least the first month of next year, allowing other government agencies to continue operating if the measure is unsuccessful, or whether the GOP will go all or nothing and include it in the main legislation to keep the government open. The draft obtained by MailOnline and confirmed by multiple GOP sources on the Hill does not detail the legislative strategy and a source familiar with the proposal confirmed to MailOnline that it's still up for debate. Among the actions taken by the president targeted in the draft are his memorandums changing the 'Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants' and those that give DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson the prosecutorial discretion to defer deportation of migrants residing in the country illegally who came to the U.S. as children before Jan. 1, 2010. It would also block DHS from issuing work permits to illegal immigrants who have been living in the U.S. since that date and have American-born children and prevent it from handing out additional permits to high-skilled workers. If the immigration specific language were set aside in a stand alone bill and Senate Democrats refused to bring it to the floor after it's all but assured passage in the House, only DHS would be affected by the partial shutdown a GOP congressional source told MailOnline recently. Even then, essential services in the department, including border security, would go untouched. 'Congress cannot hand the President a blank check for his continued lawlessness,' Dan Holler, the communications director of influential conservative grassroots group Heritage Action told MailOnline in an email. 'The Republican-controlled House should use the upcoming funding bill to block Obama’s plan to give amnesty, work permits and Social Security numbers to those who are in the country illegally.' A demonstrator who disagrees with Obama's immigration policies stands outside Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, Nevada on Nov. 21 during an event in which the president delivered remarks on his executive actions . Members of the House Appropriations committee recently issued a statement saying that a key immigration agency the bill is designed to keep from enforcing Obama's memorandum is not subject to congressional oversight of its funds because it receives much of its money from application fees. However, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, a government-funded fact-finding organization that works for Congress, debunked that claim in a letter last week to a senator who strongly favors the conservative approach. 'The funds available to the agency through fee collections would be subject to the same potential restrictions imposed by Congress on the use of its appropriations as any other type of appropriated funds,' it said, breathing new life into conservative legislators' plot. Though Republicans account for a majority of the members in the House, they have just 45 seats in the Senate and would need to convince at least 15 Democratic and Independent lawmakers to join their cause in order to have a filibuster-proof majority. A handful of Democratic Senators have publicly shown their displeasure with the president over his decision to go it alone on immigration but whether they would vote to tie their party leaders hands is less clear. If they did and Obama did refuse to sign the legislation, leading to a government shut down, that would be president's fault, not lawmakers', conservatives on Capitol have vehemently argued. 'President Obama will no doubt threaten a shutdown—that seems to be the one card he repeatedly plays,' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said in a recent op-ed in Politico outlining the GOP strategy to defund the president's immigration actions. 'If the President is unwilling to accept funding for, say, the Department of Homeland Security without his being able to unilaterally defy the law, he alone will be responsible for the consequences,' Cruz wrote. Cruz, a presumed 2016 presidential candidate, notably led the charge last fall to gut the president's signature law, Obamacare. When Democrats refused to vote for legislation starving the health care law of its funding, the government shut down for more than two weeks beginning on Oct. 1, the first day of the 2014 fiscal year. It was not until the evening of Oct. 16 that Republicans in the House and Senate approved a continuing resolution allowing the government to reopen. The White House said Monday that it doesn't believe that a majority of lawmakers would again be willing to shut down the government. Pointing to previous statements from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  that a shutdown is not in the works, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said today that it sends a 'pretty clear' message when one of 'the most influential Republicans in Congress' says it's not going to happen. The White house, he told reporters on Monday afternoon, continues to stand by its position that Congress should pass a yearlong appropriations bill. 'What we would like to see is something that would sort of eliminate any kind of uncertainty,' he said, adding that Congress should pass an omnibus spending bill that would fund all areas of the government. 'We're not asking them to do anything heroic, we're asking them to do their job,' Earnest stated.","MailOnline exclusively obtained a draft copy of the legislation under consideration by conservatives in the House .

"The Arkansas teen impaled through the jaw by a deer's antler during a horrific car crash has recalled the moment she first looked at her reflection  moments after the accident. 'You look in that mirror and see your teeth aren't where they used to be. Your face is bleeding really bad, and you realize this isn't a time where I can just call mom,' said 17-year-old high school senior Tori Henry about the October smash. Rushed to hospital, Henry underwent five hours of emergency surgery to wire her face and repair the damage left after the deer came through the windscreen on the drivers side as it bolted through traffic. Scroll Down for Video . Recovery: Tori Henry is now back at home after her collision with the deer in October and has only a small scar on her left hand side to show for the near-fatal crash . Support: Tori with her mother Nikki Winn who says that her daughter has learned to appreciate life more following the accident . Now, two months later and multiple operations, Tori has been left with only a small scar. 'At first, you know, I was really scared because I wouldn't see Tori anymore,' said the teen to KFVS.12. Due to the stellar work of surgeons at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Jonesboro, Tori had two metal plates put into her jaw. Back home now and able to reflect on her brush with death, Tori told KFVS that she would not change a thing about that moment or that day. 'Every little detail of the accident is what it needed to be for me to be sitting right here, right now,' said Tori. Injuries: Tori Henry is pictured after a deer smashed into her car window and impaled her jaw with its antler . 'I would not take this accident back. It opens your eyes so much to the reality of life isn't a guarantee.' Tori's mother, Nikki Winn said that she believes her daughters positive attitude was responsible for her full recovery. 'I only allowed progress,' said Tori. 'Nothing else was allowed. Recovery was all that I was going to do.' Nikki said that now the most important thing for her daughter is to return to her schooling and routine. Recovering: Tori, right ahead of Homecoming just a week before the incident, managed to stay calm despite the terrifying ordeal and pulled her car over. She was later airlifted to hospital and underwent surgery . 'We are just trying to be normal again,' said Winn to KFVS. 'If we can inspire people along the way and make a difference in someone's life then that's great.' Tori said that if anyone was to see her as an inspiration then she would be happy, albeit reluctantly. 'Me just talking to them and then hearing my story and seeing how quickly I recovered, if that could just make them feel better about themselves then it would be a dream come true to me,' said Tori. And in the aftermath of the accident, Tori now has decided to consider a career in medicine, so impressed and grateful was she for the care given to her by the doctors and nurses. Fighter: Her mother said that Tori is physically recovering but is still emotionally shaken up by the incident - but says her daughter's positive mental attitude was key . On the mend: Henry is pictured during her stay in hospital with an actress dressed as Elsa from Disney's Frozen . In October, the teenager was driving on one of the city's busiest streets when the five-point buck tried to jump over her car - but smashed into the driver's window and impaled her face with its antler. Despite the terrifying experience, Tori stayed surprisingly calm, her mother told KAIT. 'She kept her composure after the deer hit her and drove and parked her car so no one else would get hurt,' her proud mom, Nikki Winn, said. As she recovered, Tori posted pictures of her sporting a swollen cheek, but they were a far cry from the week before the accident, when she was voted to be part of Homecoming court at Paragould High School.","Tori Henry, 17, hit the deer in early October and was severely injured .

"The ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. Geologists have uncovered evidence that a mountainous area of Svaneti in what is now northwest Georgia was the country ‘rich of gold’ described in the legend. They claim that villagers that were part of the wealthy Kingdom of Colchis, which existed from the sixth to the first centuries BC, used sheepskin to capture gold from mountain streams in the area. Among artifacts found in  villages of Svaneti, northwest Georgia was a bronze sculpture of a bird with a ram's head that researchers say lends support that the myth of the golden fleece originated in the area . The fleece was used to line the bottom of the sandy stream beds, trapping any tiny grains of gold that built up there. The technique is a variation on panning used elsewhere in the world. This, they say, would have lead to sheepskins that were imprinted with flakes of gold and could have given rise to stories of a golden fleece. Historic artifacts, including a bronze sculpture of a bird with a ram's head, that were found in the villages of Svaneti also lend support that the kingdom was the source of the myth. Dr Avtandil Okrostsvaridze, a geologist from the institute of earth sciences at the Ilia State University, Georgia, said the story of Jason and his Argonauts quest to find the Golden Fleece may have been a real event to learn about the sheepskin gold mining technique. The myth of Jason and the Argonauts' quest to the the ancient Kingdom of Colchis to obtain the Golden Fleece has been a highly contentious subject among historians. The ancient Greek legend has several, often contradictory, accounts of the adventures of Jason and his Argonauts on their ship the Argo in the years before the Trojan War. It is described as a real story by  Eurpides in his play Medea. The Greek poet Apollo of Rhodes also dedicates a poem to the voyage where he gives a detailed description of the Kingdom of Colchis. The ancient Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder was among the first to provide a theory for what the Golden Fleece may have been, but many historians through the years have suggested that it could have been a sign of power, a sign of wealth, a book on alchemy, a particularly fine silk cloak or even simply a specially valuable breed of sheep. According to the Greek myth the Golden Fleece had belonged to a golden ram that Jason's ancestor Phrixus had flown east from Greece to the land of Cochlis, where King Aietes, son of the sun god Helios, had sacrificed it. The fleece was then hung in a sacred grove belonging to the war god Kratos. Jason snuck in and stole the fleece. He said: ‘The phenomena of the “Golden Fleece”, according to our research, is connected with the sheepskin technique of recovering placer gold (gold that has built up in sand deposits). ‘The end result of this technique of gold recovery river gravels was a gold imprinted sheepskin, giving rise to the romantic and unidentified phenomena of the “Golden Fleece” in the civilized world. ‘We think, from our investigations, that the bedrock and placer gold contents of this region give grounds to believe that there was enough gold in this region to describe Svaneti as “the country rich of this noble metal”. ‘We share the viewpoint of the Roman historian Apian Alexandrine and suppose that the myth about expedition of Argonauts in quest of the “Golden Fleece” to the Colchis Kingdom was a real event and that the main purpose of this mission was to obtain gold and sheepskin technique of gold mining.’ Dr Okrostsvaridze and colleagues from the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University in Georgia, conducted a widespread survey of gold deposits in the Svaneti region. They report in the journal Quaternary International that they used remote sensing and analysed more than 1,000 rock and gravel samples to assess the gold content in the area. They found that placer gold, where nuggets and flakes sink to the bottom of a stream bed, were extensively exposed throughout the time of the Kingdom of Colchis. Although the Kingdom of Colchis was named in the legend of Jason and his Argonauts as the place where they stole the Golden Fleece, the exact location has always been disputed. Some ancient sources, and modern academics, have said it could have belonged to the Vani people of Colchis, whose territory was in the middle of the kingdom, but others have predicted it was the Svans who lived in the mountainous north. The Kingdom of Colchis was a wealthy area in what is now modern Georgia where according to Greek mythology King Aeëtes hung the Golden Fleece until it was seized by Jason and the Argonauts . According to Greek mythology Jason and the Argonauts sailed in their ship the Argo from Greece to the Kingdom of Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece as part of a quest to help Jason win the throne of Iolcus . Gold grains washed from the gravel stream bed of the River Quani in Svaneti. Streams in the area are still panned by locals for gold, some of whom still use traditional methods that include sheepskin . A unique golden lion sculpture from the beginning of the second millennium BC is thought to show the sophisticated skill at obtaining and casting metal around the time when the Golden Fleece myth began . They used remote sensing and analysed more than 1,000 rock and gravel samples to assess the gold content in the area. They found that placer gold, where nuggets and flakes sink to the bottom of a stream bed, were extensively exposed throughout the time of the Kingdom of Colchis.

Some ancient sources, and modern academics, have said it could have belonged to the Vani people of Colchis, whose territory was in the middle of the kingdom, but others have predicted it was the Svans who lived in the mountainous north. Dr Okrostsvaridze, however, points to golden artifacts found in the villages around Svaneti as evidence that they had sophisticated mining and meteorological skills. These include a unique golden lion sculpture that has been dated back to the second millennium BC. He said: 'This shows that gold mining and its artistic processing was at a very high level, very early in the history of the old Georgian kingdoms. 'Our work shows that the gold content in the rivers sands of this region are sufficiently large to give grounds for the creation of legends.' Svaneti sits beneath the main ridge of the Greater Caucusus mountains in northwest Georgia where streams still run rich with gold deposits according to the analysis by geologists . Surveys by the geologists show that gold ore veins (marked with orange ovals) and stream beds that contain rich gold deposits (marked with yellow ovals) exist today and have been replenished after historical mining . Geological surveys by Dr Okrostsvaridze and his team reveal that gold deposits in many areas that were historically mined have been replenished as streams have continued to wash them down the mountainsides. Indeed, he said that some locals still use traditional techniques to obtain gold from the rivers in the area and it may even be possible for modern day Argonauts to find a golden fleece of their own today. He said: ‘Our work has confirmed that Svaneti is a region, uniquely, where the locals still wash gold from alluvial placers through modern domestic, wooden vessels or pans with holes in the bottom and unto a sheepskin or fleece which collects the fine particulate gold.’","Ancient villagers used sheepskins to line stream beds in the Svaneti region of the Southern Caucasus in northwest Georgia .

"Nine Cleveland police officers involved in a deadly 2012 police shooting are accusing the police department of racial discrimination. Eight white officers and one Hispanic officer filed a federal lawsuit against the city on Friday, alleging that the police department treats non-black officers involved in shootings of blacks more harshly than black officers. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for discrimination and civil rights violations after they were suspended, allowed back on regular duty and then placed back on restricted duty in a move they argue was 'politically expedient.' Racial tension: Several of the officers involved in the 2012 shooting deaths of two black unarmed Cleveland citizens are suing the city over claims non-black officers are treated unfairly harshly following shootings of black suspects . Thirteen Cleveland police officers fired into the victims' car after a high-speed chase, killing 43-year-old driver Timothy Russell and 30-year-old passenger Malissa Williams in the parking lot of a suburban middle school . 'A serious dichotomy exists as a result of the defendants' longstanding practices and procedures which place onerous burdens on non-African American officers, including the plaintiffs, because of their race and the race of persons who are the subjects of the legitimate use of deadly force,' reads the suit. The officers were not allowed back on to regular duty until June 2014, reports CNN. By then, they say they'd missed out on potential wages, transfers and promotions. They are suing for unspecified damages. The relatives of the two African American people killed in a barrage of police gunfire in 2012 will split a $3 million settlement from the city of Cleveland, the attorney for one of the families said Tuesday. Thirteen Cleveland police officers fired into the victims' car after a high-speed chase, killing 43-year-old driver Timothy Russell and 30-year-old passenger Malissa Williams in the parking lot of a suburban middle school. Both were unarmed. Russell family attorney Terry Gilbert said the settlement of the federal lawsuit helps avoid long and expensive litigation. Williams' family attorney, David Malik, declined to comment. City spokesman Dan Williams would not comment on specifics of the agreement but said 'the settlement speaks for itself.' Disciplined: Cleveland authorities including (left to right) Director of Public Safety, Martin L. Flask, Police Chief, Michael McGrath, and Mayor Frank Jackson, announced in October 2013 that 63 officers were suspended for breaking rules during a deadly chase . Gilbert called the shooting 'probably one of the worst cases of police misconduct' in U.S. history because of the number of police officers involved. More than 100 officers and 60 police cars, including some driven by supervisors, were involved in the chase. Gilbert said that by the time the chase ended in East Cleveland, officers had Russell's car blocked in and surrounded when they opened fire. 'We felt it important to address the conduct of all the shooters, not just officer Brelo,' Gilbert said, referring to Michael Brelo, who faces two counts of voluntary manslaughter for having jumped on the hood of Russell's car and firing the last 15 rounds into the windshield. He fired a total of 49 rounds. Five supervisors face misdemeanor dereliction of duty charges. Gilbert said the lack of supervision during the chase and shooting was evidence of a systemic problem within the police department that 'led to the massive violations of the constitutional rights of Russell and Williams.' The chase began when officers patrolling near a homeless shelter on the edge of downtown Cleveland thought they heard a gunshot. Investigators later said it was likely that the officers heard Russell's car backfiring. That sparked a 20-mile chase that lasted 23 minutes and reached speeds of 110 mph. The U.S. Justice Department is conducting an investigation of the Cleveland police department's pursuit and use of force practices.","The eight white officers, and one Hispanic, were among the Cleveland cops who killed Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams in a hail of 137 bullets .

"The two artists who collaborated with Shia LaBeouf on an art project called #IAMSORRY have backed up the actor’s allegation that he was raped during the performance earlier this year. For five days in February, the 28-year-old invited the public to visit him one-on-one in a small room in a Los Angeles gallery where he sat wearing a paper bag over his face that read: 'I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE'.

'[She] whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me.’ LaBeouf’s collaborators, British artist Luke Turner and Finnish artist Nastja Säde Rönkkö, have said they intervened as soon as they became aware of the incident and ‘put a stop to it’. Both artists posted the same statements on Twitter on Sunday, which they described as ‘important clarifications’ about the project. ‘Nowhere did we state that people could do whatever they wanted to Shia during #IAMSORRY. ‘As soon as we were aware of the incident starting to occur, we put a stop to it and ensured that the woman left.’ When asked if the incident was reported to the police, Turner did not respond but said that their collaboration with the actor continued. 'It was painful': Shia LaBeouf claimed on Thursday that a woman raped him during his #IAMSORRY performance art installation at the Stephen Cohen Gallery in Los Angeles, California, on Valentine's Day . For full hour meeting visit Dazed . LaBeouf told Dazed that the woman ‘walked out with disheveled hair and smudged lipstick’ past ‘hundreds of people in line’ including Mia Goth, his girlfriend of two years. 'It was no good, not just for me but her man as well,' LaBeouf wrote. 'It was Valentine’s Day and I was living in the gallery for the duration [February 11-16] of the event. 'We (Mia and I) were separated for five days, no communication. 'So it really hurt her as well, as I guess the news of it traveled through the line.

LaBeouf also vented his frustration at gallery patrons who would 'come in, take my [paper] bag off, pop off a selfie, and bounce.' 'We both sat with this unexplained trauma silently': Even more unsettling was that Shia's girlfriend of two years, Mia Goth, was among the 'hundreds' waiting for a one-on-one with him (pictured on Tuesday) 'Some would hold my hand and cry with me, some would tell me to ""figure it out"" or to ""be a man.""

'I always had a f****d up view on masculinity,' he admitted. 'My father [Jeffrey] was a gun nut like Hemingway. He was also a junkie and a bully, mainly to prove he wasn’t effeminate, even though he was a painter and a poet, a mime, and a storyteller.' After corresponding with British reporter Aimee Cliff for two weeks online, the pair donned GoPros and sat together silently in LaBeouf's London hotel room last month.

In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel he explained that his arrest came after he'd been drinking whiskey for several hours following a trip to Ireland and that he was merely trying to calm the homeless man he was photographed with in Times Square. According to TMZ, the judge gave Shia a 'thumbs-up' after he brought a progress report detailing his outpatient alcohol rehab to Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday.

"Two men have appeared in court accused of killing a chef who died after they allegedly wrapped him in clingfilm. Richard Bowler and David Connor, both from Canterbury, are charged with unlawfully killing 47-year-old Alun Williams by wrapping him in clingfilm and plastics and subjecting him to 'at least the risk of self-harm.' Mr Williams, who worked as a chef on P&O Ferries for more than 30 years, was found dead in a flat above a hairdressers' in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year. Richard Bowler, 35, and David Connor, 23, both from Canterbury, Kent, (pictured outside court today) are charged with unlawfully killing Alun Williams, who was wrapped in plastics and clingfilm at a flat in Dover . Mr Williams, 47, was found dead and wrapped in clingfilm at a flat in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year . Bowler, 35, and Connor, 23, appeared at Canterbury Crown Court today as the trial got underway. They are both charged with unlawful killing and the charge specifies that wrapping Mr Williams in clingfilm and plastics 'subjected him to bodily harm in the form of dehydration, overheating and stress to his cardiovascular system'. It states that this was the 'substantial cause of his death'. The defendants also face an alternative charge of manslaughter by gross negligence, which specifies that by wrapping him up they owed him a duty of care and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure he was safe and well. Bowler appeared in court today dressed in a purple polo shirt and brown coat while Connor wore a dark jacket in the dock. Prosecutor Ian Hope is expected to outline the Crown's case tomorrow morning but the jury has already been told it will involve details of gay websites, including Gaydar and Recon. Bowler and Connor both deny the charges against them. Police officers stand guard at the entrance to the flat where Mr Williams was found dead in August last year .

"Forget the provocative likes of Rihanna and Miley Cyrus; in Japan, the look that both men and women aspire to is cute, wholesome and resolutely virginal. Japanese culture, in particular popular cartoons such as Manga and Hello Kitty, has an innocent mien while the cult of the computer game loving geek, the otaru, is burgeoning. But Japan's obsession with all things cute has come at a price. Not only are people having less sex, the country's birthrate has declined so much the Japanese population is expected to drop by a third within the next 50 years. No sex please, we're Japanese: Many young people from Japan are choosing not to have sex . In Tokyo, a city of 35 million people, just 250,000 babies are born each year - a shockingly low figure when compared to London's rate of 135,000 children born to a population of just eight million. So what's going on? It's a question that film maker Anita Rani attempts to answer in new BBC documentary, No Sex Please, We're Japanese. 'There are lots of reasons for the population decline but one of the biggest trends is that young Japanese people are moving away from wanting to have sex,' Rani revealed in an interview with MailOnline. 'Many young people have just decided they don't want any part of it. I'm as baffled as anyone else by it!' Most baffling of all are the otaku [geeks], many of whom have chosen to withdraw from the dating game altogether in favour of 'relationships' with virtual girlfriends. An increasing number of 'otaku' (geeks) are choosing to have a relationship with a virtual girlfriend over a real woman . Among them are Nurakan, 38, and Yugai, 39, whose 'girlfriends' Ne-ne and Rinko both come in a box and are part of a virtual game created by Nintendo called Love +. And the pair really do believe they're in real relationships with the animated characters. 'I like the girls in this game too much,' explains Yugai, who adds that he tries not to have sexual feelings about his virtual girlfriend because the relationship is supposed to be platonic. Asked whether he'd like a real girlfriend, he answers: 'Yes of course I do but since I began a relationship with Ne-ne, I'm really emotionally involved with her.' 'Ne-ne', should you have forgotten, is a cartoon schoolgirl, who says things like: 'do you really want to talk this late at night?', 'Because I . like you, I will always want to be with you' and 'Let's go to the . beach, let's dream and have lots of fun.' Yugai, who says he is 17 in the Love + game, explains that for him, being involved with a cartoon is easier because he will never have to contemplate marriage. 'At high school you can have relationships without having to think about . marriage,' he explains. 'With real life girlfriends, you have to consider marriage so I . think twice about going out with a 3D woman.' Is it the Japanese obsession with cute that is leading to the population crisis? 'There's so many great distractions,' explains Roland, a non-otaku man who appears in the documentary. 'Why would you get into something as messy, as troubling, as disorienting as a relationship when you could have a virtual girlfriend, a virtual experience, that maybe is even superior to the reality? 'I do know a number of men in Japan, and elsewhere, who find the role play games, the dating SIMS, even advances in pornography, and would rather experience the opposite sex that way than go through the challenges of relationships.' Unsurprisingly, Japanese women are not impressed. 'Relatively speaking, I think most . Japanese women find Japanese men wanting,' explains Roland. 'Men haven't developed autonomy or a sense of individualism and you now have a generation of . women who want something more. They want to be independent themselves . and they want men to be independent too.' 'They were nice guys and totally normal,' says Anita of Yugai and Nurakan. 'They were cool blokes but when it comes to women, they don't want to engage.' Her view is borne out by the experience of a group of Japanese women interviewed for the documentary, among them career girls Natsuo and Yamiko. 'Japanese men are straight but they are . not interested in women that much,' explains Natsuo. 'They don't aggressively try to get . girlfriends. Documentary: Film maker Anita Rani went in search of reasons for the Japanese preference for celibacy . Her friend Yamiko adds: 'They are afraid to get real contact with humans.' A recent survey by Japanese insurance company Meiji Yasuda Life found that a third of Japanese men under 40 have never dated women at all, although women themselves aren't much better. 'They are afraid to get real contact with humans.' - Yamiko . A survey by the Japanese Family Planning Association done earlier this year found that 45 per cent of women between 18 and 24 'were not interested in or despised sexual contact.' 'A few people can't relate to the opposite sex physically or in any other way,' adds Ai Aoyama, a Japanese sex and relationship counsellor in an interview with the Guardian. 'They flinch if I touch them. Most are men, but I'm starting to see more women.' So what is to be done about Japan's ageing population and sex-shy younger generation? For Anita, the answer is more immigration, which she says would give women freedom to work after becoming mothers - a practice currently frowned upon in Japan - as well increasing the number of taxpayers. 'Everyone in Japan is aware of the problem so . conversations happening at highest level,' she explains. 'They know they need to adapt workplaces . to make them child and family friendly. But immigration is big issue over . there because Japan is nation that's always been closed.' But with an ageing population and a growing number of twenty and thirty-somethings who simply aren't interested in real life relationships, Japan is running out of time.

"This is the spectacular moment millions of red crabs on a remote in the Indian Ocean  began their migration to breed more of the fire-coloured creatures. A sea of red moves on Christmas Island, 2,500km north-west of Perth, from the forests to the Indian Ocean where the crustaceans will mate. IT specialist and amateur photographer Gary Tindale, 53, from Perth, captured the start of the migration two weeks ago and saw 'the crabs just pour out of the jungle and take over'. Scroll down for video . An estimated 120 million red crabs live on the 52 square mile island shared with just more than 2,000 residents . The incredible sight attracts thousands of islanders to see the phenomenon, which lasts several weeks as the 14 different species of crabs take over the island, which has a large areas of monsoonal forest. 'The speed with which everything on the island changes is incredible. On Tuesday (Nov 18) the weather started out fine and there was maybe one or two crabs around,' said Mr Tindale. 'In the afternoon, storms came through and that evening the red crabs were out in force. The island had evolved into a red carpet; a sea of red as the crabs started heading down to the Indian Ocean,' he said. The crabs move in their crimson wave to and from their breeding ground and habitat, as the crabs gradually move down to the ocean to spawn. 'A few weeks later, the spawn return and a shimmering carpet of small tiny one inch crabs returns to the jungle,' Mr Tindale said. An estimated 120 million red crabs live on the 52 square mile island shared with just more than 2,000 residents. The bright display of natural wonder forces roads on the island to close, allowing the crabs to cross and bringing the island to a standstill. 'But the majority of areas are off limits for a few months for all vehicles,' said Mr Tindale. 'Where cars do travel, everyone is weaving around to avoid the crabs and sometimes it's probably quicker to walk,' he said. 'They bring many things on the island to a halt, whole swathes of the rain forest, tourist style areas, beaches and trails are closed.'

"Privately educated pupils can harm society with their 'bullish and charmless' over-confidence, a leading headmaster has admitted. Andrew Halls, head of fee-paying King’s College School in Wimbledon, warned that an independent education can lead to former pupils 'asphyxiating the society they move in'. He said that the 'prefect and house' system taught students that influence matters. Andrew Halls, head of fee-paying King’s College School in Wimbledon, warned that an independent education can lead to former pupils 'asphyxiating the society they move in' Mr Halls, whose school charges fees for day pupils of £19,500-a-year, said that the 'prefect and house' system taught students that influence matters . Mr Halls told The Times: 'Some independent school children can asphyxiate the society they move in because their confidence is so bullish and charmless. 'There are downsides to overconfidence; people can feel a bit repelled by it. The comments come after Homeland actor Damian Lewis revealed that going to Eton was the perfect training for his upcoming role as Henry VIII. The 43-year-old, who has become one of Britain’s biggest acting exports after making his name with roles in Homeland and Band Of Brothers, . Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: ‘I think there is no question that it helps having had the kind of schooling I’ve had to play a king. ‘It’s not such a leap oddly – even though the thought of being a monarch of any nation is mind-boggling and not something I could imagine easily at all. ‘But, yes, there’s just the sort of court structure, hierarchies and the way they are set up which is something I understand.’ His comments came after he compared his OBE, which he received on Wednesday afternoon, to being made a school prefect, as he felt it put him under pressure to be extremely responsible and to prove himself. 'I remember when I heard I was being awarded it, it was a little bit like ""now you've got to prove it"",' he said. 'It was a bit like being asked to be a prefect, now I have to be extremely responsible.' Mr Halls clarified his comments to the MailOnline. He said: 'They (independent schools) obviously do a fantastic job with most kids, who have a real joy taking part in society. 'What I mean to say, is that we as schools have a responsibility to the children to make sure they do not leave with an excessive sense of entitlement. 'It is important that independent schools ensure that students leave with a sense of debt, not to us, but to society. 'Many, not all, have had very fortunate upbringings. 'So many good things, for all of us in the rich west, can make us complacent in the real world.' He said First World War hero Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse  - was an inspirational example of a privately educated man who gave back to society. It comes after Homeland actor Damian Lewis revealed that going to Eton was the perfect training for his upcoming role as Henry VIII . Educated at Magdalene College School in Oxford, Chevasse is one of only three people to be awarded a Victoria Cross twice. He said: 'He had a fantastic education, but he was not a great charmer or a conformist. He was actually quite a difficult man, stubbornly dedicated to the health, wealth and welfare of his men and an incredibly brave captain who saved hundreds of lives. ' At Kings, Mr Halls said students do not have lessons on a Friday afternoon and instead do activities with 27 local state schools as part of a partnership programme. He said: 'That to me is what we should be doing more of. We should be out there playing our part in a world which is there to be improved and made healthier. 'I'm not trying to show off about Kings, and I must sound very hypocritical, but that's my job and I have to try and help these fortunate and good men and women feel commitment to improving circumstances. 'And they do have that commitment and love for doing good things.' He has also warned recently that private schools were in danger of becoming the preserve of wealthy oligarchs as fee hikes price out middle-class families. He warned that many parents in traditionally well-paid careers as accountancy and law were no longer able to afford a private education for their children. The most expensive private schools were becoming little more than ‘finishing schools for the children of oligarchs’, he said. Some schools had become so reliant on pupils from overseas they were at risk of suffering a banking-style crash. The actor, 43, said his OBE honour, presented by the Duke of Cambridge, was as a complete surprise, and added: 'It was a bit like being asked to be a prefect, now I have to be extremely responsible' Prepared: Lewis said his time at English boarding school Eton (pictured) had helped him with his latest role . Fifty private schools in recent years had closed, merged with another school or joined the state system, he said. Mr Halls, whose school charges fees for day pupils of £19,500-a-year, said: ‘We have allowed the apparently endless queue of wealthy families from across the world knocking at our doors to blind us to a simple truth: we charge too much. ‘Somewhere along the way, first the nurses stopped sending children to us, then the policemen, then armed forces officers, then even the local accountants and lawyers. ‘The most prestigious schools in the world teach the children of the very wealthiest families in the world. A typical boarding school now requires a parent to have a spare £30,000 in taxed income to pay for just one child — every year. ‘We are in danger of coming across as greedy, because we can charge what appears to be limitless fees but in truth there is a fees timebomb ticking away. It feels like the build-up to the banking crisis. For the first time in my career, I feel that the shifts over the next 10 years could prove seismic.’","Andrew Halls, head of fee-paying King’s College School in Wimbledon .

"Archaeologists may have recovered a skeleton from a large burial mound in Amphipolis, but now they are hopeful there could be more to find. Experts have opened the second phase of their excavation of the vast 4th-century BC tomb in search of more burial chambers. They hope these chambers may hold ancient members of the Macedonian royal family, or the legendary warrior king Alexander the Great himself. Experts have opened the second phase of their excavation of the vast 4th-century BC tomb (pictured) in search of more burial chambers that they hope may hold ancient member of the Macedonian royal family, or legendary warrior king Alexander the Great himself . The team will scan two hectares (five acres) of the vast mound to look for clues about what may lie beneath. The first search of the site, which was built shortly after Alexander the Great's death, yielded an elaborately decorated tomb containing a skeleton, as well as large sculptures and a beautiful mosaic floor. Earlier this month, experts analysing the skeleton found in the vault, claimed that the person who was buried there was male and probably an 'important general'. He was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair, they said, suggesting that the remains could belong to blue-eyed king, Alexander the Great himself, who was reputed to have strawberry blonde hair. Geophysicists will scan two hectares (five acres) of the vast mound to look for clues about what may lie beneath. This image shows one of its entrances, guarded by two mythical sphixes . Experts believe the ancient mound, situated around 65 miles (100km) from Thessaloniki (shown on the map) was built for a prominent Macedonian in around 300 to 325 BC . Analysis of the skeleton discovered in an underground vault has revealed the man buried there was of medium height, with pale skin and brown or red hair (illustrated). While some experts dare to hope it could be Alexander the Great himself, others say that even the skeleton's gender is in doubt . Skeletal remains show the man buried in the Amphipolis tomb was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair. He must have been of high social status, based on his opulent final surroundings. Archaeologists say he was probably an important general, although because the tomb was looted in antiquity, no shield or sword have been found, which were typically buried with Macedonian warriors. Experts are studying the bones to reveal what the man died of and what he ate. However, doubt has now been cast on this and some experts claim the sex of the remains is not known. Katerina Peristeri, head of the Amphipolis Tomb excavation said  that the man was probably of high status, but because robbers removed valuable items in antiquity, no weapons or precious objects remain in situ. The skeleton is undergoing DNA analysis to deduce if the man was a member of the Macedonian royal family, as well as to learn his age. Greek Culture Minister Costas Tasoulas visited the burial mound to announce the new phase of the exploration. Geophysicists are scanning the site to see if there are other structures besides the impressive, three-chamber tomb discovered in August. The area being scanned is about one-seventh of the total area of the mound. Scientists will compare the DNA of the bones to that of Phillip II, who was buried at Vergina, but this will be difficult because the genetic material is 'overworked,' Lina Mendoni, the culture ministry's general secretary told Iefimerida. The bones of Phillip II - father of Alexander the Great - were burnt and because DNA tests were carried out some 50 years ago, it is feared the results may have been contaminated. The skeletal remains were found both inside and outside the rectangular stone-lined cist (pictured), under the floor of the cavernous, vaulted structure that is 26 feet (eight metres) tall. They are undergoing DNA analysis . There has been speculation that the tomb could be that of Alexander the Great (a mosaic depicting the king is shown). Examinations of the remains have established they belong to a man who was  a general . While the announcement was made about the skeleton’s identity, some experts claim that its gender is uncertain. Identifying it may never be possible, even if its DNA is checked, said Ms Mendoni. Speculation on the identity has been rife among experts, including theories that the remains are of Alexander's mother, widow, son, half-brother, or Nearchos, one of Alexander's closest aides and an Amphipolis native. Meanwhile, archaeologists are still uncovering multicoloured decorations found inside the dug up tomb. And lasers will be used to study them, Ms Mendoni said. Greece’s Ministry of Culture revealed earlier this month that the body had been placed in a wooden coffin, which disintegrated over time. The skeletal remains were found both inside and outside the rectangular stone-lined cist, under the floor of the cavernous, vaulted structure that is 26ft (eight metres) tall . Iron and bronze nails, as well as carved bone and glass decorations from the coffin, were also found scattered in the grave. Archaeologists in the past have said the grave likely belonged to a prominent Macedonian – possibly a military man. Clockwise from top right shows two headless, marble sphinxes found above the entrance to the barrel-vaulted tomb, details of the facade and the lower courses of the blocking wall, the antechamber's mosaic floor, a 4.2-metre long stone slab, and the upper uncovered sections of two female figures. The second and third chambers, not pictured, have not yet been explored . Archaeologists are now searching for more burial chambers and bodies hidden in the vast mound, they have already uncovered many sculptures such as this bust, thought to be the head of a sphinx . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt, but it is thought his body was moved to prevent looting. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. The Culture Ministry said: 'It is probably the monument of a dead person who became a hero, meaning a mortal who was worshipped by society at that time. 'The deceased was a prominent person, since only this could explain the construction of this unique burial complex.' ‘It is an extremely expensive construction, whose cost, clearly, is unlikely to have been borne by a private citizen.' Michalis Tiverios, a professor of archaeology at the University of Thessaloniki who has not been involved with the dig, said the human remains should provide valuable information on the occupant of the tomb, which at about 49 ft (15 metres) long and 15 ft (4.5 metres) wide is one of the biggest ever found in the country. The ministry confirmed fears that the tomb had been thoroughly and repeatedly plundered during antiquity. ‘Whatever objects of value the first thieves missed was taken by others later,’ Professor Tiverios said. Excavations at the site in north eastern Greece near the city of Thessaloniki began in 2012. They captured global attention in August when archaeologists announced the discovery of vast tomb guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497-metre marble wall. Since then the tomb has also yielded a mosaic made of coloured pebbles depicting the abduction of Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, as well as two sculpted female figures also known as Caryatids. The tomb dates to 300-325 BC. Alexander the Great died in 323 BC after a military campaign through the Middle East, Asia and northeast Asia. Surviving fragments of carved bone and glass coffin ornaments were found in the tomb at Amphipolis, but no helmet, shield or military objects which would be expected in the tomb of a Macedonian soldier were recovered making the skeleton's identity largely guess work at this stage . A large, damaged mosaic floor of the ancient Greek god of the underworld, Pluto, abducting the goddess Persephone on a horse-drawn chariot as the god Hermes looks on, was found in the tomb .","Experts have opened the second phase of their excavation of the vast 4th-century BC tomb in Amphipolis, northern Greece .
They hope it holds members of the ancient Macedonian royal family .
The skeleton discovered in the tomb is still undergoing DNA analysis .
Reports suggest the tomb was built for a Macedonian general, but its thought the skeleton may be Alexander the Great himself .
Archaeologists will scan two hectares (five acres) of the vast mound to look for clues about what may lie beneath - hopefully more chambers ."
"Jailed pedophile Rolf Harris has abandoned his push to appeal 12 convictions for sexually assaulting four girls in the United Kingdom. Harris's initial application was refused by a single Court of Appeal judge in late October and the disgraced entertainer is now out of time to ask the court to revisit the issue. Harris was sentenced in July to five years and nine months' jail for indecently assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986, however he's expected to serve less than three years behind bars. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A mugshot of Rolf Harris, released by Metropolitan Police after he was convicted of assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986 . Harris has abandoned his push to appeal 12 convictions for sexually assaulting four girls in the United Kingdom, after failing to ask for a hearing before three Appeal Court judges . A Judicial Office spokesman on Monday confirmed  that Harris hadn't renewed his application to appeal 'and he is now out of time'. The 84-year-old Australian had 28 days to ask for a hearing before three Appeal Court judges but chose not to. Among his victims was an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two teenage girls and a friend of his daughter whom he abused for over 16 years. Jurors were told that the ongoing sexual abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams. During the trial, Harris was described as an ‘octopus’ because of his reputation for wandering hands and his systematic abuse of young girls than spanned over a quarter of a century. After he was exposed, Harris was stripped of his BAFTA fellowship and a number of other honours. The formerly celebrated performer now faces losing his CBE, a prestigious award  he received from the Queen in 2006. During the trial, Harris was described as an ‘octopus’ because of his reputation for wandering hands and his systematic abuse of young girls than spanned over a quarter of a century . In October it was reported Harris could face fresh charges as a result of more than 10 new victims claiming they were abused by the disgraced entertainer . During his lengthy trial another six women gave supporting evidence that Harris abused them in Australia, New Zealand and Malta between 1969 and 1991. Harris wasn't charged over those alleged incidents because they occurred outside the UK. In mid-October a British newspaper reported Harris could face fresh charges as a result of more than 10 new victims claiming they were abused by the disgraced artist and singer. It was claimed Operation Yewtree officers were looking at the British cases while any assaults that took place in Australia or New Zealand would be handled by local police. The Metropolitan police have refused to comment on the possibility of further charges being laid. It was also reported in mid-October that Harris had to be moved to a new prison for his own safety after being bullied by inmates. The convicted sex offender was moved from HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire to Stafford jail after being taunted by fellow prisoners.","Harris's initial application was refused by an appeal judge in October .

"Boasting twinkling Santas, flashing Christmas trees and a whole herd of illuminated reindeer, this dazzling cul-de-sac could be Britain's most festive street. Six families in Trinity Close, in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, have strung up more than 100,000 fairy lights across their roofs, lawns and garden fences. The spectacular display attracts thousands of visitors every year, and the donations they make help the residents raise thousands of pounds for local cancer hospices. Scroll down for video . Dazzling: A collection of shooting stars, Christmas trees and Santas cover the homes of Trinity Close in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset . Spectacular: Six festive homes on the street have draped more than 100,000 fairy lights across their roofs, garages and garden fences . Twinkling: The impressive displays attract thousands of visitors each year and raise thousands of pounds for local cancer hospices . Tasteful: The tradition was started 12 years ago by two couples on the street - since then, other families on the street have joined in . Nick Gardner, 46, and his wife Hazel, 45, started the tradition 12 years ago with neighbours Chris Woodberry, 68, and his late wife Christine, who died in 2010 aged 61. The trust that the money is donated to was set up in her name. Mrs Gardner said: 'We've moved the lights around a little bit this year and we've got a couple of new ones. I've noticed quite a few people have put a few more new lights out this year. Everyone's getting involved, as usual. 'Luckily, once again we haven't come across any problems, everyone seems keen to get involved and join in. We've even got new neighbours this year who decided to buy decorations and keep up the tradition, which is fantastic.' Since the tradition started, the other households in the street have joined in the festive fun and added more and more lights - mostly in white and blue. Paula Payne, 67, who lives next door to Mr and Mrs Gardner, has been taking part in the decorations since moving in with husband Graham, 73, nine years ago. She said: 'We take part every year and this year is no different. We even brought a couple of new lights for this display.

Playful: A herd of twinkling reindeer graze on the lawn in front of one house - as a life-size Santa waves to visitors from his illuminated sleigh . Impressive: Visitors admire the beautiful displays on two of the homes on the street. They are asked to make a charitable donation . 'We have got reindeer and twinkling lights, it's all very tasteful. We've been here nine years and gradually built up our collection. We don't spend lots of money. 'It's lovely really, when I was a child neighbours knew neighbours and neighbours helped neighbours. With all the lights we have the same kind of attitude here, we all get to know each other. 'Lots of people like the lights, lots and lots of people come to see them. The switch on is always nice, we have a choir, mince pies and mulled wine. 'It's so nice that we can carry on with it every year, it's such a lovely community feel.' Close: One resident said that the lights foster a community feel and that they give neighbours an opportunity to get to know each other better . Celebration: The switching on of the lights is marked each year with a choir, mince pies and mulled wine, one resident said . Tribute: Donations made by visitors go to Petals, a charitable trust set up in memory of resident Christine Woodbury, who died in 2010 . Visitors are asked to make a donation in a number of collection boxes around Trinity Close. Last year the display raised £8,250. It has raised more than £50,000 since the neighbours started collecting for charity eight years ago. Donations go to Petals, a charitable trust set up in memory of Christine Woodbury, to benefit local cancer hospices and BARB, a registered charity that operates two life-saving rescue hovercraft and an inshore rescue boat in the Bridgwater Bay area.

A family have been given an enormous Christmas tree from Marks & Spencer - a year after their house was raided by burglars. The Penniston family in Maulden Bedfordshire, were surprised with the 25ft tall tree, which is decorated with more than 100 metres of fairy lights, after being nominated by friends and neighbours. It comes a year after Nicola, 35, and her husband Christopher, 38, returned home from a shopping trip to find that thieves had taken the presents they had bought for their children, Finlay, seven, and Jasmine, 12. Enormous: Nicola and Christopher Penniston with their children Finaly and Jasmine. The 25ft tree bursts through the roof of the family home . Surprise: The tree shoots up through the bedroom of seven-year-old Finlay, who was left terrified after the house was burgled last year . The thieves had also taken a number of sentimental items including photo albums, jewellery, and the children's first teeth. Mrs Penniston, an HR consultant, said: 'Last Christmas was a tough time for us - we just didn’t have a Christmas at all in the end. The most upsetting part was losing all the irreplaceable items.' But she said that this year the sight of her children's smiling faces had brought back the feeling of Christmas cheer. The tree is covered with a hundred decorations created by school children from around the UK and also contains details of kind deeds. The surprise, organised by Marks & Spencer, was part of their Two Fairies Christmas campaign. Christmas treat: The family lost presents, jewellery and photo albums when their home was raided by burglars in December last year . Touching: The tree is decorated with baubles and figures made by schoolchildren - and strung with more than 100 metres of fairy lights . A further 49 trees are set to be delivered to deserving families and organisations who are nominated by the public on Twitter using @thetwofairies account or £followthefairies. The two fairies, called Magic & Sparkle, top the incredible tree themselves where it emerges out the roof of the family’s two storey home. Finlay said: 'This is the most epic Christmas we’ve ever had. I couldn’t believe it when I saw the tree! 'I don’t know how the fairies did it. Last Christmas I was scared to even go in my bedroom, now it’s the best room ever!' Mrs Penninton added: 'It’s so nice of the two fairies, they’ve really made our Christmas. The kids are beside themselves with excitement.'","Residents in Burnham-on-Sea-Somerset have decorated their homes with twinkling Santas and shooting stars .

"Two women have given birth using wombs donated by their own mothers, bringing hope to the 15,000 British women who want children but were born without a womb or have had it removed. File picture . Two women have given birth using wombs donated by their own mothers. The pair become the first ever to have children using the very womb that brought them into the world a generation earlier. The breakthrough brings hope to the 15,000 British women who want children but were born without a womb or have had it removed. The two mothers are among nine women to have been given womb transplants – seven of which have succeeded. Allan Pacey of the British Fertility Society said: ‘That’s a very good success rate for a new surgical procedure. If it carries on like this, it may have a massive impact on things like surrogacy. ‘Women would much prefer to have their own baby and be pregnant than watch another woman be pregnant.’ The babies – both boys – were born a month ago in Sweden and are doing well with their mothers at home. Henrik Hagberg, a professor in foetal medicine at King’s College London, who was at the first birth, praised the grandmothers who had hysterectomies to donate wombs to their daughters. ‘It is an absolutely extraordinary gift. It is probably the best thing you can do for your daughter,’ he said. ‘The mothers were still very much doubting whether things would really go well. You don’t take anything for granted when you have experienced all of the problems they have been through.’ The first child, who weighed 5lb 8oz, was born to a 29-year-old Swede who lacked a womb at birth. The mother of the second boy, who weighed in at 5lb 15oz, is 34 and had her womb removed when she was treated for cancer in her 20s. Both babies were delivered by Caesarean section around a month early. They join another history-making boy, named Vincent. Born in September as part of the Gothenburg University project, he was the first in the world to be born from a womb transplant. Scroll down for video . Vincent, the first baby born to a woman who had a womb transplant, is cradled by his mother at an undisclosed location in Sweden, Monday, October 6, 2014 . He was carried in a womb from an unrelated donor. Four of the seven women with successful transplants have become pregnant and three have had babies. Richard Smith, head of the charity Womb Transplant UK, is gearing up to start similar operations here, using wombs from dead donors. He says the first could be carried out as soon as next summer. Professor Mats Brännström, who led the Swedish team, has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed for transplant . Professor Hagberg believes the operation in which the donor’s womb is removed can be reduced from the current ten hours – making the procedure more attractive. ‘I’m an optimist. I’m sure this is something for the future,’ he said. ‘It looks rather promising. It will be very exciting to see what happens in Britain and what they will be able to do using wombs from brain-dead donors.’ Professor Mats Brännström, who led the Swedish team, has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed for transplant. He believes Mr Smith’s project will be successful and predicts the first British womb transplant baby will be born three years from now. Dagan Wells, an Oxford University fertility doctor, said: ‘The numbers are still small and we probably don’t have a good handle on the true safety or how often it will be successful. ‘But from the data available, we can say that it is looking pretty good. That could raise the possibility of wider application – there are significant numbers of women in the population who would have perfect fertility if it was not for a problem with their womb.’ Dr Wells added: ‘It is a pretty radical thing to undergo but the fact that some women have done it, even when it is in this experimental phase, really does emphasise how important it is for some women to carry their own child. ‘I am not saying that this is the way that everyone should go but for some people, it clearly is very important.’ Professor Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create Fertility in central London, said: ‘There is no doubt that the birth of two more babies is encouraging and is further evidence that the project is successful. ‘It’s exciting, complex surgery being done by very skilled surgeons. It is promising for women who need womb transplants but quite clearly it is something that would happen in specialist centres. It is not something that is going to be widespread like IVF.’ The babies – both boys – were born a month ago in Sweden and are doing well with their mothers at home. Picture posed by model . Vincent – derived from the Latin for ‘to conquer’ – was given his name to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to give him life. A fourth woman with a transplanted womb is pregnant and said to be doing well. Although womb transplants have been done before, in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, no babies had been born until Vincent. The fact that Vincent has been joined by two more healthy boys offers hope to women who have been born without a womb, as well as those who have had a hysterectomy due to womb cancer or as a last-ditch attempt to stop a threatening bleed while in labour. Eventually, some women who have suffered the heartache of repeated miscarriages could also benefit. The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, allows women to experience the joy of pregnancy, as well as have babies that are genetically their own. The Swedish transplant team favour organs from living donors, such as mothers who have completed their families. An organ from a living donor should be in better condition and the woman can take care of her health before removal. But the British team believe the best option is an organ from a dead donor. This would allow them to take extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to ease the strain of pregnancy. Either way, ideally, the woman should have had children of her own – meaning her womb has been ‘road-tested’. The surgery is quite straightforward for a skilled team. The biggest worry is how well the organ copes with pregnancy. The mother is likely to be at risk of extra complications on top of miscarriage or premature labour.","Mothers carried their children in the wombs that brought them into world .

"The Dallas hospital that sent home Thomas Eric Duncan the first time he showed up at the emergency room has a machine that could have detected Ebola in less than an hour - but doctors were barred from using it because of federal regulations. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has treated three Ebola patients - Duncan, who died last week, and two of its own nurses who contracted the disease from Duncan. In each case, the hospital had to wait up to two days for confirmation that that patients were infected with the virus. The Associated Press has also reported the medical records reveal nurses didn't wear full protective gear while treating Duncan for two days while they awaited the results of his Ebola test. Scroll down for video . The Film Array can detect Ebola and other diseases in less than an hour using blood or saliva samples . Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital had one of the devices but was barred from using it for Ebola detection because of Food and Drug Administration rules . However, military news site Defense One reports that doctors could have simply turned on a toaster-sized device called the Film Array and gotten a diagnosis within minutes. US military doctors sent to West Africa to combat the disease are already using the Film Array, which has more than 90percent accuracy, according to Defense One. The device costs $39,000 - a pittance by the standards of medical devices in hospitals - and was developed by Utah-based BioFire Diagnostics to test the genetic markers of a slew of gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. It can use blood or saliva samples and it's proven adept at quickly detecting Ebola, as well. Presbyterian Hospital acquired one two years ago, though it has been prohibited from using the device to diagnose patients because the Food and Drug Administration had approved it only for research use - and not for testing Ebola. Thomas Eric Duncan was sent home from the hospital the first time he showed up with symptoms of Ebola. The Film Array could have detected the disease in minutes . The Film Array boasts easy, fast testing - but the FDA is not convinced it's effective enough to be used for diagnosis in hospitals . This, despite the fact that BioFire Diagnostics has received a $240million grant from the Defense Department's Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense to hone the device to detect Ebola and other deadly pathogens. The FDA has now approved the device for Ebola screening for research and has allowed hospitals to buy the necessary modifications to allowed their Film Array systems to detect the virus. Defense One also points out that the device could even be deployed at airports to screen travelers from West Africa. With results in less than an hour, the Film Array could provide accurate tests to keep patients sick with Ebola out of the US. Currently, some airports are using temperature screening to check if travelers have a fever. Health experts have warned that taking a simple fever reducer could allow infected travelers to slip through security.","The Film Array can screen for Ebola with 90percent accuracy .

"Pope Francis said last night that equating Islam with violence was wrong and called on Muslim leaders to issue a global condemnation of terrorism to help dispel the stereotype. He told reporters aboard his plane returning from a visit to Turkey that he understood why Muslims were offended by many in the West who automatically equated their religion with terrorism. Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, caused storms of protest throughout the Islamic world in 2006, when he made a speech that suggested to many Muslims that he believed Islam espoused violence. Scroll down for video . High-level press conference: The Pope told reporters aboard his plane yesterday that he understood why Muslims were offended by many in the West who automatically equated their religion with terrorism . Statement: Pope Francis told reporters aboard his plane last night that equating Islam with violence was wrong . Benedict said he had been misunderstood and apologised. But this year, the image of a violent religion has once more been promoted by Islamic State. The terrorist organisation has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq, slaughtering or driving out Shi'ite Muslims, Christians and others who do not share their radical brand of Sunni Islam. The Argentine pope has been trying to foster cooperation with moderate Islam in order to work for peace and protect Christians in the Middle East. Francis, the leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, insisted that it was wrong for anyone to react to terrorism by being ‘enraged’ against Islam.

Iraqi orphan: Pope Francis several times condemned Islamic State's insurgents during his three-day trip . He said: ‘You just can't say that, just as you can't say that all Christians are fundamentalists. We have our share of them (fundamentalists). ‘All religions have these little groups. They (Muslims) say: “No, we are not this, the Koran is a book of peace, it is a prophetic book of peace”.’ Francis said he had made the suggestion of a global condemnation of terrorism by Islamic leaders in talks on Friday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. ‘I told the president that it would be beautiful if all Islamic leaders, whether they are political, religious or academic leaders, would speak out clearly and condemn this because this would help the majority of Muslim people,’ he said.

Trip: The Pope visited Haghia Sofia, the Byzantine church-turned-mosque that is now a museum, on Saturday . On the plane, he said some Christians had been forced to abandon everything: ‘They are driving us out of the Middle East.’ In an address at a Mass yesterday, he said IS was committing a ‘profoundly grave sin against God’ and called for inter-religious dialogue and action against poverty to help end the conflicts in the region. He added that ending poverty was crucial, partly because it gave rise to ‘the recruitment of terrorists’. Francis has in the past said that, while it is lawful for the international community to use force to stop an ‘unjust aggressor’, lasting solutions must be found that tackle the root causes of violence.","Pope says he understands offence at Islam being equated with terrorism .

"The number of toy-related injuries has increased nearly 60 percent in the past two decades - in large part due to the growing popularity of foot-powered scooters. According to research by Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio, every three minutes in the U.S., a child is treated in an emergency department for an injury received playing with a toy. The data compiled from emergency room visit reports from 1990 to 2011 (the most recent year the data is available) showed more than 3.3 million children received urgent treatment for a toy-related accident. Hazard: The number of toy-related injuries increased nearly 60 percent in the past two decades - in large part due to the growing popularity of foot-powered scooters (stock photo) Columbus hospital’s Center for Injury Research and Policy said this was in part down to the trend for scooters, which began in 2000. The research shows that since they starting rising in popularity, a child has been treated in an emergency department every 11 minutes for an injury from a foot-powered scooter. Children aged 5-17 years, are most likely to suffer injuries from riding toys including foot-powered scooters, wagons, and tricycles. With their lightweight aluminium frame and tiny wheels — children place one foot on a board and use the other to propel themselves along — scooters can reach 25mph. The study says that injuries from riding toys are three times more likely to involve broken bones or dislocations than injuries from other toys. Growing dangers: According to research by Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio, every 3 minutes in the U.S., a child is treated in an emergency department for an injury received playing with a toy (stock photo) 'I've never seen anything like it in my career as a pediatric emergency room physician,' said Dr. Gary Smith, the study's lead author and director of the center, reports ABC. 'For the next two years the rate of scooter injuries spiked, dropped slightly until about 2005 and have been on the rise ever since,' Smith said, adding that skate board injuries have actually declined during the same time period. A survey compiled by a motor insurance company last year revealed that British death and serious injury rates for child pedestrians aged five and under were at their highest for ten years. Research by Waikato University in New Zealand also found a five-fold rise in the number of injuries to children using mini-scooters over the past five years. Mini-scooters weren’t originally designed for youngsters. The brainchild of Swiss inventor Wim Ouboter, they first became popular in 1998 among adult commuters in Tokyo. By 2000, the phenomenon had spread to Britain with celebrities such as Kylie Minogue owning one. In the study injuries varied by age - for younger children the main hazards are choking on small toys or small parts of larger toys is the biggest risk. Every day, 14 children are treated in a hospital for an injury they got from swallowing or inhaling a small toy or toy part.","Every 3 minutes in the U.S., a child is treated in an emergency department for an injury received playing with a toy .

"More than 20 Anglo Saxon skeletons have been unearthed on a proposed building site in Suffolk - and archaeologists believe they could have connections to members of the royal family. The remains were found in Exning, Suffolk alongside a host of jewellery, brooches, a glass bowl, weapons and beads, which experts believe points to them being wealthy and of high social status. The skeletons and objects date back to the time of King Anna of East Anglia at around 650AD. More than 20 Anglo Saxon skeletons have been unearthed on a proposed building site in Suffolk (pictured) - and archaeologists believe they could belong to members of the East Anglian royal family . Initial searches had missed the location of the burial ground, despite one of the bodies found buried just one foot (0.3 metres) below the ground. There was also a double burial, in which two bodies were found in the same grave, and what is known as a 'bed burial' involving an intricate wooden frame. A bed burial was typically reserved for women of high status during the 7th century and involved literally burying a person in the ground on a bed. As a result, they are extremely rare. The dig was carried out by Archaeological Solutions on behalf of Persimmon Homes, which is planning to build 120 homes on the site. Anna was the son of Prince Eni and nephew to King Redwald of East Anglia. During this time, King Penda of Mercia wanted to expand his borders into East Anglia, and in 635AD, pushed to take control of the Middle Anglia. During the battle, a number of members of Anna's family died, including his brother King Erica - who was also referred to as his cousin -  and Anna took the throne. He was a Christian, and is said to have had five daughters including Saethrith, Sexburga, Etheldreda, Withburga and Ethelburga. Few records of his reign survive, so it is not known exactly how many children he had, or how he related to fellow members of royalty in the region. In 645AD, reports claim he was exiled to King Penda or Mercia, and during that time converted to Christianity. King Anna died during another Mercian invasion in 654AD and was buried at Blythburgh. Andrew Peachey, from Archaeological Solutions, said the finds date back to around 650AD and were 'totally unexpected'. Mr Peachey, 34, said: 'One burial was very intricate with a wooden or iron frame possibly underneath the body. 'It may be what's known as a bed burial, but again it's too early to tell until everything is cleaned up properly. 'Another appears to be a warrior burial. A spearhead and dagger were found with the bones.' The remains were found in Burwell Road, Exning (pictured). The dig was carried out by Archaeological Solutions on behalf of Persimmon Homes, which is planning to build 120 homes on the site . Initial searches had missed the location of the burial ground, despite one of the bodies (pictured left) found buried just one foot (0.3 metres) below the ground. There was also a double burial, (pictured right) in which two bodies were found in the same grave, and a so-called 'bed burial' involving an intricate wooden frame . The remains were found alongside a host of jewellery, brooches, a glass bowl, weapons and a link and beads (pictured), which experts believe points to them being wealthy and of high social status . This glass bowl was discovered in the burial ground, and it is possibly from the Rhineland. Andrew Peachey, from Archaeological Solutions, said the finds date back to around 650AD and were 'totally unexpected' 'It is incredible that there was absolutely no disturbance caused to the graves, when you think ploughs must have just about been skimming across them.' Although the burial site is believed to date back the 7th century, some of the items may be even older, including a dagger that could have been made as early as 7AD. Most of the skeletons were found with so-called 'grave goods' including a glass bowl, brooches and other items of gold-plated and copper jewellery. The glass bowl is possibly from the Rhineland. Although the burial site is believed to date back the 7th century, some of the items may be even older, including a dagger that could have been made as early as 7AD. A spear found on the site is pictured . The team at Archaeological Solutions have now recovered the skeletons (pictured) and the items, and will be carrying out further tests to discover more about their identities. The 'excellent preservation' of both the skeletons and items meant the finds were of 'high analytical value' A total of 20 graves were found, containing 21 skeletons (an example pictured) with so-called 'grave goods' The quality of the items indicate the bodies may have had 'royal connections', and the area had close links with King Anna, who ruled East Anglia in the 7th Century.

"After sleeping with 10,091 men over 12 years in a drug and alcohol induced haze, former escort Gwyneth Montenegro is finally ready to settle down and experience true love for the first time. The 36-year-old  received an astounding 80 marriage proposals after the last time the Melbourne resident spoke to Daily Mail Australia in July about the launch of her book, 10,000 Men and Counting. The overwhelming response to the insight into her former seedy lifestyle got Gwyneth thinking that maybe she was ready to meet a good man - something she never felt comfortable doing when being paid $500 to $1000 an hour to have sex with well-known  lawyers, politicians and musicians. Scroll down for video . After sleeping with 10,091 men over 12 years in a drug and alcohol induced haze, former escort Gwyneth Montenegro is finally ready to settle down and find true love . She didnt think it was appropriate to enter into relationships while working as an escort . The male clients gave a good insight into what a man likes in a woman . 'It awoke something within me when the article was published - not that I'm in a rush to be married,' she said. 'There were some working in the industry who were dating people and married but for me personally I didn't find it appropriate.' 'I found it easier to avoid relationships during my time in the industry. The two just don't mix. I tried it once, it was an utter disaster.' Since leaving her old life behind three years ago, Ms Montenegro wears many hats as a commercial pilot, an NLP Master Practitioner and, of course, now an author. 'I was a little over men at that point in time of my life and found my businesses infinitely more stimulating,' she said. The 36-year-old received an astounding 80 marriage proposals after the last time the Melbourne resident spoke to Daily Mail Australia in July about the launch of her book, 10,000 Men and Counting . The overwhelming response to the insight into her former seedy lifestyle got Gwyneth thinking that maybe she was ready to meet a good man . But Gwyneth is now ready and raring to give the dating game a go. 'My parents didn't get married until their late 30s and they have been married for 33 years,' she said. Despite growing up in a contrast world being raised by devout Christians, her parents are her number one supporters. 'Mum joked that she thought I would have had enough of men by now,' she laughed. Ms Montenegro said the years of men paying her for sex gave her a good insight into what men want from a woman. 'Clients would confide in me about the good and bad parts of their relationship,' she said. 'I feel I have a deeper understanding of men than ever before.' Gwyneth describes herself as 'fairly introverted and conservative' Writing the book was a therapeutic experience that helped Gwyneth to discover her true self and become comfortable with it - as she describes herself as the 'girl next door'. 'I'm fairly introverted and conservative,' she said. 'I'm the last person my friends ever expected to have lived that kind of life.' Gwyneth fell into the escort world after she was gang-raped during a night-out at a club at just 18 years-old when her low self-esteem and lust for money led her to table top dancing before heading into sex work. After dabbling in the online dating game and deciding it wasn't for her, she believes that relationships should evolve organically. 'I believe in the energy I put out there I will get back,' she explains. Gwyneth has only ever been in two relationships before that lasted about a year. 'I’m contemplating it, I’d love to. I’ve never really experienced what you’d consider true love or what it’s like to be totally in love.' Gwyneth has slept with more than 10,000 men and has written a book about her time as an escort . Hollywood has come knocking keen to tell the story of Gwyneth's former life . She is now a woman who well and truly knows what she is looking for. 'I can be a handful, I am headstrong and determined. I like a man who is calmly confident, in charge, but not bombastically so,' she said. 'I’ve spent a lifetime looking after my body and I respect that in any potential partner. 'He certainly doesn’t have to be a model or a muscle bound fireman, I’d give preference to a fun personality any day.' Gwyneth's former life, which involved blowing tens of thousands of dollars on a new car, clothes and cocaine, has sparked interest from Hollywood with Gywneth in secret negotiations with a famous producer. 'I can't say at the moment but everyone would know who she is - it is most likely going to happen,' she said. 'It's quite a long process but we should know this month or the next.' She likes a man who is: 'calmly confident, in charge, but not bombastically so' She said she can be a 'handful' because she is headstrong and determined . Gwyneth finally achieved her dream of becoming a fully licensed commercial pilot at 29 years old .","Former elite escort Gwyneth Montenegro has slept with exactly 10,091 men .

"A mother who is documenting her three-year-old autistic son’s journey to forming a bond with his pet Labradoodle through a series of heart-warming photos says she’s already spotted things in common between the adorable pair. ‘They both like to chew things and confined spaces,’ Cassandra Merrigan, 29, told Daily Mail Australia. And little Alex thinks pet Ollie makes a great pillow: ‘Ollie has got that really lovely fleece and Alex likes how it feels. You will see Alex rubbing his feet all over Ollie.’ When the cheeky three-year-old was diagnosed with autism this year Cassandra said she was heartbroken but not surprised as she’d had concerns about his speech since he was a toddler. Scroll down for video . Three-year-old Alex was diagnosed with autism this year and his mother Cassandra decided to get a dog that could help him . 'Ollie may have wanted to watch the cats but Alex wanted to spoon,' Cass wrote on Facebook . A short while later, after the death of the South Sydney family’s husky cross dog, the  graphic designer started looking at pets that were suitable for autistic children. That’s when she came across 12-month-old black Labradoodle Ollie through Smartpups, an Australian charity that trains assistance dogs for special needs children. ‘They try their best to match the dog to the child, so they wouldn’t put a hyperactive dog to a hyper child like Alex,’ Cassandra told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Ollie is a pretty sedate dude as far as dogs go.’ The highly-trained Labradoodle was put into training for six months, housed with a foster family and sent to puppy bootcamp before he took on his very important role of helping Alex. This photo of Alex was taken on the day Ollie joined the Sydney family two months ago . Alex is slowly forming a bond with Ollie and recently climbed into his doggy basket for a cuddle . When the family are out and about, Ollie wears a harness that can be attached to Alex . Alex's mother is a graphic designer with a passion for art and Alex has followed in her footsteps with his love of drawing . Cassandra describes Alex as ‘action packed’ and said he needed to be matched with a dog who would suit him. ‘He’s never sitting still, he’s got a very cheeky sense of humour, he's a very strong non-verbal communicator even though he can’t talk, and he’s strong willed.’ As well as autism, Alex also has a sensory processing disorder and has been in speech therapy since an early age. ‘His brain doesn’t interpret sensory stimulation the same, he craves movements and deep pressure. He would run full pelt into a wall and not slow down just to get that sensory feedback, spinning in circles and hand flapping,’ Cassandra explained. Ollie has come as a relief to the family, because he’s an extra pair of eyes to watch over Alex and is even a trained tracker. ‘Ollie watches him wherever he goes, if Alex goes walkabout he can track him,’ the mother-of-two said. Cassandra described the Labrador and poodle cross as a bit of a 'primadonna' Alex, who has difficulty communicating verbally, enjoys a cuddle with Ollie while he plays on his iPad . Ollie went to puppy bootcamp to learn how to be a fully-trained autism assistance dog . Alex's mum Cassandra Merrigan said he likes walking with a harness with Ollie but also likes to hold her hand . The family were given four days with a trainer as part of the handover of Ollie: ‘They teach you how to handle him. 'As a certified assistance animal we have legal requirements to meet like making sure he is appropriate in public, not sniffing in supermarkets or trying to eat food in café’s and not going to toilet in public.’ Although the Labradoodle is still a puppy - with a weakness for tennis balls - Cassandra said he is ‘unbelievable’. ‘He toilets on command… but Ollie was the first Labradoodle that they trained. He’s quite different to a lab… he’s got a bit of primadonna complex… now his fur is growing back his character is showing.’ Alex giggles when he goes out for walks with his father and Ollie's tail tickles his arm .

Alex enjoys skateboarding while Ollie keeps a watchful eye over him at the skatepark . Cassandra, her husband Liam (right) and their two children live together in South Sydney . However, Ollie didn’t come cheap. The family had to raise a minimum of $15,000 of his $25,000 cost before they could bring him home and Cassandra received huge financial help from her sister and the local community. She even sold some of Alex’s ‘beautiful’ artwork to help raise the money. Alex and Ollie’s bond is slowly developing but Cassandra said she tries not to worry about the time it takes because Alex ‘didn’t even realise his sister was alive until she was 12 months old and walking’. ‘Emery is full of spunk and she just pins him down when she wants a hug,’ Cassandra laughed. Alex and Ollie’s bond is slowly developing but Cassandra said she tries not to worry about the time it takes . Ollie comes in handy as a fleecy warm foot rest while Alex sits in his basket . Although the Labradoodle is still a puppy - with a weakness for tennis balls - Cassandra said he is ‘unbelievable’ ‘Alex takes a long time to bond with things and for them to become part of his world. ‘He will pat and give a little cuddle but they haven’t had a huge chance yet… it can take to six/eight months. He’s developmentally around 18 months so he hasn’t got the language skills for me to explain “this is Ollie this is what he does”,’ she reasoned. One of Cassandra’s fondest moments since Ollie joined their family was when Alex curled up with him ‘and used him as a pillow’. ‘Alex initiated it and Ollie is still getting used to Alex because Alex is an incredibly random child but Ollie didn’t even flinch when he got in the doggy bed.’ Check out more photos of Alex and Ollie on their Facebook page Alex & Woof.

"Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Monday made a second bid to move his trial outside Massachusetts, arguing that 'emotionally charged' media coverage and the widespread impact of the attacks have made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in the state. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. rejected Tsarnaev's first request in September to move the trial, ruling that Tsarnaev's lawyers had failed to show that extensive pretrial media coverage of the bombings had prejudiced the jury pool to the point that an impartial jury could not be chosen in Boston. But Tsarnaev's lawyers are making another push to move the trial. In a court filing Monday, they argued that continuing pretrial publicity and media leaks have led to the 'inescapable conclusion' that 'great local prejudice' will prevent a fair trial by an impartial jury. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured, have said 'emotionally charged' media coverage and the widespread impact of the attacks have made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in Massachusetts . Deadly: Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon's finish line on April 15, 2013 . Tsarnaev's defense team focused on the broad impact of the bombings on marathon runners, spectators, victims and their friends and families, doctors and nurses who treated the injured, and children who were traumatized by the attacks. 'The nature and scope of victimization here, coupled with the pretrial publicity compel a change of venue,' Tsarnaev's lawyers wrote in their change of venue motion. The defense asked the judge to hold a hearing on their request and to determine where the trial should be held. Tsarnaev's lawyers previously said the trial should be moved to Washington, D.C. A spokeswoman for federal prosecutors declined to comment and said they will file a written response in court. Jury selection in Tsarnaev's trial is scheduled to begin January 5. He faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, planted and detonated two pressure-cooker bombs. Tamerlan died following a firefight with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar was captured later that day, wounded and hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston suburb.

Manhunt: Dzhokhar was eventually captured, wounded and hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston suburb . Tsarnaev's lawyers say pretrial coverage of the case has increased since they made their first request to move trial, in part because of coverage of the convictions of three of Tsarnaev's friends who were accused of removing evidence from his dorm room or lying to authorities investigating the bombing. Motions to move trials are rarely granted. But Tsarnaev's lawyers said the pretrial media coverage in the marathon bombing case is similar to the coverage in the case of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose trial was moved to Denver. 'Here, as in McVeigh, the strong emotional and community response evidenced in the pretrial publicity demonstrates that potential jurors from the Eastern Division of the District of Massachusetts can only be presumed to feel a personal stake in the outcome. As in McVeigh, a change of venue is required to provide Mr. Tsarnaev with a fair trial by an impartial jury,' Tsarnaev's lawyers wrote.","Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Monday made a second bid to move his trial outside Massachusetts .

"It's no wonder that Jimmy Kimmel told Shia LaBeouf that he 'seems to have gone crazy' when he interviewed him recently. The star was arrested for criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, and harassment at a Broadway production of Cabaret, after being photographed chasing a homeless man around Times Square and was filmed sitting in silence for an hour - bar a few giggles - with a British journalist. He also turned up to the premiere of his film Nymphomaniac wearing a paper bag over his head. Now the Hollywood star is claiming that a woman raped him on Valentine's Day.

'It was painful': Shia LaBeouf claims a woman raped him on Valentine's Day during his #IAMSORRY performance art installation at the Stephen Cohen Gallery in Los Angeles, California . For five days, the 28-year-old actor invited the public to visit him one-on-one in a small room in a Los Angeles gallery where he sat wearing a paper bag over his face that read: 'I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE' - the same one he wore to the film premiere. But three days in, a woman allegedly stripped and raped the former Disney Channel actor while their respective partners stood in line. LaBeouf did not explain whether he attempted to stop the alleged attack during his silent performance at the Stephen Cohen Gallery. He was reportedly unresponsive and silent during every one-to-one meeting. The Nymphomaniac actor opened up about the incident on Thursday during a bizarre interview with Dazed Digital, conducted over email before he and the reporter sat staring at each other in silence for an hour. 'One woman came with her boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened,' the Daytime Emmy winner wrote in his email interview. '[She] whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me. 'There were hundreds of people in line when she walked out with dishevelled hair and smudged lipstick. It was no good, not just for me but her man as well.' He explained Mia Goth, his girlfriend of two years, was among the 'hundreds' waiting for a one-on-one with him when the woman left his room.

'We were separated for five days, no communication. 'So it really hurt her as well, as I guess the news of it travelled through the line. 'When she came in she asked for an explanation, and I couldn’t speak, so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently. It was painful.' LaBeouf also vented his frustration at gallery patrons who would 'come in, take my [paper] bag off, pop off a selfie, and bounce.' 'Some would hold my hand and cry with me, some would tell me to ""figure it out"" or to ""be a man."" I’ve never experienced love like that; empathy, humanity.'

"Almost 60,000 Londoners aged between 30 and 39 abandoned the capital to move elsewhere in England according to new figures released by the Office for National Statistics. Between June 2012, and June 2013, 58,220 people in their 30s left the capital, with almost one in ten of them moving to Birmingham. A further 3,290 went to Bristol, slightly ahead of the 3,260 who headed north to Manchester. Nottingham, Oxford, Liverpool and Newcastle were also popular destinations for Londoners leaving the capital. Almost 60,000 people in their 30s have left London over a 12 month period according to new statistics . One in ten of those migrants has moved to Birmingham, pictured,  where houses cost on average £133,000 . Many of those leaving the capital are moving north where they can avail of far cheaper housing . According to economic experts, the flight of well educated professionals from London to provincial centres could help the country's unbalanced economy. Ed Cox, director of the IPPR North think-tank told the Observer: 'Young people may be initially attracted by jobs in the capital, but then they recognise that if they want to move on and get on to the housing ladder, there are opportunities in other cities. We are starting to see the benefits of the recovery, particularly for higher-skilled jobs that are being created in cities outside London.' Neil Rami of Marketing Birmingham told the Independent the city has worked incredibly hard to rebrand its image and rebuild its infrastructure. He said: 'We are tearing down the concrete of the 1960s, transforming the city centre, and drastically improving our infrastructure. Birmingham’s quality of life is also helping to attract people here, particularly those with families. It has one of the youngest and most diverse populations in Europe – and the city’s unique blend of music, cuisine and arts makes Birmingham a great place to live.' The ONS based their migration figures by extrapolating data held on NHS databases of people registering with new GPs. More than 3,200 Londoners moved to Manchester, pictured, between June 2012 and June 2013 . The average price of a house in London is currently £400,000, compared with just £133,000 in Birmingham. Interpreting the data, the ONS claimed that married couples in their 30s are being forced out of the capital by the high price of family homes. The figures suggest that some couples are leaving before they start a family or while their children as still young. According to the ONS briefing document: 'They may be seeking somewhere greener and quieter, and may also perceive that a less urban neighbourhood offers a better social and educational environment for children.' The figures also suggest there has been a net outflow of children from the capital. The ONS suggested that a spike in the number of 19-year-olds leaving London is probably due to students going to university.","Couples in their 30s are fleeing London to get on the property ladder .

"An Indiana Jones-style expedition has been launched in Germany to recover £500million worth of missing artworks looted by the Nazis in World War Two. Monets, Manets, Cezannes and masterpieces by other artists, along with sculptures, carpets and tapestries, are believed to be buried in an old silver mine near the Czech-German border, 90 minutes' drive from the city of Dresden. The paintings formed the bulk of the Hatvany collection, the property of Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who was a leading Hungarian-Jewish industrialist and art patron. Mother lode: If the looted artworks are found in a mine, it will not be the first such discovery. In this picture from 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, centre, inspects paintings uncovered in a salt mine at Merkers, Germany . Some of his pictures are still hanging on museum walls to this day, their ownership disputed by his heirs. They were carted off from Budapest bank vaults by Red Army soldiers when the city fell to the Soviets in 1945. But most of the Hatvany Collection, between 250 and 500 pieces, was looted on the orders of Holocaust organiser Adolf Eichmann, who was in Hungary in 1944 and instituted a policy of arresting Jews and then releasing them in exchange for property. Pillage: Nazi SS Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann, who ordered the looting of the Hatvany collection . He also shipped 400,000 of them to Auschwitz, where they were gassed almost upon arrival. Viennese historian Burkhart List, 62, says he has acquired documents from old Wehrmacht archives that report a mass shipment of the Hatvany collection to two subterranean galleries, measuring 6,000 by 4,500 feet, in the Erzgebirge Mountains. With the permission of the mayor of nearby Deutschkatherinenberg, Hans-Peter Haustein, he deployed a neutron generator inside the mountain to probe for the secret chambers. The device revealed that, 180 feet down, there are workings detailed on no maps and they appear to be man-made, not natural. Mr List said: 'In the winter of 1944 - 1945 the records indicate that a mysterious transport arrived here from Budapest that was coded top secret. 'One of the photos yielded up by the archives was of the Sonnenhaus, a large building directly in front of the Fortuna mine where I believe the art is stored. 'It shows a large contingent of SS. There was no military or logical state purpose for them to be here on a secret mission, unless it was to deliver the artwork into chambers which, climactically, are ideal for the storage of art.' So far the explorations have yielded only a Schmeisser machine gun, a Nazi gas mask, plastic explosive detonators and a safe deposit key. French master: Cezanne's La Chaine De E'toile Avec Le Pilon Du Roi, which is displayed in Glasgow and may have been looted by Nazis. More Cezannes are among the masterpieces thought to lie hidden in the mine . Mayor Haustein, who is also an MP for the FDP liberal party in Berlin, said: 'The question is not what we find here, but when we find it. 'I have seen the evidence and I have heard the testimony of eyewitnesses over the years about the presence of the SS in the village. This stuff is here.' The Sonnenhaus is already drawing visitors ahead of a planned May descent into the mountain that will attempt to open up the secret chambers accessed so far only by radar.","Search is underway for two underground galleries believed to be hidden under Germany's Erzgebirge mountains .

"This Christmas pudding weighs as much as an adult, contains more than 200,000 calories, measures two-feet wide and could feed a family of four for a month. The recipe includes four loaves of bread, 40 eggs, 6kgs each of sultanas, raisins, currants and soft brown sugar, 2kgs of mixed peel, 20 lemons, 40 apples and 2kgs of chopped nuts. But it's all for a good cause as portions of the giant cake are being sold off to raise money for charities. Scroll down for video . The monster Christmas pudding contains 200,000 calories, measures two-feet wide and weighs eight stone . Head chef Jon Fell of Sella Park Hotel, Calderbridge, Lake District is the mastermind behind the gigantic creation. The festive favourite took more than 24 hours to cook and contains 40 eggs and four loaves of bread . Head chef Jon Fell of Sella Park Hotel, Calderbridge, Lake District, is the mastermind behind the heavy Christmas pudding. The festive favourite took more than 24 hours to cook and was so big that that the kitchen team had to have fire extinguishers on hand when they lit it. The sweet treat is approximately 450 times bigger than a regular-sized portion and a family of four, consuming 8,000 calories between them in day, could survive off this treat for a month. The 42-year-old said: 'A Single portion Christmas pudding  is about 100 grams and has about 450 calories. This Christmas pudding weighs 45kg and has about 202,000 calories to it. 'It is the ultimate Christmas pudding but probably a heart attack waiting to happen! The sweet treat is approximately 450 times bigger than a regular-sized portion. Two 70cl bottle of brandy - one for setting alight- and two bottles of rum were added to give the pudding its distinctive taste . 'It is ridiculously calorific. If you think about it it's all fat and sugar.' To give the pudding its distinctive taste, Mr Fell added two 70cl bottle of brandy - one for setting alight - and two bottles of rum. He said: 'We normally put about a teaspoon of the rum and brandy in a single sized portion. If we had had more time we would have kept it in the fridge for two or three weeks, leaving it to mature and we would have kept adding the brandy and rum.' He added: 'It is certainly one the largest Christmas puddings I have ever seen - and probably one of the most alcoholic you could have this Christmas. It is big but it will also taste great.' A regular Christmas pudding takes around an hour to steam; this 45kg pudding took 24 hours of steaming . 4 loaves of bread . 40 eggs, . 6kg sultanas, . 6kg raisins . 6kg currants . 6kg soft brown sugar . 2kg mixed peel, . 20 lemons . 40 apples . 2kg chopped nuts . 2 bottles of rum . 2 bottles of brandy . The pudding was so heavy that the chef had to enlist three helpers to carry it from machine to machine at the hotel in Calderbridge. He said: 'It was difficult finding the right equipment to cook something so big and so heavy. The mixing of it was done by hand in two 40 litre containers because we couldn't fit the mixture anywhere else.' Mr Fell combined all the ingredients, mixing them by hand, in two separate batches before steaming it in their steamer. He said: 'We had an oven and steamer big enough but we had to use a big stock pot for it to stand in.' A regular Christmas pudding takes around an hour to steam - this 45kg pudding took 24 hours of steaming. Jon said: 'It was a bit of a guessing game but we knew just by working out everything that had been put into it that it was going to need that long.' Once the pudding was cooked Mr Fell, with the help of his three sous chefs, took the heavy treat to the hotel's restaurant where they poured a litre bottle of brandy on it before setting it alight with a blow torch. Jon said: 'We had to be careful because of health and safety. With a pudding that big with that much alcohol in it something could possibly have gone wrong.' All for a good cause: Portions of the Christmas pudding will be sold to raise funds for local charities . However the experienced chef took no chances and had a fire extinguisher and fire blanket at the ready if his giant pudding got a just a little bit too flammable. He added: 'I was a bit nervous when I started to light it but thankfully everything went to plan and the smoke alarms didn't even go off.' No stranger to creating giant culinary masterpieces, Mr Fell attempted to beat the Guinness World Record earlier this year for the largest scotch egg - weighing in at 11kg. This time around the chef is doing it to create a little festive cheer this Christmas. He said: 'I think it is all just a bit of fun but we knew it was possible. It is about seeing if you can cook something that big but the main thing is what you do with it after. 'It would have been easy for us to have thrown anything into but we wanted it to taste great and we cooked it really for some local charities. 'We are going to let the charities sell portions off for Christmas with the proceeds going back to them. 'Christmas can be a really difficult time for some people so if we can raise a bit of cash for someone then it is all worth it - but let's hope no one gets too tipsy.'","Creation of chef Jon Fell of Sella Park Hotel, Calderbridge, Lake District .

"A flesh-eating plant that grew in Russia about 40 million years ago has been discovered by scientists. Its fossilised leaves, preserved in Baltic amber, are strewn with multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs. The new species was dug out of a mine near Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and is believed to be related to the 'flypaper trap' plant Roridula, found in the southwestern Cape of South Africa. A flesh-eating plant that grew in Russia 40 million years ago has been discovered by scientists. Its fossilised leaves, preserved in Baltic amber, are strewn with multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs . Roridula catches small prey - largely insects - with its leaves that are covered in an extremely sticky glue produced by the glands or tentacles. Like Roridula, the Russian plant's leaves show evidence of different sized tentacles with which it would have captured prey and smothered it in slime before releasing digestive enzymes. The tentacles, as well as the glands on the leaf surface, absorb the nutrients from the prey. Describing the discovery in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers believe the fossils, dating back to 35 to 47 million years ago during the Eocene. They could represent early members of Roridula's family called Roridulaceae. Pictured in A and B are the carnivorous leaf found preserved in Eocene Baltic amber. They look remarkabley similar to the leaves found in modern-day Roridula gorgonias (C and D) The tentacles, as well as the glands on the leaf surface, absorb the nutrients from the prey. Pictured is a close up view of the tentacles in amber. Scientists say this represent early members of Roridula's family called Roridulaceae. Dr Eva-Maria Sadowski, of Gottingen University in Germany, said it is believed to be the first case of carnivorous plant traps being fossilised. 'Amber - fossil tree resin - preserves organisms in microscopic fidelity and frequently fossils preserved in amber are otherwise absent in the entire fossil record,' she said. 'Plant remains however are rarely entrapped in amber, compared with the vast amount of insects and other animals. 'Our newly discovered fossils from Eocene Baltic amber are the only documented case of fossilized carnivorous plant traps and represent the first fossil evidence of the carnivorous plant family Roridulaceae, which is today a narrow endemic of South Africa.' Scientists successfully revived moss that has lay frozen under Antarctic ice for more than 1,500 years . Earlier this year, scientists successfully revived moss that has lay frozen under Antarctic ice for more than 1,500 years. The discovery shows, for the first time, that plant life has the ability to survive millennium spanning ice ages. Moss has previously been known to weather extreme conditions for up to 20 years and is an important player in the eco-systems of both the North and South Poles. The research was jointly carried out by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the University of Reading and involved sliced moss cores being taken from Antarctic permafrost and sprayed with distilled water by being kept in carefully monitored temperature and light conditions. After only a few weeks, the moss started to grow and carbon dating revealed that the plants were at least 1,530 years old. The results suggest the Roridulaceae's ancestors were spread more widely than thought. It also challenges previous ideas that the plant originated about 90 million years ago on the southern supercontinent Gondwana before Earth's landmass split into the pieces we see today. Dr Sadowski said living Roridula plants are very effective traps for all kinds of insects due to the sticky resinous trapping glue and the hierarchical organisation of the tentacles into functional units for effective prey capture. Like Roridula (pictured), the Russian plant's leaves show evidence of different sized tentacles with which it would have captured prey and smothered it in slime before releasing digestive enzymes . 'The longest tentacles make the first contact with the prey. Due to the high flexibility of these prominent tentacles the moving prey then gets stuck to the medium-sized tentacles which slow down the caught animal,' she said. 'Finally the smallest and stiffest tentacles immobilise the prey. As in modern Roridulaceae the leaf fossils have different size classes of tentacles that fulfil the functional roles for prey capture - entanglement, slow-down and immobilization - and comply with the requirements for a carnivorous nature. 'In addition the pore of the tentacle heads distinguishes the fossils from any other extant carnivorous plants with glandular adhesive traps such as sundews.' The new species was dug out of a mine near Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and is believed to be related to the 'flypaper trap' plant Roridula, found in the southwestern Cape of South Africa .","New species was dug out of a mine near Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea .

"Police in St Louis have made a third arrest in connection to Sunday's deadly hammer attack on a Bosnian immigrant, charging a 17-year-old as an adult in the slaying. The arrests of the youths - among them two black teens and one Hispanic - in the death of 32-year-old Zemir Begic came as city officials struggled to tamp down speculations that the killing of the Bosnian man may have been motivated by race or somehow related to the ongoing unrest in Ferguson. 'There is no evidence that this was a crime occasioned by the race or ethnicity of the victim,' St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said in a statement Monday. Scroll down for video . Killing: Police said that Zemir Begic was driving in Bevo Mill early Sunday morning when a group of juveniles surrounded his car and began banging on it, beating him when he stepped out . Targeted: Teens clashed with Begic after attacking his car, pictured. They then turned on him beating him to death . 'Speculation that this attack had anything to do with the Ferguson protests is absolutely unfounded. 'I don’t know what happened to them or to their families to lead these young people to commit such a horrific crime. It’s disturbing. We do not know their past. Their futures, though, will be as grim as the judicial system can make it,' the mayor said in the statement cited by the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Mayor Slay reiterated his position on the matter in a tweet sent out Monday afternoon, calling the killing an act of 'random and senseless violence.' Zemir Begic, 32, a South City resident of Bosnian descent, was driving home with his newlywed wife at around 1.15am when police say a group of teenagers approached his car and began vandalizing it. Begic emerged from his vehicle to try and stop them, at which point the teenagers allegedly attacked him with hammers, striking him in the head, face and abdomen. The motorist was taken to an area hospital, where he died from his injuries a short time later. His wife escaped unharmed after her husband reportedly shielded her from the attackers with his body. Suspect Robert Mitchell, 17, turned himself in Sunday night after two of his alleged accomplices, ages 15 and 16, were arrested by police, reported St Louis Post-Dispatch. The 17-year-old is being charged as an adult with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Detectives say they know the identity of the fourth suspect in the killing, but as of Monday evening that person has not been taken into custody. A motive in the killing has not been released, but Police Chief Sam Dotson said there's no indication Begic was targeted by the hammer-wielding youths because he was Bosnian. Police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said they believe Begic was simply in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Zemir Begic  was heading home from a bar at 1.15am in St Louis when a group of teenagers surrounded his car and began banging on it. His wife of six months Arijana Mujkanovic (pictured) said: 'The last thing he did before he actually died was pull me out of the way and put himself in front of me, basically giving up his life for me' An angry crowd protest Begi's death as they insist he was killed because he was from Bosnia . The police have said they do not think the attack was racially motivated - but the crowd on Sunday disagreed . Anger: Members of the Bosnian community marched in anger at the killing on Sunday. Police have reassured residents the attack wasn't a hate crime but it has done little to appease outrage . The attack was not related to Ferguson protests taking place in the city, police say . The 32-year-old stepped out of the vehicle, only to be yelled at and set upon with hammers, striking him in the head, abdomen and face and leaving him fatally injured. He was unconscious when police arrived  - he was taken to St Louis University Hospital, where he later died. His wife of six months, Arijana Mujkanovic, said: 'The last thing he did before he actually died was pull me out of the way and put himself in front of me, basically giving up his life for me.' 'That is out of anger because he doesn't deserve this and most of these people don't even know him,' she told KSDK. Suad Nuranjkovic, 49, said Begic was driving and he was in the passenger seat when a group of at least five teens started banging on the car. 'I was afraid that if one of them had a gun, they were going to shoot me, so I didn't know what to do,' Nuranjkovic said. He fled to a parking lot across the street. 'The picture is in my head, what I saw,' he said. 'I don't know why this is happening to Bosnians. We could go around and shoot people, too, but we just want peace.' A tribute to Begic put on a wall near where he was murdered at the weekend . He was taken to St Louis University Hospital, where he later died from his horrific injuries . Two males, ages 15 and 16, were taken into custody, followed by 17-year-old Robert Mitchell, who surrendered to homicide detectives overnight. A fourth suspect remains at large. The suspects are described as being a group of Hispanic and black males by the St Louis Post-Dispatch. The attack was not related to Ferguson protests taking place in the city, police say. On Sunday evening, members of the Bosnian community protested  Bejic's death in Bevo Hill, and raised the possibility that Begic, who came to the US  in 1996, had been killed because of he was Bosnian. Senseless: The attack was not related to Ferguson protests taking place in the city, police say . Crime lab officers cordon off the area where Begic was killed . 'There is no indication that the gentleman last night was targeted because he was Bosnian,'said Police Chief Sam Dotson . Police are now stepping up foot patrols in the area following Sunday night's attack . Tributes laid at the scene of Begic's death - investigators are still searching for a motive . The protesters, who numbered about 50, said another member of their community was murdered in 2013, when an armed robber killed Haris Gogic, 19, in his family's store. 'There is no indication that the gentleman last night was targeted because he was Bosnian,' Police Chief Sam Dotson told the crowd. 'There's no indication that they knew each other.' Seldin Dzananoic, 24, said he was accosted by a group of teens with hammers on the same street about an hour before Begic was attacked, but was able to fight them off with only minor injuries. 'I'm just lucky,' he said. 'God is on my side.' Fleeing violence: Begic's sister said the family immigrated to the United States while fleeing violence in Bosnia and never imagined Begic would be murdered in the US . The suspects are described as being a group of Hispanic and black males by the St Louis Post-Dispatch . Pictured: Begic with friends in a photo posted on Facebook . The family emigrated from Bosnia to the United States in 1996 and eventually settled in Waterloo, Iowa, said Begic's sister from her home in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Pictured: Begic with friends in a photo posted on Facebook . Dotson said foot patrols would be stepped up in the area as well. According to his Facebook profile, Begic worked for a removals company. A GoFundMe page that had raised just shy of $5,000 will help cover the costs of Begic's funeral, which is set to be held in Iowa, Begic's sister Denisa said. The family emigrated from Bosnia to the United States in 1996 and settled in Utica, New York, before moving to Waterloo, Iowa, said Begic's sister from her home in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 'He loved America,' she said. 'We come from Bosnia because we were getting killed and our homes and families were getting destroyed. Never in my life did I think he would get murdered.' Begic had lived in Arizona as well before moving to St Louis, and had married his wife only months before his murder. With a population estimated to be around 70,000, St Louis has the largest community of Bosnians outside of Bosnia-Herzegovina.","Zemir Begic, 32, was surrounded by a group of teens wielding hammers .

"Have you ever wondered where Russians would go if we dropped nuclear bombs on them? Thanks to eye-opening pictures provided by Moscow construction worker Mikhail Bratza, we in the West can now see the grim 650-feet underground welcome that 2,700 Russian citizens would receive if nuclear war became reality.

Meanwhile, a gigantic, secret bunker that Albania's communist regime built underground decades ago to survive a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union or the United States has been opened to the public for the first time. On Saturday, Prime Minister Edi Rama led visitors, including Western ambassadors, on a tour of the never used 106-room, five-story bunker. 'We have opened today a thesaurus of the collective memory that presents thousands of pieces of the sad events and life' under communism,' Rama said, speaking at the bunker's 200-seat hall, which was to serve as the meeting place for parliament.

The bunker was built by the late communist dictator Enver Hoxha near Tirana, the capital, in the 1970s to prepare for a possible nuclear attack by 'American imperialism or Soviet social-imperialism.' Hoxha, whose regime built up to 700,000 bunkers of different sizes and tunnels all around the country, died in 1985. The communist regime was toppled in 1990. Rama said the bunker was opened ahead of Albania's World War II liberation day this month. The government plans to use it as a tourist attraction and an exhibition space for artists. On display before the bunker, which has been preserved by the military, stood a Soviet-produced Zim-12 luxury car, a gift to Hoxha from Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. The bunker, 100-meters (330 feet) underground, houses a museum with pictures and items from World War II and the communist regime. The heavy cement and metal doors are so low that visitors have to bow down to pass through them. In the small, cold and smelly rooms one can see military equipment used by the communist regime, mainly received from the Soviet Union and China. Work on the bunker was completed in 1978, when Tirana broke ties with China. Albania had done that with the Soviets in 1962.

"Buckingham Palace has defended a photo which appeared to show Prince Edward aiming a shotgun over the head of his six-year-old son. In the image James, Viscount Severn, appears to be standing a few feet away and in front of his father as he takes aim at a pheasant on the Sandringham Estate. However the Palace said that the perspective of the photograph makes it look like Viscount Severn was standing almost directly in front of his father as he aimed his gun, when he was actually to his side and perfectly safe. Scroll down for video . Buckingham Palace said a photo which appeared to show Prince Edward aiming a shotgun directly over his son's head was misleading and the six-year-old was actually to the side of his father and perfectly safe . The picture led to criticism being levelled at the Earl of Wessex this weekend as experts warned of the dangers of having children standing in front of someone shooting. Best practice dictates young people on a shooting expedition should stand behind those taking aim. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said they always kept to strict safety standards on the estate and that the Prince would never have put his young son in a dangerous position. He said: 'In the image shown the perspective is very misleading. 'At no time during the shoot was Viscount Severn directly in front of The Earl of Wessex. As always during any sporting event on the Estate the highest safety standards were adhered to. 'Any suggestion that The Earl would risk his son's welfare in any way is simply untrue.' The photo was taken while Edward, the Earl of Wessex, was aiming at a pheasant during a shoot on the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk on Saturday morning. The Earl and his son are seen looking into the distance before he raises the shotgun. Prince Edward was with his son at the Queen's Sandringham Estate on Saturday for the shooting expedition . A witness said he swung his gun from left to right as the bird rose from a maize field. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation supported the view of the palace and said the photo had made it appear like Viscount Severn was standing directly in front of the gun, when in fact he was more likely to have been to his side. They also pointed to the safety precautions taken by the Earl of Wessex in giving his son ear defenders to wear and said they did not believe the 50-year-old would have taken an unsafe shot. Mike Yardley, a leading shooting instructor, said children should never be in front of someone shooting. He said sometimes a dog would be in front, but not a person. He said: ‘You should never have children in front of you because the problem with children is they run around. It’s not something I would allow.'","Prince Edward was pictured apparently aiming shotgun over son's head .

"AC/DC's Malcolm Young had to rehearse songs he had played for 30 years everyday before doing a show, just so he could remember them.

Despite retiring in September due to his dementia, Malcolm Young wanted the band to continue 'making music' Malcolm Young (pictured left) wanted his band members to 'keep making music' after he left the band in September due to dealing with illness dementia . 'Malcolm was always very organised and it was very strange for the first time I had seen him disorganised, being confused about a lot of things so that's when it hit me that something was not right,' said Angus. While Angus spoke to Malcolm, telling him he didn't need to continue if he didn't feel up to it, Malcolm was determined to carry on. It was in September Malcolm finally retired from the band when he couldn't remember the songs anymore. 'Mal kept up right up until he couldn't do it no more,' Angus told the 7:30 report. 'It was a strange feeling because your work mate, you worked with for the last, for me 35 years wasn't there anymore,' said lead singer Brian Johnson.

The decision had to be made as to whether the band should keep going and Johnson claims it was really a decision for Angus, who was one part of a sibling team who created 'these riffs that nobody else made'. 'We always collaborated and bounced off each other,' said Angus. The pair masterminded the massive hit 'Highway to Hell' which Angus says sprung on him one day, the name of the song coming after a cigarette and a trip to the toilet. It was essentially Malcolm who decided the band's fate and insisted the band 'keep making music' but they were able to keep it in the family when they hired Stevie Young, the pair's nephew, to replace him.

"From the puritanical Victorian standards of beauty in 1910, to the eclectic styles of today, a fascinating new time-lapse video documents how hairstyles have changed over the past century. The video, masterminded by the team at Cut Video, shows how beauty has evolved over 100 years in just one minute. Beginning in 1910, the model showcases the elegant yet conservative curls seen on the Crawley women in Downton Abbey. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Beginning in 1910 and finishing in 2010, a new video shows how hairstyles have evolved . The film swiftly moves through to 1920, also known as the Roaring Twenties, and depicts the popular bobbed haircut - a symbol of women's increasing freedom. The look was inspired by glamorous film stars such as  Louise Brooks, and make-up was worn heavy. Next up is the 1930s and 1940s - eras that took cues from Hollywood starlets such as Bette Davis and Rita Hayworth. Curls were big news during these decades, which is reflected in the video, and it shows them loose, pinned and, above all, in abundance. Early days: Beginning in 1910, the model showcases the elegant curls seen  in Downton Abbey . Bouncy bouffant: The Roaring Twenties were depicted through the popular bobbed haircut . Sophisticated: The video shows the 1930s, left, and 1940s, right - eras that took cues from Hollywood stars . Glamorous: The 1950s were all about immaculate hair via beautifully curled bouffants, as seen in the video . The video then moves on to 1950s. Following the end of the Second World War, women became increasingly glamorous and immaculate. They embraced traditional, conservative values of beauty and with it came beautifully curled bouffants, and the iconic 'doe eye' created with heavy eyeliner and bright lips. The 1960s, as proven in the video, were all about the apologetically voluminous beehive. The look was created in 1954 by Chicago-based hairdresser Margaret Vinci Heldt who was asked by the editors of a glossy magazine to conjure up a style to reflect the next decade - it became a sartorial hit. Next up came the 1970s - and a social revolution. Indeed, hair reflected this and was worn long, flowing and free. Popularised by the likes of Farrah Fawcett, it was all about loose curls. Beehive babes: The 1960s were all about the voluminous beehive masterminded by Margaret Vinci Heldt . Thanks to the social revolution of the 1970s, hair was worn long, flowing and free a la Farrah Fawcett . As for 1980, as seen in the video, hair got bigger and bigger and women took inspiration from Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, who crimped their hair and wore it in a side ponytail. Make-up was colourful and clashing and hairspray was a girl's best friend. As the footage ventures into 1990, it's clear that Jennifer Aniston's character Rachel in Friends was hugely influential. Hair was long, sleek and framed the face; choppy layers were all the rage. So popular was this look that it was recently named the most iconic hairstyle ever. The millennium hairstyle didn't change hugely and sleek hair was still big news. The final look in the video is 2010 and showcases bouncy, loose curls reminiscent of Kim Kardashian - the model is even taking a selfie using her mobile phone. Jordan from Hershesons said of the video: 'The time lapse shows a real move from hair that is contrived;  you need an arsenal of products and tools for hair that is stiff and untouchable. 'Nowadays, hair has gone on a journey to be more organic, natural. Far more ‘get up and go’ achievable beauty, hair you want to run your hands through. 'The most popular requests we get are for ‘undone’ styles. People want ‘Cool Girl’ hair that looks a little bit naughty.' Wacky: In 1980 hair got bigger and bigger and women took inspiration from Madonna and Cyndi Lauper . Sleek and chic: The 1990s and 2000 were fairly bland in terms of hair experimentation. Women wore their locks sleek and choppy layers were favoured . Selfie nation: Hair as we know it today is worn effortlessly curled and the final shot in the video, right, is perhaps a nod to selfie-obsessed celebrities of today such as Kim Kardashian . nice’n easy colour Advisor Jonathan Long comments on the hair colour trends through the decades: . 1930s: . “In the 1930’s with the already vibrant Art Noveau, and the more recent Art Deco trends spreading across Europe and America, hair became more graphic and bold. The look was short, jaw length hair, with strong shape. Long hair tended to be pin curled at the front to resemble jaw length hair and kept small and tight in a chignon style at the back. Colours were bold, single applications of primary colours; the purest tone. If it was blonde it was the cleanest, purest platinum possible and if it was dark it was deep and strong to give strength and density to the shape.” 1940s: . “In the 1940’s, even in the midst of war with clothing and fabric rationing, people took great pride in their hair. The updos of the 30’s continued but hair naturally became longer and darker giving way to beautiful deep rich dark tones which would be set on pin curls then brushed through to create that classic wave of the 40’s. Raven haired beauties like style icon Ava Gardener epitomised the 40’s and took the lime light with beautiful blondes like Veronica Lake becoming more rarely seen on screen.” 1950s: . “With the constraints of war at an end, glamour became popular and women wanted to create a hair look that implied ‘domestic goddess’. Women looked to the glamour of Marilyn Monroe and the decade's other big Hollywood screen vamps and sirens for inspiration. Intense red coloured lips and platinum blonde hair became popular, highlighting a pale complexion.” 1960s: . “Women were moving into the workplace and wanted a more manageable and achievable day-time look. Hair colour was kept simple, with the emphasis on natural, healthy-looking colour like nice’n easy Sunkissed. Blonde was still the key colour but a more natural darker blonde with highlights, made famous by Ursula Andress and Bridget Bardot. Darker hair was often given highlights and the sun-kissed look by soaking strands of hair in lemon juice and sitting in the sun.” 1970s: . “At the beginning of the 1970’s a dark natural blonde look remained popular, inspired by Farrah Fawcett from the cult series 'Charlies Angels'. Hair was all about manes of free-falling curls, soft partings and long fringes completed by bronzed skin. However by the end of the era with the 'Punk' movement, women like Toyah Wilcox started to experiment with hair colour. For the first time we saw vivid primary or fluorescent hair colours emerging.” 1980s: . “Women were opting for intense strong colour to compliment 'power dressing'. Rich brunettes and strong blondes were all the rage, inspired by Dynasty characters' Krystle Carrington (Linda Evans) and Alexis (Joan Collins). On the other hand, the rebellious streak that started with punk continued with women led by Madonna wanting an ever-changing hair colour to go with their unconventional, eccentric clothing.” 1990s and 2000s: . “During the 1990’s and naughties, the whole world went back to blonde all over again! Each season we see the emergence of new hair colour trends, but our love of blondes remains constant throughout. Multi-toned inspired highlights, which can be achieved at home with nice’n easy Sunkissed, or an all over blonde – any shade of blonde in fact, even previously brunette models and film stars turned blonde.” 2010s: . “With all of the resources available to us today in the 2010s, blonde is still the desired hair colour of choice. The blondes of today are much easier going and less high maintenance. Multi-tonal, sun kissed, sandy blondes have replaced the all over block colours of previous years, allowing for that organic look and feel. We are entering into an era of huge change in hair colour and the way that people perceive hair colour. In the 2010s it should be a part of you not something extra added. With the likes of Scarlett Johansson opting to 'dress it down' instead of 'up' with her tousled sandy, sun kissed locks at this year’s Oscars showing her real natural beauty, you can definitely see the change we are heading for!”","Video documents changing hairstyles from 1910 to today .

"A chef at a ritzy eatery in Brooklyn is accused of serving the worst meat to Asian patrons and demanding they were not seated near him. A lawsuit alleges that César Ramirez of Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare ordered his staff to abide by his preferences and became angry if they did not. 'When a large piece of meat was cut into many pieces for the guests, Defendant Ramirez instructed Ms. Howard to give the worst pieces of meat to the 's**t people,' i.e. Asian people, and to Upper West Siders,' the suit states. A lawsuit alleges that César Ramirez (pictured)  of Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare served the worst meat to Asian patrons as he saved the best cuts for people he preferred . The three-Michelin-star eatery, which accommodates 18 diners, charges a flat $255 per person plus a $50 'service charge' for each patron, reports the New York Post. Ex-server Emi Howard, who is Asian, alleges in the suit Ramirez told his staff not to place Asian customers too close to him in his section of the restaurant. 'On one occasion, Ms. Howard 'violated' Defendant Ramirez's discriminatory rule by seating Asian individuals close to his spot at the center of kitchen counter,' the suit states. 'In response, Defendant Ramirez subjected Ms. Howard to a wild verbal tirade.' 'Mr. Ramirez from then on took control of the seating, so that he could ensure that no Asians be sat next to his place.' The three-Michelin-star eatery which accommodates 18 diners, charges a flat $255 per person plus a $50 'service charge' for each patron . Howard and four other former employees who were sacked, also accuse Ramirez and owner Moe Issa of cutting them out of tips and withholding overtime pay. Howard and fellow axed staffers Kyle McMahon, Loren Mash and Santos Hernandez are seeking unspecified back pay and damages. In a 2010 interview with Serious Eats: 'There are only a couple of feet between me and the customer, so I can't lie about the quality of the food or give them something inferior, like some restaurants do. 'There is an intimacy that Brooklyn Fare provides, but this is my kitchen, and I want to do it my way.' Brooklyn Fare owner Moe Issa has said in an email statement to The Daily Meal:  'At Brooklyn Fare, we pride ourselves on the diversity of our staff who hail from around the globe, and we welcome everyone who comes through our doors with open arms, be it a guest, vendor, or employee, regardless of their creed, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or nationality. We pay all of our staff fair wages for their hours worked as well as gratuity in accordance to the law.'","A lawsuit alleges that César Ramirez of Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare ordered his staff to abide by his preferences .

"Hacker group Anonymous  took down at least two official websites in Florida making good on threats after a city banned feeding the homeless. In a video claimed to be posted by Anonymous on Monday, an unidentified person wearing a mask and speaking with a digitally-altered voice threatened to crash the sites if the city of Fort Lauderdale didn't lift bans on panhandling at intersections, sleeping in public downtown and feeding the homeless. The sites FortLauderdale.gov and FLPD.gov were offline for several hours on Monday but back up later that evening. Scroll down for video . Hacker group Anonymous on Monday threatened to take down official Fort Lauderdale city websites following a ban on feeding the homeless . Both Fort Lauderdale's main city website (pictured) and that of the police department were down for several hours on Monday following threats from hacker group Anonymous . World War II veteran, 90-year-old Arnold Abbott (pictured) was cited on November 5 along with two pastors for feeding the homeless in a Fort Lauderdale park . The denial of service attack created a web traffic jam forcing the city to shut down the sites as a precaution. The Sun Sentinel reported that no critical services were affected, but people were unable to pay utility bills or find other government information. City Manager Lee Feldman said that officials were discussing the issue. Fort Lauderdale drew national attention last month after police cited 90-year-old Arnold Abbott and two pastors for feeding homeless people at Fort Lauderdale Beach. Abbott, a World War II veteran, and others served a four-course meal by the beach as a crowd of nearly 100 mostly homeless and volunteers cheered their arrival. Despite being charged with violating the new law by feeding the homeless,  Abbott said he's not deterred and even went back out to serve more food at a public park. Abbott, affectionately known as 'Chef Arnold,' has several programs, including a culinary school to train the homeless and help find them jobs in local kitchens. He and two South Florida ministers face up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. Known locally as 'Chef Arnold', Abbot runs several programs to feed and help the homeless including a culinary school to train them to find jobs in local kitchens . The faceoff in Fort Lauderdale over the ordinance restricting public feeding of the homeless has pitted those with compassionate aims against residents and businesses trying to protect their neighborhoods. Fort Lauderdale is the latest U.S. city to pass restrictions on feeding homeless people in public places. Advocates for the homeless say the cities are fighting to control increasing homeless populations but that simply passing ordinances doesn't work because they don't address the root causes. In the past two years, more than 30 cities have tried to introduce laws similar to Fort Lauderdale's, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. Harsh winters have driven many homeless people south to states such as Florida. Mayor Jack Seiler said he thinks Abbott and pastors Dwayne Black and Mark Sims have good intentions, but the city can't discriminate in enforcing the law. He said it was passed to ensure that public places are open to everyone. He also stressed that the city was working with local charities to help serve the homeless through indoor feedings and programs that get them medical care and long-term help. 'The parks have just been overrun and were inaccessible to locals and businesses,' Seiler said. After several hours both affected websites were once again up and running following the denial of service attack which forced the city to shut them down as a precaution . The issue of feeding the homeless has cropped up multiple times during Mr Abbot's long life. Abbott fought a similar ordinance in court 15 years ago and said he's prepared to mount another legal challenge. In 1999 he sued the City of Fort Lauderdale after he was banned from feeding the homeless on the beach. A court ruled that such a law was against the Constitution. Other cities are conducting routine homeless sweeps while some have launched anti-panhandling campaigns, according to the coalition. And many laws continue to target public feedings. In Houston, groups need written consent to feed the homeless in public, or they face a $2,000 fine. Organizations in Columbia, South Carolina, must pay $150 for a permit more than two weeks in advance to feed the homeless in city parks. In Orlando, an ordinance requires groups to get a permit to feed 25 or more people in parks in a downtown district. Groups are limited to two permits per year for each park. Since then, numerous activists have been arrested for violating the law. Fort Lauderdale's new law requires groups to be at least 500 feet away from residential properties and food sites are restricted to one per city block, but charities have criticized the rules as forms of implementing social cleansing. Similar laws are being looked at by other cities including Seattle, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Dallas, and Philadelphia.","Hacker group Anonymous took down two city websites in Fort Lauderdale in response to a ban on feeding the homeless .

"An unlikely alliance of left-leaning human rights activists, right-wing conservatives and church leaders has been forged to try and save the life of a mentally ill convicted killer slated for execution this week. Attorneys representing Scott Panetti asked the US Supreme Court Monday to halt his lethal injection scheduled for Wednesday saying he is too delusional for execution. Panetti, 56, is set to be put to death for the 1992 shooting deaths of his estranged wife's parents at their home in Fredericksburg in the Texas Hill Country. Condemnded: Texas death row inmate Scott Panetti's execution is set for December 3 but his attorneys want the death date withdrawn or at least delayed to allow for a new round of psychological testing to determine if he's competent to be executed . There was 'no doubt' Panetti was severely mentally ill 'before, during and after the crime for which he has been sentenced to death,' attorneys Gregory Wiercioch and Kathryn Kase told the justices. 'And Mr. Panetti's mental state has further deteriorated since his last evaluation in 2007.' The long list of those who are opposed to Mr Panetti's execution includes more than 50 Evangelical Christian leaders, seven Methodist bishops, 10 Texas state lawmakers and former libertarian presidential candidate and Republican Congressman Ron Paul, reported The Independent. Last month, Paul wrote a letter to Texas Governor Rick Perry asking him to grant Panetti clemency. Perry's gubernatorial predecessor Mark White, a Democrat, has gone on record calling Panetti's capital murder trial a 'sham.' Nearly 100,000 people from all walks of life have signed an online petition on Change.org asking to spare Panetti's life. Even his ex-wife, Sonja, whose parents the inmate shot dead in front of her in 1992, has declared that she believes he is too mentally ill to be put to death. Scott Panetti's case has something for everyone: libertarians oppose the death penalty because they do not trust the government; fiscal conservatives believe that executing an inmate costs more than imprisoning him for life, and religious conservatives reject capital punishment as a pro-life matter. Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood abortion clinic staffer-turned anti-abortion activist, wrote in a recent Dallas Morning News op-ed that opposing Panetti's execution is consistent with the key principles of the pro-life movement. 'A fundamental tenet of the pro-life ethic is that all life has value and we are called to protect it, especially in its most vulnerable forms. A culture of life recognizes the value of those who are vulnerable and prioritizes safeguarding them,' she wrote. Horrific crime: Panetti, at right on a horse with his wife and child, murdered his in-laws as his wife and daughter were splattered with their blood in 1992 . Panetti, a Hayward, Wisconsin, native, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1978 and had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before killing Joe and Amanda Alvarado. Attorneys said the double homicide was the result of a 'psychotic break' Panetti had suffered. His wife was living with her parents and a week earlier had obtained a court order to keep Panetti away. His wife and 3-year-old daughter, were sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws. They were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities. Justices in 2002 prohibited the execution of people who are mentally impaired, deciding it violated the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. But they have allowed capital punishment for mentally ill prisoners as long as the inmate has a factual and rational understanding of why he's being put to death. The 'rational understanding' provision was added by the Supreme Court in a 2007 ruling on an appeal from Panetti. Records indicate his case has gone to the Supreme Court at least five times since his 1995 conviction and sentence. Too sick to die: Panetti's lawyers say he is too severely mentally ill to be executed . 'Imposition of the death penalty on people with severe mental illness, as with people with intellectual disability, does not serve the two goals of deterrence and retribution because of their reduced moral culpability,' Panetti's lawyers argued to the high court Monday. Another appeal for Panetti pending before a federal appeals court seeks an execution delay for additional competency evaluations. While his medical records contain indications of mental illness, they 'strongly indicate rational awareness of his impending execution and the reason for it,' Ellen Stewart-Klein, an assistant Texas attorney general, told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 'Panetti's mental status has at best been severely exaggerated by his counsel,' she said. Also Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles refused a petition from Panetti's lawyers to delay his execution for 180 days or recommend to Republican Governor Rick Perry that Panetti's death sentence be commuted to life, board spokesman Raymond Estrada said. At his trial, Panetti 'wore the garish costume of a dime-store cowboy as he represented himself' and 'engaged in bizarre, incoherent and frightening behavior,' his attorneys said. His trial judge ruled he could be his own lawyer and appointed a standby attorney whom Panetti never consulted except to call as a witness during the trial's punishment phase. Panetti, pictured left as a boy, had moved to Texas with his parents in the 1970s. The one-time Navyman (right) worked as a ranch hand — his occupation on prison documents is listed as blacksmith . Bible thumping: Panetti already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years. He's seen here with his brother . Delusional? Attorneys contend Panetti is so delusional that he can't understand why he was convicted and condemned. Here, he's pictured with his mother and father . At one point, the defendant even tried to subpoena Jesus Christ and assassinated President John F. Kennedy as witnesses. He insisted only an insane person could prove insanity. I just wanted to see my wife,' Panetti, in a taped statement played at his capital murder trial, explained why he went to the home armed with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three knives and dressed in camouflage clothing. 'I put on my combat stuff so if I was cornered, I wanted to have my equipment. It was like I wasn't even in control, like someone else was pushing me.' No court has ruled Panetti was or is incompetent or insane. He has told lawyers his scheduled punishment was part of a satanic conspiracy to prevent him from preaching the gospel.","Scott Panetti's execution is scheduled for December 3, but his defense team seeks to delay it .

"The BBC pays 11 of its most senior bosses twice as much as the Prime Minister, it emerged yesterday. A further 80 executives take home more than David Cameron’s £142,500-a-year salary. When many of the corporation’s staff have seen annual pay rises of little more than 1 per cent, the 91 bosses are taking home a combined £19million a year including bonuses. MPs said the figures would make hard-pressed families question the licence fee especially when programmes are facing the axe. Scroll down for video . BBC director general Lord Hall, pictured,  earns £450,000-a-year, according to recently published information . BBC head of radio, Helen Boaden, pictured, is paid £352,900, while Charlotte Moore, right, is on £240,000 . Top earners include Director-General Lord Hall, who earns £450,000, Anne Bulford, managing director of finance and operations, who is paid £395,000, and Peter Salmon, Director of England, who takes home £375,000. The figures do not cover on-air stars, 39 of whom are paid more than £250,000 a year. Managing director for finance and operations, Anne Bulford, pictured, earns £395,000-a-year . These include Graham Norton, who is reportedly paid £2.6million for presenting his BBC1 and Radio2 shows, and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, who is said to take home as much as £2million. Even Paul Hollywood is paid a better wage than the Prime Minister, earning £300,000 for his work on The Great British Bake Off and its various spin-offs. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The BBC has recently said they have cut their senior management to the bone and there are no more savings to be made there but it’s only at the BBC where you could cut senior management to the bone and end up with more people paid more than the Prime Minister than before you started. ‘It’s just extraordinary and goes to show how much fat there is. ‘What the BBC should do is be cutting out all of these managers, most of who if they disappeared no one would notice, and start delivering some value for money to the licence fee payer.’ Angie Bray, a Tory member of the Commons culture committee alongside Mr Davies, said: ‘It will be difficult for the BBC to continue to feel loved by the public if it continues to put licence payers’ money on salaries rather than on what people want them to spend the money on, which is good programming. ‘It does make it difficult for everybody to go on justifying this kind of funding if it’s just disappearing into managers’ pockets.’ The number of BBC staff earning the entry level pay grade fell by nearly 3,000 between June 1995 and this year. Those in the top pay grade increased by almost 100, from 328 to 426 over the same timespan. An efficiency report published last week said the BBC has made savings of £1.1billion and would save a further £400million annually by 2016/17. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, receives an annual salary of  £142,000 for running the country . Stars: Graham Norton is believed to earn around £2.5million from the BBC and Gary Lineker, pictured with wife Danielle, around £1.5million . Miss Bulford said no more savings could be made through cuts to pay, staff and property and that ‘tough choices’ would have to be made over which services were sacrificed. Through the licence fee, the BBC collected more than £3.762billion tax free last year, an increase of £70million from the previous 12 months. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Overall we have saved over £150million per year on pay and head count; reduced the number and pay bill of senior managers by more than a third; reduced talent pay by £35million since 2008; and we have cut the number of buildings in the UK and overseas – all helping to us save £1.1billion a year.’ The figures on the salary structure were obtained from the BBC website and through a freedom of information request. Tony Hall, Director General - £450,000. Took the top job at the BBC after being chief executive of the Royal Opera House. Previously he ran BBC News and launched Radio 5, News 24, BBC News Online and BBC Parliament. Anne Bulford, Managing director for finance and operations - £395,000.

"Dementia patients are being failed at the end of their lives as they are not deemed to have a terminal illness, charities warn. Many are dying on an undignified hospital ward when they wanted to be at home with loved ones. The final stages of the disease have become the ‘forgotten aspects of a silent epidemic’, according to a joint report by the Alzheimer’s Society and Marie Curie. Undignified: Pensioners with dementia are being failed on NHS wards, charities warn (posed by model) It says that unlike other illnesses, NHS staff do not sit down with families of dementia patients and draw up an end-of-life care plan. Around 850,000 Britons are known to have dementia, and the number is expected to rise to 2million by 2050 as the population ages. The Government has promised to make the illness a national priority over concerns that there are no effective treatments and diagnosis rates remain shockingly low. But this report warns that despite efforts made to detect and treat the illness early on, too little attention is being paid to sufferers and their families at the end of their lives. The report also states sufferers are admitted to hospital ‘inappropriately’ (posed by models) Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive at Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘Dementia is frequently overlooked as being a terminal illness and as a consequence, there are unacceptable failures to prepare and plan for end of life care. ‘Despite much attention on dementia in recent years, many people with dementia are not dying where they had hoped, others face meeting the end of their life in pain or without dignity. ‘A lot needs to happen to improve care. ‘Improving staff training and awareness is vital in order to help make people’s final days as good as they can be. ‘Mapping this journey is difficult but considerations for end of life care for people with dementia are essential to meet the needs and dignity of each individual and their loved ones.’ Many dementia patients are believed to experience intense bouts of pain in their joints and bones but – due to the nature of the illness – cannot express this to doctors or nurses. The report also states that sufferers are frequently admitted to hospital ‘inappropriately’ as they near the end of their lives when they should be cared for at home. Phil McCarvill, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Marie Curie, the cancer care charity, said: ‘End of life care for people with dementia remains a hidden aspect of health and social care in England so it is vital that we shine a light on the final stages of dementia to improve care and support for people and their families. ‘I know from the personal experience of caring for my father that people with dementia have very specific needs. ‘All too often, services do not respond to the needs of the individual.’ Last year David Cameron pledged to make dementia a national priority and said there would be a cure by 2025. The Government has also promised that by next year doctors will have diagnosed two thirds of all patients with the illness – currently it is less than half.","Some patients have intense pain but cannot express it, charities say .
Joint report by Alzheimer’s Society and Marie Curie says state must act .
David Cameron made dementia 'national priority' and vowed 2025 cure ."
