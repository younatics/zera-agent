"Islamic State fighters have released new photos of a man having his hand chopped off for theft and another man being whipped for watching porn. The graphic images, which were posted online, give the first indication of how the shocking amputation punishment is being carried out as ISIS delivers its own twisted form of justice. The horrific sentence was carried out in the Iraqi border town of Qa'im, in Euphrates province. Severed: This is the moment Islamic State fighters administered their own brutal brand of justice by cutting off the hand of a man who was allegedly caught stealing . Justice: ISIS law demands that, after a trial, a list of the criminals' crimes be read out in front of a crowd of men who have been invited to watch, before the punishment is carried out . In front of a large crowd of men, the victim was blindfolded with a large patterned scarf and forced to place his arm on a table. One masked Islamic State fighter, wearing surgical gloves and a grey and pink striped jumper underneath his camouflage military vest, is shown trying to keep the victim's arm steady. On the table, the victim's arm has been stretched out on top of a wooden plank, covered with a white cloth. A large bottle of antiseptic is also positioned on the edge of the table. A rope is tied around the victim's wrist, allowing another Islamic State fighter to yank the severed hand away from the arm after it has been hacked off with a cleaver. One especially grisly image shows the detached hand in mid air, still tied to the rope. ISIS fighters also posted a high definition photo of the man's severed hand showing that the amputation was not a clean cut, leaving  bone and tissue hanging from the hand. A final photo of the victim's stump being covered in a gauze bandage is also shown. Typically ISIS would also release an image of the victim hugging the fighter who has punished him, but this was not done in this case. Punished: For the first time these images reveal how amputations are carried out. The victim is sat in a chair with a noose tied to his wrist (centre) which is used to pull the hand away after it is severed . Public: ISIS law demands that all punishments be carried out in public, and a large crowd of men are usually invited to watch each sentence . The vile punishment comes days after Islamic State posted photos of a man being flogged for watching pornography in Syria. According to captions on the photographs, the man was found guilty of 'watching pornographic videos' and was publicly whipped in front of a large crowd in the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. The victim appears to be in his early 20s and is smartly dressed in a red jumper. In front of a large crowd, the man is shown being whipped by an Islamic State fighter. As is customary in Islamic State punishment propaganda, the final photograph appears to be a staged scene, where the victim is shown hugging the IS fighter who has just punished him as an act of forgiveness. Last month, Islamic State released a document on social media, explaining the rules of Islamic State penal code, which is being brutally enforced across IS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law. All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court. After the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city. Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments. Twisted: A medical team wait nearby with bottles of antiseptic and bandages to help patch the victim up after the punishment is finished . An Islamic State fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public. All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death. Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion. According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed. Islamic State's penal code also states that anyone found guilty of banditry and caught stealing will have their right hand and their left leg amputated. This terrible punishment is done so that every member of the public can identify the victim's past crime. Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State. According to the document, 80 lashes of the whip is given to anyone who drinks alcohol or is found guilty of committing slander. Normally the whipping is not carried out on bare skin. The punishment of stoning, where heavy rocks are thrown or piled on top of the victim, is ordered for any married man or woman who has committed adultery. A hundreds lashes and immediate exile is given to any man or woman who has sex outside of marriage.","Islamic State fighters release video of man having his hand cut off in Iraq .

"The sharpest and largest image ever taken of the Andromeda Galaxy - the nearest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way - has been revealed by astronomers. It shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy’s pancake-shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light-years. The sweeping view, which reveals one third of our galactic neighbour, also suggests that the galaxy may have been battered by a collision with another galaxy two billion years ago. Click on the image to zoom in . Benjamin Williams of the University of Washington in Seattle told Nature that the image hints at an older wave of starbirth that had previously only been spotted in one area of Andromeda. ‘No one would have guessed it was galaxy-wide’, he said, suggesting there may have been a major collision in the galaxy’s history. The panoramic image has 1.5 billion pixels — meaning you would need more than 600 HD television screens to display the whole image. It traces the galaxy from its central galactic bulge on the left, where stars are densely packed together, across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outskirts of its outer disc on the right. The large groups of blue stars in the galaxy show the locations of star clusters and star-forming regions in the spiral arms, while the dark silhouettes of obscured regions trace out complex dust structures. Underlying the entire galaxy is a smooth distribution of cooler red stars that trace Andromeda's evolution over billions of years. Scroll down for the video . This image shows dust lanes, which are bands of interstellar dust, observed as a dark swath against the background of a brighter object. Other features, including stellar clusters, Milky Way stars, and star-forming regions are highlighted. The large groups of blue stars in the galaxy show the locations of star clusters and star-forming regions in the spiral arms . This image, captured by Hubble, is the largest and sharpest image ever taken of the Andromeda galaxy, otherwise known as M31. This is a cropped version of the full image and has 1.5 billion pixels. You would 600 HD television screens to display the whole image . It’s widely accepted than in 5 billion years our Milky Way will collide with the nearby Andromeda galaxy - but what will happen when it does? In a new simulation revealed in September, scientists showed the intricate process that will take place, with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one. And the newly formed super-galaxy, dubbed ‘Milkomeda’, will also ultimately spell disaster for Earth as our planet is flung out into interstellar space. The simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia. In the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other. First, in a tentative meeting, they will ‘swoop’ past each other, possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy. Then, after separating, the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again. As Andromeda is larger than the Milky Way, with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter, it will technically be the one ‘eating’ our galaxy. The Milky Way is also expected to ‘eat’ two nearby dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at some point in the future. The Andromeda Galaxy is a large spiral galaxy - a galaxy type home to the majority of the stars in the universe – and the clarity of these observations will help astronomers to interpret the light from the many galaxies that have a similar structure but lie much farther away. Because the Andromeda Galaxy is only 2.5 million light-years from Earth it is a much bigger target on the sky than the galaxies Hubble routinely photographs that are billions of light-years away. Its full diameter on the night sky is six times that of the full moon. To capture the large portion of the galaxy seen here — over 40 000 light-years across — Hubble took 411 images which have been assembled into a mosaic image. This panorama is the product of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (Phat) programme. Images were obtained from viewing the galaxy in near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard Hubble. This view shows the galaxy in its natural visible-light colour as photographed in red and blue filters. This wide-field view shows the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) along with its companions M32 (below centre) and NGC 205 (upper right).

"Australians travelling to Indonesia have been advised to exercise a high degree of caution after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop confirmed she has received information about planned acts of terror. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have issued a warning to Australians to exercise a high degree of caution if travelling Indonesia, including popular tourist spot Bali. The Australian Government says it is receiving information which indicates that terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia, which could take place at any time. Scroll down for video . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in Perth on Tuesday discussing government warnings about heightened risk of terror attacks and advice regarding travel to Indonesia . The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have issued a warning to Australians to exercise a high degree of caution if travelling to all areas of Indonesia, including popular tourist spot Bali (pictured is Legian Beach, Bali) Julie Bishop confirmed that the Government is working 'very closely' with Indonesian security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies and are preparing for the worst. The alarm was first raised after the US Government was warned about threats against US-associated hotels and banks in Surabaya in East Java. 'Australia is monitoring this situation very closely,' Bishop said at a press conference, confirming that DFAT is in partnership with Indonesian security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Ms Bishop emphasised that the risk is very real and Australians must act cautiously when travelling overseas, as we have already experienced 'incidents in the past where Australians were killed'. She used the example of the tragic deaths of 45 Australians in the 2002 Bali Bombings and 88 Australians in the 2005 Bali bombings as stark reminders that 'the threat of terror activity anywhere in the world remains.' She used the example of the tragic deaths of 45 Australians in the 2002 Bali Bombings and 88 Australians in the 2005 Bali bombings as stark reminders that 'the threat of terror activity anywhere in the world remains' 'That is why we count terrorism as our major national security threat,' said Ms Bishop. It is a major priority for the government to prepare adequately to prevent or react to potential terror attacks, 'to keep Australians safe here and overseas'. 'We're taking steps to make sure our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement agencies are well-resourced... (and) have the funding and personnel they require.' The smart traveller warning for Indonesia advises that there are known terrorist groups which remain active throughout Indonesia, despite police disruptions. 'Police continue to conduct operations against these groups and have stated publicly that terrorist suspects remaining at large may seek to attack Western targets.' The Foreign Minister advised Australians to follow all advice given by the Australia Government by paying close attention to Smart Traveller updates. 'We're taking steps to make sure our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement agencies are well-resourced and have the funding and personnel they require,' Ms Bishop told media on Tuesday . 'Of course in all these situations, people should be very aware of the fact that they are in another country, they're subject to the laws of another country,' Ms Bishop added. 'And if you can't afford to travel to Bali with travel insurance, then perhaps you should rethink your travel.' The US government on Sunday warned of a potential threat against US-associated hotels and banks in Surabaya. 'You should exercise particular caution around locations that have a low level of protective security and avoid places known to be possible terrorist targets,' the department says in its latest travel advice. The advice also notes Indonesian immigration staff may refuse entry to Australians with a criminal record, regardless of how long ago the offence took place. Ms Bishop has advised Australians to always execute caution when overseas and to be mindful that they are subject to the laws of another country, of which they may not be aware .","Australians are being advised to be 'highly cautious' in Indonesia .

"Missionary: Maud Kells, 75, from Cookstown, County Tyrone, who was shot twice by gunmen as they raided her home in north-east Congo . A British missionary who received an OBE in the New Year Honours List was shot twice by bandits who raided her home in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Gunmen shot Maud Kells, 75, in the shoulder during an armed robbery at her home in Mulita in the north east of the country. A spokesman for her Christian aid organisation, WEC International, said: 'She was stable last night, speaking, recognising people, drinking water. 'She has no broken bones, no major muscles hit and her bleeding has stopped.' Ms Kells, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, has worked in the Congo since 1968, initially as a missionary nurse, and has helped train  Congolese nurses in five hospitals and 30 health centres. She also conducts bible school teaching, speaks at church services, and supervises construction projects. She was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Year Honours List for a lifetime's work at the medical centre in the Congo. Although she has previously lived in the Congo for stretches of up to four years at a time, she now spends part of the year there and the other part at home in Cookstown. Politicians in Northern Ireland said they were shocked to hear about the shooting. Ulster Unionist Assembly Member for Mid-Ulster Sandra Overend said: 'Only a few days ago we heard the news that Maud is to be awarded a great honour from Her Majesty the Queen and now today, this terrible news that she has been shot doing her work in the Congo is shocking. 'I am sure that I share this sadness with so many people from Cookstown and across Mid-Ulster. 'Those that know Maud will hope that her usual determination will provide her with strength to recover from this terrible incident.' Ian McCrea, a Democratic Unionist Party Assembly Member for Mid Ulster, said: 'My thoughts and prayers are with Maud Kells tonight as she recovers from being shot twice in the shoulder.' A map shows the location of Mulita, north-east DRC, where Ms Kells was living when she was attacked . Pious: Ms Kells has worked in Congo since 1968, initially as a missionary nurse, latterly training Congolese nurses. She also teaches in bible school, speaks at church services, and supervises building projects . The WEC International spokesman said a primary school had been named after Ms Kells where she works. She is also a well-respected member of Molesworth Presbyterian Church in Cookstown. He said doctors in the Congo were assessing her condition last night and considering whether to send her to Kampala for further treatment. WEC director in Ireland Norman Cuthbert said the news about Ms Kells was very good, given that she could have been more seriously injured. 'Maud is a very, very strong lady. She has a very strong faith, I am sure Maud will recover, although it has been a very frightening experience for her.'","Maud Kells said to be in stable condition with no broken bones or bleeding .

"A female suicide bomber killed a police officer and wounded another in an attack on a police station in the main tourist district of central Istanbul, the city governor has said. The unidentified woman had walked into the police station and spoke English to officers, telling them she had lost her wallet, before setting off her suicide bomb. One policeman was badly wounded and later died in hospital, while another was lightly wounded in the attack in the Sultanahmet district on Tuesday afternoon, Istanbul's governor Vasip Sahin said. Deadly: Forensic officers work at the scene of the suicide bombing in central Istanbul which killed one police officer and injured another . 'She approached the police at around 5pm, saying in English: 'I have lost my wallet'. That's all I can say. We are trying to identify the attacker,' said Sahin. 'The female bomber lost her life. She has staged the attacked by detonating the bomb on her.' Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet . Davutoglu said on Tuesday it was not immediately clear whether the . suicide bomber had links . to any particular group. 'We have given instructions for the most . comprehensive investigations,' Davutoglu told reporters in a . brief statement in the capital Ankara. The Sultanahmet district, which is the home of world famous attractions including the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia museum, is visited by thousands of Turkish and foreign tourists every day. Attacked: The female suicide bomber went into the police station in the Sultanahmet district and told the police in English she had lost her wallet before setting off her charge . Unknown source: The Turkish Prime Minister said  it was not immediately clear whether the suicide bomber had links to any particular group. One policeman was badly wounded in the blast and later died in hospital, while another was lightly wounded and remains in hospital . The police station, seen in the left-hand corner, is located right next to the Hagia Sophia Museum, which can be seen in the background, and the Blue Mosque . Emergency services rushed to the scene and the city tram line that goes through the district was halted. Officials said there was so far no indication of the nationality or identity of the female suicide bomber. The attack came five days after a member of an outlawed Marxist group attacked police on guard outside the Ottoman-era Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul on the Bosphorus. The man, named as Firat Ozcelik, hurled two grenades at the police honour guard on duty outside the palace but they failed to explode. The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party–Front (DHKP-C) said it was behind the attack outside the Dolmabahce palace, which houses the Istanbul offices of the Turkish prime minister.","Female suicide bomber attacked police station in central Istanbul .

"Apple is preparing a radical redesign of its MacBook Air than includes just one port to allow Apple to make it even smaller. The new design was mocked up by 9to5mac after what it claims are leaks of them machine's specs. It is rumoured to include a single USB type C port - a new design that allows both power and other addons to work through the same connector. The new design has a slightly narrower keyboard, and four speakers above the keyboard . One port to rule them all: The new design (left) has a single USB 3.0 port and a headphone socket, compared to the power, headphone and USB port on the current model (right) 'The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model,' says 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman. 'Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple's first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.' Crucially, the machine is also expected to include a Retina screen - something the current model does not. The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the 'MacBook Stealth' internally. Apple's current MacBook range: The new version has a radically different design . Crucially, the machine is also expected to include a Retina screen - something the current model does not. Late last year Apple's Phil Schiller revealed a new iMac with a high resolution retina display the firm says is the world's highest resolution. Called the retina 5K display, it boasts 14.7 million pixels, seven times more than a HD TV. It has 67% more pixels than 4K. The edge of the machine measures just 5mm. The USB Type-C connector is a completely new design. It has been created for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks. It claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones. It is being built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. The plug is smaller than current laptop connectors, and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 Micro USB. Crucially, it will be reversible, meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in. The new 27‑inch iMac with Retina 5K display has four times as many pixels as the standard 27‑inch iMac display. The firm also revealed a new version of its Mac Mini computer, selling for $499. Both run Yosemite, the firm's latest mac OS software, which is also expected to be used in the new Air.","New design expected to include a single port to allow it to be lighter .

"Police are looking for Juan Soria Hernandez after he allegedly poured petrol over his wife on Monday morning . Police are hunting a man accused of pouring gasoline over his wife before setting her on fire in front of their terrified children. Juan Soria Hernandez, 31, allegedly poured the flammable liquid over his 29-year-old wife in the early hours of Monday morning. Authorities were alerted to the horrific attack when his wife managed to call 911 just before 4am, telling emergency services her husband was trying to set her one fire. The Ventura County Sheriff's Office says police who attended her home in Broadway Road in Moorpark, Southern California, found her suffering from significant injuries. James Mireles, understood to be part of a power crew working nearby who the woman manged to flag down, said she had burns to her head, face, arms and upper body. 'She was telling us that there was a fire and that she needs help,' Mireles told KABC-7. 'As we got up closer to her, she was pretty badly burned.' Mireles said her three young children - who authorities have confirmed were at home - were terrified following the incident, which apparently took place in the bathroom. According to the Moorpark Acorn, somebody had already tried to put the fire out in the bathroom. Mireles added: 'I brought the hose around and started hosing down the kitchen, and that's when I saw a gas can in there. You could smell the gas.' The woman was rushed to a local hospital, before being moved to a specialist burns unit. Mireles said the children, all under seven, told him their parents had been arguing 'for hours'. Neighbour Alejandro Magdalena told KTLA 5 News: 'It's just king of shocking, hearing that. 'Honestly — hearing that someone poured gas onto his woman. That's just wrong.' Police have not released the name of the woman, but have offered $1,000 for Hernadez's arrest. It is thought Hernandez left the scene in his white Ford F250 truck with the licence plate 86644S1 (pictured) The sheriff's office confirmed he was a suspect in an attempted murder. Hernandez, who is believed to be armed, is thought to be driving a white Ford F250 truck with the license plate 86644S1. He is described as Hispanic, 5ft 7ins and about 200lbs.

"A former AFL player has been granted bail after being charged over an elaborate kidnapping plot which allegedly also involved a media adviser to Clive Palmer and a former detective. Former Sydney Swans player Tony Smith was granted bail in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday after pledging a $250,000 surety. Under bail conditions Smith, who lives in Bali, is allowed to return to Indonesia but must advise the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of all overseas travel. Former Sydney Swans player Tony Smith was granted bail in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday after pledging a $250,000 surety . Smith, along with media adviser Andrew Crook and former detective Mick Featherstone, is accused of trying to persuade a National Australia Bank executive to admit to committing perjury during a Supreme Court civil lawsuit. Smith tried to sue NAB over $68 million he lost in a building project and shares in failed mortgage broker MFS, but the case was dismissed in 2012. The bank employee was allegedly lured to an Indonesian island with the false promise of a job interview, supposedly for a high-paid global finance officer position with Clive Palmer. Police allege when the NAB worker refused to say during the interview he had lied to the court, he was 'detained' by two Indonesian nationals dressed in security uniforms and further threatened. Smith was charged alongside Clive Palmer media adviser Andrew Crook (above) and Mick Featherstone . Smith, 48, has been charged with one count each of retaliation of a witness, attempting to pervert the course of justice and attempted fraud. Crook, 48, and Featherstone, 51, were arrested and granted bail last month with conditions including they surrender their passports and not go within 100 metres of the NAB branches at Southport on the Gold Coast. The former footballer played for the Swans from 1986 to 1988, chalking up a total of 17 games. It comes after it was revealed on Monday the alleged plot had been reported to police two years earlier but nobody followed it up, the ABC reported. The Crime and Corruption Commission is now investigating the matter after police sources told the national broadcaster a 109-page statement had been prepared for the police by NAB on behalf of an employee. It was handed over to police on January 30, 2013. A bank spokesman confirmed a 'full briefing' had been given to police in relation to the matter. The alleged kidnapping plot only came to light after Queensland Police Service's Taskforce Maxima - one aimed at stopping bikie-related incidents - found emails and other documents pointing to the incident. The taskforce was looking into Featherstone at the time, including his association with bikies as well as former and current police officers, and accusations of money laundering. The trio have been charged in relation to the alleged kidnapping a NAB bank executive after Smith tried to sue the bank over $68 million .

"Two parents turned their sons over to police after recognizing them in footage of an electronics store burglary which showed a group of five teens helping themselves to stacks of cell phones and laptops. The mom and dad - who have not been named - took their 14- and 16-year-old children to the police station in Fayetteville, North Carolina, after watching a news broadcast that featured the crime. Footage of a group of five boys wearing tracksuits and hooded sweaters showed the 3.30am robbery of an independent store called Tech Boyz on December 29. Scroll down for video . Burglary: The parents recognized their own sons in footage of five boys robbing an electronics store in Fayetteville, North Carolina . Busted: The 14- and 16-year old were supposed to be staying with an older sibling the night of the crime. It is not clear which they are in the footage . On their way: The youths were caught by as many as nine cameras, both outside the store and inside . Charges: The boys have been charged with larceny, breaking and entering and possession of stolen goods . The parents had thought their sons were spending the night with an older sibling - but realized what they had really been up to when they saw the surveillance footage, shown by ABC11. They were caught by as many as nine different cameras walking up to piles of laptops and other electronics stacked on the shelves of the store - many of which had been brought in by customers to be repaired. They seemingly forced their way into the store, and are filmed walking causally through it, then running away. The parents were at church when the footage first aired, but had recorded ABC11's news program and watched it back the next day. After they were marched to the Fayetteville police station, the boys were charged with charges including breaking and entering, larceny and possession of stolen goods. Others: Police also arrested a 17-year-old, and say they are on the cusp of finding the other two suspects . Raided: The store targeted was Tech Boyz in Fayetteville, from which laptops and cell phones were taken - some of which had been brought in by customers for repair . Owner: Jesse Hill thanked the parents for turning their sons in . Because of their ages, the two will go to a juvenile court. According to police, they said the burglary was not their idea and they went along with it due to peer pressure. Another boy, aged 17, was also arrested, while officers say they are closed to identifying the other two people filmed as part of the robbery. Jesse Hill, the co-owner of Tech Boyz, told the news station: 'To the [parents] who turned them in, thank you.

"Rating: . A chatty young man called Ross ('I'm working here until my girlfriend finishes uni, then we're off travelling') is blowing frantically on the embers of a failing fire. He breaks off to show us our ground floor room at this handsome (Grade 2-listed) pub on the River Kennet, across the tracks from Kintbury railway station. The author Robert Harris lives 100 yards upstream, and Hungerford is a couple of miles further along the towpath in this leafy stretch of West Berkshire. Simply glorious: The Dundas Arms enjoys a remarkable setting on the banks of the River Kennet . We are only paying £100 B&B but, even so, it's a dull room - a box, with brown furniture and dated curtains. Its one redeeming feature is a little fenced-off patio leading directly on to the canal at the back of the building. There is no middle ground in the bathroom, where the basin taps either trickle lifelessly or gush with such force that they give you a proper soaking - just where you don't want it. But what we like about the Dundas Arms is how it's popular with locals, and the staff are all in the mould of Ross - welcoming, efficient, down to earth. We are particularly impressed by a German girl who tells us she has been in the UK for 11 years - which explains her flawless English. A friend who lives nearby joins us for dinner. Ross explains that there is no head chef as such - 'we're using agency ones at the moment' - and it shows. My game pie is an unsightly mess and doesn't taste of much, while my wife has a rubbery steak. Our friend does better with her venison. But prices (wine is particularly reasonable) are good for this part of the world. A labrador strolls in for some respite from the cold. He seems to like the atmosphere, and might even be impressed by the bar decorated in polished old penny pieces minted in 1967 and by the wonderful array of real ales, including Berkshire Good Old Boy and Ramsbury Gold. Yes, the dining room needs some love. But what a spot this must be once winter is over, when Ross won't have to act as human bellows, and when sitting by the river will be a glorious summer treat.

"Rumours have been circulating since the beginning of December that Apple is preparing to launch a supersized version of its iPad Air.

The image seems to show a 'sketch' of the casing for the supersized tablet, which supports previous claims that the iPad Air Plus, also dubbed the iPad Pro by speculating enthusiasts, will also boast four speakers for stereo sound. A leaked photo of a sketch (pictured) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a Foxconn factory, where iPads are made, suggests that the rumours of an ‘iPad Air Plus’ with a 12.2 inch screen, are true . The image was released by French website Nowhere Else, which has previously leaked details  from unannounced smartphones and Apple gadgets which proved to be true, citing a Foxconn source. The source said that initial testing for the iPad Air Plus was stopped in the summer and Apple’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet. The sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the iPad Air 2 in design, with rounded corners and the same standby button, rear camera, microphone and volume buttons placement. However, seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound, there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell. The iPad Air Plus is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger, dwarfing the iPad Mini with its 7.9inch screen (left) and iPad air (right) with a  9.7 inch screen . Name: Popular suggestions for the name of the supersized tablet include the iPad Air Plus - taking its lead from Apple's iPhone 6 Plus smartphone, and the iPad Pro. Size: The tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 inch screen, although other dimensions have also been suggested. Rumours suggest it will be just seven millimetres thick. Design: The leaked 'sketch' suggests that the iPad Air Plus will be similar in design to the iPad Air 2, with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges. USP: The image differs from the smaller tablet however, because of grilles on the top of the shell, which suggest the device will include stereo speakers, as rumoured. Launch: Sources have suggested different launch times, but there is some consensus that the tablet may make its debut before the summer. Japanese magazine Mac Fan claimed in December that the iPad Air Plus will also feature a much faster A9 processor and is set to launch between April and June. Bloomberg and other publications reported that Apple was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015, while a recent report from The Wall Street Journal said the Californian firm had postponed mass production of the larger iPad from December 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch. The designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick, but the size of the screen is uncertain, with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches. The first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the iPhone 6 plus was impacting on iPad usage. The release of Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus means there is now only a 2.4-inch difference between the size of the phablet’s screen, and the display on its iPad mini. Analysis has revealed that as phones become larger, more people are using them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant. The new larger iPad is expected to look like the recently launched iPad Air (pictured), with rounded corners. Leaked designs show the gadget is just 7mm thick, but this is uncertain . A survey comparing the  before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users revealed that people with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55% of the time, but this increases to 72% for the iPhone 6 and 80% for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad, perhaps explaining why Aple is planning a larger one . A study by Pocket - an app that lets users save webpages, videos and other content for reading - later found that people who recently upgraded to an iPhone 6 Plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before. It analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app, and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an iPhone 5, 5C and 5S and those who now own an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also looked at the use of tablets by the same people. Pocket also saw users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 (centre) opened 33% more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5S (left), and those with a 6 Plus (right) opened 65% more items than before . The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent. Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales. Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular. The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘The bigger your phone’s screen, the more time you’ll spend reading and watching on it,’ explained the researchers in a blog post. ‘In fact, the bigger your phone’s screen, the more you’ll read and watch as a whole.’ It discovered that users who upgraded to an iPhone 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time, up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen. Pocket also saw that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. But, a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and Pocket noticed that people with an iPhone 6 Plus read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘This tells us that, at least for now, convenience and portability trump a better, and bigger, entertainment and reading experience.’","Image was obtained by an employee of Foxconn, which makes iPads .

"Footballer Phil Neville (pictured) has tweeted a picture of himself surrounded by cleaning supplies with the caption 'Time to get started' after his wife revealed he had never mopped or used a Hoover . He had never ironed a shirt, mopped a floor or picked up a vacuum. And until last month, ex footballer Phil Neville didn't even know how to make a cup of instant coffee. But after his wife Julie revealed the pundit had never tackled a piece of housework during their 15-year marriage, it looks like the man branded 'Britain's most hopeless husband' could be turning over a new leaf. The 37-year-old has tweeted a picture of himself surrounded by cleaning supplies, a vacuum, a mop bucket and a jar of instant coffee- with the caption 'Time to get started.' Mr Neville, who played 59 times for England and won six Premier League titles with Manchester United, seems to finally be ready to tackle some household chores. But with Julie revealing he has no idea where the ironing board is kept, can't turn on the oven and has never picked up a Hoover before, whether he will be able to do them is a different matter. Mr Neville first hinted at his lack of skill around the house on BBC Radio 5 at the weekend. In an insight into the cosseted life of top footballers, he said he ‘sprinted into the kitchen’ and phoned his wife to ask ‘how the hell do I make a cup of coffee’ after the Daily Mail’s chief sports reporter Matt Lawton asked for one during an interview at the couple’s £3.6million Cheshire home. The father of two later told how he made it with a ‘kettle… two little scoops of coffee’, and laughed: ‘I’ve lived in a bubble all my life.’ ‘All his talent is in his toes, that’s for certain,’  Julie Neville said. His wife then revealed in a separate radio interview that he had never used a vacuum cleaner, mop, dishwasher or washing machine. And yesterday, when asked if he had any redeeming talents around the house such as putting the rubbish out or mowing the lawn, she told the Mail he did neither. She added: ‘Ironing? Oh gosh no, he wouldn’t even know where we keep the ironing board… He wouldn’t know how to turn an oven on. ‘I’ve never known anything else and I’m super-domestic so I don’t really mind. Phil is an amazing father and husband – just not domesticated in any way.’ Speaking about her husband’s first attempt to make a cup of coffee, the 39-year-old said: ‘If you’d seen it you would not have thought it was classed as a coffee. I didn’t taste it, but it didn’t look good.’ But the Mail’s Matt Lawton was more generous, saying: ‘For a first go, it was very good.’ Scroll down for video . Embarrassing: Neville, who has won 59 caps for England, was forced to admit he did not know how to make instant coffee after he phoned his wife Julie Neville (right) for 'urgent' instructions for how to make the drink during an interview . Long relationship: The Neville couple, pictured left in 2000 and right in 2003, have been together for 18 years . As for Mr Neville, he has insisted he would ‘never drink the stuff’ anyway but confirmed that he has made tea. Mrs Neville, who owns online natural, sport performance and gluten-free products firm WinNaturally.com, is a former girlfriend of David Beckham. In June, more than 400 viewers complained about Mr Neville’s ‘robotic’ and ‘monotonous’ BBC commentary debut during England’s first World Cup game against Italy. Afterwards, he joked: ‘I helped everyone get to sleep.’ Manchester United players’ inability to cope with everyday tasks was revealed by ex-coach Brian McClair in 2004 when he said ‘none of the players can change a tyre on their cars’. FATHER . Neville Neville, 65, who was known for being the agent for his sons, is a former league cricketer and commercial director of Bury FC. His unusual name is featured in the classic terrace chant 'Neville Neville is the name of your dad', set to the tune of David Bowie's song Rebel Rebel. MOTHER . Jill Neville, 63, has been company secretary of Bury FC for more than 20 years and also general manager for the last five years. She was awarded for the freedom of the borough of Bury in 2012. At the time she was said to still be playing rounders and netball, and promoting sport in the area. THREE SIBLINGS . Gary Neville - England’s most-capped right-back in history - spent his whole career at Manchester United. He won eight Premier League titles, three FA Cups, one League Cup and two Champions Leagues. The 39-year-old is now a coach for England as well as a pundit for Sky Sports. Phil Neville hung up his boots at the end of the 2012/13 season after racking up 505 Premier League appearances for Manchester United and Everton. He won six Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League. The 37-year-old father-of-two is now a pundit for the BBC. Tracey Neville, 37, who went to school in Bury with her two brothers, is a twin of Phil - and a retired England netball player. She won a bronze at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, before retiring due to injury in 2004. She is now director of netball for the Manchester Thunder team.

"A Belgian student travelled more than 5,000 miles to Austin, Texas, to meet a stranger who Facebook suggested he make friends with. Victor Van Rossem, 24, was curious when Neal D Retke, 49, popped up as a 'suggested friend' on his Facebook feed because they had no obvious connection aside from one mutual acquaintance. But after browsing through Mr Retke's pictures, Mr Van Rossem, from Ghent in Belgium, became intrigued by the artist's eclectic interests. Have you seen this man? The poster which Belgian student Victor Van Rossem, 24, placed all over Austin, Texas in an attempt to find Neal D Retke, a stranger whom Facebook suggested he should befriend. 'Facebook suggested we become friends, and I thought that was pretty absurd,' Mr Van Rossem said. 'I became fascinated by him. He had a long beard and looked a little unusual. He did art performances and paintings of mythical creatures and strange beasts which only made me more interested in him. 'He looked like someone I wanted to meet - a very eccentric person.' So when Mr Retke, of Texas, failed to respond to him on Facebook, Mr Van Rossem decided to make the 5,000-mile trip to ask him in person if they could be friends. 'These days you can be friends with anyone anywhere just by clicking that friend request button. I wanted to take it back to the real world,' Mr Retke said. Search: Mr Van Rossem during the search for Mr Retke, filming one of their posters pinned up around Austin . Best of Facebook friends: Mr Van Rossem, Mr Van Bree and Mr Retke, who they finally met at a book signing . Mr Van Rossem set off with his friend, Bran Van Bree, 27, who took a video camera to document the adventure. They spent a week searching for Mr Retke, scouring the city of Austin by putting posters up on every street and asking passers-by if they knew him. They even wore t-shirts carrying the slogan 'Neal D Retke for President!' in the hope they would help them find him. Mr Van Rossem, said: 'At first we thought our chances of finding him were very slim, but then we visited some places in Austin that we knew he liked to go - and we eventually found someone who knew him.' That contact suggested looking for Mr Retke at a book signing. There Mr Van Rossem finally came face-to-face with the stranger to whom Facebook was so keen to introduce him. 'We were nervous when we first saw him,' said Mr Van Rossem . 'We didn't know how he would react - but after we explained the whole thing he just laughed and said ""well, you found me"" as if he was expecting us.' Eccentric: One of Mr Retke's Facebook pictures, standing next to a tree with a cartoon face, which persuaded Mr Van Rossem that Facebook's algorithms were right and they should indeed become friends . Fun times: in the end Mr Van Rossem and Mr Van Bree spent three weeks in Austin getting to know Mr Retke . Facebook's algorithms were vindicated as Mr Van Rossem and Mr Van Bree spent three enjoyable weeks with Mr Retke. Mr Van Rossem said: 'We had a lot of fun with Neal, and I consider him a real friend. We're still in touch through Facebook, and he might be coming to visit us next summer. Mr Van Rossem and Mr Van Bree's short documentary can watched on Vimeo.","Victor Van Rossem was intrigued at the suggestion he befriend Neal Retke .

"In the man-made world there is nothing like the vast, wizened majesty of an ancient tree. They are living links to the distant past whose very existence mocks the transience of our own mortality. American photographer Beth Moon has spent the past 14 years travelling the world in a quest to document the world's biggest, rarest and oldest trees. Most have only survived thanks to their isolation on remote mountainsides, private estates, or nature preserves, but just a few maintain a proud, though often precarious, existence in the midst of civilization. 'Standing as the earth’s largest and oldest living monuments, I believe these symbolic trees will take on a greater significance, especially at a time when our focus is directed at finding better ways to live with the environment, celebrating the wonders of nature that have survived throughout the centuries,' she writes on her website. 'By feeling a larger sense of time, developing a relationship with the natural world, we carry that awareness with us as it becomes a part of who we are.' Bristlecone pine: This tree could be one of several particularly old specimens in the U.S., which are believed to be up to 5,000 years old . Croft chestnut: This ancient tree in the grounds of Croft Castle in the Welsh Marches is between 400 and 500 years old . The Sentinels of St Edwards These yews framing the door of a church in Stow-on-the-Wood, Gloucestershire, inspired JRR Tolkien . Wakehurst Yews: These yews at Kew's country estate, Wakehurst Place, were a few years ago found to be more than 600 years old . Buffelsdrift Baobab: This massive tree near Lephalale, Limpopo, is one of South Africa's five biggest baobab trees . Rilke's Bayon: This massive tree is growing from ruins in Cambodia . Off To Market: This picture shows women walking past the baobab trees of Madagascar on their way shopping . Quiver Trees At Dusk: These South African trees, a type of aloe, are named for the practise of hollowing out their branches to make quivers . Kings Canyon Sequoias: The giant sequoia is the world's most massive tree, and arguably the largest living organism on Earth . General Sherman: This tree in California's Sequoia National Park is by volume the largest known living single stem tree on Earth . The Nantglyn Pulpit Yew: This yew, rumoured to be 5,000 years old, can be found outside St James Parish Church in Nantglyn, Denbighshire . Ifaty teapot: This particularly stout, almost bottle-shaped baobab tree specimen grows near the west coast of Madagascar .","Beth Moon spent 14 years travelling the world to collect the photos for this magnificent series .

"In a city famed for its beautiful people, you might think they would blend right in. But when the world’s most beautiful women descended on Miami on Monday ahead the 2014 Miss Universe pageant, even the most hardened heads in Florida’s party capital were turning to have a look.

The delegates who become part of the Miss Universe Organization display those characteristics in their everyday lives, both as individuals, who compete with hope of advancing their careers, personal and humanitarian goals, and as women who seek to improve the lives of others.' This year's event hasn't come without controversy; tensions are rife in the event's city of Doral, who pledged $2.5million from its reserves to support Trump’s beauty pageant, according to the Miami Herald.

'My costume portrays a sense of how I feel about being a modern day woman in my city; passionate, strong and empowered, whilst at the same time giving me the the opportunity to represent something which people immediately know as British. 'It also reflects the protection of the monarchy and how patriotic I feel towards them. 'I spent days exploring my city to find inspiration and I discovered that London is a city which is completely dedicated to them; hence why I finally decided to base my national costume on the Royal Guards of Buckingham Palace. 'My costume was designed by myself and handmade using the same textiles and embellishments from the same factory that make all official regalia for the royal family and their guards.

"Fiddling with tiny padlocks and trying to remember combinations could be a thing of the past for travellers. A new digital lock has been launched, allowing tourists to lock and unlock their suitcase with a swipe of their iPhone. The eGeeTouch lock, from US company Digipas, claims to offer a hassle-free alternative to normal locks and keys, offering increased security because you will need a specific smartphone or tablet to use it. Scroll down for video . You can now open your luggage lock with your smartphone, removing the need to remember combinations . The eGeeTouch uses NFC, a feature found on most smartphones, to open and close the mechanism . The lock is battery operated which will last for three years, but it can also be charged via USB, and uses NFC (Near Field Communications) to operate; a feature that is compatible with most smartphones. However, the product also comes with a pre-paired fob and sticker that is specific to that particular combination - working in a similar way to a lock and key. It was decided to use NFC technology as, unlike Bluetooth, there is no pairing code to input. The package also includes a pre-paired fob should your phone not have NFC enabled . The eGeeTouch Smart Lock will be able to be purchased in a variety of colours and designs . The company's website states: 'The world's-first eGeeTouch Smart Luggage Lock elevates your travel experience offering hassle free and improved security of luggage to accommodate increasing highly mobile worldwide travelers. 'This smart lock is embedded with state-of-art intelligent proximity access security technology to effectively eradicate disadvantages associated with traditional keyed and combination padlocks.

"Karen Danczuk is among the bookies’ favourites to be named the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester . ‘Cleavage selfie’ star Karen Danczuk is among the bookies’ favourites to be named the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester. The city’s political leaders agreed to hold an election for a directly-elected mayor in November as part of a £1billion devolution deal with the Government. Bookies have made Karen – wife of campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk – an outsider to become the ‘Boris of the North’ by landing the job. Other front-runners for the job include former Happy Mondays singer Bez and TV presenter Terry Christian, both 33/1, as well as film director Danny Boyle who is 25/1. The current leader of Manchester council Sir Richard Leese is the 4/1 favourite to win the race with the authority’s chief executive Sir Howard Bernstein at 10/1. Karen, who has become an internet sensation for posting revealing photographs of herself online, is 33/1 to get the job with the bookies Ladbrookes - only slightly longer odds than her husband, who is 20/1 to land the post. The Rochdale councillor has even joked she may run for the job, tweeting earlier: “Might put a bet on myself lol. KD.” The 31-year-old mother-of-two has brushed off criticism of her penchant for revealing photographs. Just this week she sent a series of snaps showing off her generous cleavage from a beach in Spain. Alongside one of the pictures, Cllr Danczuk wrote: 'OK so I couldn’t come to my favourite beach without taking a selfie!!' Her actions haven't come without criticism. In October last year, she went on national television to defend her posting of revealing selfies. Cllr Danczuk came head-to-head with notoriously outspoken journalist Janet Street-Porter on ITV's Loose Women. The politician became embroiled in a discussion with Street-Porter about her self-taken snaps. The Rochdale councillor has joked she may have run for the job of London Mayor, tweeting earlier: 'Might put a bet on myself lol. KD' Karen Danczuk, 31, Labour councillor for Kingsway, Rochdale who is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47 . Karen said the photos were not a ‘big deal’ adding: 'They're just selfies, millions of people do it every day. 'I do a very stressful job so have a very long week, I get dressed up on a Friday night, take a selfie. Why not?' At which point, Janet chimes in: 'Can I say why not? Because you're a councillor from Rochdale and Rochdale has reached the headlines in a very unfortunate way in the last few years. 'Firstly for the allegations of sex abuse, which your husband wrote a very good book about, and secondly because in 2012, nine men went to prison for having sex with girls who were groomed.' Street-Porter continued: 'The young women of Rochdale look to you as a Labour councillor to be a role model whether you want it or not. 'I think you carry a responsibility as a female politician whether you intend to stand for parliament or not is another matter. But I feel ashamed that you think that getting your assets out on a Friday night and posting a picture once it's been picked up by anybody. 'What kind of role model are you offering a 15-year-old girl in Rochdale?'.

"She might have missed out on the traditional breakfast of Three Kings cake but Queen Letizia of Spain appeared to be enjoying her early start as she watched a military parade in Madrid. The parade, which was combined with a reception at the Palacio Real, was held to mark Epiphany - a national holiday in Spain. Dressed in a floor-length teal gown, the 42-year-old was all smiles as she was helped onto a red carpeted viewing platform ahead of proceedings. Royal salute: Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia watch the traditional Epiphany Day parade . With husband King Felipe, 46, by her side, she then stood to watch the procession before retreating back inside the palace to welcome Juan del Rio Martin, the Military Archbishop of Spain. The priest, 68, has held the ceremonial role, which is similar to that of a British army chaplain, since 2000, when Benedict XVI appointed him to the position. Madrid's Epiphany Day parade is an annual tradition and is part of a day of celebration that sees the whole country come to a standstill. Considered almost as important as Christmas Day itself, Epiphany marks the moment when baby Jesus, then just a few days old, was seen for the first time by the Magi or Three Kings. Big day: Epiphany is almost as important as Christmas in Spain and most towns stage a parade . All smiles: The royals waved to well-wishers as they arrived with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (left) Glamorous: Letizia began the new year in style and wore a floor-length teal dress for the occasion . Ceremony: After the parade, the couple returned to the Palacio Real for more Epiphany celebrations . Known in Spain as El Día de los Reyes (Day of the Kings), it is celebrated with presents and colourful parades, the oldest of which takes place in Valencia. The biggest and most important, however, is Madrid's - thanks in no small part to the presence of a real king at the procession. This year's is Felipe's first since becoming king in June 2014 and follows a turbulent Christmas period for the Spanish royals. On the 20th December, it was announced that Felipe's older sister Infanta Cristina, 49, would go on trial for tax crimes. Royal welcome: Guests included Juan del Rio Martin, the Military Archbishop of Spain (right) Guests: A dignitary bows as he is introduced to 42-year-old Queen Letizia . Turbulent: The Spanish royals have endured a difficult Christmas period thanks to Infanta Cristina . Speech: 46-year-old King Felipe used the occasion to make a speech . Along with her husband, former handball player, Iñaki Urdangarín, the 49-year-old princess is one of 17 people charged with misusing funds donated to Mr Urdangardin's charity, the Noos Foundation. As a result, Cristina has been asked to keep a low profile, has not been allowed to undertake royal duties since 2011 and was conspicuous by her absence at Felipe's coronation. If convicted, which would be a first for Spain's royal family, she could face up to four years in prison as well as a multi-million pound fine. While Felipe and Letizia remain popular, the incident has led to the introduction of new rules designed to prevent a repeat of both the current scandal and the last two to affect his family - King Juan-Carlos' love of a freebie and the infamous 2009 photo in which he was pictured standing over an elephant he had shot. The rules, which also apply to Letizia and his two daughters, came into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'. Along with banning freebies, royals will be prevented from working in the private sector and all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.' Looking good: Letizia looked fresh-faced and relaxed following the Christmas break . Difficult times: The 46-year-old's older sister Cristina is set to stand trial on tax fraud charges later this year . New rules: As a result, Felipe has been forced to introduce new rules on royal behaviour . Dignity: Royals are now expected to behave in ways that earn them citizens' trust and appreciation .

"Donald Trump has called the alleged racist remarks made by Donald Sterling 'despicable', but said the woman who recorded the conversation is the 'girlfriend from hell'. No stranger to controversy himself, the billionaire property mogul said that LA Clippers owner Sterling, 'got set up by a very, very bad girlfriend, let's face it.' Speaking on Fox & Friends, Trump, 67, expressed sympathy for Sterling, 80, speculating that his fellow billionaire was struggling mentally and was taken advantage of by Vanessa Stiviano. Scroll Down for Video . Trump waded into the Donald Sterling controversy on Monday but was later hammered for an offhand comment he made -- one he stands by . Sterling has been widely condemned after the release of an audio recording in which he allegedly tells Stiviano, 31, that she cannot bring black people to his games and not to be photographed with black people. Appalled: Donald Trump said that he was appalled at the actions of Sterling's girlfriend, Vanessa Stiviano and the LA Clippers owner . Sterling can be heard specifically talking about Magic Johnson - telling Stiviano, who is black and Mexican, that he doesn't want her 'associating with black people.' 'She’s called the girlfriend from hell, but what he said was terrible and despicable and very strong action is going to be taken. There’s no question about it,' Trump said of Stiviano. 'She’s a terrible human being and he gave horrible answers and disgusting answers.' 'But what he said was terrible, it was despicable and very strong action is going to be taken, there is no question about it.' Trump also raised the possibility of mitigating circumstances for Sterling, questioning his mental abilities and how he could be led on by someone 'so obviously looking to do harm to him.' He added that in his opinion, Sterling seemed close to 'incompetent.' 'I think he could be out of it, frankly, based on his actions,' Trump said. 'He could be pretty much out of it in terms of his whole mentality.' Trump said he expects “extremely strong action” from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. United: Donald Sterling spotted leaving a Steak House with his wife Rochelle in El Segundo, Los Angeles. The disgraced owner of the LA Clippers came out of hiding just a day after a recorded phone conversation of Sterling making racist comments were released . This comes as the NAACP wants a meeting with NBA commissioner Adam Silver to discuss Clippers owner Donald Sterling and the racist comments he allegedly made in a recorded conversation. The announcement was made Tuesday morning by Roslyn M. Brock, the chair of the NAACP National Board of Directors. She says the NAACP wants to talk to Silver about what it calls, quote, 'the influence and impact of racism in the National Basketball Association.' This comes as the organization's Los Angeles chapter withdrew its decision to give Sterling a lifetime achievement award, and returned money he donated. Brock says the situation reminds us ""racism and bigotry are still alive and well in all corners of society."" The NBA is scheduled to announce later Tuesday the result of its investigation into Sterling's alleged remarks. Lastest lawsuit: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling and Vanessa Stiviano, who is being sued by Sterling's estranged wife Rochelle for $1.8 million and who allegedly recorded him making racist remarks .

"Former neighbours of the woman at the centre of the Prince Andrew 'sex slave' scandal have spoken out about the typical 'lovely' Central Coast mum with the alleged huge secret. Residents of Glenning Valley, near Tuggerah, on the NSW Central Coast, were shocked by the allegations that 30-year-old Virginia Roberts was allegedly kept as a sex slave by Wall Street financier Jeffrey Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, local Cellarbrations bottle shop worker Sue Evrard said she was 'gobsmacked' by the allegations. Prince Andrew photographed with Virginia Roberts in 2001 . 'She was lovely. She had two little boys and a little girl. She was always really pleasant,' Ms Evrard said. Ms Evrard said she was sad when Virginia decided to move back to the US with her Australian husband Robert Giuffre to be with her brother and his children. She claims Virginia never mentioned she was affiliated with any member of the royal family and certainly never boasted about her alleged famous ties. Prince Andrew was seen leaving Verbier ski resort in Switzerland today as he made his way back to the UK . Marriage: Miss Roberts pictured with her husband Robert Giuffre on their wedding day in Thailand in 2002 . 'When I saw it on the news I was gobsmacked. I just screamed ""That's my Ginny,"" I just remember how she was a really good mum.' Ms Evrard said. Ms Roberts and her husband regularly hosted barbeques in the backyard of her home, which the Telegraph says is now occupied by Honor Symes. Ms Symes described Ms Roberts as a 'lovely lady' and 'well liked' and said she was unaware of her previous life as an alleged sex slave. 'She has been in contact with some people over the past 48 hours,': Ms Symes said. Prince Andrew vehemently denies the claims made in a legal action by Ms Roberts that he abused her as an under-age girl at an orgy where she was being used as a ‘sex slave’. The legal allegation states that Ms Roberts was ‘forced’ to have sex with the royal at parties in London, New York and the Caribbean. Former neighbours of Virginia Roberts when she lived at Glenning Valley, near Tuggerah, on the NSW Central Coast, say they were shocked when it emerged she was allegedly kept as a 'sex slave' Ms Roberts' father later corrected his claims his daughter (right) was introduced to the Queen. Left, Prince Andrew with former friend Jeffrey Epstein in 2011 . Ms Roberts' two boys attended Chittaway Public School on the Central Coast before they moved abroad . She claims she was told to ‘give the prince whatever he demanded’ by his friend Epstein – the US paedophile who hosted the parties – and that she was converted ‘into what is commonly referred to as a sex slave’. FRIDAY: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’ SATURDAY AFTERNOON: ‘A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further.’ SATURDAY EVENING, in response to specific claims about Andrew’s alleged conduct: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’ Ms Robert's father Sky Roberts spoke out this weekend to support his daughter, who is now 30, and said her claims should be tested in court. He said: ‘I brought up my children and that includes Virginia to always tell the truth … Why would she lie?’ In court documents, Ms Roberts – who is not named – says she was ‘procured for sexual activities’ for Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell. Ms Maxwell is alleged to have facilitated the prince’s ‘abuse’ of the girl. The legal documents, lodged with a Florida court, name Ms Maxwell as a ‘madame’ and a ‘primary co-conspirator in [Epstein’s] sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’. She has previously branded all claims against her as ‘untrue’ and ‘obvious lies’. The court papers name Andrew, 54, as one of three men allegedly involved in abusing ‘Jane Doe #3’ when she was 17 – under-age according to Florida state law. Epstein, a long-term friend of Andrew, was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for under-age prostitution. The pair remained friends and were seen together in 2011 after Epstein’s release. On Friday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said ‘any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue’. Andrew’s accuser countered the statement, saying via her lawyers that she is an ‘innocent victim’ and: ‘I’m not going to be bullied back into silence.’ Denial: The Queen has said she did not meet Virginia Roberts after her father Sky (pictured with her aged seven) said she met the monarch on the same trip she met Prince Andrew .

"It is an iconic sight, a steam bus that shuttles more than 50,000 tourists a year through the steep, narrow streets of Whitby. And now you can own a slice of history by bidding for the Elizabeth the Steam Bus on eBay. The 11-tonne bus is on sale for £185,000 and has long been a familiar sight in the picturesque North Yorkshire seaside town, trundling along at a maximum speed of 25mph. Iconic seaside attraction, Elizabeth the Steam Bus, is now up for sale on eBay for £185,000 . But now owners Viv and Vernon Smith have decided to reluctantly part with the unique steam bus, after a row with the local council. Despite being labelled a heritage attraction and a national treasure, Elizabeth, the only working steam bus in the world, receives no money from the public purse. For nine years the couple have operated Elizabeth, a six-wheel, 30-seater bus, and a sister vehicle, a soft top charabanc, called Charlotte, which was built in 1929. But with the owners decision to part company, locals fear that the attraction could be sold overseas and leave the town forever. Owners Viv and Vernon Smith decided to put it up for sale following a dispute with the local council . The bus is a local institution, shuttling over 50,000 holidaymakers every year at a maximum speed of 25mph . Owner Vernon Smith reluctantly announced the sale of the 'heritage attraction' on Facebook . Announcing the sale on Facebook the couple said: 'We are a heritage attraction, but unlike most others we get nothing from the public purse, in spite of being labelled a national treasure. 'We have reached the stage where in spite of all the good you and other people do by taking a ride, the ever growing costs of keeping our old ladies going are getting beyond us.' The couple had a dispute earlier in the year over the 'obstructive' attitude of the council over the refilling of Elizabeth's 300 gallon water tank.The steam bus must be refilled once each day, a process that takes five minutes. The refilling usually took place at Whitby Town FC's ground, but the bus cannot be accommodated on the 12 days a year when a match was being held. The couple also shared that they get 'nothing from the public purse' to help with maintenance of the vehicle . For the lucky bidder, a 10% non-refundable deposit must be paid within 24 hours of the end of the auction . Vernon claimed he contacted the council to ask whether this could take place at a car park near the town's harbour - but said the council refused permission, saying the vehicle must fit inside a designated parking space. Mr Smith said: 'There are a variety of reasons for selling Elizabeth but the council's behaviour is a catalyst. 'We think it's time the council wakes up the level of public support, instead of being what we perceive as obstructive.' The decision to sell came after the pair contacted the council about concerns refilling the vehicle's water tank . Viv and Vernon had hoped to refill the vehicle 12 days per year in a local harbour-side car park . A spokeswoman for Scarborough Borough Council has said: 'Like many others, we are very sad to hear of the decision taken by the owners of Elizabeth to stop operating in Whitby. 'As one of the town's unique and much loved attractions we fully appreciate the strength of feelings expressed by her supporters. 'However, we strongly refute the claims that we are somehow to blame for the owner's decision. However, the council refused their request, which Vernon identifies as his 'catalyst' to opt to sell . Locals are hopeful that the attraction will remain in the town and not be sold to an individual overseas . 'Welcome to Yorkshire has worked closely with Elizabeth's owners for a number of years to try and assist them, which included helping to fund Elizabeth's participation in two Lord Mayor's Parades in London. 'In conclusion, we feel that the willingness of the council and Welcome to Yorkshire in recent years to support the steam bus has unfortunately not been met with realistic co-operation from its owners.' Elizabeth will continue carry passengers this year before making her final journey on November 2.","An 11-tonne steam bus, known as Elizabeth, is now for sale on eBay .

"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today delivered an impassioned eulogy to his father, former governor Mario Cuomo, at his funeral, calling him a 'keynote speaker for our better angels'. In his 40-minute address at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on Manhattan's Upper East Side, the governor recalled his father's steadfast commitment to his beliefs and his own desire to continue his father's legacy, saying: 'My dad was my hero, my mentor and my confidante.' Bill Clinton, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined Andrew Cuomo, his brother, CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo, their mother Matilda and hundreds of mourners in the snow today to bid farewell to former Governor Mario Cuomo at his funeral service. Draped in a New York state flag and dusted with snow, his casket was carried into the church  as dozens of state police in uniform stood at attention, and hundreds of well-wishers queued in the brisk weather to pass on their respects to the Democratic Party icon who left a progressive legacy of speaking out for the voiceless and powerless. Following the service, Andrew Cuomo was seen holding his sobbing mother before his brother blew one final kiss to their father's casket. Cuomo, a three-term governor, passed away at his Manhattan home from heart failure on January 1 - just hours after his son was sworn in for a second term as governor. He was 82.

'He believed what he believed, and the reaction of the audience or the powers that be or the popularity of his belief was irrelevant to him,' he said. 'Mario Cuomo was at peace with who he was and how he saw the world. This gave him a great strength and made him anything but a typical politician.'​ . He added that as an immigrant's son from Queens, his father - in his words - 'was always an outsider. That's what gave him his edge'. 'At his core, he was a philosopher. He was a poet. He was an advocate. He was a crusader. Mario Cuomo was the keynote speaker for our better angels,' the younger Cuomo said in the eulogy, which spanned from his father's biggest speeches to his fierce competitiveness on the basketball court. 'He left the world a better place than when he found it,' he said. 'New York is a better state thanks to Mario Cuomo.' He explained how, in his father's last few days, he told him that he wanted him to stay strong so that he could hold the bible at his inauguration. On January 1, he told his father he could attend a ceremony in Buffalo, New York if he didn't feel up to an earlier one in the city. His father didn't reply, and shortly after the start of the Buffalo ceremony - which started at 4pm - he passed away at 5.30pm, Governor Cuomo said. 'He was here, he waited and then he quietly slipped out of the event and then went home,' he said. 'Just like he always did because his job was done.'

At the close of his eulogy, he asked his father to send his love to their relatives who had passed away, as well as fallen police officers, Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, who were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn two weeks ago. 'Tell Ramos and Liu we miss them already,' he said. He went on: 'Pop, you taught us well. You inspired us. We know what we have to do and we will do it. We will make this state a better state. We will do this together. On this, you have my word, your son. I love you pop and I always will.' Scripture readings — some by Cuomo's daughters — included the Beatitudes, which were said to be among Cuomo's favorites, and a quote from the Book of Wisdom that begins, 'The souls of the just are in the hands of God.' 'Mario Cuomo ever communicated a spirit of inclusivity and care, a spirit of decency and uprightness that inspired love and respect,' said the Rev. George M. Witt, the pastor of St. Ignatius, where some of Cuomo's five children are parishioners and several of his grandchildren have gone to school. 'In the end, it was not so much the eloquence of his words that spoke to us but the eloquence of his life.' On Monday, hundreds waited in a line that stretched more than a block to pay their respects at Cuomo's wake. Vice President Joe Biden, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York, actor Alan Alda and former state Comptroller Carl McCall were among those who paid tribute. Photos from Cuomo's life were displayed - him being sworn in as governor, their wedding portrait, a black-and-white image of a young Cuomo playing stickball.

He's working with God now,' she said. Lynda Rufo, a banker lined up outside the funeral home, said her daughter was finishing law school because of Cuomo's encouragement. 'He was a part of New York,' Rufo said. 'He always took the time to be there for everyone, no matter who you were or where you came from. He loved people.' Cuomo was most remembered for a speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, where he focused on an America divided between haves and have-nots and scolded Republican President Ronald Reagan for not working to close that gap. He came to his stances from personal experience, the son of an Italian immigrant father who struggled economically.

"Two women accusing Bill Cosby of sexual offenses decades ago have joined a defamation lawsuit, contending he publicly branded them as liars through statements by his representatives. The amended complaint was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Springfield, in western Massachusetts, where Cosby has a home in Shelburne Falls. Cosby is the only defendant in the lawsuit, originally filed last month by Tamara Green, who said he drugged and assaulted her in the 1970s. Scroll down for video . Two women accusing Bill Cosby of sexual offenses decades ago have joined a defamation lawsuit, contending he publicly branded them as liars through statements by his representatives . The two new plaintiffs are Therese Serignese, who said he drugged and raped her in 1976, and Linda Traitz, who alleges he tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970. Attorney Joseph Cammarata, who represents the three women, said the civil action allows them to have their allegations heard since criminal statutes of limitation have expired. ""The lawsuit provides an opportunity for women who claim to have been harmed to have their day in court in a forum where the truth can be tried,"" he said. Cosby's publicist David Brokaw and lawyer Martin Singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. Singer has said he expected to prevail in the original lawsuit. Nurse Therese Serignese, 57,  said the television icon raped her in 1976 when she was 19 years old following a show in Las Vegas . Green first spoke publicly about her allegations in 2005. She said in the lawsuit that after she did media interviews Brokaw and Cosby's lawyer Walter M. Phillips Jr. made statements intended to expose her to public contempt and ridicule. Phillips said last month he represented Cosby in 2005 but no longer does, and he declined to comment further. Brokaw did not return messages then seeking comment on Green's allegations. Serignese and Traitz, who are from Florida, allege in the amended complaint that when they came forward separately last November, Singer issued responses for Cosby that said they and other accusers were lying. Linda Traitz, who alleges he tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970 . Since November, at least 15 women have come forward with claims Cosby sexually assaulted them decades ago. Most of the women say he drugged them before he assaulted them. Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show"" from 1984 to 1992, has never been charged in connection with any of the allegations, and through his representatives he has denied them. A 2005 lawsuit by a Pennsylvania woman was settled before it went to trial. Cosby's career unraveled after his accusers came forward, with a TV project halted and nearly a dozen standup comedy tour performances canceled or indefinitely postponed. He's scheduled to appear Wednesday in Canada, at a Kitchener, Ontario, theater, his first concert since a Nov. 21 show in Melbourne, Florida.","Cosby is the only defendant in the lawsuit, originally filed last month by Tamara Green, who said he drugged and assaulted her in the 1970s .

"A gay couple claim they were chucked out of a taxi operated by Uber because they were kissing and cuddling. Jordan Sloat said the driver told them he usually took gay couples but 'they don't usually do that sort of thing' after he ordered them out of the taxi in London. Mr Sloat and his partner Corey Watts, 23, had been in the car just minutes when the driver pulled over in Covent Garden and told them to get out at about 8pm on New Year's Day. Corey Watts (left) and his partner Jordan Sloat (right) were ordered to get out of an Uber taxi in London by their driver after they started kissing and cuddling in the back seat of the car on New Year's Day . 'I felt shocked - you don't expect that sort of homophobic reaction in London,' Mr Sloat told ITV News. The couple, who had been on their way to a friend's house, were forced to get another taxi. Uber confirmed the driver had been suspended since the incident and they were investigating. Mr Sloat added: 'We were kissing and cuddled next to each other when a minute or two after picking us up he pulled over and told us to get out. He said he was shocked by the reaction and asked the driver if it was because they were gay. He allegedly told them he picked up gay couples all the time but they 'don't normally do this.' Mr Sloat, who comes from Toronto, said he was shocked to witness this kind of behaviour in London and said his partner became angry - accusing the driver of 'disgusting homophobia.' They claim they asked the driver, who has now been suspended by Uber, if they were being asked to leave because they were gay and he said he did take gay couples but 'they didn't usually do that sort of thing' After the incident Mr Watts, a hair stylist from Cardiff, wrote on Twitter: 'Just got asked to get out of an @Uber cab for kissing my boyfriend. Flipped my s***.' The couple were initially charged for the journey but this was later refunded. Uber runs a taxi service in cities across the world and allows people to use an app to get a quote for a journey and order a car through their smartphones. Mr Watts posted a message on Twitter after the incident and said it has provoked unexpected reaction . In a statement Uber said: 'Uber does not tolerate any form of discrimination either by our partner drivers or towards our partner drivers. 'We opened an investigation from the moment we learned of this unacceptable incident and have been in contact with the rider to extended our sincere apologies and get further information. 'The driver concerned has been suspended from the Uber platform.' Mr Watts accused the taxi firm of homophobia after they were ordered out of the taxi in Covent Garden . In November the taxi firm was criticised after a driver refused to pick up a blind woman in Conneticut, apparently because she was with her guide dog. In London the launch of the firm has led to gridlocks after black cab drivers staged a 'go slow' protest because they claimed Uber was putting them out of business. It has already been banned in New Delhi after a driver allegedly raped a customer, and in Madrid because of claims that drivers carry out activities which constitute unfair competition. Uber was launched in 2009 in California. It operates through a smartphone app which allows customers to get a quote for a journey and order a car. The app works by locating the nearest suitable vehicle for the ride using GPS. Customers are then charged for the journey through their mobile phone bills and can even split the cost with friends. It is also possible to track the journey on mobile phones. When a journey is complete customers can rate the driver out of five stars. In December the company was valued at £25.5billion ($40 billion). The firm currently operates in 70 cities of 35 countries across the world. Uber has been banned in New Delhi after a driver allegedly raped a customer. Spain has also banned use of the app over claims drivers use unfair competition.","Jordan Sloat and partner Corey Watts travelled in an Uber taxi in London .

"A Vermont school district that barred a parent from meetings because some staff members were afraid of him has agreed to pay $147,500. Attorneys negotiated the settlement between the Addison Rutland Supervisory Union and Marcel Cyr after a federal judge ruled Cyr had been discriminated against. Cyr had been critical of the education provided his child at the Benson Village School. 'We're talking about a guy who was worried about his kid's education and was trying to bring attention to what he thought the problems were and he was told he couldn't come to the meetings,' said Allen Gilbert of the Vermont Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Banned: A Vermont school district that barred parent Marcel Cyr from meetings about Benson Village School because some staff members were afraid of him has agreed to pay $147,500. 'Basic rights were taken away. Schools need really good reasons to serve no-trespass orders. This case is a win for everyone who cares for education, democracy and how public policy is done.' No-trespass orders were served against Cyr in September 2011 and March 2012 after school officials said they feared for their safety, in part because of Cyr's loud voice and sometimes harsh comments about the education his son was receiving. Cyr's family had lived in Benson, but they have since moved elsewhere. Superintendent Ron Ryan tells the Rutland Herald  that he would rather lose a lawsuit than risk the safety of teachers, school staff, students and parents. 'From this point forward, I guess if we suspect someone is being unruly, we'll hire a law enforcement officer to stand guard,' he said. 'It could be expensive, but that's what we have to do. VTDigger.org reports that court records reveal Cyr has no criminal record and his lawyer Dan Barrett said that Cyr is 'not a threat to anyone.' No-trespass order: Court documents reveal that Marcel Cyr was barred from school property . “In this case I think it’s laughable. If you were to ever meet Marcel, he’s no threat. He’s not going to harm anybody. … In this instance, I don’t see any real threat of harm from disclosure of the person,' said Barrett. 'It’s really important for government agencies in Vermont to understand that criticism is normal and healthy,' Barrett said. 'Someone comes to a government meeting and criticizes a school board in public comments: he can’t be frozen out. That’s just part of democracy, and something that school boards and select boards sometimes don’t understand.” According to court documents Cyr makes a living as a facilities manager at a retirement community.","A Vermont school district barred  parent Marcel Cyr from meetings because some staff members were afraid of him .

"A Lebanese porn star has received death threats after being ranked as the best actress in the business by a popular adult website. Mia Khalifa, 21, grew up in Lebanon but moved to the U.S. as a teenager to enroll in college, before becoming involved in the adult film industry. She is now the most searched for actress on movie-sharing website PornHub, an accolade which has drawn strong criticism from her country of birth. Scroll down for video . Mia Khalifa, 21, who was born in Lebanon before moving to the U.S. as a teenager, has been attacked online after being voted porn's top actress by one of the world's top video-sharing sites . Twitter users branded Miss Khalifa 'disgusting' and 'vile', while one even threatened to 'cut her neck' after she was named as the internet's most searched-for adult star . Users have branded her 'ugly' and 'disgusting', while one vowed to 'cut her neck' and another posted a mocked-up photo of her being held hostage by ISIS murderer Jihadi John. One particular source of outrage is a video which shows Miss Khalifa performing sex acts while wearing a hijab, part of the Muslim religious dress. One user calling herself Fifi wrote: 'Mia Khalifa is neat and all but wearing hijabs in her porn vids is really problematic and gross.' Another poster going under the handle of Ayeerab wrote: 'B**** wonders why Arabs bash on her. Maybe because you f****** degraded Muslims in a porno.' Users reacted angrily to the news that Miss Khalifa had taken the top spot, calling her a 'disgrace' Miss Khalifa began posting some of the abuse on her own Twitter profile, while responding to her critics, accusing many of being secret fans . A particular source of anger was one video which shows Miss Khalifa having sex while wearing a hijab . Miss Khalifa was also heavily criticised for having an Arabic tattoo on her arm which reads 'Koullouna lil-watan, lil’oula lil-‘alam' - the first line of the Lebanese national anthem. Another controversial tattoo is the Lebanese armed forces cross, which she has on her wrist. Miss Khalifa responded to the abuse by posting it on her Twitter profile, along with responses to users, hitting back at their comments and accusing some of being secret fans. She added: 'Doesn’t the Middle East have more important things to worry about besides me? How about finding a president? Or containing ISIS?' Lebanon has been badly affected by the civil war taking place in neighbouring Syria, including ISIS, which has threatened to spill over its borders. Miss Khalifa hit back at her abusers, saying: 'Doesn’t the Middle East have more important things to worry about besides me? How about finding a president? Or containing ISIS?' She also posted this image of a Chrismtas present she was given, saying it had cheered her up 'after a long day of death threats' It has also been without a president since Michel Suleiman vacated his post in May last year after a six-year term, and politicians have so far been unable to find a suitable replacement. Miss Khlifa grew up in Lebanon, but moved to Maryland as a teenager before enrolling at the University of Texas at El Paso as a history major. According to her Twitter profile she now lives in Miami, and describes herself as: 'Unofficial mascot of the Florida State Seminoles and a pornstar in the off-season.' However she is believed to still have family living in Lebanon, where she was born in Beirut.","Mia Khalifa, 21, originally from Lebanon, named porn's top actress .

'When it happened, it was terrifying. I felt really dizzy and had to call my dad to come and pick me up from a dance class at school,’ she explained. 'It came completely out of nowhere. I had to sit down but couldn't think clearly and wasn't sure what I was doing or where I was. If the 19-year-old wins the prestigious competition she will travel to Orlando to compete . Georgie says that having a stroke had only made her more determined to compete in the competition . 'I ended up walking out of the school and stumbling down the road like a drunk. My dad was passing as he was coming to get me and he found me collapsed in a bush. 'I spent two days in bed before being rushed to the hospital - a doctor was called out to my house as I was too ill to move. 'He was waving his hands in front of my face but I couldn't see them, that's when everyone realised that something was terribly wrong. 'I felt really sick and it was really frustrating because I knew what I was thinking but I was unable to speak without slurring.' Georgie says that when they finally realised that she had had a stroke it had come as a huge shock for her and her family. Georgie will be representing her home county of Northamptonshire in the Miss Galaxy contest . Georgie's stroke left her with impaired sight but she says she's not going to let that get in the way of winning . 'When my parents and younger brother were shown my brain scan their faces just dropped, I was so worried what had they seen. 'There was a big black blob in my brain where there had obviously been a clot or something. 'I lost my peripheral vision, so I couldn't see the top right corner of my sight, and I've still got that a bit. I'm much better now, though, and I have to take aspirin every day.' Georgie will take part in the competition on Feb 6 . But despite her setback Georgie is now gunning to win one of the country's most prestigious beauty pageants prizes after making a remarkable recovery. She is in the running to be named Miss Galaxy UK after reaching the finals of the competition, which will be held at The Park Hall Hotel, Chorley, Lancashire, on February 6.

Georgie will be representing her home county of Northamptonshire where coming first would earn her a trip to Orlando, Florida, to compete internationally. Georgie says that since her accident she has been concentrating on volunteering which eventually saw her enter the world of pageanting. 'Since my stroke, I have been doing a lot of charity work and that's how I got back into doing pageants because you do a lot of charity work for them.' The beauty queen says that without the pageanting she doubts she would have been able to overcome the experience. 'It has given me a lot of confidence to move on with my life and live every moment to the fullest. 'I hope the competition will help me forget and move on from such a horrifying experience.' Georgie whose sight has deteriorated says that she is still determined to win the contest despite her condition. 'Losing sight in your eye is very scary - but I'm ready to compete and win the competition. 'It would be amazing for me if I did. It would be a dream come true.' Georgie moved from Thrapston, Nothants, to Nottingham last year with her friend Nancy Burrows, to study at Nottingham Trent University. Nancy, 20 says that moving away from where the bad experience had take place had really helped Georgie to move on. 'It's been good for her to get out of the small town we come from and move to Nottingham. 'She's been able to meet new people and do something different. She's a really happy girl, she wakes up smiling and that's why I think she does well in these competitions. 'I don't see any reason why she couldn't win it.' Georgie's mother, Kim Holland, added that she was extremely proud of her daughter's inpiring story. 'I think Georgie has got back on her feet because of her determination. If she gets something in her head, then she does it. 'I'm really proud of her and I'd like to think she will do really well.' Georgie says that as well as being a huge triumph for herself, winning would mean proving to other women that you can move on from bad experiences. 'It would be great to win it - I want to show other women out there that no matter what life throws at you, it can be overcome.'

The New York Times best-selling author has been spending her final days before surrender with her princesses - at a hockey game and a ski trip to Crystal Springs Resort. 'My family is probably one of the strongest families I know,' her daughter Gia - who's shopping around a reality show - told Access Hollywood in November. 'So we'll get through this. It's gonna be fine. And when it's over, we're gonna be better than ever.' The Real Housewives of New Jersey star has told daughters Gia and Gabriella about the family's legal woes, but she's reportedly keeping her incarceration a secret from her youngest girls. 'She told [Milania and Audriana] she is going to jail to work on a book about jail,' a source told Radar Online. 'Teresa and Joe feel that they are too young to fully comprehend what is going on.' They pleaded guilty last year to hiding assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitting phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans. Joe  also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes totaling more than $200,000. At the Giudices' sentencing in October, U.S. District Judge Esther Salas criticized the couple for not disclosing all their assets as required under their plea agreement, calling it 'the same pattern of obstruction, concealment and manipulation as they showed in the bankruptcy case.'

Reached by phone last week, Kridel called the lawsuit 'ridiculous' and denied the claims. 'We did what we were supposed to do,' he said. 'We can only rely on the facts that were provided to us. I don't wish her any ill will, but I would have preferred a 'thank you' rather than a lawsuit.'","Real Housewives of New Jersey star was convicted of bankruptcy fraud .

"Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino has declared he intends to write himself into the club’s history books by getting the better of Arsenal in his first North London derby. The Argentinian says he knows exactly how significant the fixture is for supporters of both sides and has called upon his players to show bravery as well as skill at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday evening. The 42-year-old, who left Southampton in May to succeed Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane said: 'We are ambitious. We arrived three months ago and we need to make our way but we are focused on the game and know the history. But it is also important to write the history, starting now.' Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino takes charge of his first North London derby on Saturday . Rafael Van der Vaart (left) and Gareth Bale celebrate Tottenham's 3-2 victory at Arsenal in November 2010 . The history books show that Arsenal enjoy a vastly superior record in home derbies as Tottenham’s only away victory since May 1993 was a 3-2 success in November 2010. But Pochettino’s first derby while in charge of Espanyol saw his under-dogs beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Nou Camp and he outlined the ingredients he believed his players would need to succeed on Saturday. He said: 'We need to be clear in our own way and in our performance. We need to put in a good performance from beginning to end to get the victory. We need to be aggressive and focused on our job, never give up and try to get the victory - this is the winning mentality we need to have.'

Pochettino added: 'It was a different competition but it was important for our confidence. But we know we need to change. The game on Saturday is different to Nottingham Forest and different to West Bromwich. We need to show our skill and we need to be brave to play against Arsenal.'","Mauricio Pochettino takes charge of Spurs in his first North London derby at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday .

"Hull City manager Steve Bruce is excited by new signing Hatem Ben Arfa, and is confident he can get the best out of the mercurial French winger. Bruce brought in the playmaker  on a loan deal from Newcastle on transfer deadline day after Ben Arfa fell out with the club's manager Alan Pardew and was sent to train with their youth and reserve team players. The Frenchman is short of match fitness, and is unlikely to feature in Hull's clash against West Ham on Monday, but the Tigers' manager Bruce has vowed to get the best out of the inconsistent midfielder. Hatem Ben Arfa signed for Hull City on loan from Newcastle after falling out with Magpies boss Alan Pardew . Hull City manager Steve Bruce (right) insists Hatem Ben Arfa will be a success at Hull City . Bruce told Sky Sports: 'I don't think he's fit enough to go straight in at the start because he hasn't played 90 minutes for I don't know how long. 'But that's what you get when you've been ostracised, having to work with the Under 21s. 'He's going to have a big part to play here because he gives us the flexibility to play whatever formation we like. 'All I want him to do is go out there and enjoy playing again, feel wanted, be part of the club and be appreciated.' Sportsmail understands  meanwhile that Bruce is keen on leaving Hull to become the Newcastle manager, if, as expected, current boss Alan Pardew is sacked. French winger Ben Arfa was at Newcastle between 2010 and 2014, and scored a number of memorable goals .","Hull City manager Steve Bruce is excited by loan signing Hatem Ben Arfa .

'If our hearts could explode from love they would': A week after they were born 12 weeks early, Ashley and Tyson Gardner are learning how to care for their fragile premie quadruplets . 'If our hearts could explode from love they would have already,' Ashley wrote on the Facebook dedicated to their journey. 'Everyday I don't think it's possible to love them any more than I already do and then the next day I find that I do!!!' Though faced with some bumps in the road, especially for the lightest baby Indie, but the couple are looking to their faith to stay strong. 'God has a plan for us, and he's trusted us with four babies,' Tyson Gardner said. 'We have faith in him, and we have faith in each other.' The Gardners spent eight years battling infertility and gave birth with the help of in vitro fertilization. Proud father Tyson posted that the new mom and four daughters 'were doing incredible' after the birth which was a one-in-70-million chance. 'God has a plan for us, and he's trusted us with four babies,' Tyson Gardner said. 'We have faith in him, and we have faith in each other' Tyson and Ashley Gardner smile while answering questions during a press conference on their new quadruplets at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, Utah . Ashley and Tyson Gardner, of Pleasant Grove, said they've gotten congratulations from people around the world after the four babies were delivered via cesarean section . Quads! Ashley Gardner, who spent eight years battling infertility, has received an incredible late Christmas present after delivering four healthy baby girls . Miracles: She gave birth 12 weeks early to two sets of identical girl twins named Esme, Evangeline, Indie and Scarlett . Mr Gardner, from Pleasant Grove, Utah, also thanked the doctors and nurses who delivered the babies. The couple have been sharing messages on a Facebook page charting the pregnancy, saying they are 'overjoyed' and that all four girls appear to have inherited their father's dark hair. The Gardners also shared that they will be featured on a TV series on the TLC network about the pregnancy, birth of their 'quad squad' and adventures over the coming months. The Gardners documented the pregnancy on YouTube, Facebook and a family website. Mr Gardner wrote: 'We can't wait to have you all along on this journey!' Photos of the couple looking shocked after receiving the news about their multiple babies gained wide attention online, and a Facebook page they set up for the babies has nearly 350,000 likes. 'People identify with our story. There are hundreds, thousands of people that struggle with infertility,' Tyson Gardner said. 'Our story's a story of hope.' 'It was scary at first, and then, you know, the second you see the babies' faces and hear them cry, it just is, it's all worth it,' Ashely Gardner said, according to the Deseret News. Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing  contractions early. The couple became an internet sensation after they made a video earlier this year showing their startled but ecstatic reaction to the news that they had four babies on the way. The couple have been sharing messages on a Facebook page charting the pregnancy, saying they are 'overjoyed' and that all four girls appear to have inherited their father's dark hair . Proud new father Tyson Gardner posted this picture of his wife Ashley with the message: 'Moms saying Hello to Esme! Incredible day! God is real people!!'

Ashley Gardner (left), pictured after giving birth by Cesarean section on Sunday, is now mom to four baby girls, Indie, Esme, Scarlett and Evangeline. Her proud husband Tyson with Dr Minton (right) Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. The couple wrote in a Facebook post: 'We were so blessed to be able to do IVF the month of June! They put 2 eggs back and both split! That's right, we are having quadruplets! The odds of both eggs splitting are literally 1 in 1 million.' Since then, the couple have posted regular updates on the progress of the pregnancy, including themed snaps of Ashley in costume for Halloween and Christmas. The quadruplets' survival was called a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop  contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant. The couple flew to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October. Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. The couple posted a picture shortly before the birth with the message: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks' Festive: The couple, pictured above at Christmas just days before Ashely's contractions started, kept their huge Facebook following updated with topical pictures . Mr Gardner said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. Surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems. In October, the Gardners posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, ''This has been a good day!'' 'Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!!' The couple, who say the babies are doing 'great' and receiving 'fabulous care', have promised more updates when possible. How many?!

"Australian globetrotters will now be able to get their much-loved flat whites while travelling across the United States, with Starbucks finally adding the beverage to its menu. While most bemoan the coffee-making abilities of Americans, the ABC put the coffee giant's version of the beloved hipster drink to the ultimate test by calling on radio announcer Red Symons to try out the new addition. Symons is best known for his role as the prickly judge of Hey Hey It's Saturday's Red Faces and lead guitarist of rock bank Skyhooks. Scroll down for video . The coffee giant's version of the beloved hipster drink was put to ultimate test by radio announcer Red Symons (pictured here with ABC journalist Ben Knight) Along with journalist Ben Knight, Symons visited a Starbucks to Washington D.C. to get their hands on one of the first flat whites to be served on U.S. soil. Symons - whose drink of choice is the flat white - told the national broadcaster he often had to coax American baristas through the process of making a good cup of joe. 'In order to get a decent coffee here you have to get a cup and you say ""I'd like an espresso, and then can you put another espresso in that cup, and then can you pour some milk on top - no that's enough"",' he said. A Starbucks' flat white is made with 'steamed whole milk poured over two shots of espresso, topped with microfoam swirled into beautiful latte art', according to its website. Symons is best known for his role as the prickly judge of Hey Hey It's Saturday's Red Faces and lead guitarist of rock bank Skyhooks . And it seems the cafe chain is on to something good but still has room for improvement. In the initial first sips, Symons said the coffee was a bit weak for his liking but he was 'happy with the foam'. He also questioned the lack of promised 'latte art'. 'The important thing is, maybe it's not how coffee should be, but they're having a go,' he said. For years, there has been much debate surrounding the origins of the flat white. It has been reported the beverage first appeared in the early 1980s in Sydney but Melbournians have laid claim to creating the concoction, saying they were drinking them as early as the 1970s. But over the ditch in New Zealand, Kiwi coffee makers credit themselves with the invention of the flat white we know today in the later 1980s, The New Zealand Herald reported. Starbucks has started serving the flat white, which some say originated in Australia, in stores . While social media has been abuzz with the new drink options, Australians were less than enamored by the inclusion . Brisbane's Bec wrote: 'If starbucks u.s flat white attempt is similar to their ""cappuccino"" attempt, ill stick to black coffee while i am there' While social media has been abuzz with the new drink options, Australians were less than enamored by the inclusion. 'So America is in a flap about the flat white. The really big deal is that Starbucks has found a new style of coffee to f**k up,' Melbourne's Tron Lord tweeted. While Brisbane's Bec wrote: 'If starbucks u.s flat white attempt is similar to their ""cappuccino"" attempt, ill stick to black coffee while i am there'. And for Americans, Starbucks' flat white is more of an acquired taste. 'The Starbucks Flat White is just a glass of warm milk,' Matt White said. lisasharkey echoed his sentiments: 'The Starbucks Flat White is just a glass of warm milk.'","Red Symons, from Hey Hey It's Saturday fame, tested out the new flat white .

"London's highest-up and most controversial roof garden has opened its doors on the 35th floor of the Walkie Talkie skyscraper - but even City planners appear to be unimpressed with the final result. The Sky Garden, which sits atop 20 Fenchurch Street, promised to be the capital's newest public park and was one of the reasons why the vast office block was allowed to be built on the edge of a conservation area. It was also expected to provide the best aerial view of UK's capital city. London's highest-up - and most controversial - roof garden has opened its doors on the 35th floor of the Walkie Talkie skyscraper . The Sky Garden, which sits atop 20 Fenchurch Street, promised to be the capital's newest public park . But City planners have admitted that the hotly-anticipated garden, which opened its doors this week, is not 'quite what it was meant to be'. Some have said the development, with its three exclusive restaurants,  isn't actually a garden at all, but 'an observation deck with a few trees'. There has also been criticism levied at the 'public' aspect of the space, after it emerged that only paying customers would be allowed up to the garden after 6pm. The furore will again highlight the controversy which surrounded the building of the £200m skyscraper, when developers were forced to go through a public inquiry, amid complaints the block would impede the view of St Paul's. It will also be another blow for those who backed the building, following the episode last summer in which the concave top-shape of the building  - the very feature which allowed the Sky Garden to built - caused cars and businesses to melt beneath it. Speaking after the garden's opening, a source close to the planning department told the Guardian: 'It's still very much a live issue here. Let's say it isn't necessarily quite what it was meant to be.' But City planners have admitted that the hotly-anticipated garden is not 'quite what it was meant to be' Some have said the development, which has three exclusive restaurants, isn't actually a garden at all, but 'an observation deck with a few trees' The three-storey space, designed by landscape practice Gillespies, has space for 400 diners, plus an extra 200 members of the public . Peter Rees, the City of London's former chief planner, added: 'I can't say that nothing has been compromised. 'Every building is a prototype, and things have to change as they go along. But it isn't a garden.' The three-storey space, designed by landscape practice Gillespies, boasts a Sky Pod bar on the lower terrace, as well as the Darwin brasserie and the 'refined dining experience' of the Fenchurch grill on the top level. In all, there's room for 400 diners, plus an extra 200 members of the public. The criticism will again highlight the controversy which surrounded the building of the £200m skyscraper, when developers were forced to go through a public inquiry . The building was given its nickname due to its unique concave shape, which means it is top-heavy . Those who would prefer just to check out the view can book to go up the tower for a one-and-a-half hour slot. The booking must be made online, three days in advance. But, after 6pm, only paying clientele from one of the three restaurants will be allowed up to the garden. One critic wrote: '""Public park"" may be stretching it a bit. ""Observation deck with a few trees"" might be a more accurate description.' Not everyone has been impressed with the photos of the roof garden, which opened this week . Another person, responding to a photo posted online, tweeted: 'Imagine it. You've climbed to the top of the greasy pole and it's not even as good as Center Parcs.' Last year, the 37-storey building was dubbed the Walkie Scorchie when it was found that the building was channelling the sun's rays into a concentrated beam, melting vehicles parked on Eastcheap. A two-storey scaffolding structure covered in netting was erected as a temporary solution. At the time, the architect behind the new building Rafael Viñoly said he predicted the exact scenario, but blamed the 'current elevation of the sun in the sky'.","Sky Garden at 20 Fenchurch Street promised to be public park for London .

"Garth Brooks is a real country gentleman when it comes to keeping his word. He’s making good on a promise he made to wife Trisha Yearwood eight years ago, to move from the couple’s country mansion in Owasso, Oklahoma, back to Nashville once his youngest child graduated from high school. And he’s just put their $3.5 million home up for sale! We're outta here: Garth Brooks is a man of his word. He promised wife Trisha they would move back to Tennessee after his daughters had graduated from high school. And so they are . When Brooks, 52, and his 49 year old Misses married December 10, 2005 he was a divorced dad with three young daughters. Garth and Trisha wanted to make their home in Tennessee, but when his ex wife Sandy Mahl moved the kids from Georgia to Oklahoma, he knew he and Trisha had to follow. ‘Although Garth and Sandy divorced after 15 years of marriage, Garth continued to put his girls first,’ says a source. ‘He adores his children, and there was no way he wasn’t going to be a part of his daughter’s lives on a daily basis. Trisha just didn’t know how they could live in Oklahoma and still manage their careers, which centered around the music industry in Nashville.  But Garth was adamant that he needed to be near his children in Owasso. For sale: Garth's girls spent a lot of time at thea 14,089 square foot French country style mansion on 2.4 acres of land in Owasso, Oklahoma . The source reveals Garth wanted so much to be with his girls, that he made Trish a deal. He said that if she would agree to move up north with him until the girls were all out of High School, he would agree to move back to Tennesse. Garth is Yearwood’s third husband. She was married to Chris Latham from 1987-1991 and on May 21, 1994, she married guitar player Bobby Reynolds, but they divorced in 1999. ‘Trisha never felt either of her first two marriages was strong enough to have children,’ says the source. ‘And when she and Garth finally married in 2005, after four years of dating, she found she didn't get pregnant, so they never had children of their own. ‘Garth and Trisha did talk about adopting,’ adds the source, ‘but in the end they agreed that it was enough to parent Garth’s three girls together.' State of the art: Besides a huge kitchen, Garth's house boasts seven bedrooms and 9.5 baths. The asking price is $3,490,000 . The source says Trisha is extremely close to the girls, including 21 year old Taylor, who Trisha taught to cook, Allie, 17 and 19 year old August who just made Garth a Grandfather when she and her boyfriend welcomed a baby girl they named Karolynn. 'Trisha has always gotten along great with Garth’s girls,' adds the source. 'Garth decided to retire shortly after his divorce from his wife so he could spend more time with the girls.  And after the move to Oklahoma, the girls lived part time with their mom and part time with Garth and Trisha.’ The home the girls shared with their dad and step – mom, which is now for sale,  had plenty of room for the Brooks family of five! It is a 14,089 square foot French country style mansion on 2.4 acres of land in Owasso, Oklahoma. It has 7 bedrooms and 9.5 baths, and the asking price is $3,490,000. It also has 2 kitchens, a 5 car garage, a screening room and a gym. ‘Of course the girls loved living in the lap of luxury with Trish and Garth, so they were always happy to arrive on their doorstep!’ Adieu: Ex-wife Sandy Mahl, the mom of Garth's daughters Allie, 17, August,19, and Taylor, 21, will remain in Oklahoma . But now that Allie will be graduating next month, Garth is ready to make good on his promise to return to Tennessee. Garth just put the Oklahoma house up for sale and he and Trisha have already started looking for a new property near their old place in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. They still want enough room so the girls can visit anytime.’ Garth has also decided to start touring again after 14 years . ‘Garth is coming out of retirement now that Allie is graduating High school,’ says the source. ‘He wanted to be around while the girls were growing up, but now that they will all basically be on their own, he feels free to travel. In fact, he’ll star touring in September, and Trisha plans to spend time on the road with him promising to jump up on stage every once in a while and duo with him!’","Country superstar has put his seven-bedroom mansion in Owasso, Oklahoma up for sale .

"Nigel Farage has defended a Ukip official who said it was the party of 'bigots' as he was left reeling from the defection of a top MEP to the Conservatives. The Ukip leader hit out at the party's former communities spokesman Amjad Bashir after his defection to join David Cameron's party. But he refused to condemn Ukip party secretary Matthew Richardson saying that Ukip should represent 'bigots' and labelling the NHS a 'waste of money'. Scroll down for video . Ukip have been rocked by the defection of Amjad Bashir, who was pictured with David Cameron after joining the Tories . Nigel Farage feels the heat after a day of terrible headlines, including claims Ukip is the party of bigots . Ukip has been stunned by the Mr Bashir's shock decision to change parties, claiming only the Tories can deliver a vote on Britain's membership of the European Union. In a stinging parting short, Mr Bashir said he decided to leave Ukip because it 'has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true'. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he said he had 'experienced racism in Ukip' and accused Mr Farage of e runs running the party 'like a dictator, employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way'. In an attempt to play down the defection, Mr Farage said Ukip had become 'increasingly alarmed' about allegations of impropriety against Mr Bashir. He claimed the MEP 'didn't tell us the truth' about the alleged employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business and there are 'some big open questions in Brussels about money'. There were also claims of interference in candidate selection in Keighley, West Yorkshire and links with 'political extremists' from Pakistan. Mr Bashir has strongly denied the accusations made by Ukip since his decision to quit. In a fresh blow to Ukip, it emerged Mr Richardson had made a series of damaging public remarks. The party secretary – who, ironically, was hired to stamp out negative media stories about Ukip – said: 'People talk about Ukip being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the United Kingdom and they deserve representation.' Ukip party secretary Matthew Richardson, hired to stamp out negative media stories about Ukip, said: 'People talk about Ukip being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the United Kingdom and they deserve representation' Mr Farage refused to condemn the extraordinary comments, which Mr Richardson has suggested was pub 'banter. Mr Farage told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'There were people in a pub having a drink. If you expect me to ban all Ukip officials from going into pubs, from laughing and smirking and joking, it's not going to happen.' Meanwhile, footage emerged from 2010 of Mr Richardson attacking the health service at events in the US. Speaking at the Young Americans Foundation conference in Washington he said: 'When I was younger a trillion was an astronomic number. Now when I look at our national deficits, and your national deficits, actually it is an economic number. 'A number I couldn't possible imagine when I was younger is now the amount of money that is owed by my country, and soon more than that by your country, to other countries, paying for wasteful socialist programmes. And of course at the heart of this, the Reichstag bunker of socialism is the National Health Service.' At the Conservative Political Action Conference in the same year he said: 'This socialist government wastes money like you can't imagine. They have started doing every wasteful scheme under the sun ... The biggest waste of money of course in the United Kingdom is the NHS, the National Health Service.' Mr Farage, who has advocated an insurance-funded model for the NHS in the past, insisted Ukip was committed to a health service that was free at the point of delivery. Amjad Bashir, left, with Ukip party leader Nigel Farage, right, before his defection to the Tories . But he said the service was struggling because of the 'massive increase' in the country's population. He called for measures to crack down on health tourism and said people studying for medical subjects should be exempt from tuition fees to reduce the NHS's reliance on migrant workers. He said: 'We want the NHS to be better run, we want it to be more efficient. We think it's ludicrous that middle management has grown by 48%, we think the fact that health tourism is costing GBP2 billion a year is wrong and the fact that one in five new nurses being taken on have to come from abroad says to us 'let's make sure there are no tuition fees for people who are taking medical degrees'. 'We want a National Health Service that is free at the point of delivery and funded through taxation. 'But the one thing nobody dares say is the reason we have an NHS crisis right now is because of a massive increase in the population in this country.' Amjad Bashir: 'I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Farage' I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true. David Cameron famously said that Ukip was a party of ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. Certainly, I have experienced racism in Ukip. I have been racially abused on social media by other Ukip members who ask offensive questions like: ‘Are you a Muslim?’ I was angry when I was the only Ukip politician who was cut out of a video of speeches at a party event. I complained that it was because of my ethnic minority background, but was fobbed off. Some of the antics of Ukip MEPs are appalling. They make childish remarks during debates and are abusive towards MEPs from other countries when there is no call for it. I was outraged when I heard Mr Farage talk of a ‘fifth column’ of immigrants in Britain. I have worked hard all my life, and when my father came to this country he worked his socks off to provide for his family. It is an insult for him to talk in this way. I joined Ukip because I wanted a referendum on the EU and wanted better controls on immigration. But now I have no doubt that Mr Cameron will deliver on this, so, in my view, Ukip has outlived its usefulness. Mr Farage wants to use Ukip as a means for getting power for himself, and that is not what the party was set up to achieve. He has created a popularist image for himself as the jolly chap at the bar with a pint in his hand, but the reality is different. He runs the party like a dictator, employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way. Ukip is guided more by dogma than common sense. Since I became an MEP, I have been amazed that Ukip often votes against Britain’s national interest in the European Parliament. For example, we were told to vote against EU money for flood relief schemes in the UK because the money had come from Brussels. I protested that this was ridiculous because much of the EU money was British in the first place, but I was ignored. And Ukip’s reaction on finding out that I was going to join the Conservatives sums up what is wrong with them. They made a crude attempt to smear me with false allegations of irregularities in the recruitment of Asian members in Bradford. There is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that I made the right decision. There is no escaping one simple fact: when Mr Cameron said: ‘If you go to bed with Nigel Farage on Election night, you will wake with Ed Miliband the next day,’ he was telling the truth.","Farage feels the heat after terrible day of headlines for his party .

"A blind man who had to leave his job when he could no longer see his computer has been told he is fit for work again - in a letter written in small print. Richard Alcock, 62, from Bury, Greater Manchester, took early retirement from his job as a local government clerk in a social services department because increased use of computers in his office meant he could no longer do his work. After 28 years' service in local government Mr Alcock, who has been registered blind after being diagnosed with congenital glaucoma before he was two, had to leave work and rely on benefits. 'Rotten trick': Mr Alcock, whose wife is also blind, had to wait until his carer could read the letter out to him . But earlier this month he passed a test set as part of the Government’s new welfare reforms to assess those who should or should not still remain off work and claim state handouts, and was told he should go back to work. The tests found he could lift one of his arms above his head, pick things up, stay in the same place for an hour, could control his bladder and 'stay conscious' whilst awake. As a result Mr Alcock, who reads using braille and uses a white cane to get around, was sent a letter saying he no longer qualifies for his monthly £350 Employment Support Allowance because he 'does not have limited capability for work.' He said: 'It’s a rotten trick. What was just . as upsetting was I had to wait for a support worker to come and read the . letter out to me - it seemed like the final insult. 'Admittedly two days after I got it read to me I had the braille version, but it’s not the point. The letter to Mr Alcock, whose wife Rachel, 64, is also blind, said: 'I understand that this decision may come as a shock to you, however I should explain that entitlement to employment and support allowance is not based on someone’s health or disability itself. Taken early retirement: Mr Alcock, from Bury, uses braille to read and a white stick to get around . 'It is based on what a person is capable of doing rather than assuming their health condition or disability automatically prevents them from being able to work.' Mr Alcock, who has not worked since he took early retirement from Birmingham City Council 12 years ago, said: 'I’ve been unemployed for this long so it’s going to be very difficult to go back to work now. Nobody wants to employ disabled people, and certainly not visually impaired people at that.' 'I understand the government wanting to get the bone idle back to work, but I worked hard in local government for the best part of 30 years despite my disability, and I didn’t even choose to leave my job in the first place. 'Technology moved on so quickly and I felt the workplace didn’t cater for the likes of me, so there was nothing I could do but take early retirement. 'I don’t know what I’ll do now. I have support workers who come twice a week and help me with paperwork and read things out that aren’t in braille and help with the cleaning and shopping - and I won’t be able to afford that without this money.' Mr Alcock, with his wife Rachel, 64, at home in Bury, says: 'What if they tell me to become a bricklayer?' The Work Capability Assessment lists a series of tasks which the recipient must say whether or not they can do them. A statement from a healthcare professional said: 'The healthcare professional discussed these descriptors with Mr Alcock at the assessment and it was confirmed that he does not have any problems with these activities and therefore these descriptors are not appropriate.' It went on: 'You can move unaided more than 200 metres on solid ground, including using a wheelchair. You can stay in one place standing for one hour without having to move away. You can raise at least one arm above head height. 'What happens if I walk down to the Jobcentre and they give me a job as a bricklayer?' - Richard Alcock, 62, who was registered blind 60 years ago and now has been told to go back to work . 'You can pick up and move objects such as an empty cardboard box or carton of liquid. You can use a computer keyboard or mouse and a pen or a pencil with at least one hand.' Mr Alcock said: 'You must score 15 points to be deemed unsuitable for work and I scored nine. It’s ridiculous. What am I going to do at my age? 'What happens if I walk down to the Jobcentre and they give me a job as a bricklayer? 'I’m going to appeal but if that’s unsuccessful, which it may very well be, my lifestyle is going to be drastically changed. It’s scary.' Mrs Alcock, a former bank telephonist, said: 'I think it’s a disgrace. He’s a 62-year-old blind man, for god’s sake. How can he just go back to work now? 'There’s young people out there who can’t get work, never mind people his age and with his condition. A DWP spokesman said: 'It is important that we don’t simply write people off. There is strong evidence that working can be beneficial for many people who have a health condition. 'But we also want to ensure that those who need it get the right support, which is why a decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken after consideration of all the supporting medical evidence provided by the claimant. 'Anyone can appeal against a decision. Before the appeal is heard we review all decisions, taking into account further information provided.'","Glaucoma meant Richard Alcock, 62, was registered blind at 18 months .

The 250-ton crane, rising from the ground at the hip NDSM site on the River Ij's banks, was saved despite the creation of the hotel being dismissed as 'technically impossible', according to its spokesman Edwin Kornmann Rudi. Mr Rudi said: 'But after years of preparation there was a point of no return. Nowhere else in the world is there something as unique, as big and high as this hotel.

"Aravindan Balakrishnan pictured today appearing at Southwark Crown Court to face 25 charges which include rape and indecent assault . A Maoist cult leader accused of sexually abusing three of his female followers for more than three decades has appeared in court today. Aravindan Balakrishnan, 74, faces four counts of rape and 19 charges of indecent assault against the three women. He is also accused of one count of cruelty to a person under 16 years and one count of false imprisonment. All the charges relate to the period between January 1980 and October 2013. Bespectacled Balakrishnan appeared at Southwark Crown Court sporting a receding grey mullet, and dressed in a blue coat and grey trousers and spoke only to confirm his identity. During the brief hearing, Judge Anthony Leonard set a provisional trial date of July 20. Known as 'Comrade Bala', Balakrishnan  was arrested in November 2013 after allegations emerged he had abused three women for more than 30 years at a house in Brixton. His wife Chanda Pattni, 67, was also arrested but released without charge in September after 10 months on bail. It was claimed a 69-year-old woman from Malaysia, a 57-year-old from Ireland and a 30-year-old Briton had been abused after joining Balakrishnan's extreme left wing cult. Police raided the Brixton property after one of the women reported her alleged ordeal to a charity. Tony Connell, prosecuting, said a plea and case management hearing would be held on March 4. He said: 'We have prepared 200 pages of witness statement and 1000 pages of evidence from the victims. 'It is likely there will be four contentious witnesses. These include the three victims, two who have undergone prolonged sexual abuse and one victim mentioned in count one and two of the indictment, who will face cross examination. 'Thousands and thousands of pages of documents were found in his house which takes time to go through. Any trial will last at least 5 weeks.' Adam Wiseman, defending, said this 25 count indictment needed a 'complex, detailed investigation'. The 74-year-old was accused of sexually abusing three of his female followers (one of which is pictured) for more than three decades . It was claimed a 69-year-old woman from Malaysia, a 57-year-old from Ireland and a 30-year-old Briton had been abused after joining Balakrishnan's extreme left wing cult . At a previous hearing on December 17 Balakrishnan was remanded on bail on condition that he continues to live at his address in Edmonton, north London, that he does not apply for any international travel documents or that he contact the three victims or two female witnesses. Mr Wiseman said: 'He has been on bail throughout and has complied with bail conditions.' Judge Leonard told Balakrishnan: 'You will return to court on March 4. 'I have extended your bail until that point.' The Brixton flat where the charges of rape and indecent assault were alleged to have taken place . A provisional trial date for Balakrishnan to faces four counts of rape and 19 charges of indecent assault, as well as one count of cruelty to a person under 16 years and one count of false imprisonment, has been set for July 20 . Described as a 'guru', Balakrishnan set up a communist squat, the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre, in Brixton in 1976 where the couple ran their group, the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought, holding lectures and film evenings. He had been kicked out of the Communist Party's national executive after his faction 'attempted to put themselves above the discipline of the party'. After raiding the house, police removed 55 bags of evidence and 12,500 exhibits, but admitted the 'complexity' of the case meant it would take a long time to investigate.

"Islamic extremists have hacked the websites of a primary school and a church and replaced their homepages with a hate message against the US and Israel. A group calling itself X-saad hijacked the sites of Sowerby Community Primary School and the Danish Church of Hull, both in Yorkshire, and replaced them with a sinister Islamic-State style page. Police have launched an investigation into the hacks that were believed to have taken place late last night. The sinister message that appeared on the sites of Sowerby Primary School and the Danish Church of Hull . The message that appeared on both websites included a picture of the US and Israeli flag  with a red cross through it. It is on a black background, similar to an ISIS flag, with English writing in red and Arabic script in white. The statement reads: 'We Hackers We defend our religion, we do not forget we are without limits we do not believe in the laws' 'Islam is not a terrorist religion but Islam is the religion of coexistence and mercy and love, the real terrorists are Israel and america' Sowerby Community Primary School governor Charles Allen said: 'As a Community Governor I have been asked by Jean Yendall, Head Teacher, to post the following to inform and reassure parents. 'The school is aware the website has been hacked and will get the message taken down as soon as possible. 'The school has been in dialogue with North Yorkshire Police. There is no need for anyone to contact the police any further. 'The school and police believe it is perfectly safe to send your child / children to school today.' Sowerby Community Primary School, near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, was targeted by Islamic hackers overnight . Torben Jorgenson, pastor at the Danish Church in Hull (pictured above) was left shocked and angry after being alerted to the message . The school near Thirsk, North Yorkshire has  taken the message down from its website and replaced with one saying it was 'currently down for maintenance'. Torben Jorgenson, pastor at the Danish Church in Hull was left shocked and angry after being alerted to the message. 'It is like a thief coming into your home when they are not invited,' he said. 'I am angry. We do not want our website to be used to promote this radical and political message. Our website is a friendly one and is used to post information about our social and cultural events. 'It is very shocking.' The church is currently liaising with their websites creator to have the message removed. The same group are also believed to be responsible for hacking a church website in Australia. A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police confirmed they were investigating and said the hack of the school's website and believed a number of sites had fallen victim to the virus. The force wrote on Twitter last night: 'We are aware that a primary school near Thirsk has had its website hacked. Officers are working with staff to establish the circumstances.' Inspector Chris Galley, of North Yorkshire Police, said today: 'We believe that the Sowerby Primary School website had unauthorised content posted by a virus which seeks out servers with weak security software. 'Other organisations and businesses both locally, nationally and internationally have had their websites compromised in a similar manner in recent months and there is no suggestion that Sowerby Primary School was deliberately targeted in any way. 'The school have now removed their website and enquiries to establish the origin of the content are ongoing. 'It is important that all organisations with a public facing website ensure that they have sound security software in place to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring.' Sowerby Primary School sent out a message reassuring parents last night that this was not a specifically targeted threat and that there was no risk to children attending school. Both governors and police officers attended the school this morning as a reassurance to families. Pete Dwyer, North Yorkshire's Corporate Director of the Children and Young People's Service said: 'We have been working closely with the police on this matter. Our schools place great importance on website security but we understand that despite all best efforts public and corporate websites can be compromised in this way from time to time. 'We are reassured by the police in this case that this was a random breach and that children are not at any risk.' However, one mother decided to keep her children off school today after being left frightened by the hack. 'I only briefly looked at the website at my friend's house over the road but as soon as I saw the flag at the top I immediately thought it was some terror related thing,' said the 31-year-old parent, who declined to be named. 'I didn't read the message. 'I think my main fear was of the unknown, you didn't know what it was and you wanted to be sure to be safe. 'I didn't know if it was a prank and I didn't know if it was a terror thing.' Last week Muslim extremists hacked into the Bristol bus timetable after mistaking it for a major international travel website for Europe and the United States. On this occasion bus and train timetables were replaced with Arabic text and the message: 'Hacked by Darkshadow'.

"After watching his American Football team lose on New Years' Eve, a loyal fan's misery was compounded when he fell asleep on the taxi ride home and woke up to a $908 bill. Joseph Martin had been drinking all day in preparation for the Peach Bowl final between his beloved University of Mississippi and Texas Christian University in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended one after-party with his sister before jumping in an Uber taxi with some friends thinking they were making an eight mile journey to another. Joseph woke up over an hour later to discover they were in Alabama, en route to his home in Mississippi -- over 300 miles away. He claims to have 'crossed the state line twice' and was dropped off at the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Peachtree Street in Atlanta. Big game: Joseph was watching Ole Miss play Texas Christian University in the Peach Bowl final in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta . Bad trip: Joseph Martin's cousin tweeted a picture of $908 being removed from Joseph Martin's account after the fateful New Years' Eve journey . In an interview with Fox Sports, he said: 'I started with mimosas that morning, and we really didn't stop all day. I was with my sister Hannah all day, and she went to a NYE party with me and a few friends. 'When I left the party, me and a few other people took my sister back to the hotel because she had a flight the next day. I walked my sister up to the room and came back to the Uber. 'Once I got back, I asked the other members of the car what the address of the after party was that we were supposed to be going to. They said they had already given it to the driver and he confirmed. 'I didn't come out of the party trashed and put my Mississippi address in the system and get a ride home. It was one of the other members of the car that talked to the driver. I assumed they knew the address of the party, which was only about eight to ten miles away. 'I may have dozed off for a bit. My phone woke me up and I didn't realize we had been driving for about an hour and a half. The other three people in the car were also asleep. 'I woke one of them up and asked where we were going and what address she gave the driver. She told me and the driver the address and when he looked at his phone they didn't match up, obviously.' Insult to injury: Joseph watched Ole Miss (pictured) lose in the Peach Bowl final before his calamitous taxi ride . Victory: His family left after the eventual winners, Texas Christian University (pictured) scored after half-time . Crossed wires: Joseph Martin accidentally entered his home address in Mississipi when entering the taxi in Atlanta, Georgia -- over 300 miles away . Rumours of his New Years' nightmare began to circulate on social media, before his cousin uploaded 'proof' of his disastrous journey. He later uploaded another picture of the $908  leaving Joseph's account on January 2. The fee was so large because of the company's 'surge pricing', triggered by the post-game crowds and the fact he had allegedly entered his home address in Mississippi. Uber allows users to locate its nearby taxi drivers and agree fares on their smartphones. It claims to have worked with Joseph to reduce the overall price. He has reportedly said the company have been very helpful since the incident and wouldn't hesitate to use their service again.","Joseph Martin had been watching the Peach Bowl final in Atlanta, Georgia .

"A Florida woman who while 'on meth' last week believed that she and her boyfriend were trapped in unlocked closet filled with feces has a sordid arrest history. Amber Campbell, 25, and John Arwood, 31, were freed - and then arrested last Tuesday after calling 911 for help, only to be told by police they could have just opened the door themselves. Campbell has had run-ins with the law before and two years ago nearly escaped arrest by running into the woods. Scroll down for video . Criminal history: Amber Campbell, 25, is pictured in her mug shot from last Tuesday (left) and in a mug shot from 2013 (right)  when she led cops into a chase through the woods after escaping a mental health facility . Trapped: Amber Campbell believed she was locked inside of the closet with her boyfriend John Arwood, 31, and the pair called police to free them after two days . The Orlando Sentinel reports that Campbell escaped from a mental health facility on April, 30, 2013 and when authorities finally captured her she fooled police so that she could slip out of her handcuffs and run into the woods. A deputy chased her by foot into the wooded area and she allegedly attacked him several times. Campbell, 23 at the time, was shocked with a stun gun and then sentenced three years of probation. When police initially found Campbell she and a female friend were walking along a country road, a mile south of where she crashed her brother's car after escaping the mental health facility. When police asked Campbell her name she provided a false identity and birthday and claimed she was not the driver of the decimated vehicle. She was cuffed and put into a police car where she complained she couldn't breathe. Police took pity on her and lowered the car windows and loosened her cuffs a bit and that's when she managed to escape. She ran from the car, jumped a barbed wire fence, and scampered off into the woods with police running behind her. She then allegedly punched a deputy who in response, shocked her two to three times with a stun gun. Campbell was charged with escape, aggravated battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting an officer with violence and giving a false name upon being arrested, reports The Orlando Sentinel. She was sentenced to three years probation which she violated after last week's arrest. Campbell, now 25, and her boyfriend didn't try to escape police last Tuesday but instead begged for their help. The two allegedly believed they were locked inside of a janitor's closet and waited two days to seek help. The strange incident occurred at the Marine and Environmental Science Center at Daytona State College. Another mug shot: This undated mug shot shows Campbell after another brush with the law . Locked in: Amber Campbell, 25, and John Arwood, 31, were freed - and then arrested last Tuesday after calling 911 for help, only to be told by police they could have just opened the door themselves . Inside the closet, police said they found feces and copper scouring pads used to smoke meth and crack cocaine. Police said they smelled meth in the closet. Campbell and Arwood claim to have been chased into the closet on Sunday. It is not known what they were doing at the facility. The campus was closed for the holidays. It is also not clear why the pair waited until Tuesday to seek help. However Arwood called 911 and told police they were trapped. Police used his cell phone to trace the location and arrived to let the two out. But an officer, trying to understand what had happened, went into the closet and shut the door. The door did not lock. Arwood and Campbell were charged with trespassing. No drugs were found. Campbell was also charged with violating her probation, stemming from a 2013 arrest. Arwood has a colorful criminal history. He has been to jail five times, with his first stint in 2000. His offenses range from armed burglary, possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana and fleeing law enforcement.","Amber Campbell, 25, and John Arwood, 31, were freed from and unlocked janitor's closet and then arrested last Tuesday after calling 911 for help .

"Police in Florida say a young father decided to combine baby sitting duties with criminal activity when he brought his 5-month-old son to an armed home invasion. Corey Jame Earl Mathews, 22, from St Petersburg, was arrested Monday while allegedly acting as a lookout during a burglary. According to investigators, the recently married father of one was holding his baby son in a car carrier while his friend was trying to break into a house in the 300 block of Ninth Avenue North just before 6pm. Not father of the year: Corey Jame Earl Mathews, 22, from St Petersburg, Florida, was arrested Monday while allegedly acting as a lookout with his infant son (right) in tow . Multitasking: Police say Mathews pulled a knife on the owner of the home he and his accomplice were trying to burglarize and threatened to kill him, all the while holding his baby son . Police say when Mathews spotted the homeowner approach, he alerted his accomplice. The other suspect fled, and the homeowner called 911 as he followed Mathews. The 22-year-old man then put down his son and pulled out a knife, allegedly threatening to kill the victim if he kept following him. The man backed away, allowing Mathews to flee with his child, reported St Petersburg Tribune. He was arrested a short time later still carrying the knife. Mathews was held Tuesday on $15,000 bond on burglary and other charges, including violating his probation for battery on a law enforcement officer.

In December 2012, he was arrested on a slew of charges, including resisting an officer with violence, battery on an officer, and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. In January and February of 2013, Mathews landed behind bars on two separate occasions for trespassing and resisting an officer.","Police in Florida say Corey Mathews pulled a knife on a man, all the while holding his baby son in a car carrier .

"The only son of Marion Barry, a former Washington mayor who once left office in disgrace after being caught smoking crack cocaine, is seeking his late father's seat on the D.C. Council. Marion Christopher Barry, 34, picked up nominating petitions Monday at the District of Columbia Board of Elections. His father suffered a fatal cardiac arrest last November aged 78. The son, who currently runs a small construction company, becomes one of 23 candidates bidding to make the ballot for an April special election for the council seat. Keeping it in the family: Christopher Barry (right), the only son of Marion Barry (left), is seeking his late father's seat on the D.C. Council . The elder Barry represented Ward 8 - the poorest section of the nation's capital - for the last ten years of his life. He remained beloved by many though his citywide popularity never fully recovered after 1990 when he was videotaped in an FBI sting taking drags from a crack pipe and arrested on drug charges. His son, who goes by the name Christopher, has had his own run-ins with the law. The younger Barry has been arrested three times on drug and traffic charges, most recently last July, when he was jailed after he was caught driving on a revoked license. He pleaded guilty to that charge in December and is currently serving nine months' probation and undergoing drug and alcohol treatment. 'That's definitely all behind me. Like most young people, I've gone through my phases and experimented in drugs. 'I paid a great price for that and I've learned from my mistakes,' Barry said.

"She's the glamorous daytime TV presenter with a serious passion for fashion. And now, Lorraine Kelly has channeled her styling expertise into designing her own range. Lorraine’s first collection for JD Williams is targeted at the 50-plus female and comes on the back of research by the brand that revealed just 20 per cent of mature women feel well catered for on the high street. Scroll down for video . Lorraine Kelly has unveiled her first-ever clothing range with JD Williams that she says she has designed for 'fifty plus women who are in their prime and want to look fashionable' Speaking about her new range, which she models herself, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'Designing a fashion collection has always been a dream, and I am delighted to have achieved that with JD Williams. 'I have been involved every step along the way and seeing the final outcome has been incredibly exciting. The best part will be seeing women - like me - dressed in products from my line in the New Year, and fingers crossed feeling fabulous inside and out.' The 55-year-old Glaswegian cites herself as the inspiration behind the collection - even naming one of the pieces after herself. The TV presenter often chats women's fashion and style on air and now she has channeled her styling expertise into designing her own fashion range . Lorraine has been the face of the brand for a year and now she's designed her own collection of dresses, jeans and chic coats . 'It was really about what I want to wear as well as a lot of feedback from viewers over the years. I wanted classy but comfortable clothes that look stylish and are also flattering,' she said. Lorraine, who served as the face of JD Williams before designing the range for the brand, believes that there's a big untapped market of 50-plus women who are 'in their prime and want to look fashionable'. She said: 'Women of 50-plus look better than ever and as a 55-year-old, I know that I want to look chic and on trend but also have the comfort factor.' Lorraine's first design collection comes on the back of research by the brand revealing just 20% of mature women feel well catered for on the high street . One of Lorraine's favourite pieces is this jumpsuit, which she says was designed to either be worn around the house or with heels and a belt for a night on the town . The colourful range is available in sizes 10 to 32, with prices ranging from £29 for an embellished top to £75 for a Geo Print Jacquard Red Coat . Lorraine spent hours in the design studio curating chic Burberry-esque raincoats and Issa-esque wrap dresses, as well as a jumpsuit that you could 'wear around the house' or team with 'sassy high heels  on a night out'. Speaking about her personal sense of style, she said: 'My own style is pretty minimalist to be honest. I like clean lines, no fuss and a good cut.' 'My style icon would be Helen Mirren; she isn't afraid to experiment. I loved her floor length D&G dress teamed with a black leather biker jacket on the red carpet. She looks comfortable in her own skin. She wears the clothes - it is never the other way around. 'I think Julianne Moore always looks effortlessly elegant. I also admire Meryl Streep and I think Ruth Langsford from Loose Women never puts a foot wrong,' she added. The 55-year-old Glaswegian cites herself as the inspiration behind the collection and each of the pieces are items she would want to see in her own wardrobe .

"Storms of up to 90mph are set to batter the country by the weekend. Winds as powerful as those which caused misery last winter will sweep in tomorrow, forecasters have warned. The Met Office issued official weather warnings for northern England and Scotland, saying there may be power cuts, transport chaos and damage to homes and buildings. The most powerful winds of 80 to 90mph will be seen in Scotland on Friday and Saturday, as the centres of two consecutive storms pass by the northern coast. In northern parts of England and Wales winds could reach 70mph, with gales of 50mph seen in the South. Scroll down for video . Here they come: Two storms are set to hit the north of the UK in quick succession on Friday and Saturday because of a strong jet stream, currently travelling at a speed of around 250mph moving across the Atlantic Ocean. It will bring winds of up to 90mph in northern Scotland . Eerie skyline: Fast-moving storm clouds over Canary Wharf in east London today. Winds of up to 90mph are expected to hit Britain . Sussex: After a dull rainy day, a dog walker enjoys the view from The Ladies Parlour as the sun sets over Hastings Castle and Beachy Head . The Met Office alert said: ‘The public should be aware of potential for disruption to transport and power supplies and the possibility of structural damage. Large waves may also lead to dangerous conditions along some coasts.’ At the same time, temperatures will be remarkably mild for this time of year, reaching 15C (59F) in London – compared with the average January temperature of 6.9C (44.4F). Forecasters said the ferocious weather is being caused by an exceptionally strong jet stream triggered by cold conditions in the US. Frank Saunders, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: ‘The jet stream effectively fuels low pressure systems moving across the Atlantic, causing them to deepen rapidly as they pass to the north of the UK. ‘This will bring some very strong winds across the UK, but they will most likely be strongest in northern Scotland.’ Mark Wilson of the Met Office said wind speeds would be similar to those seen in the fierce storms towards the end of 2013, when tens of thousands of homes were left without power, trees were uprooted, trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the UK. But while the worst weather then was seen in southern England, this time rural parts of Scotland will bear the brunt, Mr Wilson added. Yellow weather warnings for the strong gales have been issued for much of Scotland on Friday (left), when the first storm is due to hit, and for a wider area of the north and central England when the second jetstream is forecast to hit the country on Saturday (right) Severe weather warnings have been issued for both Friday and Saturday. These are currently yellow - be prepared - warnings, but Mr Saunders said these could be changed as the storm is tracked. Forecasters have not issued warnings for rain on Thursday and Friday, with heavy rain in the South East on Wednesday expected to end by Thursday. The storms will also hit at a time when the UK is seeing above average temperatures for this time of year - double what is normal in some areas. In the North the mercury is expected to reach 10C on Friday and between 12C and 13C on Saturday. This is more than double the average of 5.7C for this time in the region. In London, Friday could see 'unseasonably warm' temperatures recorded as the mercury is expected to reach 15C. Again, this is double the average of 7C expected at this time of year. However forecasters said it will not feel warm because of the strong winds battering much of the UK. The deep and strong jet stream is currently moving towards the UK, with current winds of up to 250mph (depicted by the white areas to left) The first storm will hit the north of the UK on Friday and will be followed by a successor that will be even more wide ranging in the north . The storms are similar to those experienced last winter in December and January, when high winds and downpours caused devastation in the South. Tens of thousands of homes were left without power, trees were uprooted, trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the UK. Parts of the Somerset Levels were left submerged for weeks after the heavy downpours. Bethany Freeman, 17, died when the tree came down on a caravan as she slept in Kent. And 14-year-old Dylan Atkins was swept out to sea when he played near waves in Newhaven, East Sussex. However forecasters said this year's storms are different because they will be more focused on the North of England. This part of the country is more used to coping with extremes of weather and less heavily populated. There is also expected to be considerably less rain, which caused havoc in the South during last winter. Wintry weather is forecast to start on Thursday evening with strong winds hitting Scotland and the North West on Friday morning. This is expected to move east on Friday afternoon. But there will be little respite as by Saturday afternoon a second system will move in, bringing stronger winds to a wider area of the north. Laura Young, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'These are being caused by very deep low pressure back to back in some areas. 'It will be more widespread than anything we've seen so far this winter. 'The cold weather in America is having an impact on the jet stream and is strengthening it. At the moment the jet stream is moving at about 230mph.' Yellow weather warnings are in place for the whole of Scotland and much of the north of the UK for Thursday and Friday. The double storm warning comes as it was revealed that last year was the hottest ever for the UK, with an average temperature of 9.9C. The previous record, set in 2006, saw an average temperature of 9.7C. The 2014 record means that eight of the UK's top ten warmest years have happened since 2002. Last year also became the fourth wettest year ever on record.","Two storms set to hit north of the UK on Friday and Saturday bringing rain and gales of up to 90mph in Scotland .

"Mario Balotelli would need only seven goals per season for Liverpool to see the financial benefit of his £16million recruitment from AC Milan. Whether or not the statistical boffins at John W Henry’s Fenway Sports Group have made such calculations remains unknown but FSG have famously applied ‘Moneyball’ techniques to player recruitment at Anfield in the past and there is sure to have been some economic reckoning around Balotelli. The mathematics that say he needs seven goals per season to repay the investment in him is simple enough, and is based on him being given a three-year contract on wages of around £5million per year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the biggest, badest and best moments of Mario Balotelli . Done deal? Mario Balotelli is expected to complete a £16million move to Liverpool this summer . Target: Balotelli would need to score seven Premier League goals a season to payback his £31million outlay . Liverpool have already agreed in principle a £16m transfer fee for the 24-year-old forward, who is capable of lighting up the pitch every bit as lighting up his bathroom with a fireworks-related house fire. A three-year deal at £5m wages per year plus a £16m fee would mean a £31m outlay by Liverpool for the contract and wages. How do goals repay that? Eyes on the prize: Balotelli (right) is expected to sign a three-year deal worth £5million per year in wages . Roughly speaking, each goal in the Premier League is worth one point, on average. In fact, it’s not so roughly speaking at all; there is an extremely close relationship between goals scored and points won, across the division as a whole. Last season, for example, there were 1,052 goals scored in the Premier League, and the 20 clubs combined won 1,062 points. Each goal, essentially, on average, is worth a point. The amount of points a club wins directly affect where they finish in the league, and hence also affect the amount of prize money they win from the Premier League. Predator: Balotelli has scored 26 goals in 43 Milan league games since joining the club in January last year . To simplify, more goals equals more points equals more prize money. The total amount of Premier League prize money split between the 20 clubs last season was £1.563billion, which equates to £1,485,741 per goal, or £1.5m per goal, give or take. An outlay of £31m on Mario Balotelli over three seasons would therefore require 20.66 goals over three years at £1.5m each to cover the cost of hiring him. That’s seven per season, in the Premier League. On point: Balotelli (right) scored 20 goals in 54 Premier League games at Manchester City . Any goals he scored in any other competition would be a bonus. Any fee he attracted should he be sold later would be a bonus. Any income Liverpool accrue from selling Balotelli shirts or merchandise would be a bonus. Of course there is the possibility that Balotelli will arrive on Merseyside and fail to fire. If he scored fewer than his seven goals per year he would arguably be an economic flop. But he has scored 26 goals in 43 Milan league games since joining in January last year, and 20 in 54 Premier League games for Manchester City before that. Problematic though he may be, it’s likely that an American economist somewhere in FSG has looked at the numbers and realised Balotelli is worth the punt, financially as well as in a sporting sense. Our first Fantasy Football £1,000 weekly winner is revealed (he's an Exeter fan who got lucky with two Hull defenders)... and here's his team .","Mario Balotelli is expected to complete a £16million move to Liverpool .

"A cop who was injured following a shootout in the Bronx seems to still resent New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's recent support for the city's protesters. NYPD officer Andrew Dossi was visited by Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bill Bratton at St. Barnabas Hospital Monday night after he and his partner were shot by robbers shortly at a grocery store after their shift ended Monday, and according to his father, the Mayor was not a welcome site. 'He wasn’t too happy about the Mayor’s visit,' said Joe Dossi. This as the alleged gunman responsible for the attack has been taken into custody. Scroll down for video . Injured: NYPD officer Andrew Dossi (above) was visited by Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bill Bratton at St. Barnabas Hospital Monday night after he and his partner were shot by robbers . Not welcome: 'He wasn’t too happy about the Mayor’s visit,' said Joe Dossi, the officer's father, about Mayor Bill de Blasio (above) coming by the hospital . 'He deals with some crappy people every day and getting no support (from Mayor de Blasio), come on,' added the elder Dossi while speaking with the New York Post. 'These are the guys in the trenches dealing with anything and everything.' This is reference to Mayor de Blasio's comments in the wake of a grand jury's decision not to indict the cop that killed Staten Island resident Eric Garner after placing the man in a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes that he worries for his son Dante, who is half-black, and how his interactions with the police will go as the young man grows up. The elder Dossi also said he told Mayor de Blasio that men like his son were 'laying theit lives on the line' when he came into the hospital room Monday night. The man also said he liked Commissioner Bratton, who he saw  as 'a real legitimate guy.' Officer Dorsi, an Iraq veteran, was shot in the back and the arm. The shot to his back barely missed his spine, though doctors believe he will make a full recovery. 'I just hope that doesn’t affect his career,' said his father. 'He’s Army Airborne. He can’t jump out of airplanes with a messed-up arm.' Proudly serving: Dossi (left), an Iraq vet, was shot in the arm and back but is expected to make a full recovery . Putting it together: Three men have been taken into custody for questioning following the shooting (above), and one is believed to be the alleged gunman .

"A federal judge sentenced former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell to two years in prison on Tuesday, in a case that gripped the state and provided a cautionary tale for corrupt politicians across the United States. Two years ago McDonnell was discussed as a possible presidential contender. Now he's headed behind bars for selling the influence of his office to the CEO of a dietary supplements company. 'I stand before you as a heartbroken and humbled man,' the former governor told U.S. District Judge James Spencer before he pronounced sentence. 'I can't fathom any deeper humiliation for me and my family.' McDonnell will have to report to prison by 2 p.m. on Feb. 9 – unless his lawyers can persuade the court to let him remain free while they appeal the jury verdicts. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell hung his head outside a federal court building after he was sentenced for selling the influence of his office to the CEO of a dietary supplements company . A jury in September found McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, guilty of accepting more than $165,000 in loans and gifts, including a Rolex watch and designer clothing, in exchange for promoting the donor's products . Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell (center) has been cast by some family members as the villain who took some gifts from a businessman without telling her husband in the midst of a troubled marriage . Prosecutors had recommended a prison term of at least 10 years for McDonnell, who was convicted of 11 public corruption counts. Spencer quickly revised the report on federal sentencing guidelines for McDonnell down to a range of 6.5 to 8 years. He then chose to lower the boom more gently still, opting for a 24-month sentence followed by two more years of supervised release. Defense attorneys asked Spencer to order three years of community service, arguing that the federal investigation that destroyed his career and exposed details of his rocky marriage and shaky finances was punishment enough. If McDonnell had received a sentence of ten years or longer, he could have faced time in a penitentiary that viewers of the show 'Lockup' would recognize. But his shorter term and the nonviolent nature of his crime virtually guarantees that he will serve his two years in a 'Club Fed'-style minimum security facility. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has broad discretion, although it usually factors geography into the equation to place inmates as near to their home as available bed space will allow. Virginia is home to two minimum-security federal prisons. Federal Correctional Institution Petersburg is in Hopewell, Virginia – only 25 miles south of Richmond, where McDonnell was tried. U.S. Prison Lee in Pennington Gap is 300 miles to the southwest in the Appalachian mountains. Both places are light on prison guards and host inmates who have greater freedom and more privileges than violent offenders housed elsewhere. The BOP's website describes 'minimum security institutions, also known as Federal Prison Camps,' as institutions that 'have dormitory housing, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and limited or no perimeter fencing.' 'These institutions are work- and program-oriented,' the agency says. 'A number of BOP institutions have a small, minimum security camp adjacent to the main facility. These camps, often referred to as Satellite Prison Camps, provide inmate labor to the main institution and to off-site work programs.' CLUB FED: Federal Correctional Institution Petersburg is in Hopewell, Virginia, just  25 miles from the courtroom where McDonnell was sentenced . Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, center, hugs two of his daughters Cailin Young, left, and Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky, right, after speaking outside federal court in Richmond, Va., on Tuesday, Jan. 6 . Pictured here smiling with his daughter Jeanine at an earlier hearing. Jeanine famously wrote to the court blaming her mother for the charges leveled against her father and pleaded for a softer sentence . McDonnell's friends and supporters packed the courthouse before 10 a.m. sentencing hearing on Tuesday. Supporters included former NFL standout Bruce Smith and several state lawmakers. McDonnell's family members – including wife Maureen, also convicted in the scheme – were in attendance as well. She arrived with her two sons, Bobby and Sean. More than 400 people had written letters asking the judge to spare McDonnell from prison, among them former Democratic Gov. and current U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, co-workers, relatives and neighbors. Several, including two of the McDonnells' daughters, placed much of the blame with Bob McDonnell's wife. Daughter Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky wrote in a letter to the court: 'My mom ... has always been concerned about getting discounts or freebees [sic]. 'She hid her coordination with people for free or discounted things or services and she didn't communicate with my dad because she knew he would not approve. ... The testimony about my mom ... unfortunately, was the reality.' Zubowsky added that she believed her mother suffers from mental illness, and that her father planned to address her health after leaving office last January. Several charities had offered McDonnell volunteer positions, anticipating he might escape prison in favor of a community-service sentence. Those included religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's Operation Blessing, which had jobs managing a hunger relief program in Appalachia and another working at an orphanage and fish farm in Haiti. BROAD SUPPORT: McDonnell's cheering section Tuesday included retired NFL Hall of Fame football player Bruce Smith, who answered questions as he arrives for the sentencing hearing . A jury in September found McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, guilty of accepting more than $165,000 but less than $177,000 in loans and gifts – including a Rolex watch and designer clothing – in exchange for promoting a nutritional supplement marketed as a miracle cure by Star Scientific Inc. Federal Judge James Spencer will decide McDonnell's fate on Tuesday . The company's former CEO, Jonnie Williams, testified under immunity as the prosecution's star witness. Judge Spencer ruled Tuesday for the purpose of sentencing that the original value of the bribes was overstated, placing the value in the range of $97,000 to $121,000. And in a second silver lining for McDonnell, he dismissed one criminal count of obstruction of justice. McDonnell testified in his own defense during the six-week trial, acknowledging he accepted Williams' largesse but claiming he did nothing for him in return other than extend routine political courtesies. Maureen McDonnell, who did not testify, will be sentenced Feb. 20 on eight counts. The case prompted the General Assembly to tighten state ethics laws and some Virginia elected officials have voluntarily limited the value of gifts they will accept. Jonnie Williams testified under an immunity deal in the McDonnell case, admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his 'miracle cure' products . PINS AND NEEDLES: McDonnell could have gone to prison for ten years . Former Virginia first lady, Maureen McDonnell (right), shown in August, will be sentenced for her role in the scandal next month . McDonnell, 60, was once considered a possible running mate for Mitt Romney and inspired some talk of a 2016 presidential run of his own. He delivered the 2010 Republican response to the State of the Union Address and became chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2011. He was indicted 10 days after leaving the office once held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. Former Virginia governor and current US Senator Tim Kaine is among McDonnell's supporters who argue he should be spared prison in favor of a lengthy community-service sentence . At trial, the McDonnells' defense strategy depended in large part on convincing the jury that their marriage was so strained they could not have conspired to squeeze bribes out of Williams. They arrived at and left the courthouse separately every day and rarely even glanced at each other as they sat separated by lawyers at the defense table. McDonnell and other witnesses testified about the first lady's erratic behavior, suggesting she was largely responsible for the cozy relationship that developed between the couple and Williams. They said she was prone to such angry outbursts that the Executive Mansion staff threatened a mass resignation. One acknowledged calling Maureen McDonnell 'a nutbag.' Prosecutors countered the broken marriage defense by showing the jury photos of the McDonnells holding hands as recently as at pretrial hearings. Later, in their sentencing recommendation to Spencer, prosecutors sought to turn the strategy against McDonnell by saying he has blamed others for his own misdeeds. Defense attorneys also claimed Maureen McDonnell developed a 'crush' on Williams, and several witnesses described her relationship with the wealthy vitamin executive as inappropriate and flirtatious. But nobody suggested the relationship was physical, and Williams testified that his dealings with the McDonnells were all business.","Prosecutors had asked for a 10-year prison term while McDonnell's lawyers are arguing for a lengthy community-service sentence .

"Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, said offenders are walking away with just a caution . Drug dealers who sell cannabis outside school gates are escaping with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, the Magistrates’ Association warned last night. Other serious offenders who are being let off with a caution or fine include serial burglars, muggers and even rapists. Instead of being hauled before a court, they walk away with a caution, fixed penalty notice or so-called community resolution. Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, said the revelations would lead the public to wonder if the justice system was ‘broken’. In evidence to MPs, he said magistrates believed that between 30 and 35 per cent of out-of-court disposals were being administered ‘inappropriately’. They fear police officers are looking to settle cases ‘quickly’ – but with no regard to trying to change a criminal’s ways. He gave the disturbing example of drug pushers being given only a cannabis warning, which was supposed to be for people caught with a small amount of the Class B substance. Recent studies have warned the drug can inflict enormous harm on young minds – with teenagers who smoke it at much greater risk of addiction and psychosis than adults. Mr Monkhouse said: ‘It is right somebody picked up on the street with a spliff should be given a cannabis warning, but should somebody caught selling drugs outside a school? Because they are.’ A cannabis warning does not even constitute a formal criminal record. Police had previously insisted drug users – especially those stood close to schools - would not be eligible for a cannabis warning. Guidance drawn up by chief constables states the sanction ‘does not apply to offences of possession with intent to supply cannabis or any other supply offence.’ Appearing before the home affairs select committee, Mr Monkhouse went on: ‘When you start seeing people being cautioned for multiple robberies, multiple burglaries, you start to think, is not there something going wrong here? He said  drug dealers were only being given a cannabis warning, which was supposed to be for people caught with a small amount of the Class B substance . ‘That is when the public start to think, Is this system broken?’ Mr Monkhouse said another example was rape, which would make people think ‘how on earth is that given an out-of-court disposal’?’ Since 2010, at least 90 rapists have been punished with a caution, even though the offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Mr Monkhouse said that, in some cases, a crime which is reported as a rape is downgraded by the police until it becomes a sexual assault or other lesser offence. Officers then consider it more suitable for a slap-on-the-wrist sanction. Police had previously insisted drug users, especially those stood close to schools, would not be eligible for a cannabis warning . He said there are a number of reasons why cautions are being given out when a case should be brought before magistrates, at the very least. He told MPs: ‘There has been an issue with a target culture and an issue with the fact out-of-court disposals are covered by guidance rather than statutory provision. There are 43 chief constables who will all interpret it in a different way to suit their own areas.’ He added that some police saw the punishment as a way of dealing with an offence ‘quickly, never mind stopping the offender’s behaviour’. In total over the past four years, police have issued almost 15,000 cautions for offences that would typically result in jail – including 2,279 for sexual assault, 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary. In 1971, only 6 per cent of offenders were given a caution, which carries no sanction except a reprimand. The figure reached 20 per cent by last year, though this was down from 31 per cent in 2007. There were 181,000 cautions issued last year which meant the offender avoided being hauled before the courts – including 29,560 handed out to criminals by the Metropolitan Police. A quarter of offences of violence againt the person are dealt with by a caution, along with 17.4 per of sex attacks, 20 per cent of thieves and almost 40 per cent of those guilty of criminal damage and arson. Surrey Chief Constable Lynne Owens, who speaks for the police service on out of court disposals, insisted they had a valuable role to play when used properly. She told the MPs that, since 2007, the percentage of all crimes solved which were dealt with in this way had fallen from 10 per cent to 4.8 per cent.","Magistrates' Association chairman said  offenders are being 'let off lightly'

"Breaking the law in old age may be a sign of dementia, doctors warn. Criminal activites including theft, traffic violations, sexual advances, trespassing, and public urination, are common signs of the disease, especially in older adults who are first-time offenders. Older adults whose personality appears to have changed or who engage in criminal behaviours might be doing so because their brain is becoming damaged by dementia. Violence is one of the first symptoms of a little known type of dementia, but this condition is not often recognised by health providers or the authorities, researchers said. Doctors warn criminal behaviour including theft, traffic violations, sexual advances, trespassing, and public urination in older people could be a sign of a rare type of dementia . Ad a result, family and friends who notice a relative who is acting outside of the norm should seek a medical evaluation as they may have a degenerative brain disease underlying their behaviour. The U.S. researchers reviewed the medical records of 2,397 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia between 1999 and 2012. They scanned patient notes for entries about criminal behaviour using keywords like 'arrest,' 'Driving Under the Influence (DUI),' 'shoplift' and 'violence' and uncovered 204 patients, or 8.5 per cent, who qualified. The researchers concluded their behaviours were more often an early sign of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). This is a rare type of dementia which can sometimes cause inappropriate behaviour in social situations, . Frontotemporal dementia is similar to Alzheimer's disease in that it is caused by a build up of abnormal proteins in the brain, leading to a progressive loss of brain cells, and the affected areas functioning less well and shrinking. But it affects the frontal lobes of the brain, behind the forehead – which regulate our ability to plan and organise, and are important in regulating our behaviour. It also affects the temporal lobes on either side of the brain, which organise memory and language. This type of dementia causes slowly progressive problems with language, thinking, emotions and behaviour, and can profoundly alter a person's character and social conduct. It was also more often an early sign of another type of dementia called 'primary progressive aphasia' (PPA), a type of language-deteriorating dementia, than of Alzheimer's. Of the 'criminal' group of 204 patients, 64 had frontotemporal dementia, 24 had primary progressive aphasia, 42 had Alzheimer's, and the rest had various other forms of dementia. Patients with frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia tended to be younger, averaging 59 to 63 years old. This is compared to Alzheimer's patients, who were an average age of 71 when their doctors made notes about criminal behaviours. Researchers analysed the medical records of patients with dementia between 1992 and 2012 and found many of the patients who had engaged in criminal behaviour had frontotemporal dementia. Violence is a common sign of this type of degenerative disease . Frontotemporal dementia is a rare type of dementia caused by a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain. The term 'dementia' describes a loss of mental ability that is more than would be expected with ageing. It is sufficient to affect day-to-day activities and gets progressively worse. Frontotemporal dementia is similar to Alzheimer's disease in that it is caused by a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain, leading to a progressive loss of brain cells. The affected areas of the brain gradually function less well and shrink. It tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (the front and sides) in particular, and often starts at a younger age than usually seen in Alzheimer's disease. The frontal lobes are at the front of the brain, behind the forehead – they regulate our ability to plan and organise ourselves and are important in regulating our behaviour. The temporal lobes are on either side of the brain above and behind the ears, and they organise memory and language. Generally, frontotemporal dementia causes slowly progressive problems with language, thinking, emotions and behaviour. It can profoundly alter a person's character and social conduct – for example, they may either become impulsive and much more outgoing, or uninterested and lacking in energy, depending on the type of disease they have. Other typical symptoms include inappropriate behaviour in social situations and difficulty with speech. Frontotemporal dementia typically starts between the ages of 45 and 65, although it can sometimes affect younger people as well as the elderly. Source: NHS . More than 6.4 per cent of those in the 'criminal group' with frontotemporal dementia exhibited physical or verbal violence during their illness. But this was only seen in 3.4 percent of those with PPA and two percent of those with Alzheimer's disease, the researchers found. In four per cent of patients with frontotemporal dementia, violence was one of the first symptoms of their brain disease. Men were considerably more likely than women to make sexual advances to others and to urinate in public. The study's lead author, Dr. Georges Naasan of the University of California,  U.S., said if patients have a family history of dementia, it may be possible to connect new criminal behaviour to an underlying problem with the brain. 'However, most of these diseases are ""sporadic"" - meaning they occur for no identifiable genetic cause and it is difficult to predict,' he said. 'In general, an early detection of changes in personality, deviation from what constituted a ""norm"" for a particular individual, should prompt an evaluation for possible brain causes.' Early signs of frontotemporal dementia can include personality changes including disinhibition, lack of empathy, loss of motivation or apathy, or obsessive-compulsive behaviour, he said. 'It is sometimes hard to wrap our minds around the concept that a specific part of our brain is not functioning properly, leading to behaviours that may range the gamut of disruptive, detached and sometimes criminal,' Dr Naasan said. Family and friends can easily take these behaviour changes personally, but they should understand that it may be the first sign of a disease and should request a medical evaluation, he added. Frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders can be accurately diagnosed with positron emission tomography (PET) scans and neuropsychological testing. However this can only happen if doctors recognise it could be the cause of the behaviour and think to test for it, Dr Hassan said. The study was published in the journal JAMA Neurology.","Personality change or criminal activity could be signs of dementia .

"Rev Al Sharpton has accused police of trying to embarrass him after they revealed they found his Viagra prescription in the apartment of a lawyer friend recently cleared of rape charges. High-profile civil rights attorney Sanford Rubenstein, 70, has been told he will not face criminal charges after a woman accused him of rape last year. But rather than the case disappearing from the media spotlight, it was leaked that a prescription for Viagra – a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction – was found in Rubenstein’s apartment, made out in Sharpton’s name. Rev Al Sharpton (center) has accused police of trying to embarrass him after they revealed they found his Viagra prescription in the apartment of a lawyer friend, Sanford Rubenstein (second left) It was leaked that a Viagra prescription was found in Rubenstein's home after he was cleared of rape charges . The activist hit out at police, claiming that they were trying to humiliate him. He said 'if the motive of the cop was to embarrass me, at 60 years old, I am unembarrassable', according to the New York Daily News. He added: ‘I am not saying what I do or don’t do, I’m not going to invade my privacy for some cop. I have no knowledge of what was in (Rubenstein’s) apartment. But it’s not uncommon for men of all ages to use certain things.’ A 42-year-old executive from the National Action Network claimed Rubenstein attacked her in his New York penthouse apartment following Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party in October. The woman said she was drugged with cookies laced with marijuana before she was raped. But the Manhattan district attorney's office have said Rubenstein's case will not be sent to the Grand Jury following a three-month investigation because of a lack of compelling evidence. The 70-year-old was set to represent the family of Eric Garner after he died in a chokehold at the hands of police officers in Staten Island in July. However he removed himself from the case when the allegations surfaced. Rubenstein told the New York Daily News he was 'very pleased' with the decision and excited to get back to work. In a statement he said: 'I maintained from the very beginning that I did not violate the law. I am pleased that the system worked and that I have now been fully cleared.' 'I look forward to many more years of practicing law and representing victims.' In the clear: Sanford Rubenstein, a top civil rights lawyer, has been told he will not face charges after a woman accused him of raping her in his New York apartment last October . Allegations: Rubenstein maintained the encounter following Sharpton's 60th birthday was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams . Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, released a statement Monday saying: 'Over the past three months, the District Attorney's Sex Crimes Unit has conducted a thorough investigation into the incident that occurred on October 2 and was reported to authorities approximately 36 hours later. 'In keeping with standard procedure, prosecutors and investigators with decades of experience in such matters reviewed all aspects of the incident, including video surveillance, physical evidence, and medical records, and conducted extensive witness and expert interviews. 'The video evidence in this case included surveillance footage from before and after the incident, taken from the lobby and elevator of the suspect's apartment building, as well as from earlier in the evening at the Four Seasons restaurant. 'The investigation also included the collection and testing of multiple items of physical evidence, many pursuant to a search warrant executed at the suspect's apartment, as well as electronic devices and telephone records. 'A review of medical records was conducted by an independent medical expert. Experts at the National Institutes of Health and the FBI were also consulted. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner conducted toxicology and forensic testing, and further testing was performed at a second independent laboratory. Investigation: NYPD officers were seen taking 'biological evidence' away from Rubenstein's luxury penthouse in brown bags after the allegations surfaced last November.

"J.Crew customers have accused the retailer of cutting back on shoe quality, while failing to lower prices. After newsletter subscribers were alerted that the $125 Cece Ballet Flat, which was discontinued in early 2014, had returned last week both in the brand's US and UK stores, customers immediately began noticing differences in the new shoes. The blog J.Crew Aficionada pointed out that the ballet flats, still priced at $125 - and an even pricier £125 in the UK - are no longer made in Italy, and customers have described their 'disappointment' on J.Crew's website. New CeCe:  After newsletter subscribers were alerted that the $125 Cece Ballet Flat, which was discontinued in early 2014, had returned last week, customers immediately began noticing differences in the new shoes . A woman from Colorado ordered a pair of her beloved CeCe ballet flats in red leather and said she noticed differences 'immediately'. '[They are] overly wide at the center, no reinforcing leather strip up the heel, a pieced sole rather than a solid one, 1/2 to 3/4 inch lower at the top of the heel. 'The resulting quality and fit are poor ... excessive width makes them difficult to keep on when walking, the lower-hitting heel results in my heel slipping in and out, the original interior wedge has been replaced with an interior bump at the instep. How disappointing.' Another customer notes that her new Cleo loafers are no longer made in Italy either; now, they're made in Brazil. And for one anonymous reviewer who said she 'doesn't care where it's made,' but she does 'care about the quality', the new CeCe flats are unsatisfactory. Old CeCe: Made in Italy, customers say the original CeCe ballet flat was of much higher quality, and far superior in comfort . '[They are] not as buttery soft as before and stretches out too easily. It's also cut wider and falls off the back of my feet,' she wrote. To prove their point, J.Crew Aficionada compared the shoes' old and new descriptions from J.Crew's online store. 'New: We resurrected one of our most popular ballet flats from the J.Crew archives—and for good reason. With a cushioned insole for maximum comfort, a rubber sole for maximum flexibility and an elasticized topline so they hug your feet just so, they feel as good as they look.  Import. 'Old: Beautifully styled in sumptuous suede (from Italy, of course). Our designers deliberated over every detail to ensure our ballets are the most comfortable you'll ever wear, adding more padding, removing the shank and finishing them with an arch-hugging wedge. We think they've nailed it. Made in Italy.' However a J. Crew representative said the company hasn't changed anything about the shoe. In fact, the retailer told Daily Mail Online that the new CeCe flat is made with the same last, same sock, same upper, same materials, and same fit – the only difference being, it said, is that  a pull tab in the back of the shoe, which customers said was causing discomfort, was removed.","The Cece Ballet Flat, which was discontinued in early 2014, has been made available again in the brand's US and UK stores .

"The number of children treated annually for accidental pot consumption in Colorado has reached double-digits and a drug treatment chain has seen a surge of teens treated for cannabis abuse, a leading U.S. anti-marijuana group said on Monday. In a report, marijuana legalization foe Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) also pointed to higher-than-average use in the first states to sanction recreational cannabis, Colorado and Washington state, and an increase in burns from butane hash oil production. 'We need a pumping-of-the-brakes on the marijuana industry,' SAM’s president, Kevin Sabet, said in an interview. Call for control: Legalization opponents say Washington state and Colorado have been flooded with dangerous products, from infused candies and concentrates, and argue for stricter controls . 'When we have hospitalizations and burns and deaths, we need to stop many of these products from being sold.' The report comes amid rapidly shifting state laws governing marijuana use. Voters in four U.S. states opted to legalize its recreational use, most recently in Oregon and Alaska. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. Legalization opponents say Washington state and Colorado have been flooded with dangerous products, from infused candies and concentrates, many far stronger than what might have been smoked in the 1960s. At least 14 Colorado children ages 3 to 7 were sent to hospitals in the first half of 2014 for accidentally ingesting marijuana products, compared with eight in 2013 and four between 2008 and 2011, SAM said of state data. In Colorado, teen marijuana abuse treatment at about a dozen Arapahoe House Denver-area facilities increased by 66 percent between 2011 and 2014, SAM cited that group as reporting. Separately on Monday, Colorado health officials announced a $4 million Internet, television and radio public-education campaign aimed at exposing the dangers of cannabis-infused products and aspects of the law. Mistaken for candy: At least 14 Colorado children ages 3 to 7 were sent to hospitals in the first half of 2014 for accidentally ingesting marijuana products, compared with eight in 2013 and four between 2008 and 2011 . Use among people ages 18 and older from 2011-2013 in Colorado and Washington has risen about 3 percentage points, from roughly 16 to 19 percent and from 15 to 18 percent, respectively, SAM said, citing federal data. The national average is about 12 percent. The University of Colorado observed 17 cases of marijuana-related burns in 2014 and 11 cases in 2013, largely from botched butane hash oil extractions, with one case each in the three years prior, SAM said. 'Trying to draw any conclusions with less than one year of data is irresponsible,' pro-cannabis Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert said. He said research on pot has drawn conflicting results and has been limited by the federal ban.","The number of children treated annually for accidental pot consumption in Colorado has reached double-digits .

"Police have released an image of a man in a tweed cap and jacket who they believe, with an Asian woman, helped dupe a 59-year-old dementia sufferer out of £10,000 in a fake lottery scam . A couple conned a man with dementia into handing over £10,000 after a woman said she had won the lottery but was unable to claim her prize. The 59-year-old man was approached by an Asian woman in Birmingham who told him she had won the jackpot, but was unable to claim it because she was an illegal immigrant. After she asked him for directions they were joined by another man who suggested they could help the woman by buying her ticket. The couple then took the dementia sufferer to get his details and to a bank and watched him withdraw £10,000 before driving off. West Midlands Police have released an image of a man they believed helped dupe the 59-year-old into emptying his bank account. They said the pair preyed on him because of his vulnerability. The woman had approached the man in the Jewellery Quarter of Birmingham and told him about the fake win before asking for directions to the nearest solicitors on October 24. When the second man approached he claimed to have simply overheard their conversation and suggested they give her £10,000 in exchange for the supposed winning ticket. The pair then took him to his home in Edgbaston, collected his bank details. They then escorted him to the nearest bank to withdraw the cash. Detective Constable Michelle Hunt said: 'This has left the victim and his family devastated. 'These two suspects have picked on the victim because of his vulnerability. 'They made up the story to deceive him and take advantage of his good nature. 'They have been driven by greed to take these extraordinary steps and steal a large amount of money. 'We are keen to trace the pair and urge anyone who recognises the man captured on CCTV, or the descriptions given, to contact us as soon as possible.' The 59-year-old, dressed in a blue headdress, is seen at his home in Edgbaston escorted by the Asian man . CCTV images show the victim, dressed in a blue head dress at his home. Footage also captured an image of the man who is suspected of helping to dupe him, wearing a light tweed jacket with a distinctive flat cap and dark rimmed glasses. Officers said the conman, who was in his late 40s to 50s and Asian, was around 5ft 7ins tall and was also wearing dark trousers and a pale shirt with a brown tie and black shoes. His partner was described as the same age and height and was wearing traditional Asian female clothing.","Man, 59, with dementia was approached by a woman in Birmingham .

"One police union is pushing for cop killings to be included in the federal hate crimes law. The National Fraternal Order of Police is asking that crimes against police be added to the Congressional hate crimes statute. A hate crime is currently defined by Congress as a 'criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation.' This comes in the wake of the recent killing of two cops in New York City. Scroll down for video . Change: The National Fraternal Order of Police and their president Chuck Canterbury (above with President Obama) are asking that crimes against police be added to the Congressional hate crimes statute . Tragedy: This in the wake of the ambush killing of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos (left) and Wenjian Liu (right) NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were killed last month by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, a man who posted anti-police messages on social media and shot the men dead in an ambush attack. According to the FBI, '21.7 percent of non-accidental law enforcement deaths since 2004 were ambush attacks.' Yahoo News reports that the Fraternal Order, which has 300,000 members, wrote a letter to Congress and President Obama this week addressing their concerns. 'Right now, it’s a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their skin, but it ought to be a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their uniform as well,' said executive director Jim Pasco. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said when asked about the initiative it was 'something that we'll have to consider.' Speaking out: 'It ought to be a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their uniform as well,' said executive director of the union Jim Pasco (above) The hate crime statue has been expanded before, most recently in 2009 when disabilities and sexual orientation were added by Congress. It is still not certain who in Congress might take up this bill, especially as violent deaths of police officers on duty have dropped drastically from just a few decades ago. That being said, the group is still intent on getting harsher penalties for those that take down officers in the line of duty. Said the union's president, Chuck Canterbury; 'Enough is enough! It’s time for Congress to do something to protect the men and women who protect us.'","The National Fraternal Order of Police is asking that crimes against police be added to the Congressional hate crimes statute .

"Bess Myerson, the first and only Jewish Miss America and a New York political force until a series of scandals dubbed the 'Bess Mess' forced her into obscurity, has died aged 90. Myerson died on December 14 at her home in Santa Monica, California, according to the Los Angeles coroner's office and Department of Public Health Vital Records Office. The Bronx-born beauty was hailed as a Jewish, feminist Jackie Robinson — a groundbreaker for her religion and sex — after turning her stunning 1945 Miss America victory into national celebrity. Bess Myerson was the first and only Miss America in the pageant's history, winning her crown in 1945 . Myerson, unlike her predecessors, accentuated her intelligence, landing a series of television jobs, from game show hostess to on-air reporter, before her appointment as New York City's chief consumer watchdog in 1969. The popular Myerson, who stood 5ft 10ins tall, helped Ed Koch win the 1977 mayoral race, deflecting rumors of the bachelor candidate's homosexuality with her constant presence at his side . ""The immaculate deception,"" cynics called it after the couple shared an election night victory kiss. She made her own bid for office in 1980: an unsuccessful Democratic primary run for U.S. Senate. Three years later, Koch appointed her Cultural Affairs commissioner — an $83,000-a-year post as the city's liaison to the arts. ""People like to read about me,"" she said in a 1987 interview. ""They like to imagine themselves in my life."" But Myerson's carefully cultivated image crumbled in the mid-1980s under a barrage of political and personal embarrassments that became known as the Bess Mess. Myerson went on to have a career in politics - which was brought to an end in a series of scandals known as the 'Bess Mess' A city background check exposed Myerson as an insanely jealous woman who harassed an ex-boyfriend and his new lover. She repeatedly invoked her right against self-incrimination in a 1986 corruption probe of a subsequent boyfriend, Carl ""Andy"" Capasso, who was born the year Myerson was crowned. Capasso, a contractor with purported mob ties, pleaded guilty to nine counts of tax evasion. Myerson, Capasso and Judge Hortense Gabel were indicted in October 1987 on a charge of conspiring to fix Capasso's divorce case. Prosecutors said Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet, received a city job in return for the judge's lowering of Capasso's alimony and child support payments. Before that trial began the next year, Myerson was convicted of shoplifting nail polish and earrings from a Pennsylvania store. A 1970 shoplifting conviction was also made public. Although Myerson and her co-defendants were acquitted in the divorce-fixing case, the damage was done. She had already resigned her Koch administration post, and her public career was virtually over. The former Miss American is credited with helping Edward Koch - pictured here with Myerson and a bagel celebrating his election victory in November 1977 - become New York Mayor by deflecting rumors of the bachelor candidate's homosexuality . The Miss America Organization said in a statement Monday that Myerson would be remembered for her unwavering commitment to equality. ""Bess used her Miss America title to fight anti-Semitism and racial bigotry as she traveled around the country,"" the organization said. Bess Myerson was born July 16, 1924, the second daughter of Russian immigrants. Raised in a one-bedroom Bronx apartment, she was beloved by her housepainter father, Louis, and beleaguered by her strict mother, Bella. By age 12, Myerson was taller and thinner than her classmates — she once played Olive Oyl in a school production. Her natural beauty soon emerged, and older sister Sylvia shepherded Myerson into the Miss New York City pageant in 1945. Myerson, who was born to Russian immigrant parents, became a game show host and roving reporter after winning her title in 1945 . She was entered in the pageant by her older sister Sylvia, who spotted the young Myerson's beauty . Myerson won, advancing to Atlantic City for the Miss America pageant. Organizers urged her to change her name — they suggested ""Betty Merrick"" — but Myerson refused. Her title, captured as the horrors of the Holocaust were coming to light, made Myerson a hero to her peers. Walking down the stage to cries of ""Mazel tov!"" from Jews in the audience, Myerson later recalled thinking: ""This victory is theirs."" Not content with the stereotypical role of Miss America, Myerson left an exploitive vaudeville revue and mounted a speaking tour for the Anti-Defamation League. ""Miss America's brainy, too!"" announced a Daily News headline about the Hunter College graduate-turned-pageant winner. Myerson remained socially aware through the years. She received the ADL woman of the year award in 1965, the same year she began a seven-year stint as chairwoman of the Bonds for Israel fund. After surviving ovarian cancer in the early 1970s, she took the lead in battling that disease. She was appointed to committees by Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Myerson later battled ovarian cancer, becoming a campaigner against the disease . Her first break came on TV game shows. Myerson appeared as the 'Lady in Mink' on The Big Payoff from 1951 to 1959 and as a panelist on I've Got A Secret from 1957 to 1968. She also served as commentator for the Miss America Pageant from 1964 to 1968. But Myerson changed careers in 1969, when Mayor John V. Lindsay named her the city's consumer affairs commissioner. She stayed until 1973. She backed Koch in the hotly contested 1977 mayoral race, holding hands with him as they marched in the Columbus Day parade. Koch media adviser David Garth said it was Myerson who put his candidate over the top. Koch appointed Myerson cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 - but the 'Bess Mess' scandals broke soon after and by the end of the decade she had fallen into oblivion . Her loyalty was repaid February 23, 1983, when Koch appointed her cultural affairs commissioner. It was a decision that did neither much good, however. Myerson's problems were exposed amid several other scandals that kept Koch from winning a fourth term as mayor. But while Koch never left the public eye, Myerson's drop was precipitous — occasional appearances at cancer fundraisers or visits to friends' birthday parties. Myerson, who was twice divorced, is survived by a daughter, Barra Grant, from her first marriage.","Bronx-born beauty turned her 1945 victory into national celebrity .

"It is the annual stock take that sees workers note down each and every one of the 17,000 residents at London Zoo. The mammoth task takes staff a week to complete and tiny creatures such as ants and locusts are, thankfully, counted in colonies. The zoo is home to more than 750 species, from red-kneed spiders to Sumatran tigers, and all must be accounted for. The yearly stock-taking is required under the license terms for all British zoos and means workers have to coax, corral and count each resident in the famous zoo. New arrivals this year include 10 young Humboldt penguins, three tiger cubs and six baby Philippine crocodiles - the first of the reptiles ever bred in Britain. The count is expected to take about a week. Tiny creatures such as ants and locusts are counted in colonies, but all others are recorded individually. 'You need a quick pair of eyes,' said zookeeper Amy Heath as she counted a group of skittering squirrel monkeys. 'Usually an extra pair of eyes helps, but I've been counting them for quite a few years, so I'm quite good at counting them.' Data from the count, and others around the country, will be entered into an international computer database of animal collections and used to plan zoo management and breeding programs for endangered species.

"A bizarre video has emerged from China of a game held in Shanghai where people compete to stay still and silent for the longest - the biggest prize being an iPhone 6. According to reports there were 282 participants involved the weekend before Christmas - sitting together without trying to move, laugh or leave for the bathroom. Half the contestants failed to hold for an hour while the winner, a young pre-school teacher called Ms Yan, made it to the end after three hours and six minutes. Nearly 300 people competed to win an iPhone 6 by trying to stay as still and silent as possible . Some believed the best way to win the competition was to close your eyes and drift off . The game reportedly first came from from South Korea; aiming to encourage the public to release the heavy pressure of living. It also took place in another three cities around the country. Locals and visitors alike descended on a Shanghai mall to try and win an iPhone 6 . Children joined in the game too alongside their parents in an attempt to win Apple's top software . China was expected to be one of the first countries to have the iPhone 6 launched in their country. However, despite 20 million online orders, Apple's hi-tech product wasn't launched until October 17. This led to those desperate to purchase the iPhone 6 to turn to the black market: a 128GB iPhone 6 could sell for upwards of £1,600 ($2,440), a mark-up of around £850 on the recommended retail price.","Contestants were not allowed to laugh or leave for the bathroom .

"A private liberal arts college in Kentucky says it will make video games an official sport and start offering scholarships to gamers in the fall. The move makes the University of Pikeville one of only a few schools in the nation to provide scholarships to those who play 'League of Legends,' a multiplayer online battle arena game, according to WYMT-TV. 'It's actually becoming a worldwide trend,' said Bruce Parsons, Pikeville's new media director. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gaming scholarships: The University of Pikeville Kentucky says it will make video games an official sport and start offering scholarships to gamers in the fall . 'This game is five-on-five competitive play. It takes skill, practice and a lot of teamwork.' Parsons said the school is dedicated to providing different types of technology to its students. 'think there are going to be a lot of students, both nationwide and international, who are going to look at our university who wouldn't have before,' Parsons said of Pikeville, a small school. Graduate Eric VanHoose said he is ready to coach the game, which he described as  players competing 'to try and get to the other person's base.' Pikeville plans will offer 20 scholarships when it begins 'League of Legends' competition play in the fall. 'It will be a regime a lot like athletics,' Parsons said. 'They'll have to have a certain GPA. We'll look at them like student athletes. There will be practice time and video time when they have to study other teams for upcoming competitions.' At least one other school — Robert Morris University in Chicago — has made the game an official sport and offers scholarships. According to U Pike's website the school plans to compete as a co-ed sport in the Collegiate Star Leage (CSL), an intercollegiate gaming league open to all accredited colleges and universities in North America. 'In our research and interaction with gamers at this level, we learned that they are extremely competitive, but also hard workers, valuable team members and quite often have a high level of aptitude in using technology,' said UPIKE President Dr. James L. Hurley. 'In addition to being good gamers, they will be good students and will bring an exciting new dynamic to our campus.'

"A fraudster who claimed to be Scottish nobility has been jailed for nearly two years after claiming tens of thousands of dollars in benefits while living a life of luxury on a $1.2million yacht in Florida. Colin Chisholm III, 63, who made $167,000 worth of fraudulent welfare claims in Minnesota, pleaded guilty to two felonies, theft by swindle and wrongfully obtaining public assistance in November. On Monday, he bowed his head and did not speak as he was sentenced to 21 months in prison by a Hennepin County judge. The ruling matched the prison time that prosecutors had sought. Under state sentencing guidelines, Chisholm and his wife, Andrea - who was previously imprisoned for a year and a day in prison for her role in the fraud - could have expected to receive probation. Jailed: Colin Chisholm III (pictured arriving at court in April last year) has been jailed for nearly two years after claiming tens of thousands of dollars in benefits while living a life of luxury on a $1.2million yacht in Florida . Lap of luxury: Chisholm, who made $167,000 worth of fraudulent welfare claims in Minnesota, pleaded guilty to two felonies, theft by swindle and wrongfully obtaining public assistance in November. Above, his yacht . However, because of the severity of their economic crimes, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman sought prison terms for the pair, who were found to have millions of dollars stashed in the bank. 'This is a fitting end to a crime that never should have occurred,'  Mr Freeman told the Minnesota Star Tribune after the sentencing hearing, which Andrea Chisholm, 54, did not attend. 'We are pleased with the sentence and believe it is one of the longest ever given in the state of Minnesota for welfare fraud.' After collecting an array of fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims while onboard their yacht, Andrea Aras, the Chisholms moved to a lakeside mansion in an upscale suburb of Minneapolis.

Sprawling: After collecting an array of fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims while onboard their yacht, Andrea Aras, the Chisholms moved to a lakeside mansion (pictured) in an upscale suburb of Minneapolis . In addition to the six-bedroom home - built in 1909 with five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records - they also owned a $30,000 Lexus, prosecutors said. In total, the couple filed more than a dozen forms seeking county and Minnesota state aid over a seven-year period, from late 2004 to 2012. All of these forms failed to disclose where they lived. The forms also reportedly did not state that  Chisholm was listed as chief executive for a satellite television company in the Caribbean, nor that he had more than $3million stashed in bank accounts. Meanwhile, Andrea Chisholm, who admitted aiding and abetting the fraud in August and has finished her sentence, was not listed as owner of a  dog kennel that bread and sold championship dogs. Large-scale fraud: Because of the severity of their economic crimes, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman sought prison terms for the Chisholms (seen in their mugshots), who had millions of dollars in the bank . High-flying lifestyle: Andrea Chisholm (pictured in court with her husband in April last year), who admitted aiding and abetting the fraud in August, was the owner of a Twin Cities dog kennel that sold championship dogs . The couple - who once referred to themselves as Scottish nobility, 'Lord and Lady Chisholm' - were arrested in March last year after fleeing Minnesota for the Bahamas. Following his arrest, Chisholm admitted: 'I received benefits from Hennepin County I really wasn’t entitled to. I’m taking full responsibility for that.' At an earlier hearing, Mr Freeman said: 'Too often, people think that only poor people commit crimes. We know that is not true and the Chisholms are a perfect example. Dynasty: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy, Scotland . 'What they did was abominable, stealing from the government and the taxpayers while living a luxurious lifestyle. 'That’s why we pushed for a tougher sentence than the probation he normally would have received.' According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the Chisholms trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. They plan to challenge the judge's order to pay more than $167,000 in restitution.","Colin Chisholm III collected $167million worth of welfare while on a yacht .

"Star pitches Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and John Smoltz, who dominated in an era of offense, were elected to baseball's Hall of Fame on Tuesday. They join Craig Biggio, marking it the first time since 1955 that writers selected four players in one year. The Big Unit, Martinez and Smoltz easily earned induction on their first tries, and Biggio made it on the third attempt after falling two votes shy last year. Steroids-tainted stars Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa remained far from election. Johnson, a five-time Cy Young Award winner with 303 victories and 4,875 strikeouts, was selected on 534 of 549 ballots by veteran members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. From left are Craig Biggio in 2007, Pedro Martinez in 2008, Randy Johnson in 2003 and John Smoltz in 2008. Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz and Craig Biggio were elected to baseball's Hall of Fame . 'The Hall of Fame was never something that I surely ever thought about,' said Johnson, who has been pursuing a photography career since his retirement. The left-hander's 97.3 percentage was the eighth-highest in the history of voting. 'I don't think people quite understand how difficult it is to be 6-foot-10 and be throwing a ball 60 feet, 6 inches away,' Johnson said. 'In order to do that, you have to consistent with your release point and where you're landing and your arm slot and all that. For someone 6-1, 6-2, there's less body to keep under control, so it's a lot easier.' Martinez, a three-time Cy Young winner with flamboyance to go along with his fastball, appeared on 500 ballots (91.1 percent). Martinez was 219-100, struck out 3,154, led the major leagues in ERA five times and in 2004 helped the Boston Red Sox to their first World Series title in 86 years. Boston Red Sox starter Pedro Martinez pictured in 2004 throws to the New York Yankees in the first inning of Game 5 of the ALCS in Boston . Houston Astros' Craig Biggio acknowledges the crowd after getting his 3,000th career hit in a baseball game against the Colorado Rockies in Houston in 2007 . 'My body would change half an hour before the game, and I would just become this serious, focused person because my dad reminded me you've got to be serious about your job,' Martinez recalled. 'I saw everybody as an enemy, and I saw everybody as like in a jungle: You just kill to survive. And that's the intensity and the focus I had to keep to do it every day on a day-to-day basis. And that's the kind of chip on the shoulder that people thought I had, even though that was my way to concentrate and do the day to day things that I did in baseball.' Smoltz was picked on 455 ballots (82.9 percent) and will join former Atlanta teammates Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who were inducted last summer along with Chicago White Sox slugger Frank Thomas. Smoltz, the 1996 NL Cy Young winner, was 213-155 with 154 saves, the only pitcher with 200 wins and 150 saves. He went 15-4 in the postseason. Houston Astros' Craig Biggio, (7) races down the first base line after hitting his 3,000th career hit during the seventh inning of a baseball game against the Colorado Rockies in Houston . Biggio appeared on 454 ballots, 42 more than the 75 percent needed and up from 68.2 percent in his first appearance and 74.8 percent last year. A catcher who shifted to second base and spent three seasons in the outfielder, he had 3,060 hits and 668 doubles in 20 big league seasons, all with the Houston Astros. The quartet will be inducted in Cooperstown on July 26. The BBWAA had not voted in four players together since selecting Joe DiMaggio, Gabby Hartnett, Ted Lyons and Dazzy Vance 60 years earlier. Mike Piazza fell 28 votes short but increased his percentage to 69.9 from 57.8 in 2013 and 62.2 last year. Clemens received 37.5 percent and Bonds 36.8 percent. Clemens, the only seven-time Cy Young winner, started at 37.6 percent in 2013 and dropped to 35.4 last year; Bonds, the only seven-time MVP, began at 36.2 and fell to 34.7. Atlanta Braves' John Smoltz reacts as Houston Astros' Lance Berkman, background, walks off the field  during after the final out of their National League Division Series Game 4 in 2004 . Former Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson pumps his fists after throwing out the first pitch during ceremonies commemorating the 10th anniversary of Johnson's perfect game  in Phoenix in 2014 . McGwire, in his ninth and next-to-last year of eligibility, received 10 percent, down from 11 last year and less than half his peak of 23.6 percent in 2008. Sosa was on 6.6 percent of the ballot, down from 12.5 in 2013 and 7.2 last year but above the 5 percent threshold for remaining on next year's list. Jeff Bagwell was at 55.7 percent, followed by Tim Raines at 55 percent and Curt Schilling at 39.2 percent. Other players included Lee Smith (30.2), Edgar Martinez (27), Alan Trammell (25.1) and Mike Mussina (24.6). Atlanta Braves starter John Smoltz works against the New York Mets in the first inning of a baseball game in Atlanta in 2007 . Don Mattingly received 9.1 percent in his 15th and final appearance on the ballot. Under a change made by the Hall's board last summer, players' eligibility was cut from 15 years to 10 but the 11-15 group was grandfathered. Gary Sheffield (11.7 percent) and Nomar Garciaparra (5.5) will remain on the ballot. Among the 17 first-time eligibles who will be dropped are Carlos Delgado (3.8 percent) and players' association head Tony Clark, who did not get any votes. Ken Griffey Jr., Trevor Hoffman and Billy Wagner are among the players eligible for the first time in next year's ballot.

"In the fight against obesity, counting up the calories in every chip, biscuit or stick of celery can be a faff too far. However, a US company claims to have developed a smart wristband that does the adding up for you - by measuring changes in the glucose levels and liquid in the skin cells. The HealBe GoBe wristband is the latest twist in the wearable technology revolution, most of which is built on a theme of improving health. Scroll down for video .

The theory is that when people eat, carbohydrates are turned into glucose or sugar in their blood. Cells absorb the glucose and use it for energy, displacing liquid in the process.

The information on the pulse is used to deliver a stress level measure, while the device can also measure whether you have slept soundly or been tossing and turning through the night. While the theory sounds remarkable and useful, there are questions about whether there is sound science to back up the calorie count claims. The device initially launched on Indiegogo, and raised more than $1 million dollars - 10 times its target. Following the launch of the campaign, doctors and nutritionists disputed the claims made by Mr Shipitsyn, saying that even if the sensors could accurately measure the energy changes, it wouldn't be a reliable guide to calorie intake.

"Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has been fined £20,000 for smoking in the showers after a game. The 24-year-old left boss Arsene Wenger furious when he was caught lighting up after his nightmare performance in the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day. Szczesny was forced to apologise for his behaviour – and it is unclear whether he might also be axed from this week’s Barclays Premier League clash at home to bogey side Stoke.

David Ospina was in goal for the FA Cup win over Hull on Sunday and kept a clean sheet – with Szczesny not even picked on the bench. That may have been pre-planned – the Polish keeper didn’t play in any of Arsenal’s domestic cup games last season. But Former Arsenal star John Jensen had claimed on Danish TV that Szczesny, 24, had suffered a bitter fall-out with Wenger and would not play again this season, although Arsenal denied that allegation and said Szczesny remains part of their first-team plans. Szczesny is not the first Arsenal player to get into trouble for smoking. Szczesny has been fined for smoking after a nightmare performance in Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at Southampton . Last year, Jack Wilshere admitted his behaviour was 'unacceptable' after being pictured smoking at a pool party in Las Vegas. He was summoned to explain himself to Arsene Wenger and said later: 'The smoking? Of course I regret it. 'I've been seen doing it. I said it was a mistake and I have made a mistake again.

"Hazel Jones always wondered why she suffered from terrible cramps and heavy periods during puberty. But it wasn't until she turned 18 that she was given her astonishing diagnosis - she had two vaginas. The blonde 27-year-old from High Wycombe has the million-in-one condition uterus didelphys, which means she has two separate uteruses and cervixes as well. Scroll down for video . Hazel Jones: Lost her virginity twice due to her rare condition . But she told ITV's This Morning she was comfortable with having the condition, despite the fact she had to effectively lose her virginity twice. 'Once I found out what it was I told everybody,' she told TV hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. 'I thought it was amazing and it's definitely an ice-breaker at parties' She added: 'If women want to have a look, I'm quite happy to show them, it's not something I'm embarrassed by.' Hazel went to the doctor after her long-term boyfriend told her she was 'different' in the genital area. Hazel has two wombs (uteruses), two cervixes (neck of the womb) and a dividing wall between two vaginas . Sitting next to Hazel, Doctor Dawn . Harper explained: 'When developing in the womb girls start with two . tubes. These fuse and the septum breaks down and forms one uterus. 'In around one in 3,000 cases the septum stays within the uterus but to actually have two separate uteruses is much rarer.' Hazel said previously she had found sex very uncomfortable, but now she didn't suffer any adverse effects. She turned down surgery as it could have left significant scar tissue. Hazel, pictured at school, had no idea she had the rare condition until she turned 18 . She revealed: 'When I was younger I thought I was having cystitis and urine infections from a young age when I was tearing the middle septum.' She added that she once asked a school friend which 'hole' she should use for a tampon, but became too embarrassed to continue the conversation after her friend thought she meant she put it up her bottom. She added: 'I used to suffer from horrendous cramps and my periods could be very heavy. I now know that my periods were worse because I have two wombs. 'So if I get pregnant I have to be very aware not to get pregnant on the other side.' Dr Harper added that Hazel was more likely to have a breached birth as her uteruses were smaller and she was more likely to need a caesarean section. She must also have double smear tests when checking for cervical cancer. But Hazel is unphased by the prospect. 'I have a great sex life,' she said.","Uterus didelphys is a million-to-one condition .

"A 25-year-old former child-molestation victim from Oregon was spared prison time after she admitted to sexually abusing her mentally disabled underage brother and having a baby with him. The Portland woman, who is not being named to protect the identity of her sibling, pleaded guilty last week to one count of second-degree sexual abuse in connection to her year-long incestuous affair with her own brother. Investigators said the brother and sister had sex 10 times between 2013 and 2014 while they lived together, resulting in the woman's pregnancy. Leniency: An Oregon judge (not pictured) has sentenced a 25-year-old former childhood-molestation victim to three years' probation for having a baby with her mentally disabled teenage brother . The victim was younger than 18 at the time of the abuse. He has an IQ of 54, according to a probable cause affidavit cited by The Oregonian. Court documents presented during a hearing last Wednesday revealed that the 25-year-old woman was raped by her mother's boyfriend from the time she was 8 until age 11. Her tormentor was later convicted of child sex abuse and is currently serving a 20-year sentence. In court last week, the 25-year-old told Judge Kenneth Walker she has had a difficult family life involving both physical and verbal abuse, and that she suffers from depression and anxiety. At the time of her arrest last August, the woman was working part-time at the Portland Habilitaiton Center - a non-profit organization that provides education, training, employment and housing for people with disabilities in Oregon and Washington state. As part of a plea deal, the woman was sentenced to three years’ probation, ordered to register as a sex offender and banned from making contact with her brother and all other underage males. The woman's special-needs sibling is currently living with his mother. There is no word on who is raising the siblings' baby.","The Portland woman has pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual abuse in connection to year-long incestuous affair with her brother .

"This is the dramatic moment a school bus burst into a ball of flames just minutes before the driver was due to pick up children for their first day back. Miraculously, no-one was injured in the blaze after the quick-thinking female driver pulled over and fled from the empty vehicle when she smelt smoke and saw sparks coming from the underside. Within three minutes the 51-seater bus was engulfed by a fire which spread to a nearby hedge and melted parts of the guttering of a nearby house. This is the dramatic moment a school bus burst into a ball of flames just minutes before the driver was due to pick up children for their first day back . Firefighters battled the blaze - feared caused by an electrical fault - but it completely destroyed the coach which was just a quarter of a mile from picking up 12 pupils. The youngsters were about to be taken to Crispin School in Street, Somerset when the bus caught fire at Chilton Polden near Bridgwater around 8.15am on Monday. It is the second time in three months that a bus taking children to the same secondary school has erupted in flames. The driver had noticed smoke and quickly pulled over when smoke started to pour from the front . Within just three minutes the huge vehicle was completely engulfed in an orange fireball and billowing black smoke . Six pupils were safely evacuated when a coach belonging to a different firm was gutted by an electrical fault in the village of Ashcott, Somerset in October. The terrifying footage of the blaze was filmed by builder Phil Heyward, 48, after he made sure driver Cara Veater was safe and the bus was empty. The father-of-two said: 'It was quite dramatic to see. The bus was coming through to pick up children in the villages and I saw it when I was pulling into a property where I was doing work. 'I looked up towards the road and only about 200 metres from me and I saw the driver pull over and I saw smoke and a few cars reversing away from it. 'I headed up towards the bus and by the time I got there - literally within two or three minutes - the driver had got off and it was on fire. Fire fighters battled to extinguish the blaze which completely destroyed the coach leaving it little more than a burnt out shell (pictured) The blaze was so strong it consumed the nearby hedge and even melted parts of a house which the bus had pulled up by . It took three fire crews from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service to finally put out the flames . Luckily no-one was hurt although driver Cara Veater was left shaken up and  frightened by the incident . The fire is thought to have started after an electrical fault in the vehicle's front headlamp . 'Thankfully the bus was empty and she was heading to her first pick up in the village.' Phil added: 'I believe it was caused by a driver's lamp - the headlight on the drivers side was sparking. It went from there. The whole thing went up within minutes.' The bus belonged to local firm Aston Coaches and boss Martin Veater said his daughter Cara - a driver for five years - was left 'shaken up and a bit frightened' but unhurt. He said: 'She was about 500 yards from her first pick up and she smelt smoke. 'She stopped the coach, turned all the heating and that off, and drove another 50 years before she realised there was something not right.

"Jeffrey Daday, 35, has been sentenced to six months in jail for stealing more than $90,000 from parking meters while on the job . A New York parking inspector who stole more than $90,000 from meters has been sentenced to  six months in jail and five years probation. Jeffrey Daday, 36, formerly the officer for Mount Kisco, looted the money over a five-year period between January 2009 and May 2014. He was caught in a sting operation emptying parking machines around town before depositing some of the coins into his own account at a local bank. Suspicious workers at the branch alerted police to Daday's ongoing payments. He was confronted on May 6 2014 after cashing in a hoard of change and subsequently arrested. Parking meters in the Westchester County area take quarters (25 cent coins), dimes (10 cent coins) and nickels (5 cent coins). To amass a total of $90,893.72, Daday would have had to have taken more than 360,000 quarters or 900,000 dimes or 1.81 million nickels. The amount he stole was roughly enough to pay for eight months parking on the streets. In September Daday pleaded guilty  in Westchester County Court in White Plains to second-degree grand larceny and first-degree offering of a false instrument for filing. The Brewster resident did face a 15-year jail term for the offense but this was reduced after he paid back the stolen money. Daday reportedly had no prior criminal record.

"Dallas Animal Services has sparked outrage  after putting down four dogs earlier this year, dogs that members of the community say were handed over by their owner in hopes that they would find new homes. On December 30, 27 dogs were taken from a potential animal hoarder by the shelter with the permission of the owner and, according to reports, it was agreed that they would be kept until homes could be found for them. On New Year's Day however, four of the animals were euthanized. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Four dogs (onse above) were euthanized by Dallas Animal Services on New Year's Day . Big haul: The four (one above) were part of 27 brought in in hopes of finding new homes before the winter weather set in . Deeply upset: Marina Tarashevska (above) is one of the women who helped get the animals from the owner to the shelter with the promise that homes would be found . 'These dogs just looked at us like, ""Please help."" And so we were trying to help them,' Deborah Whittington, who worked with fellow resident Marina Tarashevska on rescuing the dogs, told NBC 5. She said that the dogs were supposed to spend 10 days in the shelter while they tried to find homes for the animals before they would consider putting them down, something that a worker there assured them of when they were brought in. 'I don't think that the left hand always knows what the right hand is doing, and I feel like they have betrayed the trust of the community,' said Whittington. Sana Syed, public information director for the City of Dallas, said the workers at Animal Servies are just as upset about what has happened. 'To know that four dogs may have been euthanized in error has devastated staff, and they are also eager to look for ways to prevent incidents like this in the future,' she said in a statement. Angry: Deborah Whittington (above) who also worked on the rescue team says she is frustrated with the shelter . Bad circumstances: The four dogs (one above) were living with what many believe was a serial animal hoarder . Bad conditions: The dogs (onse above) were in very small cages and outdoors, and had been named Faith, Hope, Love and Grace . It is still not entirely what clear what did happen, but the city did release a statement about the incident. 'On Tuesday, Dec. 30, Dallas Animal Services officers picked up four dogs. The owner gave the dogs to DAS in hopes of finding them a new home. They ranged in age from about one to eight-years old. The officers took the animals to the City shelter, where they were entered into the system as “owner surrenders,""' began the statement. 'Two days later, on Jan. 1, all four dogs were euthanized by DAS staff based on their health and behavior.' Diggin in: The city said it is launching an investigation into what happened at the shelter (above) and will share what it finds . An investigation is under way, one made even worse by the fact that on January 5, well before the 10 day deadline, homes were found for the four dogs. The city said it will share its findings once the investigation is complete. The 27 dogs had been sharing small, outdoor pens when they were found by Tarashevska, Whittington and their team, who wanted to make sure they got indoors before the cold weather hit and therefore reached out to Dallas Animal Services. They had named the dogs Faith, Hope, Love and Grace.","Dallas Animal Services is under fire for euthanizing four dogs on New Year's despite claims they promised to keep dogs until they had homes .

"The owner of an animal shelter which is caring for wildlife affected by South Australia's devastating bushfires has taken aim at Channel 7 breakfast show Sunrise, claiming producers got him to organise for volunteers to be on location for Tuesday's show - only for them to cancel without warning. Mark Aldridge says he organised for volunteers and victims of the fires to be at his house from 5.30am for live crosses for a special broadcast but were left stunned when no one from Channel 7 showed up. Executive producer Michael Pell and another senior Channel 7 staffer called Daily Mail Australia but refused to deny the claims on the record. Mr Aldridge and his volunteers are caring for displaced and injured animals and taking food donations for them after fires destroyed large parts of the Adelaide Hills. Mr Aldridge, who runs Willow Wood Sanctuary in South Australia with his wife Helen, claimed Sunrise producers asked him to have ‘the donations on the lawn, all the rescuers there with the animals and those that lost their homes in the fires here for the cross overs’. Scroll down for video . South Australians and rescued wildlife were ready at 5.30am for Sunrise to broadcast from Mark Aldridge's home . Mark Aldridge organised for volunteers and victims of the fires to be at his Willow Wood Sanctuary in South Australia for a live cross from the Channel 7 breakfast show . He said the show also requested ‘that we have the trucks arriving and departing, from 5.30 in the morning’ and he happily set about putting their requests into action. But after visiting on Monday evening to ‘sort out where to set up the satellite’ and to ‘ask that we stack the donations on the lawn’, Sunrise workers then allegedly failed to turn up at Mr Aldridge’s sanctuary on Tuesday morning. Mr Aldridge said Sunrise  producers later told him that they tried to contact him during Monday afternoon but he was out of phone range in the remote bushfire zone. He raged on Facebook: ‘We have been doing rescues and feeding the animals and families devastated by the SA fires. 'Some of us have missed days of sleep, but as Sunrise were going to help get the word out about the good work of the rescue groups, and in the hope that we would raise money for them, we all went out of our way.' Bushfires have already burned more than 12,000 hectares of land north-east of Adelaide. More than 375 firefighters from South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales are currently working on securing the 240-kilometre perimeter of the bushfire. The blaze has destroyed or badly damaged 26 homes so far. Mr Aldridge fumed at the show on Tuesday morning after he spent hours preparing for their arrival .

Mr Aldridge explained: ‘Now we have hours of work to get all the feed back under cover, and the rescuers have wasted time better spent doing what they do best........NOT EVEN A CALL SAYING THEY WERE NOT COMING. 'People devastated by the fires came all the way to be interview......what a**holes, in the world of mobile phones, they could have let us know last night, I will never watch that show ever again.' After Mr Aldridge claimed he didn't receive a message or phone call from Sunrise and angrily shared his story on Facebook, thousands of community members commented in outrage. Trish Butcher wrote on Sunrise's Facebook page: 'I think you have quite a few angry South Aussies. I think they have enough troubles without the no show, no communications this morning.' Kathryn Clayton wrote: 'I think you have quite a few angry South Aussies. I think they have enough troubles without the no show, no communications this morning.' Boxes of fresh vegetables that have been donated for the animals affected by the bushfires were piled up outside the sanctuary . Mr Aldridge also organised crates of water to be on site by 5.30am .

"Saudi Arabia’s national airline is denying claims that it is planning to separate male and female passengers on its flights. Gulf media reported last week that Saudia would introduce gender segregation for passengers unless they are close relatives, but the carrier has issued a statement saying the reports are incorrect. In the statement, an unnamed official said: ‘We would like to emphasise that no Saudia official has made any statement on gender segregation.’ Saudia is denying reports that it plans to introduce separate cabins for male and female passengers . Gulf media claimed Saudia planned to segregate cabins based on gender in response to complaints from male passengers who were upset that other men were seated next to their wives or other female family members. There were also claims that male passengers had accused a female flight attendant of being too ‘flirty’. In response to the complaints, Abdul Rahman Al-Fahad, Saudia’s vice-president of marketing, was quoted by Saudi daily Ajel as saying: ‘There are solutions to this problem … we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.’ In a series of tweets he said the report was false and a ‘fabrication’. There are no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served on board. A prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take-off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area. The airline does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead. Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other nations (file photo) Abdul Rahman Al-Fahad, Saudia’s vice-president of marketing, said the report in question is incorrect . The state-run airline said the quote was from a tweet sent to one of his followers about seating arrangements for families who want to sit together - a source of delays - and was taken out of context. Ajel reported that Saudia’s ‘solutions’ would be gender segregation for men and women who are not close relatives. The airline said: ‘It is worth mentioning that the airline’s website allow families to select nearby seats for their members while booking. ‘Some passengers may not get this facility if they did not select seats or made late reservations.’ Abdul Rahman Al-Fahad said his response about family seating arrangements was taken out of context . Saudia says its website allows families to choose seats while booking to avoid delays while boarding . The carrier's policies are already in tune to the strict Islamic practices of Saudi Arabia: no alcoholic beverages or pork dishes are served on board, a prayer of verse from the Quran is read before take-off, and many international flights have a designated men's prayer area. In addition, Saudia does not employ Saudi women as cabin crew, opting to recruit women from other countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Albania and Bosnia instead. But moves are being made to employ females on the ground in November. The airline opened its fourth women's section staffed by entirely by females at its office in the Murooj district of the Saudi capital of Riyadh. The country is known for its gender segregation, with women requiring a male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. In public spaces such as restaurants, beaches, amusement parks or banks, women are required to enter and exit through special doors. Women who are seen socialising with a man who is not a relative can even be charged with committing adultery, fornication or prostitution.","Gulf media reported that Saudia would introduce gender segregation .

"This is the seemingly inconspicuous Liverpool house where one of Merseysides most notorious crime families ran a global drug-dealing network. The images from inside the former home of the Fitzgibbon clan has emerged as two members of the family face losing their multi-million pound fortune after being jailed for their part in an international heroin deal. Jason and Ian Fitzgibbon were sentenced to a combined 30 years in 2013 for their part in a £7million plot to smuggle high-strength heroin from Turkey to Merseyside. No heroin heroes: Jason, left,  and Ian Fitzgibbon, right, are currently serving long prison sentences for their part in the international drugs ring, and may now also be stripped of their fortune . It has been estimated that Jason, 42, and Ian, 41, made £3.2million from their lives of crime before they were caught, the National Crime Agency says. The Fitzgibbon family, whose violent exploits and feuds with rivals stretch back decades on Merseyside, were described as 'tier one criminals at the top of their game' before an 18-month undercover operation led to their arrest in 2013. The brothers, from Liverpool and Merseyside, were caught on tape boasting of their lavish lifestyle and arguing which one was the better drug dealer. The tapes, used during the 2013 court case against them, saw Jason boast he was ‘ten times better’ at being a gangster than his younger brother while singing along to the Jessie J song ‘Price Tag’. A judge at Manchester Crown Court is ruling on how much they made from crime and how much they will have to pay back. Inside the den: The Fitzgibbon family had been running their international drugs empire from their home . Stuffing the mattress: One of the bedrooms in the property in Mossley Hill, Liverpool which was used to stash money from their drugs empire .

Ian Fitzgibbon was supported in court by Desperate Scousewives star Amanda Harrington,and the convicted drug-dealer kissed the socialite on the cheek before he was led back to his cell. Yesterday, their mother, Christine Fitzgibbon, was told to pay back more than £120,000 in ill-gotten gains - or face more than two-and-a-half years in prison. The 62-year-old was said to have made £280,000 by laundering money made from her sons' drug dealing, and was jailed for two years. A Rolex watch, cash in a bank account and £1,000 cash will go towards footing the bill - as will the sale of the family home in Mossley Hill, in which she has equity.

Bags of cash were found hidden underneath the floorboards in one of the bedrooms in the house . Cashflow: Some of the thousands of pounds found in the house during the 2013 raid . Matriarch: Christine Fitzgibbon, 62 . Jason and Ian were jailed for 14-and-a-half and 16 years respectively at Manchester Crown Court in June 2013 over their plan to import 57kg of heroin from Turkey. Intelligence from England to the Turkish police stopped the deal in its tracks and on September 26, 2011 five local drug traffickers were rounded up. In the boot of a car officers discovered 114 half kilo packs of heroin wrapped in brown tape. The aftermath of the failed drug deal in Turkey was recorded in part by a covert listening device. Ian Fitzgibbon was later recorded remarking: 'That's the story of Jason's life, that Turkey thing.' Ian also admitted an £800k plot to flood Merseyside with 168,000 ecstasy tablets, for which his sidekick Danny Smith, of Warren Road, Blundellsands, Merseyside, was jailed for 10 years. The Fitzgibbon brothers dispute the amount of money they are said to have made and claim they have few assets available to seize. The case continues.

"A woman has lost eight stone through dieting and exercise after she was compared to Emmerdale character Mandy Dingle. For years, Julie Butler, 38, liked nothing better than a cosy night in and a takeaway with her husband Andy Butler, also 38. But the Southampton couple's evening habits caused her to eat her way to 18 stone. Julie Butler, 38, from Southampton was upset after being compared to Emmerdale's curvy Mandy Dingle. She went on a diet and lost 7st 7lbs . When Julie was at her largest, at size 24, a stranger making jokes in her local pub remarked that she looked similar to ITV soap Emmerdale's larger-than-life character Mandy Dingle, played by actress Lisa Riley. The mother-of-three was mortified by the remarks and made a vow to lose the pounds. After cutting down her daily meals by thousands of calories, she has now lost 7st 7lbs. Her husband, who weighed 20 stone at his heaviest, was so inspired by his wife's diet that he decided to join her and has now shed six stone himself.

Julie was slim until her late teens, when she swapped healthy eating and athletics for pub lunches and boozy nights. But she finally lost control of her weight gain after she piled on extra weight throughout her three pregnancies. Now that her three children, Lewis, 14, Mitchell, 12 and Sophie, 9, are older, she decided the time was right to regain control of her diet. She said: 'I put on weight with each of my pregnancies - it was partly natural baby weight, but a lot of it was because I was eating unhealthily.'

Julie decided to go on a diet after being compared to Mandy Dingle in Emmerdale (pictured) She said: 'The comparison upset me because she is known for being big. 'Lisa Riley is a lovely woman and Mandy Dingle is a great, bubbly character - but I didn't like being compared to her size. 'At the time I wasn't bothered about my weight. I thought it was a part of who I am. But that comment stuck with me. 'I started to worry about how large I was.' While celebrating her 15th wedding anniversary in May 2013 with a burger and chips at T.G.I. Friday's, she put down her knife and fork and vowed to change her lifestyle. She said: 'Both me and Andy realised we were not happy with our weight - both of us were the biggest we had ever been. 'Our health was suffering - I had irritable bowel syndrome and Andy had acid reflux. We decided, then and there, that we would sort our lives out. 'We both loved each other whether we were fat or thin, big or small, but both of us were unhappy with ourselves.'

Before beginning her weight loss Mrs Butler typically ate three slices of white toast with butter and marmalade followed by a cup of tea with biscuits for breakfast. For lunch she would have a ham and cheese sandwich, crisps and a chocolate bar. For dinner she ate a Domino's pizza with all the toppings, garlic bread, chicken strippers and wedges with dips. During the evening she would snack on Maltesers. Today, Mrs Butler eats fruit and yoghurt with an omelette for breakfast, a jacket potato with ham and cottage cheese and a salad for lunch, and salmon stir-fry for dinner. Throughout the day she snacks on fresh fruit. They also started taking part in weekly five-kilometre runs in their local park.

I loved having the support of someone at home going through the same thing as me. I. couldn't have done it without him. Andy and Julie supported each other throughout their weight loss with shared goals . 'I really appreciate going into shops and picking fashionable dresses straight off the rail, rather than having to dig through the XXL section.' Mr Butler said: 'I feel like a different person. My life has completely changed in a good way. 'Before I lost weight I was at work all day and falling asleep after a couple of ciders at home. I didn't have enough energy to do anything with my kids.

"The ‘sex slave’ who claims she was forced to sleep with Prince Andrew was promised she would ‘be looked after’ if she kept quiet, bombshell court documents allege. Virginia Roberts said she was contacted by lawyers acting for billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein just a week after she was interviewed by the FBI about allegations of sex abuse at his Florida mansion. Epstein’s legal team ‘tracked her down’ to Australia, leaving her ‘terrified’, before apparently trying to secure her silence, according to a transcript of a telephone interview she had with lawyers in 2011. Scroll down for video . The ‘sex slave’ who claims she was forced to sleep with Prince Andrew (pictured) was promised she would ‘be looked after’ if she kept quiet, bombshell court documents allege . Virginia Roberts (pictured) said she was contacted by lawyers acting for billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein just a week after she was interviewed by the FBI about allegations of sex abuse at his Florida mansion . Miss Roberts said she was warned any of the victims who did not comply would be smeared as ‘drug addicts and prostitutes’. Miss Roberts, who claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 2001 and 2002, also expressed her disgust at a photograph which showed the royal and Epstein walking together in Central Park after the disgraced tycoon had served just 13 months in jail. ‘I am angry about how they are still up to their old ways together and that they’re still hanging out,’ she said, adding that the Duke of York ‘would know a lot of the truth’. Describing the conversation with Epstein’s lawyers, she said: ‘He told me in the first five minutes that, you know, if I stay quiet, that “I’ll be looked after”. ‘And that was the exact way it was said. It wasn’t like you know, “I’m gonna pay you a zillion dollars or anything if you be quiet”, but if I stay quiet, I would [be] “looked after”.’ Miss Roberts, who is now 30 and has now returned to her native America, said she was then called again by the lawyers a week later and was put on to Epstein. The financier apparently showed no remorse, dismissing the girls he allegedly assaulted as ‘drug addicts’ who were ‘just after the drug money’. ‘He exactly repeated what the lawyer said the week before,’ Miss Roberts added. ‘That he would look after me if I stayed quiet, and if I need any help, you know, his lawyers would represent me and he would get legal help for me, whatever I need, he would do. Miss Roberts expressed her disgust at a photograph which showed the royal and Epstein walking together in Central Park after the disgraced tycoon had served just 13 months in jail . ‘Apparently there was an investigation being held about some of the girls who had come out and said that Jeffrey had sexual contact with them under the age of a minor and that he was discrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes so they wouldn’t be looked upon as worthy in the court’s eyes.’ Miss Roberts claims she told Epstein she did not ‘want to be a part of it’ and would not speak out. The comments were made in a telephone interview from April 2011 with lawyers acting for Epstein’s victims, who were gathering evidence after the billionaire’s legal team mounted a counter legal action. A further document uncovered by the Mail shows how Miss Roberts was ‘terrified’ after being tracked down by the lawyers. In a ‘complaint and demand for jury trial’ filed in May 2009, lawyers acting for Miss Roberts stated: ‘Suddenly, in 2008, [Miss Roberts] received numerous phone calls from the defendant’s agents. ‘Terrified by [Epstein’s] demonstrated ability to track her down on her cell phone number halfway across the world, [Miss Roberts] attempted to reassure [Epstein’s] agent that she would remain quiet. [Epstein] himself spoke on the phone and thanked her for not getting involved.’ In the document, Miss Roberts’s lawyers claimed she was abused by ‘royalty’, ‘politicians’ and ‘academicians’ who were friendly with Epstein. Prince Andrew pictured in 2001 with Virginia Roberts, who claims in court she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times while underage and is said to be planning a book about her life . ‘In addition to being continually exploited to satisfy [Epstein’s] every sexual whim, [Miss Roberts] was also required to be sexually exploited by [Epstein’s] adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances,’ they stated. ‘Whenever [Epstein] transported [Miss Roberts] with him in his private jet to any destination, [Epstein] would pay [Miss Roberts] a flat rate per day while he and/or his abovementioned associates would sexually exploit and abuse minor [Miss Roberts],’ The new documents can be revealed after the Daily Mail told of the extraordinary scale of the cover-up over the underage sex crimes committed by Epstein, a friend of the Duke of York, 54. At one stage, he even ordered a pilot to re-direct his private plane because he was concerned the FBI were looking for one of the girls on board. He allegedly told his victims ‘bad things’ would happen to them if they spoke out. Investigators believe Epstein was desperate to stop the witnesses being called to give evidence before a Federal Grand Jury, where they may have been granted immunity from prosecution to tell the truth. Instead, he hired an ‘army of legal superstars’ to persuade prosecution lawyers to sign a controversial plea agreement. Many of the charges against Epstein and any ‘co-conspirators’ were removed in return for him pleading guilty to a relatively minor charge of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution, for which he served just 13 months in jail. The lawyers, meanwhile, were accused of carrying out a campaign of intimidation, using ‘aggressive witness tampering’. General views of Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island, Little St James, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Miss Roberts claims her third and final sexual encounter with the Duke took place . A girl approached by Florida detectives investigating Epstein in October 2005 told them she had already been approached by a private investigator working for Epstein. ‘[The girl] provided no additional information as it appeared her responses were almost scripted,’ a police affidavit stated. Another girl was threatened after being sexually abused by Epstein at his Florida mansion aged 15. The police affidavit adds: ‘Epstein told [the girl] that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could happen. ‘[The girl] wanted to notify authorities, however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her family.’ In a document titled ‘Statement of Undisputed Facts’ drawn up by a US state Attorney on September 18, 2007, a prosecutor also described how two FBI agents went to the home of Epstein’s personal assistant Lesley Groff the month previously to serve her with a Federal Grand Jury subpoena in relation to the Epstein investigation. Ms Groff disappeared upstairs and then rang Epstein, who told her not to speak to agents and ‘reprimanded her’ for allowing them into her home. Epstein was aboard his privately owned civilian aircraft in Miami and then had it diverted in case detectives were looking for Nadia Marcinkova, a girl who was on board. ‘During the course of that flight, the defendant verbally abused Ms Marcinkova, harassing and pressuring her not to cooperate with the grand jury’s investigation,’ the document states. Epstein also ‘threatened and harassed’ his other personal assistant Sarah Kellen to stop her from co-operating with the FBI against him, according to the prosecutor. Buckingham Palace, which has said the Duke emphatically denies the claims, said it would not be making any further comment.

"Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a . leading opponent of President Barack Obama's restoration of ties . to Cuba, called on the administration on Tuesday to cancel talks with Havana  until dozens of detainees . are released. The promised release of 53 people Washington considers . political prisoners was part of Obama's Dec. 17 announcement . that he planned to normalize relations with Cuba after decades . of hostile relations with the island. 'The expectation right now is that they've already made this commitment and we expect them to live up to it,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters today, noting that the Raul Castro regime promised to release the group not just to the U.S. but also the Vatican. But State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said during her daily briefing that releasing the prisoners is not a pre-condition for holding talks or the eventual normalization of relations. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio wants the Obama administration to cancel talks with Havana until dozens of detainees are released . State plans to begin hammering out details of opening a new embassy in Cuba even if all the prisoners are not released, Psaki said. The White House has steadfastly refused to give out the names . of the 53 or even confirm the number of detainees. 'We’re not in a position to talk about specific numbers,'  Earnest said today. 'We’ve been careful about talking about the number of prisoners and who they are because we don’t want to put an even bigger target on their back as political dissidents,' he explained. Psaki confirmed on Tuesday that some . had been set free a day after saying she could not publicly . confirm that even one had been let go. She did not provide a . number. 'They have already released some of the prisoners. We would like to see this completed in the near future,' she told reporters. The State Department official indicated on Monday that the Obama administration likely wouldn't release the names of the dissidents who were held even after they are no longer in captivity. 'We’re not going to outline who those individuals were,' she said. 'I don’t expect we’ll be releasing a public list.' A source with knowledge of the agreed prisoner release told Reuters the delay stems from lack of a final deal on where the prisoners will go - leaving for the United States or Europe, or staying in Cuba. In the past the Cuban government has preferred that such prisoners leave the country when released. But someare likely to insist on their right to stay in Cuba and continue fighting for their political rights. The fate of the detainees has provided ammunition for . congressional critics of Obama's policy shift. Rubio, who is the son of Cuban immigrants, and others . have said they will seek to slow or block moves toward improved . ties with Havana. Lawmakers are expected to hold hearings on Obama's Cuba . policy in the first weeks of the new Congress, which was sworn . in on Tuesday. Rubio said Roberta Jacobson, the assistant secretary of . state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, should cancel a trip to . Havana later this month to discuss normalizing relations at . least until the 53 are released. 'To date, no information has been provided about the political prisoners to be released – regarding their identities, conditions or whereabouts, even on a confidential basis, to members of Congress,' Rubio, a Florida Republican and possible presidential candidate, said in a letter to Obama today. 'Just yesterday, your own State Department was unable to provide an explanation about the political prisoners in question.' The freshman lawmaker reiterated his position that the Obama administration's new Cuba policy is 'flawed' and contended that 'the least your Administration can do now is hold the regime accountable' for freeing not only the 53 dissidents but political prisoners who have since been detained. 'A failure to do so will further embolden the regime to continue its oppression,' he said. 'Almost three weeks after your Cuba announcement, there is . absolutely no reason why any of these individuals should be in . prison or the targets of repression - or for their identities, . conditions and whereabouts to remain such closely held secrets.' The White House has steadfastly refused to give out the names of the 53 or even confirm the number of detainees. 'We don’t want to put an even bigger target on their back as political dissidents,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today . Several mostly Republican members of Congress, led by Rubio . and other Cuban-American lawmakers, have expressed deep concerns . about Obama's decision to ditch a half-century of U.S. isolation . of Cuba. They argue that Obama's policy shift provides legitimacy - . and money - to the island nation's Communist government even as . it continues to violate the human rights of its people. Whether the discord amounts in the long run to anything . more than speed bumps on the way to wider detente remains to be . seen. But at a minimum, they illustrate how benefits from . Obama's ditching of a half-century of U.S. isolation of Cuba . won't come quickly or without rancorous debate. On Tuesday, Obama discussed Cuba with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto during a White House meeting. Pena Nieto pledged that his country would be a 'tireless supporter' of the 'audacious' move to normalize relations. Signaling that it will continue to suppress dissent, the . government of Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday detained . more than 50 activists, dissident leaders said, to squelch a . planned gathering in Havana's Revolution Square. And dissidents . reported new detentions on Thursday. The crackdown brought sharp condemnation from the U.S. State Department. All of those detained had been released by the weekend, dissidents said.","The promised release of 53 political prisoners was part of Obama's Dec. 17 announcement that he would normalize relations with Cuba .

"Hundreds of dog-lovers from Britain, the U.S., Canada, Spain and even the Philippines have offered to re-home a pet who was found abandoned at a train station with his own suitcase. Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed is now the most popular dog in the Scottish SPCA's history after he was found tied to railings outside Ayr station with a case containing a toy, bowl, food and a pillow. Just like Paddington Bear, he was saved after a human took pity on him - and the two-year-old has since been lapping up the attention at the charity's rehoming centre in Glasgow . Staff have received more than 100 phone calls and more than 80 e-mails offering him a new home. Scroll down for video . Enjoying the attention: Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed at the Scottish SPCA's rehoming centre in Glasgow . Character: The charity has had more than 100 phone calls and 80 emails - but Kai (above) will stay in Scotland . Assistant manager Katrina Cavanagh said Kai's success had taken staff by surprise. 'We just can't believe how big this became,' she said. 'But then, it's not every day you get a dog abandoned with his own suitcase' The delighted staff face days of work to whittle down the flood of applications  after poignant photos of Kai went viral - but they insist the new owner will be in Scotland. Assistant manager Katrina Cavanagh said: 'We've had offers from America, the Philippines, Canada and England and we're trying to work our way through them. 'We've had good responses in the past but this is off the scale. We've never had offers from the other side of the world before. 'What we're saying to people is fill out a questionnaire, and Anna the manager and I will have a wee look through, whittle them down and make a decision. It'll be hard but we'll get there. 'We just can't believe how big this became, but then, it's not every day you get a dog abandoned with his own suitcase.' Kai has been compared to Paddington bear after his ordeal, which has prompted an investigation by the animal welfare charity. Until it is complete, he will not be handed over to a new family, so it could be some time before he is adopted. Vow: The charity will rehome Kai in the country where he was found abandoned on railings at a train station . New friends: Kai investigating the characters on a donations bucket for the animal rescue charity . Hello!

There has been an enthusiastic response on social media, with even author Irvine Welsh tweeting: 'If I was in Ayr that boy would be coming home with Welshy. Yes he would! Yes he would!’ Seizing on the publicity, the Scottish SPCA set up a JustGiving page yesterday to raise the £1,000 needed for Kai's operation - and it has already raised almost double that. All leftover funds will go towards other animals in the care of the charity. Ms Cavanagh added: 'He's loved the attention. He's been in and out of his kennel so many times being filmed and having his picture taken. He's a very happy boy and he's behaved perfectly. 'We're also seeing a boost in donations. A lot of people have come here in person and mentioned him.' Animal welfare experts warned his owners could face a lifetime ban from keeping animals after the 'cruel' incident. Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: 'The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai. Lonely: This photo of Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed, who was found at Ayr  station with  his toy, food and bowl in a suitcase last Friday, was shared around the world and prompted an outpouring of generosity . Cared for: Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday . Inundated: Some of the places around the world which have offered new homes... but Kai will stay in Scotland . 'We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him. 'This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online, as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about. 'Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. 'If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible. 'Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.' Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday.

"A 17-year-old  girl with cancer has gone to court to stop child services forcing her to have chemotherapy. Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but does not want to receive the recommended treatment. Her mother Jackie Fortin told NBC Connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want 'poison' in her body. Cassandra Fortin was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but does not want to receive the endorsed treatment . Cassandra was so distressed that she was being made to have treatment that she ran away from home and was then taken in custody by the Department of Children and Families . 'She has always—even years ago—said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body,' Ms Fortin explained. She said that after the diagnosis, doctors at Connecticut Children's Medical Center pushed Cassandra to undergo chemotherapy against her will. Cassandra was so distressed that she ran away from home and was then taken in custody by the Department of Children and Families. She was then returned to Connecticut Children's Medical Center to start chemo. 'CCMC reported to the Department of Children and Families that I was not giving medical attention to my daughter,' said Ms Fortin. Her mother Jackie Fortin told NBC Connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want 'poison' in her body . Cassandra has her mother's support in her decision. Ms Fortin said that after the diagnosis, doctors at Connecticut Children's Medical Center pushed Cassandra to undergo chemotherapy against her will . A court summary says after the teen received the diagnosis, her mother backed her choice - although one month later the Department of Children and Families obtained a temporary custody order 'and directed her mother to provide and cooperate with medical care under the the Department of Children and Families supervision and as recommended by her doctors.' Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever). It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. She ran away after receiving two November chemotherapy treatments - and turned down treatment after she returned, according to the summary. It states Cassandra was placed in the custody of DCF after a court hearing where her doctors gave testimony and that the court also authorized DCF to make all necessary medical decisions on Cassandra's behalf.' Cassandra and her mother appealed the ruling and their case will be heard Thursday at the Connecticut Supreme Court in Hartford. 'It's a question of fundamental constitutional rights-- the right to have a say over what happens to your body-- and the right to say to the government 'you can't control what happens to my body,' Cassandra's mother's attorney, Michael S. Taylor, told Fox CT. A public defender represents Cassandra. 'The Supreme Court of the state has never ruled on this issue, the Supreme Court of the United States has not ruled on this issue. So it's very significant not just for our client, and for the minor child, but for the law in general,' Mr Taylor told the news channel. ABC News reported that Cassandra has has around three weeks' worth of chemotherapy and is now at Connecticut Children's Medical Center. 'She knows the long-term effects of having chemo, what it does to your organs, what it does to your body,' her mother said in a video for The Hartford Courant. 'She may not be able to have children after this because it affects everything in your body. It not only kills cancer, it kills everything in your body.' Continuing chemotherapy would give Cassandra'a survival rate between 80 and 85 percent, The Hartford Courant reported. In a statement to ABC News, Connecticut's DCF said:  'When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. 'Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realize solutions to family challenges. Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.'

"A heavily pregnant woman has died in a car crash - but her baby son has survived thanks to two quick-thinking troopers and a passing nurse. Rebecca Hodge Williams, 24, was driving south along County Line Road in Gastonia, North Carolina at 7.50am on Tuesday shortly after finishing up a night shift when her Suberu Impreza went off the right side of the road and she over-corrected, according to the Highway Patrol. She careened across the road and a Chevrolet Equinox SUV traveling north slammed into her passenger door. The young mother-to-be, who was due to give birth in just two weeks, died at the scene. Saved: Riley Andrew Williams was delivered by c-section on Tuesday morning after his mother was killed when she collided with another vehicle. He was saved after troopers performed CPR on his mother's body . A passerby alerted a trooper who was working a small wreck less than a mile from the scene and the officer went to the Williams' car, pulled her out and started performing CPR. Another trooper shortly arrived on the scene, before a  nurse from Cleveland Regional Hospital, who happened to be passing in her car, pulled over to help them with CPR. They continued to perform CPR on the mother, who was already dead, for 20 minutes so that her baby could get oxygen, Trooper Brian Huffstickler told DailyMail.com. Without it, the young boy would surely have died, he said. 'God put me in the right place at the right time,' the unnamed trooper who was first called to the scene told WSOC. Williams was taken to Gaston Regional Hospital and her baby son was delivered by cesarean section before being taken to Levine Children's Hospital in Charlotte. The newborn was named Riley Andrew Williams and weighs 7lbs 5oz. Tragic: Rebecca Hodge Williams, 24, was pronounced dead at the scene on Tuesday morning. Troopers believe she had veered off the road and then overcorrected, sending her into the path of oncoming traffic . Excitement: Over the past several months, Williams had shared ultrasounds of her baby, pictured, as she looked forward to his birth. She was due on January 19, just two weeks away . He has a strong heartbeat, but is still suffering from lack of oxygen, officials said. Last year, Williams had shared her pregnancy joy on Facebook, uploading ultrasounds of the baby's progress throughout July and October. In November, she shared another ultrasound with a message reading: 'It's a boy!' Troopers said the female driver of the SUV was not hurt in the wreck. Everyone involved in the crash was wearing their seatbelt, they said. Troopers believe Williams had headed home after her night shift but had left again shortly afterwards when she got into the crash. She lived just a mile and a half from the crash scene.","Rebecca Hodge Williams accidentally veered into the path of oncoming traffic in Gastonia, North Carolina on Tuesday and died at the scene .

"Taxi drivers will face language tests to ensure their English is up to scratch, after customers complained they couldn't have a conversation with them. The so-called 'L-test' could be rolled out in Bradford after council officials found many drivers could not chat to their passengers about common taxi subjects, such as the weather. They found that customers' attempts at routine chitchat - such as 'Busy tonight mate?' - were often met with a puzzled silence from the other side of the glass. A language test is set to be rolled out across Bradford to ensure taxi drivers have good enough English to have a conversation with passengers (file picture) It comes as taxi and minicab bosses in the West Yorkshire city revealed that they are often asked by customers to have 'a driver who speaks English'. Until now, drivers have had little to do to convince licensing officers they have mastered English as a second tongue. The rules say they must show a 'basic understanding' of written and spoken English, which could be demonstrated by reading a paragraph out of paperback or filling in a receipt for a trip. But under proposals set to be approved by councillors this week, drivers will have to sit a 'conversation test' before being granted a licence. They will have to show they understand a series of common questions asked by a council worker. Licensing Manager Carol Stos said: 'The current new driver process is that an applicant needs to read a paragraph from a book and complete a receipt for a perceived journey. 'A new procedure is proposed which requires an applicant to answer normal conversational questions such as, ""What do you think of the weather recently? Where did you take your last customer? How do get from A to B?""' UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said he hoped other councils around the UK, including London, would follow Bradford's lead. UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said he hoped other councils around the UK, including London, would follow Bradford's lead (file picture) He said: 'Travelling by taxi is expensive and one of the compensations is a good chat and a good laugh. 'I myself have travelled in many cabs in London with reputable companies who have Romanian drivers using sat-nav barely able to converse a word with me. 'Speaking the language is a high requirement for an integrated society. So I would say Bradford is entirely within its rights to do this.' Wayne Casey, admin officer for the industry's National Taxi Association, said licensing officers should be able to tell when someone has the required standard of English. He said: 'Being able to communicate with a passenger is important. It is common sense. 'Reading one paragraph out of a book does not sound that clever. But a lot of it is down to the licensing officers themselves. 'They should be able to tell when someone can't speak good English and tell them to come back when they can. But council's do not work like that - it is far too simple.' Khurram Shehzad, chairman of the Bradford Private Hire Liaison Service, said: 'It is in the interests of the public. 'Some drivers may know how to drive but when they have a customer in the car they can't have a conversation. 'The public do often say, ""We want a driver that can speak English"". So we do get requests like that.'","So-called 'L test' could be rolled out in Bradford to check driver's language .

"A former Grateful Dead groupie convicted in an alleged drug conspiracy unexpectedly turned himself in, authorities said on Tuesday. Matthew Samuel West, 49, showed up on December 27 in the lobby of the Linn County Jail in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to surrender. West had been on the FBI's Most Wanted fugitives list for 20 years, the agency noting that he once owned and operated a tie-dye shop, played in a local band and coached the drum line. The FBI described West as artistic, saying he designed shirts that he sold at Grateful Dead concerts that he 'usually attended during the 1980s and into the 1990s'. Matthew Samuel West, 49, at the Linn County Jail in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He fled authorities in 1994 (right) while facing LSD charges is back in custody more than 20 years later . West was convicted in 1992 of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute LSD and had been wanted since missing a 1994 federal court hearing. He's been jailed after a federal judge ordered him detained pending further proceedings. Lt. Kent Steenblock, the assistant jail administrator, said it's 'very rare' for a longtime fugitive to give up seemingly out of the blue. The FBI said West fled Iowa in 1994 but what he did over the last 20 years remains unclear. His wife divorced him in absentia in 1999, Iowa court records showed. At least three of his alleged co-conspirators completed sentences of prison and supervised release, the last being discharged in 2005. West's attorney didn't return a message seeking comment. A jury had convicted then 27-year-old West in December 1992 of the drug conspiracy charge. He faced a mandatory sentence of 10 years in prison because the conspiracy involved more than 10 grams, but was free on bond during his appeal. In 1993, federal prosecutors obtained an indictment with additional drug and money laundering charges against West. West was part of an alleged conspiracy to distribute LSD from 1990 to 1992, sending wire transfers totaling $3,125 from Cedar Rapids to a co-conspirator at locations in Oregon and Texas, the indictment alleges. According to the FBI, West fled Iowa before a hearing on whether his pretrial release should be revoked. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jon Scoles ruled last week that West would remain jailed pending his sentencing, which hasn't yet been scheduled. Scoles also set a February 9 trial on the second indictment.

"Snow has finally arrived in the Alps! And with the heavy flakes comes some very good news for skiers: prices are also falling in 19 of the 21 top European resorts, according to a new survey. According to the latest Post Office Travel Money Ski Resort Report, the more substantial the downfall, the larger the savings, with Soldeu in Andorra offering some of the best value. With snow having finally arrived, some of the best value skiing can be found in Soldeu, Andorra (pictured) The cost of a six-day ski vacation at Bansko tallies £261, while Slovenia's Kranjska Gora comes in at £300 . Soldeu, which also benefited from early snow, currently comes in at just £331 for a six-day ski vacation, including rental equipment, lift passes, ski school, meals and drinks. Andorra's top ski resort saw the biggest fall in price overall, according a new report compiled from resort research by ski-holiday operator Crystal Ski Holidays. But the best value is offered in the Bulgarian resort of Bansko - charging just £261 for a six-day trip. Other good value ski destinations - where both snow and prices have fallen - include some of Europe's most fashionable resorts such as Italy's Sestriere and Courchevel in France. Prices have fallen 16 per cent in Courchevel (£503) and 13 per cent in Sestriere (£354), which makes it the best value resort in this category for the second year in a row. But savings aren't to be found everywhere. In the Swiss resorts of Zermatt and Saas Fee, despite recent snowfalls, prices have risen substantially. Post Office Travel Money analysed the top ski resorts in Europe and worldwide for savings this season . When it comes to economical vacations, Bansko in Bulgaria offers the best deal for a family of four . Not all resorts offer snowfall savings! Zermatt in Switzerland has increased by 16 per cent . Saas Fee is now 10 per cent pricier than it was a year ago and Zermatt, now the highest-priced overall resort in Europe, is a 16 per cent more expensive. The strength of the sterling has had a positive impact on prices for UK skiers in all European resorts, but another key factor has been local price falls. Although the strength of sterling – currently worth over six per cent more year-on-year against the euro – has had a positive impact on prices for UK skiers in all the European resorts surveyed, another factor has been local price falls. The evidence suggests that the need to attract back skiers after the market contracted 3.6 per cent last season may have been a catalyst for price cuts in top resorts. The report found local price falls in 16 of the European resorts surveyed, helping to compound the benefit of a stronger UK pound. Switzerland is home to some of the most expensive ski resorts in the world, such as Saas Fee . In the Balkans, Bulgaria's Bansko remains the cheapest ski resort for the second year in a row . Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'Although skiing is still cheapest in Bulgaria and Slovenia, growing competition for business means there are great bargains to be struck in many of the most popular European resorts this season. 'What's more, the continuing strength of sterling against the euro and other European currencies provides the added bonus of more pounds in their pockets for UK skiers. 'While it is great news that skiers can look forward to lower prices in most European ski resorts this season, it is still important for them to do their homework and check all the resort costs they will face. 'Adding these to the package price before deciding on a ski destination will provide a more accurate picture of what their holiday is likely to cost them.'","Post Office Travel Money has compiled a list of the best value ski resorts .

"The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the United States has turned down a personal check for $974.8 million on Tuesday as she continues to fight for more money. Sue Ann Arnall has appealed the ruling made last month in an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma courtroom, citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in the vast oil fortune of Harold Hamm. She slammed the court's ruling as 'inappropriate' and 'not fair', believing her ex-husband is worth an estimated $18 billion. Hamm's offer to pay ex-wife Sue Ann Arnall immediately the full cash value of what he owes based on the November divorce ruling was rejected, Hamm's lawyer, Michael Burrage, said in an emailed statement. Scroll down for videos . Not happy: Sue Ann Arnall has filed an appeal less than a month after she was awarded $1billion in her divorce from ex-husband Harold Hamm, saying she is worth much more . No thanks: In an effort to end the divorce, Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife for $974.8 million, however she turned it down, claiming it is not a fair cut of his wealth . Pay up: Mr. Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup, meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage. Her lawyers claim he is worth about $18 billion . 'Ms. Arnall, through her counsel, stated that they were rejecting the ... payment because Ms. Arnall did not want to risk the dismissal of her appeal by acceptance of the benefits,' Burrage wrote to Reuters. Hamm founded Continental Resources in 1967 and Arnall was an executive at the company. The couple were married 26 years but never signed a prenuptial agreement. Hamm had already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings. Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling. Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma. Arnall made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued. The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999. Real estate portfolio: Miss Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma . Relaxed living: The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma . All good?: Miss Arnell's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce . Miss Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her. The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Miss Arnall were married. During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division. Miss Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Mr. Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent. 'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. The Mansion: Miss Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million . Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Mr. Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion . Miss Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Mr. Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth. Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. A behemoth that Mr. Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Miss Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years. And there's somehow more. That aforementioned $9billion fortune of Mr. Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil. Started from the bottom: Mr. Hamm was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper . Working his way up:  He pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well . Filing for divorce in March 2013, Miss Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage. Mr. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream. Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Mr. Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well. And while Mr. Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years. In 2012, Mr. Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million. It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer Mr. Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Miss Arnall. Big score: In 2012, Mr. Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife . Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Mr. Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign . It was also in early 2012 that Mr. Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the Time 100 for that year. He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna. The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. Miss Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.","Sue Ann Arnall has appealed the $1billion payout she received in her divorce from her ex-husband, Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm .

'How disrespectful is that to set your junk on top of my dad's dead body while you steal his necklace and stuff it into your pants,' Hartt said. She said the act was made even more upsetting as there was an 'unspoken bond' between her mother and father that he would never remove the chain.

The necklace was returned to the man's widow. 'To watch my mother's shaking hands when the detective placed that chain back into them, I just felt a huge relief for my mother that the necklace was back where it was supposed to be,' Hartt said.","Theresa Green Mireles, 56, was arrested and charged with theft from a corpse or grave .

"Council chiefs have been blamed for leaving their town a 'laughing stock' after Christmas lights were finally put up today - a month late. While most people were preparing to take down their Christmas decorations today on the Twelfth Night, Walsall Council were erecting illuminations in Brownhills town centre in the West Midlands. The late decorations come following a row over a set of bulbs and talks had held with local people to help solve the argument over replacing the £600 set of lights. Scroll down for video . The newly erected Christmas lights on the Miner Island in Brownhills. The illuminations were put up today, a month late . The late decorations come following a row over a set of bulbs. But rather than waiting until next year to put up the lights, the council decided to put them up today and rebranded them as 'Winter Lights' But the decision came too late for contractors to carry out the work in time for the Christmas period. And rather than waiting until next year, the authority has decided to erect the tree decorations this week - and rebranded the display as 'Winter Lights' instead. Today furious residents and local councillors slammed the council and described the move as a 'joke'. Chairman of Brownhills Local Committee Doug Birch said: 'We are very angry about this. The town has been treated very badly. 'Our councillors pushed very hard to get us some better lights but to no avail. 'Eventually, two days before Christmas Eve, officers came to us and said they had got the funding for some new lights but it was too late for the contractors to get them up. 'They said it will be done this month and the display will be called winter lights instead. 'We don’t think it is good enough at all.' Barrie Poxon of Brownhills Local Committee who had been involved in a row over the lights with Walsall Council . Shop owner George Tomkins, 44, added: 'Everyone feels really let down by the council. 'We must be the only town in the country who is putting their Christmas decorations up in the New Year - we are a laughing stock. While another resident Emily Pritchard, 67, added: 'The lights the council usually put up are very tacky and minimalistic. 'I was delighted when I heard they had paid for new ones but when we heard it wouldn’t be going up until after Christmas it became a farce. 'It is the Twelfth Night and everyone is taking their decorations down and here we are putting up ours. It is a joke. However, Walsall Council has defended the decision to install the lights after the festive period, saying the new display will look 'amazing'. Councillor Mohammad Nazir, cabinet member for regeneration, said: 'The original lights, which were deemed unsafe and no longer fit for purpose, were removed in preparation for the new scheme. Walsall Council, pictured, have defended the decision to install the lights after the festive period, saying the new display will look 'amazing' 'The new lights, which are being installed for future use, will look amazing as hundreds of LED bulbs will bring sparkle and light to the Miner’s Island.' According to the tradition, Christmas decorations should come down on the Twelfth Night which officially falls on January 5. Other people maintain the actual date falls on the Epiphany on January 6 and churches often keep manger decorations up as part of their services. The Epiphany marks the visit of the three Kings to the baby Jesus and  in which he was revealed as the son of God.","A row meant Brownhills Christmas lights were delayed in being put up .

"Rowdy teens, students and boozed up Brits are behind a revolting new craze that encourages people to deliberately defecate in hotel pools while on holiday. Travel experts say the troubling trend, known as ‘logging’, is responsible for thousands of innocent holidaymakers becoming infected with harmful bacteria that causes diarrhoea and sickness and could result in irritable bowel syndrome and even death in extreme cases. The party poopers are purposely ruining holidaymakers’ getaways without realising or caring about the threat they are posing to fellow guests. Scroll down for video . Holiday Village Red Sea is threatening guests with eviction and a £1,400 fine for pooping in the pool . Warning: Letter sent warning guests about the craze from Holiday Village Red Sea . At least one hotel has issued a stern warning to guests after its pools were fouled several times, and reps for tour operators are calling the vile incidents ‘code browns’. While it is believed teens or young adults are mostly responsible, children as young as 10 are now believed to be taking part. Travel law expert Nick Harris, of Simpson Millar solicitors, said the ‘worrying’ craze has taken off in the last few years. He said: ‘We have dealt with hundreds of cases where people have been left seriously ill. Some idiots think it is humorous to deliberately poo in a crowded pool and then sit back and watch the carnage unfold as people try to escape the pool like a panic scene from the film Jaws.’ Harris said the ‘disturbing and selfish trend’ may seem like harmless fun but it is ruining holidays and posing a serious threat to pool users. He said: ‘We have seen cases where people have had to have their bowels removed due to catching serious infections form people going in the pool.’ Harris said the law firm has already received more than 20 claims this season from travellers who became ill after being in a hotel pool. Revolting craze: Experts say 'logging' is exposing innocent holidaymakers to harmful bacteria . Fouling has become such a problem at a resort in Egypt that staff at the Holiday Village Red Sea are now threatening guests with eviction and a £1,400 fine for pooping in the pool. The resort in Sharm el-Sheikh, on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, circulated a letter vowing to get to the bottom of what it suspects is a deliberate trend. The letter reads: ‘There have been numerous instances of excrement being found in the pools lately. We understand that accidents can happen, but the frequency of this suggests that it no longer remains accidental. ‘As a consequence all guests are being massively inconvenienced for several hours during pool closure whilst the hotel adds additional chemicals to the pool and backwash.’ The resort is asking guests to be vigilant and report anyone acting suspiciously to staff. Guests are being told to stay out of the water if they have an upset stomach and put swimming nappies on their babies. The dangerous bacteria could result in irritable bowel syndrome and even death in extreme cases . Problems have also been reported at Turkish, Greek and Spanish resorts that are popular with Brits. Pools at Holiday Village Turkey in Sarigerme, Turkey have been closed up to nine times in the last few weeks due to floating faeces. Guests are being warned over loudspeakers. A spokeswoman for First Choice, the company that runs the Holiday Village resorts, said the incidents are beyond its control. She said: ‘Once we have been notified of an incident, hotel staff members ensure that all customers leave the pool immediately and then put the pool water through an extensive filtration system.’ Dr Lisa Ackerly, Visiting Professor of Environmental Health at University of Salford and an expert on holiday illnesses, said: ‘It's becoming a really serious problem and I have come across it before when investigating illness in hotels. 'Many hotels now have CCTV to keep an eye on the situation, as it can occur at night when the pool is unguarded. ‘This totally unacceptable and selfish behaviour causes a serious health risk and massive inconvenience and expense to tour operators and other holidaymakers. What pranksters don't realise is that in many countries this could be seen as a criminal act, which could have serious consequences that they hadn't considered.’","Disturbing trend responsible for infecting innocent holidaymakers .

"A Chinese couple who can't afford live-saving medical treatment for their sick daughter are trying to sell their son on the street to raise money for her chemotherapy. Meng Xiangyan, 29, said that with certain death awaiting their daughter unless she receives medical treatment, she and her husband were prepared to sell their daughter's twin brother to a good home so that both would have a chance of life. Pictures show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, in China's eastern Shandong province, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder. Meng Xiangyan pictured with her son as she tries to sell him on the streets of a busy Chinese city . The 29-year-old claims she and her husband love both their children, but they are willing to sell their son (pictured together) to a good home in order to try and save the life of his twin sister . The boy's twin sister (pictured with Xiangyan) is suffering from leukemia and requires life-saving treatment . In the pictures, he can be seen eating what appears to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appeals for someone to come forward and buy him. She said: 'Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins. 'But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. 'It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.' Medical staff say the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital. The family have sold their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10sqm flat close to where the chemotherapy is being carried out. Meng Xiangyan pictured with her daughter, who requires urgent, and expensive, chemotherapy treatment . By selling her son (right) to pay her daughter's (left) medical bills, Meng Xiangyan (centre) hopes both her children will have a chance at life . They are struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal. Their attempt to sell their son follows a similar situation last month in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill. Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter. She and her husband Zhou Xinggui are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding. Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter. His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.'","The Chinese couple want to sell their son to pay for his sister's treatment .

"An Australian trekker hiking in Nepal's Everest region has died of suspected altitude sickness after falling unconscious, local police and a trekking company official said Tuesday. The 64-year-old, his niece and their guide were returning from the scenic Gokyo Lakes region, which lies at an altitude of 4,700-5,000 metres (15,420-16,4000 feet), when he fell sick on Sunday evening. 'He became unconscious as they were walking down. The guide then contacted us for help,' said Ranjit Lama of Himaland Adventure Treks which had organised the expedition. Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains ©Tshering Sherpa (AFP/File) Local police official Khagendra Khadka said the trekker's body was airlifted to Nepal's capital Kathmandu for a post-mortem to confirm the cause of death. 'We suspect that altitude sickness probably caused his death,' Khadka told AFP. Locals refer to the Gokyo region, dotted with turquoise lakes and stunning views of Mount Everest, as 'Death Valley' since the relatively easy terrain prompts hikers to ascend too quickly, creating conditions ripe for altitude sickness as atmospheric pressure drops fast. Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, was hit by tragedy in October when 43 hikers, guides and porters lost their lives in a massive snowstorm on the popular Annapurna circuit. Earlier in the same month, a British woman died of altitude sickness while returning from a trek to Everest base camp. She was found dead in her hotel room after complaining of respiratory problems. Hundreds of climbers also abandoned plans to ascend Mount Everest last April after an avalanche struck the world's highest mountain, killing 16 Nepalese guides in the deadliest ever accident to hit the 8,848-metre peak. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia that consular assistance is being provided for the Australian man's family. The spokesman was unable to provide any further details.","The 64-year-old man was with his niece and tour guide when he fell unconscious on Sunday .

"Demanding urgent action: Lord Hurd (pictured) said the issue has 'dragged on beyond questions of mere negligence and forgivable delay' Delays in publishing the findings of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war are a scandal, peers were told last night. Demanding urgent action, Lord Hurd said the issue had ‘dragged on beyond questions of mere negligence and forgivable delay’. ‘It is becoming a scandal,’ said the peer, who as Douglas Hurd was foreign secretary from 1989 to 1995. ‘This is not a matter of trivial importance; it is something to which a large number of people in this country look anxiously for the truth,’ he told Parliament. ‘Is it not time the Government exerted themselves to make sure that reasonable demand is met?’ Lord Dykes – a former Tory minister and now Lib Dem peer – said the delay in a process that started more than five years ago was ‘an utter and total disgrace’. He added: ‘More and more people think that it is some kind of attempt to prolong the agony for Tony Blair facing possible war crimes charges.’ Lord Wallace, a Lib Dem minister, told peers yesterday the report may now not be published until after the election in May. He suggested the wait was the result of telling subjects of the report – including Mr Blair and Jack Straw – about its conclusions and allowing them to respond. This so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process means anyone who faces criticism by a public inquiry must be sent a letter warning them of the contents so they can challenge any negative findings. Scroll down for video . Politicians: It has been suggested the wait was the result of telling subjects of the report – including Tony Blair (left) and Jack Straw (right) – about its conclusions and allowing them to respond . The procedure takes its name from a court challenge by media tycoon Robert Maxwell who overturned the verdict of a critical report in 1969. Lord Wallace said if the report was not released by the end of next month there would be no time to debate it properly before Parliament is dissolved in March for the election. ‘It is up to the inquiry and its chairman to decide when the process is complete,’ he added. ‘Maxwellisation is part of the process of completing the report. When it is complete, it will be published.’ Long process: Launched by Gordon Brown (left) in July 2009, the inquiry began its hearings four months later under Sir John Chilcot (right) and finished taking formal evidence in 2011 . In November, the Mail revealed letters had been sent to the main participants. Lord Wallace said the process of deciding what classified and sensitive material could be published has been completed. These documents include letters between Mr Blair and George W Bush in the run-up to the war. They will expose what assurances the former prime minister gave the US president about Britain’s involvement. The report will contain more than a million words and ‘publish substantial documentation from more than 200 Cabinet meetings’, according to Lord Wallace. A spokesman for the Chilcot Inquiry said the aim was to submit the report ‘as soon as possible’. David Cameron must decide when to make it public. Former leaders: Earlier this year there were claims of a whitewash after Sir John confirmed his report would publish only 'the gist' and some quotes of Tony Blair’s (right) messages to George W Bush (left) In May last year the Prime Minister said he expected it to be released ‘before the end of the year’. Launched by Gordon Brown in July 2009, the inquiry began its hearings four months later under Sir John Chilcot and finished taking formal evidence in 2011. Earlier this year there were claims of a whitewash after Sir John confirmed his report would publish only ‘the gist’ and some quotes of Mr Blair’s messages to Mr Bush. The US president’s replies will not be published. Families of servicemen killed in Iraq condemned the decision not to publish the documents in full, saying they might never learn the full truth about the decision to go to war. Mr Blair insists he is not the reason for the delay and has said the ‘sooner the report is published the better’.","Lord Hurd: Issue has 'dragged on beyond questions of  forgivable delay'

"Brendan Rodgers offered hints as to how he will handle Mario Balotelli when the £16m striker completes his move to Liverpool over the weekend. The manager did not offer any updates on how the Italian striker's move from Milan was progressing, opening his press conference with: 'I can categorically tell you that I can't speak about him.' But he then went on to allay any fears about the controversial striker's behaviour by saying he will adhere to the club's 'intensive' code of conduct. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the biggest, badest and best moments of Mario Balotelli . Incoming: Mario Balotelli is heading to Liverpool to complete his £16m move from Milan . Rules: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists Balotelli will follow the club's strict code of conduct . On his way: Balotelli climbs into his Ferrari at his home in Brescia as he makes his way to Liverpool . 'We have an intensive code of conduct for any member of staff here,' Rodgers said. 'That covers everyone, not one particular individual. 'Nothing will ever shake our fantastic environment. We've got a learning environment for players.' Balotelli was heading to Merseyside on Friday to complete his medical after personal terms were agreed with the player and his agent. He won't be eligible to make his Liverpool debut against former club Manchester City on Monday night, however, as the registration deadline of midday has passed. Rodgers went on to say he believes Balotelli will go from strength to strength at Anfield: 'Every player we assess. Character is very important. No player will come in of they don't fit. 'People who know me well will tell you I try to develop the person as well as the player. As long as they show they care and they want to develop, we can help them. How is was: Balotelli playing against Liverpool in the colours of Man City back in August 2012 . International duty: Balotelli in action for Italy against Uruguay at the World Cup this summer . 'Players come in all shapes and sizes. Two years ago I couldn't have brought in a player who was risk. You have got to weight it up. This is a club that is different to most. This is a club with values and ethics. 'We understand that sometime you have to take a risk and if you take a risk you can get your reward. Our team spirit is very strong and it got us through the game last week. You will fight for each other when the squad is close.' Rodgers added that Liverpool will go to the Etihad and try and win on Monday night. 'We'll go to Man City with no fear, as we've done before. We'll attack the game. 'The title is decided over the course of the 38 games, not just the big games like Monday's. But the aim is to perform and win. 'The nature of both teams is the offensive game, but they're normally tight games. Both teams will want to score. We know we need to press well and control the game. We can hurt teams, it'll be a good game for sure.' THE PRESS CONFERENCE AS IT HAPPENED . Host commentator . That's about everything from the Brendan Rodgers press conference this afternoon. We'll have a full write-up with all the quotes for you soon. On Balotelli and the pursuit of players: 'Sometimes you have to take a risk with people, but a lot of the time if you take that risk you get a reward for it. It's not easy finding new players as there's a small pool of players we could actually buy. 'But a lot of good work is going on. We're not plucking players out of the sky. A lot of hard work goes into finding and speaking to these players.' Rodgers has just outlined the team news ahead of the City clash. Lazar Markovic is set to return to the squad, while Adam Lallana will train with the team on Sunday. There are no guarantees he'll be available for the match, however. Jose Enrique is a maybe, but Daniel Agger and Jon Flanagan are still out. Rodgers adds that Liverpool will go to the Etihad and try and win on Monday night. 'We'll go to Man City with no fear, as we've done before. We'll attack the game. 'The title is decided over the course of the 38 games, not just the big games like Monday's. But the aim is to perform and win.' He adds: 'The nature of both teams is the offensive game, but they're normally tight games. Both teams will want to score. We know we need to press well and control the game. We can hurt teams, it'll be a good game for sure.' Rodgers has not ruled out further additions to his squad before the close of the transfer window. 'If we can do deal for any more players that'll be great, but come the end of August I'm sure I'll be happy with what we've got.' But when pushed about Balotelli's somewhat turbulent past, Rodgers replied: 'Every club will have a code of conduct. We have a fantastic environment and a great culture. Nothing will every shake that.' There had been reports that Rodgers was drawing up a special code of conduct for the Italian striker, but the manager is making it clear he will follow the universal club policy. The press conference is just underway and Brendan Rodgers has made it 'categorically' clear that he cannot yet talk about Mario Balotelli. 'I can categorically tell you I can't speak about it before the player has signed,' he said. That's that then... Manuel Pellegrini has labelled Monday's clash with Liverpool a 'six-pointer'. The Premier League champions welcome Brendan Rodgers' side to the Etihad after pipping them to the title last season. And Pellegrini was in no doubt as to the importance of the fixture.

"Party: Dara Preece Gehringer (above) said she met Prince Andrew in the exclusive resort in St Tropez . One of Jeffrey Epstein’s troupe of girls told yesterday how Prince Andrew attended a party as a guest of the paedophile in St Tropez. Dara Preece Gehringer said she met the prince in the exclusive resort after being flown there in Epstein’s private jet for an evening of entertainment. But she said she was ‘dumbfounded’ by claims he abused a girl at an under-age orgy. Leaping to the defence of Andrew, who is engulfed by claims that 17-year-old ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts was forced to sleep with him, Miss Gehringer said that when she met the prince he was a ‘gentleman’ and certainly not an abuser. The Duke of York, 54, fiercely denies Miss Roberts’ allegations levelled in US court papers. Yesterday Miss Gehringer became the first of Epstein’s ‘good-time girls’ to speak out – telling how she was one of a group of young women flown by the billionaire on his private jet to St Tropez in Southern France for an evening of entertainment in 2001. She said: ‘I flew on Jeffrey’s private jet and we had dinner with Andrew. He seemed relaxed. He was wonderful and a gentleman.’ She described Miss Roberts’ claims as ‘extremely unlikely’, telling the Mail: ‘I’m dumbfounded. I can’t believe he took part in anything like that. That’s my opinion. He was nothing but pleasant to me.’ Miss Gehringer, who still counts herself as a friend of Mr Epstein, was in her early 20s at the time and said she is now a 37-year-old mother-of-three who lives a ‘different life’. She said of Epstein: ‘I have never seen anything inappropriate. That’s why it was such a shock, all that was very surprising to me.’ Miss Gehringer also had harsh words for Miss Roberts. ‘I don’t have the highest opinion of that girl,’ she said. ‘If everything that went down the way she said, I just have a hard time believing it because they (Epstein and his friends) are not people like that.’ Scroll down for video . Pictured together: Prince Andrew and the then 17-year-old ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts photographed in 2001 . But a former boyfriend of Miss Roberts, Anthony Figueroa, claimed she told of how the duke ‘didn’t act very royally’ around her. The Florida barman, now 32, who dated Miss Roberts at the time of the alleged incidents, said: ‘She said she was scared because she didn’t know how angry Jeffrey would get. Financier: Jeffrey Epstein (pictured) served 13 months in jail for paedophile offences in 2008 . ‘When it came to the Prince, I didn’t hear anything good. She said he wasn’t acting very royally.’ There is no suggestion Andrew was aware of any pressure being exerted on Miss Roberts, who has gone into hiding in Colorado since her explosive claims about Andrew and Epstein were filed at a courthouse in Palm Beach, Florida, last week. Epstein has denied the claims, saying they are made up. Epstein served 13 months in jail for paedophile offences in 2008 after even more serious charges against him, involving some 40 women, were dropped. The Mail has uncovered a massive cover-up in which Epstein tracked down witnesses and warned them off testifying against him. Miss Roberts and four other alleged victims continue to make allegations against him. In a 2009 legal document uncovered by the Mail, Miss Roberts claimed she was abused by ‘royalty’, ‘politicians’ and ‘academicians’ who were friendly with Epstein. The statement outlines how Epstein and his friends would abuse Miss Roberts on private flights. ‘Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when [Epstein] knew that [Miss Roberts] was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old,’ it said. Top US lawyer: Alan Dershowitz (pictured) has denounced Virginia Roberts as a 'serial liar' A top US lawyer has urged Prince Andrew to join him in taking legal action against the woman at the heart of the ‘sex slave’ claims. Alan Dershowitz, 76, denounced Virginia Roberts, 30, as a ‘serial liar’ after she alleged she was forced to have sex with him and the 54-year-old prince. The Harvard law professor, who was one of OJ Simpson’s lawyers, filed a sworn statement to a Florida court in which he vehemently denied ever having any sexual contact with Miss Roberts. He had represented Jeffrey Epstein when he was investigated by American police in 2005 to 2007 for sexually abusing underage girls. The lawyer helped to negotiate an extraordinary plea bargain with US prosecutors that resulted in the billionaire spending just 13 months in prison. He has launched a legal battle to clear his name and encouraged the Duke of York to lend his weight to his legal fight. But one source told the Mail that Andrew has ‘no plans’ to take legal action in connection with the allegations made in the US.

"A central Ohio art museum has apologized after a visitor examining a Lego model of Columbus noticed it included a Lego figure with a gun pointing at the front door of the model police station. It wasn't part of the design for the exhibit at the Columbus Museum of Art, and it upset the Columbus firefighter who spotted it a week after two New York policemen were gunned down in their patrol car. 'I thought, ""Am I really seeing that? Am I overreacting?""' Bob Dickson told the Columbus Dispatch.

Dickson, who noticed the figure along with his daughters on December 27, was so angry he wrote letters to the museum as well as the Central Ohio Lego Train Club, who designed the display. The museum and the club that designed the exhibit said the gunman figure would be immediately removed. It's not clear how the figure got there. Museum spokeswoman Nancy Colvin tells The Columbus Dispatch that it is possible the figure came from an area near the exhibit where visitors can create their own Lego structures. According to Colvin, a docent roams between exhibits but no one is in the Lego room at all times. '[It] was very unfortunate, and we’re very sorry this happened,' Colvin said.

"A man died in a motorway crash involving a wild boar that had strayed onto the carriageway in darkness, in an area where the increasing population of the animals is causing problems. The man, named by police as Raymond Green, 47, from Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, died after his black Seat Ibiza hit the animal on the M4 between junctions 16 and 17 near Swindon. Populations of wild boar have risen recently, particularly in the Forest of Dean where the animals have caused havoc by digging up a cemetery and damaging a roadside verge. Scroll down for video . A man died after a car crash on the M4 near Chippenham involving a wild boar that strayed onto the road . There are fears populations of the wild pigs are rising out of control after a number of recent incidents where they have invaded and destroyed playgrounds and football pitches. The accident, which took place just before 7pm on Monday, happened less than two miles from a farm which has bred 200 wild boar. However police and owners of the Real Boar Company said the animal involved in the accident was not from the site. After the car hit the animal it was then struck by a white Renault articulated lorry. The motorway was closed for more than seven hours until 1am on Tuesday. Sergeant Steven Love said: 'This is a truly tragic incident and my thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim. 'It is quite rare for a wild boar to be on the carriageway of the motorway. It is more common for the police to receive calls involving horses or deer but each is equally dangerous to motorists. 'This was a particularly large wild animal and would have caused considerable damage to any vehicle. 'I would appeal for anyone with any information about the incident to contact us as soon as possible.' The boar is also thought to have died in the crash. Wild boar numbers have risen in nearby Forest of Dean and a wild one may have been involved in the crash . A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said that officers were baffled as to how the wild boar came to be wandering in the motorway - with the nearest colonies thought to be in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire and in East Sussex. The last time a wild boar was seen in Wiltshire was on the on the A365 in December 2009. Wild boar were hunted almost to extinction but have started to return to the UK in the last 15 years, with populations growing in the Cotswolds and Forest of Dean - near the crash site. They can run up to 30mph and weigh around 20 stone when fully grown. The animals can also jump 6ft. Simon Gaskell, who owns the Real Boar Company that breeds the animal for salami, said: 'Wild boar do travel and they are prepared to travel quite a distance. It's only a matter of time before they start causing trouble. 'It wasn't one of ours involved. They are all behind a big fence. I have heard of boar coming up from the Forest of Dean though. They would have been here about three to four hundred years ago but they are not common any more. 'You always here rumours of them being around though. It's not very often they're spotted here. It's much more common in Devon and Cornwall where it's much quieter. In the area we've always tried to keep them away for this very reason. Wild boar were hunted to extinction in Britain several centuries ago. But their population has started to rise again after several programmes to reintroduce them in the last fifteen years. There are now thriving herds spreading out into the countryside. Boar are usually secretive and nocturnal and are likely to stay out of the way of humans. When fully grown a wild boar weighs around 20 stone and can jump 6ft. They can also travel large distances and reach speeds of 30mph. In medieval times, boar from the Royal Forest were supplied for the Royal table - there is a record of an order for 100 boars and sows for a Christmas feast in 1254. Boar are known to inhabit parts of the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean. The animals have roamed wild in the Forest of Dean in 2004, after a 700 year absence. They started to populate the wild in 1999 after several escaped from a farm and in 2004 a group of 60 were dumped - further boosting wild populations. Since then the population has grown steadily - with complaints about them digging up graveyards, gardens and grass verges. Farming of wild boar in Britain became fashionable in the 1970s and boar originating from the European mainland were kept under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. Residents in Lydney in the Forest of Dean had their gardens damaged by the beasts last year . 'This incident is one of those horrific things that happens when they are around. Boar are very hard and very dense.' The driver of the car was killed instantly and the lorry driver did not suffer any serious injuries in the accident. A children's playground was left destroyed in November after a herd of wild boar grazed on the land in the Forest of Dean for two months. Homeowners in Lydney also reported damage to their gardens. Rangers say the Forest of Dean wild boar population is doubling every year thanks to the spread of commercial crops such as maize. In 2013 people living in and around the Forest of Dean said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby. Wild boar dug up land where the ashes of loved ones were scattered at the Pan Tod Beacon beauty spot on Ruardean Hill outside Cinderford. The animals also destroyed grass verges in the area and in 2013 the Forestry Commission announced a cull on the population. In 2008 one had to be shot at Ruardean Primary School and two years later the animals destroyed a football pitch.","Raymond Green, 47, died after being in crash on M4 involving a wild boar .

"The Home Office was forced to admit yesterday that it had lost track of hundreds of dangerous foreign criminals awaiting deportation. Instead of being locked up until they are thrown out of the UK, 758 offenders from overseas, including murderers, rapists, robbers and paedophiles, have vanished after being let out of prison. For the first time, the Mail can reveal the crimes committed by those who have absconded after completing their sentences – meaning they could still pose a serious threat. There are 4,247 overseas criminals living in Britain due for deportation and among the 758 – or one in six – who have gone missing are ‘high harm’ individuals at risk of committing the gravest crimes. In a snapshot of those let out of prison by March last year, those who had absconded included up to 12 killers, 11 rapists, 46 violent thugs, 152 drug dealers, 33 robbers and 23 other sex offenders. At least 115 had been jailed for at least four years – an indication of the seriousness of their crimes. The figures were obtained from the Home Office by the Commons’ Public Accounts Committee after ministers previously refused to publish them. Foreign criminals who commit serious offences are automatically considered for deportation, but once offenders are released from jail they are rarely put on a plane home. They can only be placed in a detention centre if there are realistic prospects they will be removed swiftly because judges would otherwise order them to be released. It means that thousands of criminals are placed back in the community with a request to keep in touch with immigration officials. But many simply slip off the radar. Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said: ‘It is a disgrace that on top of letting the wrong people into the country, we cannot even reliably get rid of them at the end of their sentences. There are 4,247 overseas criminals living in Britain due for deportation and among the 758 – or one in six – who have gone missing are ‘high harm’ individuals (file pic) ‘We need a simple process for ensuring all foreign criminals are deported at the end of their sentences. 'We also must look at controlling our borders better so that those who come here are not likely to commit crimes in the first place.’ Lord Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘It is shocking that so many serious offenders should have been able to abscond. 'We need to change the law so that it permits serious criminals to be detained until arrangements can be made to deport them, however long that takes.’ There are hopes the deportation process can be speeded up. The Mail reported yesterday how judges have backed the new ‘deport first, appeal later’ regime that means criminals can be kicked out, forcing them to fight appeals in their home country.","758 convicts such as killers have vanished after they've come out of prison .

"Police have released surveillance footage showing the chilling moment an armed robbery suspect opened fire on two plain clothes NYPD officers on Monday night, shooting both. The video clearly shows the face of the unidentified man inside a store. In another frame, he goes to leave but quickly pulls out a gun and fires from inside the building as he runs towards the door. One 30-year-old officer was shot in the left arm and the lower back. He has undergone surgery and remains in critical condition, according to the NYPD. The second officer, 38, was shot in the chest and left arm, and is listed in stable condition. Both are expected to survive. After the shooting, the gunman and another suspect in the armed robbery fled. On Tuesday morning, they still remained at large. Scroll down for videos . Caught on camera: A suspect in an armed robbery is pictured on CCTV in the Bronx on Monday night shortly before he allegedly opened fire on two police officers, shooting both of them . Opening fire: As the man leaves the store, he pulls out a weapon and repeatedly shoots at the officers . 'This is another indicator of the dangers our officers face in the line of duty,' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said after the incident. 'Thank God, these officers will recover.' The police officers were near the end of their shift when they got a call for an armed robbery at a grocery store just after 10pm on Monday. As part of a five person anti-crime team, the two plain clothes officers started searching for suspects and came across two possible suspects on Tiebout Avenue in Fordham, the NYPD said. 'These officers did something that was extraordinarily brave, and they did it as part of their commitment,' de Blasio said. 'They came off their shift. Upon hearing this call, they went back out in search of these criminals.' Crime scene: On Tuesday morning, police officers guard the perimeter of the crime scene where the officers were shot on Monday while responding to a robbery in the Fordham Heights neighborhood of the Bronx . Plea: Signs offering cash rewards in return for information are seen near the crime scene on Tuesday . One of the suspects entered a Chinese restaurant while the other stayed outside on the street. As the officers approached the man on the street, the other stormed out of the restaurant, firing on the cops, according to police. The officers returned fire. Police believe one of the suspects was wounded. The two suspects then fled on foot before stealing a white Camaro a block away, police said. The vehicle was later found abandoned and a black revolver was also recovered. The officers were not targeted by the gunman, unlike two police officers who were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn two weeks ago, Deputy Chief Kim Royster said. The plain-clothed police officers may not have been wearing their protective vests at the time because they were finishing up their shift, CNN reported. Their names have not yet been released.

Scene: Investigators work at the scene on the shooting on Tiebout Avenue in the Bronx on Monday night . Dumped: The suspects fled on foot and then carjacked this white Camaro, police believe. It was later found abandoned and the black revolver was also found nearby, police said . Recovered: After the two suspects fled the scene in a carjacked vehicle, officers found this gun left behind . 'As always, the city of New York and the NYPD will be with them through this challenge and as these officers recover,' de Blasio said. Now police are looking into whether the two men were also wanted for the armed robbery that unfolded 10 minutes before the shooting. 'We are currently reviewing video footage from both locations and will provide additional information as it becomes available,' police said in a statement. They are also looking into whether reports of a man going to a Manhattan hospital with a gunshot wound to the back are connected to the incident. Both suspects are described as Hispanic males aged between 25 and 30. One has a short beard. A $10,000 reward is being offered for information that will lead to their arrest and conviction. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, second left, stands beside NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton as he addresses the media following the shooting on Monday night. They commended their officers' bravery . The shooting came just hours after de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton celebrated a 4.6 per cent drop in New York City crime rates. But Bratton conceded that the sharp rise in shootings - up 13 per cent - is 'an area of concern'. On Sunday, thousands of officers converged to mourn the death of Officer Wenjian Liu, who was executed alongside his partner Officer Rafael Ramos in Brooklyn on December 20, 2014. Last week a ceremony was held for Ramos. The men were killed by a gunman who said he wanted to avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police officers over the summer. After shooting the officers, the gunman took his own life.

"Tragic: Maryland's first female bishop, 58-year-old Heather Cook (center) who was elected just this past September, was involved in a fatal crash in which a cyclist was fatally injured . Maryland's newly ordained first female Episcopal bishop fatally crashed into and killed a bicyclist before fleeing just two days after the Christmas holiday. Police on Saturday said a 58-year-old female motorist drove away from a scene of mangled metal beside a fatally injured man taking his final breaths--41-year-old father and custom bike maker Tom Palermo. A letter from the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland revealed Sunday that it was their No. 2 leader, Bishop Heather Cook, who disappeared from the fatal crash before finally returning to take responsibility. Meanwhile, photos from the scene can attest there was no way Cook could have kept hidden for long the evidence her Subaru had been in a serious collision. Witness Jason La Canfora, a CBS reporter who covers the NFL, described to the Baltimore Sun the collision and resulting damages as 'a massive impact.' Half the vehicle's windshield and hood bear deep, fractured indentions from Palermo's body. 'Bishop Cook did leave the scene initially, but returned after about 20 minutes to take responsibility for her actions,' Right Rev. Eugene Taylor Sutton wrote Sunday in a letter addressed to the Clergy of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland that was obtained by the Baltimore Brew. Scroll down for video . Too young: The victim was Tom Palermo, 41 - a Baltimore bicycle enthusiast who custom-made bike frames as part of his one-man business . Hit and run? Initial reports indicated that Cook, whose badly damaged car is seen here, hit Palermo and fled the scene. It was later revealed she had indeed left the scene but later returned (her car is pictured here after she went back to speak to police who were still at the scene) Pictured on the sidewalk behind police tape was what remained of Palermo's ride of choice--no doubt one of the custom Palermo Bicycles he fabricated for a living in his one-man shop. Reaction to the incident from Baltimore's thriving cyclist community was fast and furious. 'He was alive after it happened,' Lora Peters told the Brew at the scene of the crash on the 5700 block of the city's Roland Avenue. 'She might have been able to help or call for help if she'd stayed on the scene.' Twisted metal: Palermo's wrecked bike is pictured here. He was left dying in the street for a time before a fellow cyclist happened by and called 911 . 'Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore'While details of the crash are still emerging, we know the driver of the car involved initially fled the scene, leaving Tom to die on the street.' Cook was pulled over by police in 2010 and booked on drunk driving charges after police found a nearly empty bottle of whiskey in her car, on which the tire had nearly fallen off the rim . No details have been released that confirm or deny Cook's sobriety at the time of Saturday's crash and it remained unclear Sunday night whether Cook would face charges of any kind, but state records and a local report from a 2010 arrest indicate the newly ordained bishop has faced drug, alcohol and reckless driving charges once before. In September 2010, nearly four years to the day before she'd become Maryland's first female Episcopal bishop, Cook was pulled over in Caroline County. Police at the time said she blew a BAC of .27, or over three times the legal limit, when given a breathalyzer. In her car, police said they found a bottle of whiskey, a bottle of wine, and a marijuana pipe reported MyEasternShoreMD.com. Officers also said one of Cook's tires had somehow become shredded. However, records show that by January 2012 the drug charges were dropped. Cook received 'probation without judgement' for the DUI charge. According to the law offices of Eldridge and Nachtman, in the state of Maryland this means: . You can truthfully answer you have not been convicted of a crime on job applications, your car insurance does not go through the roof (if it’s a DUI), and (for certain crimes) you can get the matter expunged after successfully completing probation. The local cycling advocacy group Bikemore released a statement on their friend Palermo's death, which read in part: . 'Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore. 'While details of the crash are still emerging, we know the driver of the car involved initially fled the scene, leaving Tom to die on the street.' Katie Gore, while placing flowers at a memorial that popped up near the scene, told the Brew after seeing photos of Cook's damaged windshield, 'There’s no way you could not know you’d hit somebody.' A community mourns: A mourner places flowers at a makeshift memorial created for Palermo. Baltimore's active cycling community reacted quickly and vocally to the tragedy . A community bike shop left a touching tribute to Tom at the site of his untimely death . However, Cook isn't claiming she didn't know. Nor had she said anything else about the matter as of Sunday night. Instead, the diocese was doing the speaking for her and says they have suspended Bishop Cook because she still may face criminal charges. 'There is an ongoing police investigation into the accident,' wrote Right Reverend Sutton. 'I will meet shortly with the Standing Committee to discuss ways we can move forward.' Sutton went on to say that he'd be postponing an upcoming sabbatical 'to be pastorally present in this difficult time.' Right Rev. Eugene Taylor Sutton . From the Bishop’s Office . Dec. 28, 2014 . Pastoral . To the Clergy of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland . Dear Colleagues, . I am distressed to announce that Bishop Heather E. Cook was involved in a traffic accident Saturday afternoon, Dec. 27, that resulted in the death of a bicyclist, Thomas Palermo, 41. Bishop Cook did not sustain any injuries. Together with the Diocese of Maryland, I express my deep sorrow over the death of the cyclist and offer my condolences to the victim’s family. Please pray for Mr. Palermo, his family and Bishop Cook during this most difficult time. Please do not contact Bishop Cook directly, but feel free to send written notes to the Diocesan Center. There is an ongoing police investigation into the accident. Several news organizations have reported this as a ‘hit and run.’ Bishop Cook did leave the scene initially, but returned after about 20 minutes to take responsibility for her actions. Because the nature of the accident could result in criminal charges, I have placed Bishop Cook on administrative leave, effective immediately. I will meet shortly with the Standing Committee to discuss ways we can move forward.

"Madison Keys pulled out of her Wimbledon third-round clash with Yaroslava Shvedova on Monday due to injury. The hard-hitting American teenager was due to begin a second-set tie-break on Court 12, having dropped the first set and squandered a chance to serve for the second when 6-5 in front on Saturday evening. Her withdrawal meant Kazakh player Shvedova, who led 7-6 (9/7) 6-6, went through to a fourth-round clash with Ana Ivanovic or Sabine Lisicki. Pain game: Madison Keys recieves treatment during her match against Yaroslava Shvedova on Saturday . Crying game: Keys was in pain during her game . Ivanovic and Lisicki were preparing to resume their third-round tussle, in which Lisicki led 6-4 1-1, on Court One. Wimbledon officials announced a left thigh injury had forced 19-year-old Keys to withdraw. She was observed at the All England Club on Monday morning with heavy strapping on her left leg, having suffered the injury during the match and called for a trainer in the fading light at 9.25pm on Saturday, prior to dropping serve when bidding to level the match. The exit of Keys means there are no Americans left in the women's singles at the start of the second week, with top seed Serena Williams having been a surprise third-round casualty on Saturday when she was eliminated by French player Alize Cornet. Marching on: Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan has gone through after injury to Madison Keys . Keys had come to Wimbledon with the boost of winning the Eastbourne title behind her, having beaten Angelique Kerber in the final after breezing by Britain's Heather Watson in the semi-finals. It was a first career title for a player many expect to reach the top 10, and lifted her to a career-high ranking of number 30. But Keys was in tears as she received court-side treatment on Saturday evening, already fearing the worst. Keys expects to be sidelined for only a fortnight. She said: 'Before the match I had the other leg taped. That was just precaution. It was tight. I didn't want it to go. Unlucky: Madison Keys has retired through injury and is out of Wimbledon . 'In the middle of the second set I kind of felt something a little bit. I was thinking, 'Try to get through the set, maybe it could finish, have the next day to recover, try to get better'. 'Then I think it was the 3-2 game, I was serving. I just felt it really go. After that it was pretty painful. I have a muscle strain in my adductor. It's not terrible, not really long recovery time. But they were warning me it could get worse.' Keys acknowledged she had been emotional on leaving the court on Saturday evening, and said: 'It was more like I was trying not to bawl my eyes out. I think there were some tears. 'It's definitely not how I want to be leaving Wimbledon, but it happens. You just have to take it in your stride, just accept it, just try to get better.'",Keys' injury means there are no American women left in Wimbledon .
"A 20-year-old Florida burglary suspect was polite and remorseful when caught ransacking a woman's home in Palm Bay late last month. On December 22, the homeowner called 911 to report that a man broke into her apartment. 'I walk into my room, and I find all my boyfriend's shoes and clothes thrown on the floor. I said, ""So you're trying to rob us?"" And he's like, he nodded his head,' the woman told the emergency dispatcher. Courteous criminal: Johnathan Johnson, 20, has been arrested and charged with unarmed burglary of occupied dwelling and third-degree grand larceny, despite apologizing to his victim and returning all the stolen possessions and money . The homeowner told police the thief, identified as Johnathan Aqueel Johnson, of Palm Bay, explained to her that he needed money to buy Christmas presents for his son. The well-mannered 20-year-old climbed into the apartment by breaking a window screen, which he later fixed, reported the station WESH-TV. The homeowner then noticed that she was missing $260 in cash and confronted the intruder about the stolen funds . ‘I asked him, “Where's my money?” And he's like, “I forgot to give it to you,”’ she said. Johnson ended up slinking away empty handed after returning all the stolen possessions and cash to their rightful owner.

"From a beheading in Iraq to the hard-line repression of religious freedoms in Sudan, a string of extremist acts in recent weeks have raised the worrying spectre of a new era of Islamic fundamentalism spreading across the world. Over the last month, the world's media has been awash with gruesome images of barbarism - pulled into sharp focus in recent days with the barrage of horrific videos and hate-filled messages pouring onto the internet from Sunni militants in Iraq. But it is far from restricted to that country alone. In just the last few days: . Global fundamentalism: Some of the countries spanning two continents . where extreme Islamic acts have been perpetrated in recent days and . weeks . Another form of religious extremism has also gained widespread attention and subsequent outrage in Sudan, where a mother was handed the death sentence for marrying a Christian and was forced to give birth in shackles in prison. Mariam Yehya Ibrahim was released after an international outcry, but yesterday was re-arrested and charged with fraud as she tried to leave the country with her American husband, Daniel Wani, and their two children. The Sudanese authorities claim she failed to use her Muslim name on her travel documents. Just tonight, an explosion in a Nigerian shopping mall killed at least 21 people and injured 17 more as the nation prepared to watch its football team play Argentina in the World Cup. People watched on as smoke filled the sky after an explosion at a shopping mall in Abuja, Nigeria, just hours before the start of tonight's World Cup match against Argentina, which killed at least 21 people . A suicide bomber killed himself and wounded several security officers at a hotel in Raouche, Beirut, close to the Saudi Arabian embassy . Firefighters spent the day tackling the blaze at the Duroy hotel after the bomb attack - the latest in a series of terrorism attacks carried out in the past few days around the world . Witnesses said the blast - just an hour before tonight's match - left body parts scattered around the Emab Plaza in an upmarket district of Abuja. No one has yet claimed responsibility but the attack bears the hallmarks of Boko Haram extremists. At the same time, firefighters were tackling a blaze at a hotel in Raouche, western Beirut, after a suicide bomber killed himself and wounded several security officers, close to the Saudi Arabian embassy. Also yesterday, the highest court in Malaysia upheld a ban on Catholics using the word Allah to refer to their own god in what some experts fear is the latest step in a creeping Islamisation of the country. Disturbing: An ISIS militant holds the prisoner's head as he prepares for the execution while a young boy (circled) watches on just a few feet away . Taking no prisoners: Footage posted on YouTube appears to show ISIS militants carrying out summary executions on dozens of captured soldiers in Syria . In Libya, voters were heading to the polls for parliamentary elections which they hope will bring in a government that can clamp down on violence at the hands of a patchwork of militias, including Islamic extremists, that continues to grip the country since the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi. Meanwhile, the lightning insurgency by Sunni militants ISIS threatens to overthrow the Shia-led Iraqi government and even break up the entire country as it seeks to create an Islamic state. Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security . analyst at King's College London in Qatar, said he had noticed a rise in . extremism in recent weeks and months, but said Islam wasn't to blame. He . told MailOnline: 'All the empirical evidence shows that it is on the rise. You're seeing it in all the headlines, then you're . looking at Iraq, you're looking at Syria, you're looking at Nigeria. 'But . in all three cases this has nothing to do with Islam. I think people in . the West may think it is because they feel alienated by Islam. There is alot of Islamaphobia.' Horrific: Twin attacks in Kenya claimed by Al Shabaab, left at least 60 dead. Five people were killed in another attack a few days later . Attack: Nigerians are calling for action after Boko Haram militants are said to have kidnapped a further 91 people after snatching nearly 300 schoolgirls two months ago . Mr . Krieg said more and more communities - often disillusioned by austerity . or other grievances - have turned to religious groups as an alternative . to secular regimes in recent years. He . said: 'When communities become disenfranchised - and lot of them are . muslim - they use Islam to further their particular cause. 'They adhere to a radical interpretation of Islam, but it has nothing to do with the religion.' ISIS, in particular, appear to relish their growing publicity, increasingly courting online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to promote their hate-filled agendas of murder and oppression. Professor Lee Marsden, international terrorism expert and head of East Anglia University's School of Political, Social and International Studies, said: 'Images of brutality perpetrated by these terrorist groups are being circulated around the world on an unprecedented scale. 'While the levels of brutality seen here by ISIS and al-Shabaab are no different from what we have seen them do before, the way they are publicising their acts of terror is wholly new.' Cruel: Mariam Yehya Ibrahim  poses hours after her release with her husband, Daniel (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya and all those who bravely fought for her freedom in Sudan after she was sent to death row for marrying a Christian . Ongoing civil war in Syria adds further instability to the fragile Middle East. In nearby Afghanistan, . Taliban insurgents hellbent on destroying the first peaceful transfer of . authority, ordered voters not to participate in the weekend's general . election. And in further blow to the global fight against terrorism, Nigeria's former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, said the 200 schoolgirls taken snatched from the classrooms in the village of Chibok by Bokok Haram in northeast Nigeria in April may never return home. Boko Haram, which wants to set up an Islamist caliphate in Africa's largest economy, has fought back against an army offensive and killed thousands in bomb and gun attacks, striking as far afield as the central city of Jos and the capital Abuja. ‘I believe that some of them will never . return. We will still be hearing about them many years from now,’ Obasanjo told the BBC's Hausa-language radio service last week. ‘If you get all of . them back, I will consider it a near-miracle...'","Internet flooded with images and videos of executions from Sunni militants aiming to topple Iraqi government .

"The true extent of the security threat posed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is 'unknown', according to a top government aid, as it is revealed the White House is unsure what secret files he possesses. The revelation came as a new batch of highly classified documents was made public across the internet yesterday, revealing how the U.S. government has collected online data in bulk. Fugitive leaker Mr Snowden, who worked as an undercover computer specialist with the CIA before contracting with the National Security Agency, remains in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport, in Moscow. He had been expected to fly to Cuba but has not reportedly left Russia. Support: Snowden supporters hold posters outside Sheremetyevo, airport in Moscow that read: 'Edward! Russia is your second Motherland!' (left) and, 'Russia is for Snowden!' Russian and foreign journalists continued to monitor the Sheremetyevo international  airport, where Snowden is believed to remain at the transit zone. This poster reads: 'We will not give Snowden to world gendarme!' Speaking in Dakar, Senegal, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser to President Obama, said: 'Look, I don't know with certainty what Mr Snowden has. That's something we're actively seeking to determine.' Quoted in an ABC News article, Mr Rhodes said Snowden had already compromised 'very classified programs' by leaking secret files to three newspapers and by taking files out of the country. Rhodes said it was still believed that Snowden was carrying the classified files on his person. The government adviser said there were 'strict protocols' for how to handle classified information. 'It doesn't involve getting on a plane and going to Hong Kong and then getting on a plane and going to Russia,' he said. Officials in the U.S. are actively trying to determine which documents have been accessed by the former contract worker, carrying out forensic audits of computers and systems Snowden had used. But there are fears the computer specialist may have hidden his tracks so well at the National Security Agency that it will be impossible to identify exactly what was copied. The intelligence community is also in the process of assessing the potential damage to national security relating to leaked information so far. Mr Snowden was expected to fly to Cuba . on Monday, having booked a ticket from Moscow, but he did not board the . plane. It is believed he may be having difficulties with his documents . since the U.S. revoked his passport. Meanwhile, . supporters of Snowden's campaign have gathered outside Moscow's . Sheremetyevo Airport, holding up posters which say: 'Russia is for . Snowden!', 'We will not give Snowden to world gendarme!' and 'Snowden we . are with you!'

Until he leaves the airport, he must remain in the transit area, which serves both connecting passengers traveling via Moscow to . onward destinations and passengers departing from Moscow who have passed . border and security checks. For such a long stay, he must have secured a transit visa from a consulate operating in the zone. Exiting . the area would either require boarding a plane or passing through . border control. Both require a valid passport or other identification; . the U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport. The next possible flight to Cuba is Saturday.

'I'm . not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29-year-old hacker,' the . president said of the whistleblower during his trip to Dakar, Senegal yesterday. Speaking dismissively of the situation, Obama said that he has not personally called Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping to request they extradite Snowden, adding: 'I shouldn't have to.' He said that the documents leaked by Snowden have had their effect but that the government has responded that the surveillance programs are conducted legally and with proper oversight.

Russian news agencies, citing unidentified sources, reported that Snowden was staying at a hotel in the transit terminal, but he was nowhere to be seen at the zone's only hotel, called 'Air Express'. The area where Snowden is purportedly staying serves both connecting passengers traveling via Moscow to onward destinations and passengers departing from Moscow who have passed border and security checks. The departure and transit area has dozens of small rooms, some labeled 'authorized personnel only,' where one could potentially seek refuge with support from airport staff or security personnel. There are also a few VIP lounge areas, accessible to business-class passengers or people willing to pay some $20 per hour. Snowden was not seen in those areas.

"When it comes to 'dancing' these giraffes are definitely head and shoulders above the rest. The beautiful creatures appeared to be performing an elegant routine as they crossed their necks and 'swayed' in time to the music in a series of synchronised moves. Despite their size the giraffes appeared to create perfect symmetry in what looked like a graceful dance number. Two giraffes in Kenya appeared to be dancing as they were photographed fighting for dominance . The behaviour of crossing their necks is known as 'necking' and is used to establish strength in the group . But while the gentle giants appeared calm and graceful, the pair were in fact fighting for dominance. Known as 'necking', the two males are seen swinging their huge necks in an attempt to take out their opponent. But incredibly, despite the duo's aggressive behaviour, the giraffe's movements still managed to be easy on the eye. Still, the behaviour is graceful and quite rare to observe, yet was snapped by a Russian wildlife photographer . Photographer, Andrey Gudkov, snapped the images on the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya from his jeep . Taken by wildlife photographer, Andrey Gudkov, 42, on the plains of the Masai Mara, Kenya, the Russian managed to snap the giraffes from the safety of his safari jeep. Andrey said: 'Sometimes this behaviour is known as dancing but actually, the two males were fighting to see who is the strongest in the group. 'These fights can be very brutal and can last from a few minutes up to an hour. The fights between the animals can be very brutal and can last from a few minutes to an hour .

"A serial 999 hoaxer repeatedly dialled ambulance operators – so he could sing them Elvis songs. Charles Rush, 59, called to serenade them with tunes by the King of Rock 'n' Roll after getting drunk on New Year's Eve. Police officers found him in a phone box at 7.50am on New Year's Day, Sunderland Magistrates' Court was told. A little less conversation: Charles Rush (left) repeatedly dialled 999 so he could sing Elvis (right) songs after getting drunk on New Year's Eve . It is the latest in a series of breaches for Rush, who was slapped with a decade-long Anti Social Behaviour Order in 2005 for hoax 999 calls and has 355 convictions. Lee Poppett, prosecuting, said: 'The police officer asked him to put the phone down so he could speak to him. 'He replied ""I want to sing Elvis songs to the nurses"" and that is what he told the emergency services on New Year's Day. 'Perhaps the only saving grace is that this is his only breach of this year.' Rush admitted breaching his order by making an unwarranted emergency call and being intoxicated in a public place. Gerry Armstrong, defending, said: 'On the evening of New Year's Eve he had been genuinely taken ill and was taken to hospital where he was treated and discharged. Rush, who has an ASBO for hoax phone calls and 355 convictions, was given an absolute discharge at Sunderland Magistrates' Court (pictured) 'Unfortunately, after having a drink, he decided he wished to thank the nurses for their care, it would appear with an Elvis Presley song. 'Engelbert Humperdinck perhaps in these circumstances with Please Release Me would have been a bit more suitable.'

"Mollie King may have earned the title of fashionista thanks to her edit for Oasis but another member of The Saturdays is giving her a run for her money in the style stakes. Rochelle Humes has just unveiled her debut fashion range for Very.co.uk and it's full of trend-led flattering summer designs that she hopes every woman out there will look great in. Speaking to MailOnline about the launch of the collection, Rochelle said:'My new range is really print driven and I've ensured that the pieces can be worn day to night, dressed up with heels and down with flats.' Scroll down for video .

She said: 'I'm conscious now I'm a mother and I've made sure every single piece is really flattering; I've had lots of fun with it. She sure knows what works! Rochelle, who gave birth to her daughter 14 months ago, has used her experience of motherhood to ensure that every piece in her new range flatters women and shows off their best assets (jumpsuit, £55) Inspiration: Rochelle, who cites Blake Lively and Eva Mendes as her style icons, has used vertical stripes on her dresses because she believes they elongate a woman's body (dress, £39) 'I've been very particular with the cuts of the clothes and there's lots of jumpsuits, which I loved to wear during and after my pregnancy because they highlight my best bits - my arms and neck - and covered everything else!' Using her own knowledge of what works, Rochelle has included vertical stripes in her 18-piece range because, as she says, they elongate you, and has added plenty of playsuits and jumpsuits for days when 'you just don't know what to wear'. The 25-year-old, who cites Eva Mendes and Blake Lively as her style icons, says she took inspiration from her friends when designing the range but also took sneaky snaps of stylish women in the street.

I'd love nothing more than walking down the street and seeing women wearing my clothes,' she said. Speaking about her husband's style, Rochelle said: 'He does well by himself so I don't offer much advice but I got rid of the low V-neck T-shirts, the time is up, Marvin! 'He said: ""But I wore them when we dated"" and I said: ""Oh yes, but I knew I could change you!"".'

'Oh, I got you,'  Gindlesberger says as he cuts the video to rescue Phinny. The pet owner later uploaded a photograph to Facebook showing his pig safe from harm. 'Phinny has been cuddled up by the heater all day! No more ice sliding!' Gindlesberger reassured concerned viewers. He says the footage serves as a reminder to be careful out in icy weather.

"A 6-year-old boy was killed in Wisconsin and his mother and brother were left hospitalized after a violent shooting in a small rural town. Police are yet to identify who gunned down Jaxon, 6, his brother Joseph and their mother Morgan Slaight about 3:20 pm Friday in Montfort, about 60 miles west of Madison. The three were found inside a home belonging to Morgan's sister with gunshot wounds to the head from a .22 caliber pistol, the Wisconsin State Journal Reported. The Slaight family — Joseph, 8, Jaxon, 6, and mother Morgan — were all found with gunshot wounds to the head in Montfort, Wisconsin. Jaxon died of his wounds, while his older brother and mom remain in the hospital . The Slaight boys (Joseph, 8, and Jaxon, 6) in an older picture with father Tyler, who no longer lives with them. Police say the Tulsa resident was in town when his boys and estranged wife were shot but isn't a suspect . Sheriff Nate Dreckman, of Grant County, has said he would 'not rule out' a 'murder-suicide' attempt, but has not been forthcoming with details as the investigation continues, according to the State Journal. Dreckman refused to name who shot the family but said his deputies are not seeking a suspect. He insisted there is no threat to the public at large. The boys' father, Tyler Slaight, was in the area but did not live with them. Wisconsin police say Tyler, who resides in Tulsa, is not a suspect. Doctors say Joseph and Morgan Slaight are both in medically induced comas. Tyler and Morgan Slaight (center), surrounded by children Jaxon (then 5) and Joey (then 7), embrace after seeing their new home in Tulsa. The family struggled with meth addiction but was reunited last April . The shooting marks a tragic turn for a family whose parents long struggled with drug addiction and once lost custody of their three children. Just a year ago, the family were the recipients of a three-bedroom home in Tulsa that was restored by hundreds of volunteers from the region, Tulsa World reported. Tyler and Morgan Slaight struggled for years with methamphetamine addiction, which led to the loss of custody of their children. Happier times: the Slaight boys smile happily with their parents back when they lived in Tulsa, two years before the tragic shooting that claimed 6-year-old Jaxon's life . They were finally able to turn their lives around and received the house as a gift from the Bethany Free Will Baptist Church in Broken Arrow, according to Tulsa World. The Slaight's third boy was living with a relative and was not involved in the shooting.","Jaxon, 6, his brother Joseph, 8, and their mother, Morgan Slaight, were all found with gunshot wounds to the head in the town of Montfort, Wisconsin .

"Pizza has long been the staple of a footballer's post match buffet as Cesc Fabregas and Sir Alex Ferguson famously brought to everyone's attention in 2004, and it seems Barcelona are no different in their choice of refuelling foods. The post-match meal preferences of Luis Enrique's players have been revealed by Spanish newspaper Libertad Digital who were leaked a copy of the club's menu sheet before their game against Malaga. Players make their preferences at the start of the season so even those not directly involved on Wednesday night, in the 0-0 draw on the Costa del Sol, appear on the list. The leaked list of post-match food orders of the Barcelona players - lodged before the season kicked off in August . Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic - who signed from Sevilla in the summer - tucked into some sushi . Messi and Co failed to score away at Malaga on Wednesday night as they succumb to a goalless draw in La Liga . Brazilian star Neymar enjoyed a pizza before Barca's draw at Malaga . Bravo, Douglas (Adriano 73), Bartra, Pique, Alba, Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta, Pedro (Sandro 64), Messi, Neymar (Munir 64). Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Xavi, Mascherano, Roberto. German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen makes the most exotic choice requesting 'Sushi and a chocolate spread sandwich'. Most of the rest of the squad opt for a pizza, energy drink combination but there are other notable exceptions. Lionel Messi opts for Sprite to wash down his cheese pizza while Sergio Busquets asks for fruit with his York Ham pizza but insists on it being 'only pineapple or strawberries'. Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo and Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic take perhaps the healthiest options with pasta and fruit, and sushi and fruit respectively. Andres Iniesta and Jordi Alba leave the pitch with the biggest appetites. The midfielder requests a 'ham and cheese pizza' and a 'chorizo sausage sandwich' while the full back also tucks into a ham and cheese pizza accompanied by a turkey and cheese sandwich. New signing Thomas Vermaelen, meanwhile, does not seemed to have picked a post-match meal. On away trips the food is usually prepared by the hotel where the players are based before and after the match. Barcelona may be looking to relocate the next time they play in Malaga after this leak. The 'Barca picnic', as it is referred to, is usually served in the dressing room or on the team bus that takes the players to the airport or directly back to Barcelona while staples like the fruit smoothies and biscuit given to all players are usually consumed no sooner he leaves the field of play. A player can burn up to 1000 calories in a game so post-match diet is important. Top Spanish nutritionist Dr Antonio Escribano, who worked with Juande Ramos at Sevilla and Tottenham and famously cut out the ketchup at Spurs' training ground, says: 'What the players eat becomes fuel for the muscles allowing them to recover from training sessions and matches as quickly as possible. It's just like putting petrol back into the car after a long journey.' Flying winger Pedro was another star to enjoy a pizza and finished his meal with some fruit . Spanish central defender Gerard Pique ate a nutella sandwich before having some fruit .

"An ex-fiancée has enthusiastically backed the heartbroken groom-to-be she jilted over Christmas after he chose to sell the chance for a new woman to join him on their honeymoon next month. John Whitbread, 32, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, is auctioning the spare ticket on his £1,950 dream break to the Dominican Republic - and already has offers over £1,100. His ex-partner Amy Jackson has said she 'didn't feel ready to get married' to him on Valentine's Day this year, but added: 'Fair play to John. I’m pleased that he’s doing something positive'. Mr Whitbread says he now is looking for a woman of any age with 'a good sense of humour' to join him on the two-week break at an all-inclusive four star resort in the Caribbean. He leaves for the Dominican Republic on February 16 and returns on March 3 and hopes he'll have a 'new friend' with him. Scroll down for video . Broken hearted: John Whitbread will no longer be getting married  but is auctioning the chance for a new woman to join him on his honeymoon - which has been backed by his ex Amy, together right . Auction: Mr Whitbread has had two bidders so far with the highest offer now at £690 with nine days to go . Mr Whitbread wants a woman who must be an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss', he says in his advert. But he has warned any new companion they would be sharing a room and said: 'I've got no criminal record but should be locked up for my snoring'. Explaining his decision to sell-off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said: 'I was gutted when she said she didn't want to get married but I realised I couldn't mope forever and I didn't want what I'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste. 'Besides, I think it will be good for me to get away. I'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun.' He claims his girlfriend of two years, Amy, told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on Valentine's Day this year. Two days later they were due to head off on their honeymoon. His ex-girlfriend Amy said: 'I just didn’t feel ready to get married and John wasn’t my soulmate. Obviously it’s difficult for John, I’m finding it hard too. 'It’s obviously not nice to finish with someone over Christmas but I thought it was better that he knew now, sooner rather than later. 'It was better that I called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it. 'Fair play to John. I’m pleased that he’s doing something positive.' Reaction: Mr Whitbread said he was sad about his break-up but wasn't willing to 'mope' and wanted to enjoy his holiday . Positive: His ex Amy says she is pleased that Mr Whitbread is trying to get on with his life after they split . But when he tried to cancel their holiday the Co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him. With the help of his best friend Craig Gibson, he set up an eBay auction to find someone to travel with him and the top bid now stands at £51. John describes himself as a slim, 5'9, with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh. His advert reads: 'I'm not boring, I'm adventurous otherwise I wouldn't be doing something as ridiculous as this'. Although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry in just five weeks' time on Valentine's Day, John says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee. Plea: The jilted boyfriend said there is  nothing 'sinister' about his plan and is looking for a 'new friend' to join him on his trip of a lifetime . He said: 'I'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - I suppose I've got to respect her honesty. 'But I'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by. 'When I found out at the travel agent I could only get half my money back I was looking at other deals and places I could go but I thought, 'No, I wanted to go on this holiday'. 'I called my best friend and he agreed so I headed straight to his house to make the ebay page. 'Everyone I know is taken and I'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that I'd never otherwise get to meet. 'I'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before. 'I'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday. If the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too. 'I really thought that I would only get about £100 on ebay - enough to pay the £50 name change fee and a bit of spending money. 'I can't believe how well it was going. So if you're up for a laugh and fancy a fantastic holiday - let me know!' Prize: The winning bidder, as long as it is a woman, will get to spend two weeks with John here at the Blue Bay Villas Hotel in the Dominican Republic . After being overwhelmed with the response, John has pledged to donate any money over £1,050 to testicular cancer research. He added: 'People have said I've got real balls to do this so I thought I might as well try and make some money for charity if I can to.' The flight leaves Manchester for Peurto Plata on Monday, February 16 at 9.45 and arrives back at 05.35 on March 3, 2015. Accommodation is four 14 nights at the four star Blue Bay Villas in Playa Dorado and interested bidders can find the ebay auction HERE .","John Whitbread, 32, wants a new woman to join him on February holiday .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has claimed that his team are defending well, despite their 5-3 humiliation at Leicester. United head into Saturday’s home game with West Ham at Old Trafford still reeling from Sunday’s embarrassment and missing 10 players through injury and suspension. Van Gaal says he is determined to get to the root cause of the physical problems his players are suffering and is looking at the club’s day-to-day training methods in minute detail. Louis van Gaal says his Manchester United have defended well bar last Sunday's match at Leicester . Van Gaal admits he has a selection headache of Manchester United's home clash against West Ham . Van Gaal was a frustrated figure as Manchester United (centre) capitulated to Leicester 5-3 on Sunday . Manchester United have conceded eight goals in five Premier League matches this season and 12 in all competitions following their 4-0 Capital One Cup second round thrashing at MK Dons. 16 Aug - Man Utd 1-2 SWANSEA . 24 Aug - SUNDERLAND 1-1 Man Utd . 26 Aug - MK DONS 4-0 Man Utd . 30 Aug - BURNLEY 0-0 Man Utd . 14 Sep - Man Utd 4-0 QPR . 21 Sep - LEICESTER 5-3 Man Utd . However, the Dutch coach still feels there has been an over-reaction to events at Leicester, which saw his team concede a 3-1 advantage in the final half-hour to suffer one of their worst Barclays Premier League defeats in recent memory. Asked if he felt any sense of panic, Van Gaal said: ‘No. It is happening, it’s about overcoming it. It’s not a regular occurrence when you see our figures in the Premier League. Except (for) this match, we are defending well, our average is less than one and we scored a lot of goals. ‘I think we are fifth or sixth in terms of goals, I don’t know. I see the difficulty as, more or less, a lot of journalists. I say only that you are looking the other way. Maybe you can listen very carefully. Defender Jonny Evans will miss Saturday's match after being substituted against Leicester with an injury . Chris Smalling has come in for criticism in the heart of United's defence . England defender Phil Jones (left) is also ruled out of Saturday's match with a hamstring injury . ‘We have had some wins and should have (had more) wins. When you are 3-1 ahead after 60 minutes you have to win. Then we are two points off second in the table. But because of the loss we are sitting here and you are talking like that and questioning me like that. ‘If we had won this game it was a different story, so you don’t have to make an incident sound as if it is a regular basis. We will overcome and the season lasts more than one competition day.’ Van Gaal confirmed Sportsmail’s story from Thursday that defender Chris Smalling had become the latest player to break down in training. Smalling will join Jonny Evans and Phil Jones on the sidelines, while Tyler Blackett is suspended after being sent off at the King Power Stadium. The manager added: ‘I have to admit that I’m never in this situation before, so that’s strange, and that is also what I have said in former press conferences. Van Gaal added that he believes United can finish in the top three or four this season . VIDEO United can still be successful - Rooney . Evans (centre) has a badly bruised bone and van Gaal says he won't take any risks with him . ‘For me it’s difficult to understand, because we are evaluating what we can do in a different way, but you have to train on a certain level because otherwise you can’t play a game. ‘I’ve already said I will adapt to a certain level but I cannot train lower because then you can’t perform in the right way. ‘We have a lot of injuries, nine injuries now, and Blackett suspended, so that means that 10 are out. All the three right sided centre halves are out. ‘Evans is a very difficult thing. His bone is bruised a lot and we have to wait and see — and evaluate. ‘Smalling, yesterday in a training session he ran out because he had stiff legs so we’ll wait and see what that’s meaning, but I don’t take risks. You have to be fit and I always trust younger players. ‘So I have to go to the youth team to pick players and I have also said that in former press conferences. The younger players can pick their chances now and that’s also the policy of this club. I have read that differently in the media, but it’s like that. Tyler Blackett (right) was sent off for United during their humbling at the King Power Stadium . Van Gaal read his team the riot act after Sunday’s defeat but refused to blame them for one of the most bizarre United performances of recent times. He added: ‘I don’t think my players are robots, they are human beings and I think that human beings make errors and faults. I’m a manager who always wants to evaluate and discuss. That’s the way I do it and I have done it this week also. ‘The young players are always ready. They have hunger to play. Manchester United youth education has a certain level that can provide that. ‘It’s a big difference from youth level to Premier League but in one game you can show yourself better than regular.’ Asked if this was the hardest challenge he had faced in his career, Van Gaal was candid. He said: ‘At this moment, maybe, but you have to see in a year and not in one week when we have nine injuries and a red card. I don’t think that you can judge the effect. ‘As a manager you already know in advance that it’s a big challenge and this club is in a transition. Now we are in very difficult circumstances again but we can win.’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.","Louis van Gaal has hit back at criticism of Manchester United's defence .

"A Queensland woman who was dumped by her husband when he left her a note while she was at work is auctioning off his half of a planned romantic getaway to Bali. Sarah-Jane Bell, from north Brisbane near Caboolture, is looking for a new travel partner after she booked a surprise holiday to the Indonesian holiday island with her husband, but he left her by leaving a note on the bed. The 24-year-old posted an ad to eBay offering to sell return flights and accommodation in Kuta for anyone willing to spend nine days with a 'complete stranger'. Scroll down for video . Sarah-Jane, from Brisbane, is selling her estranged husband's half of a holiday to Bali on eBay . Ms Bell said she returned home on September 20 last year to find that her husband (pictured left) had gone . Ms Bell said she was shocked when she returned home on September 20 last year to find that her husband - who she does not wish to identify - had left her a note saying he was no longer in love after eight years together. 'He still isn't able to give me a definitive answer as to why he left and why he doesn't love me anymore,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's pretty gut wrenching to be honest but everything happens for a reason and I've tried to put a positive spin on the whole thing.' Ms Bell, who said the couple got married in 2012 on their six-year anniversary, added she had no idea the break up was coming. 'He'd been working away from home quite a lot last year, which put a bit of turmoil on our relationship, but I thought we were stronger than that,' she said. Ms Bell said following the split she offered the Bali trip to three of her closest friends but when they weren't available she decided to take a gamble and sell it on eBay. The 24-year-old's husband - who she had been with since she was 16 - left her a note on the bed . The 24-year-old is selling return flights and accommodation for nine nights in Kuta to the highest bidder . 'Unfortunately, due to a series of unfavourable circumstances, my husband decided to pack up and call it quits, leaving a note on the bed when I returned from work,' she wrote in the listing. 'The rest is history, and that's why I have opted for the exciting option of none other but to AUCTION the return flight and accommodation with myself right here!'

"A high-altitude research facility that became the coldest of Cold War relics has opened to curious tourists after decades of secrecy. The massive Stratosphere Chamber was designed under the direction of bouncing bomb inventor Sir Barnes Wallis in 1946. Researchers used the unique laboratory to test aircraft in frigid conditions experienced at 70,000ft – the target altitude for a new supersonic plane designed by Sir Wallis.

"The targeting of supermarkets over the sale of kosher foods risks importing Middle Eastern violence to the UK, leaders of Britain’s Jewish communities warned last night. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council (JLC), which includes the heads of Britain’s main Jewish organisations, last night condemned boycotts and intimidation as ‘especially troubling’ for British Jews. Their joint intervention came after anti-Israel protesters caused ugly scenes at a branch of Tesco over the weekend, while Sainsbury’s pre-emptively removed kosher foods from a central London  store amid fears demonstrators would ransack the shop. Leaders of Britain's Jewish communities have condemned protests over the sale of Kosher food. Pictured: Kosher goods were . removed from Sainsbury's Holborn amid fears . demonstrators would ransack the store . The Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council warned retailers that boycotting products, as Sainsbury's did yesterday, 'gives the message that violence and intimidation work' In both cases, protesters were accused of stirring up racial division. An upsurge of anti-Semitic incidents have been recorded in Britain and other parts of Europe since the outbreak of fighting in Gaza earlier this summer. Sainsbury’s in particular was accused of tacit anti-Semitism for apparently bowing to intimidation. They said: ‘The protesters behind this campaign have no interest in securing a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians and through such actions, risk importing the Middle East conflict to the UK, dividing local communities.’ The statement adds: ‘The community calls on retailers not to discriminate against or boycott any goods, products or suppliers, which would give the message that violence and intimidation work – an especially troubling situation for Jewish people in the UK.’ Gillian Merron, chief executive of the Board of Deputies, added: ‘Our shops are no place for a political battle ground. As a society we should be bringing communities together – importing conflict through produce on the shelves will neither serve us, nor the prospects of peace for the Israelis or Palestinians.’ Simon Johnson, chief executive of the JLC said: ‘We fully support the freedom of retailers to operate their businesses peacefully and without intimidation, and call upon retailers to act responsibly and avoid the retail environment being used to delegitimize the State of Israel.’ Anti-Israeli protestors ran amok in a Tesco store in Birmingham over the sale of Kosher food. Police officers were allegedly attacked and stock was thrown around the store . Several officers were pictured outside the Birmingham Tesco during the demonstration. The statement from leaders said that shops 'are no place for a political battle ground' They specifically challenged trades unions to distance themselves from the protests which prompted one branch of Sainsbury’s in central London temporarily to clear its shelves of kosher food amid fears that anti-Israel protesters were about to ransack the shop. Last night the TUC spoke out against intimidation of shop workers and Usdaw, which represents retailers, said it supported its members in protecting their safety and their livelihoods. The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, are among religious leaders to have condemned anti-Semitic attacks in recent weeks. Last night the National Union of Students, which supports a boycott of companies with links to the Israeli military, was asked to explicitly condemn the targeting of shops. It issued a short statement explaining its boycott policy and adding: ‘NUS has reaffirmed its commitment to raising awareness of and combating all forms of racism including but not limited to, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, that may and have occurred in response to recent events in Israel and Palestine.’","Anti-Israel protestors 'wreaked havoc' at Tesco in Birmingham on Saturday .

"Bill Cosby may have been caught on camera committing an alleged sex assault on a young model at the Playboy mansion, a lawyer for the victim has told DailyMail.com. In a bombshell development the lawyer claims detectives at the Los Angeles Police Department will want to search Hugh Hefner’s luxury home after it emerges that he operates a secret high-tech camera system inside the vast LA property. This comes as three new women who allege they were victims of Bill Cosby are set to give a press conference today and actress Phylicia Rashad has claimed that accusations Cosby attacked at least 23 women, including models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson, were part of an 'orchestrated plan' to ruin his TV career. Rashad played Clair Huxtable in the long-running Cosby Show. Bill Cosby, 77, has denied the allegations made against him and has not been charged. He is scheduled to appear at the Centre in the Square in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada tonight. Attack: Cosby is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting then 18-year-old model Chloe Goins in one of the mansion’s bedrooms six years ago during a Playboy summer party . Bestie: Cosby and Hefner are longtime buddies and Cosby was a frequent guest at the Playboy Mansion . Setting the scene: Florida attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents alleged Cosby victim Chloe Goins, believes Hefner had cameras installed in all the main areas of the house as a security measure some years ago, but significantly it’s believed he also installed cameras in the guest bedrooms . Florida attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents alleged Cosby victim Chloe Goins, believes Hefner had cameras installed in all the main areas of the house as a security measure some years ago, but significantly it’s believed he also installed cameras in the guest bedrooms. Cosby is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting 18-year-old model Goins in one of the mansion’s bedrooms six years ago during a Playboy summer party. Goins, now 24 and living in Las Vegas, claims the comic legend spiked her drink with a sedative before luring her to a bedroom where he sexually assaulted her. She told DailyMail.com how she woke up naked in a drug haze as Cosby, with his pants down at his ankles, licked her toes and groped her in a sickening assault. Kuvin says police will want to check whether or not Cosby was unwittingly caught on one of Hefner’s cameras as he allegedly assaulted Goins. At the very least the security cameras would have captured the moment the TV comic met Goins at the party before allegedly leading her away to a guest bedroom, a claim Cosby's lawyers deny. Kuvin told DailyMail.com that several sources have told him about the secret camera system. He claims that the police are fully aware of it and have ‘requested video in the past’, adding that they will search the Playboy mansion for any new footage. Kuvin said: ‘I have uncovered, through several former Playmates, the fact there are recording devices within the mansion and in some of the bedrooms. ‘What we think is going to happen is that police will be initiating a search warrant soon on the Playboy mansion and hopefully obtaining some of that evidence because we believe that Mr Hefner saved a lot of that material.’ Kuvin said he hasn’t reached out to the LAPD with the new information because, he says, ‘they already know’. Goins will make a full statement to police over the alleged attack and describe the chilling assault . The alleged attack on Goins happened in 2008 meaning Cosby could face a criminal prosecution since it is within the statute of limitations. She is due to meet with LAPD detectives this month to give her statement. Since Goins has told of her alleged assault, it also emerged that several more women who claim to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby have come forward sparking a ‘definitive open investigation’ by LAPD, a lawyer for one of the victims claimed. The new victims claim to have been subjected to sex attacks by Cosby but have asked to remain anonymous. DailyMail.com has spoken to former Playboy model Jill Ann Spaulding, who lived at the mansion in 2001, to verify the existence of the camera system. She said: ‘I believe it’s true. When I first arrived at the mansion I was told by the other girls - when they told me about the house rules – they said there were cameras in most of the rooms, including the master bedroom. ‘Hefner installed the cameras to make sure he didn’t get sued, you know, to show that no one was in there unwillingly. ‘I was taken upstairs to the second floor and there was a whole room full of surveillance that I walked by. ‘It made sense, it’s a business running there. ‘The cameras were pointing inside the house not just outside.’ Spaulding, 44, wrote a book called ‘Jill Ann: Upstairs’, a shocking, behind the scenes expose of what goes on upstairs at Hefner's mansion. King of the Castle: Hugh Hefner has not responded to requests for comment about his surveillance system . Playboy Playmate Victoria Valentino – one of Cosby’s many alleged victims - also suspected that the house was rigged with cameras. But while she didn’t know for sure she recalls a luncheon where guests were told Hef was ‘listening in’. ‘I go up to the house at least four times a year and although I’ve never seen any I have always suspected that we were on camera. ‘I remember attending a luncheon there and Hef’s son told us his dad wasn’t joining us because he was unwell. ‘But his son said Hef would be “listening in”, that’s as far as my knowledge goes, but I took that to mean the room had equipment to record what was going on.’ Valentino added that it would ‘make sense’ for Hefner to have the home wired up in case anything happened that he later needed to check. Valentino, 71, was 19 when Playboy magazine picked her as Playmate of the Month for September 1963. She has kept in touch with Hefner ever since and still attends regular luncheons and events at the Playboy mansion. Kuvin now hopes Hefner has kept any historical video footage dating back to 2008. He believes the evidence will be the breakthrough the police need to nail Cosby – now the subject of more than 25 accusations of rape and sex attacks on women. Kuvin says he will accompany Goins to her interview with LAPD detectives. He added: ‘Chloe is a wreck right now and we’re working with the authorities in Los Angeles to get her in to give them her story and that should be happening soon.’ Playboy model Jill Ann Spaulding told DailyMail.comsaid: ‘When I first arrived at the mansion I was told by the other girls - when they told me about the house rules – they said there were cameras in most of the rooms, including the master bedroom . Former Playboy Playmate Victoria Valentino – one of Cosby’s many alleged victims - also suspected that the house was rigged with cameras. She attends a luncheon at the Mansion several times a year . Goins will make a full statement to police over the attack, a chilling sexual assault. The allegation is the latest to hit the comedian, 77, who has seen his reputation as one of America's most significant comedy figures eviscerated in recent months. He is now facing of dozens of allegations of rape or sexual assault – many dating back 30 or 40 years - but until now all appeared to be covered by statutes of limitation. Goins, originally from San Diego, and a girlfriend, were introduced to Hefner and Cosby shortly after arriving at the party at the Playboy Mansion in the summer of 2008. The then 70-year-old comedian began lavishing blonde Goins with attention. The star then went to get her an alcoholic drink, but soon after drinking it, Goins claims she started to feel ‘foggy’ and ‘sick’ and Cosby offered to show her to a bedroom where she could rest. The next thing the model remembers is waking up completely undressed while a half-naked Cosby licked her toes and masturbated. Goins said she is sure Cosby had been licking her breasts and groping her body as well. She said: 'I remember waking up and feeling moist all over, like he had been licking all over me. 'He wasn't on my breasts when I woke, but I could feel, you know, the saliva on them and that he'd been licking on me. 'I felt embarrassed, it was a gross, icky feeling, I felt very violated and humiliated. 'I was scared, I was just 18 and he was an old man, I was not very sexually experienced and I didn't really know what had happened, it was violating.' Cosby quickly jumped up when she woke, pulled his pants up and left without saying anything, Goins claims. She didn’t report it at the time as she was scared of getting into trouble or ruining her modelling career. Goins’ complaint and the prospect the alleged attack was caught on camera will be a huge blow to aging Cosby, whose reputation is already in tatters. Goins is the first accuser whose allegations are not covered by the statute of limitations. Reps for Playboy didn’t respond to requests for comment. The LAPD declined to comment.","Chloe Goins says Bill Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion six years ago when she was 18 .

"The fatal shooting on Saturday in Ferguson of unarmed teenager Michael Brown has caused more than a decade of seething racial tensions between the police and public in the St. Louis suburb to finally boil over. Indeed, in this town of 21,000 people, of which two-thirds are African American, their now beleaguered police force of 53 can only claim to have three officers who are black. Worse still, an annual report last year from Missouri's attorney general found that in Ferguson, if you were African American, you were twice as likely to be arrested during a traffic stop than a white person. Scroll down for video . Ominous: Police advance through smoke. Protests in the St. Louis suburb rocked by racial unrest since a white police officer shot an unarmed black teenager to death turned violent on Wednesday night . Residents in Ferguson have become so used to this that they have dubbed it DWB, or driving while black. According to Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, while blacks make up 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, they account for 86 percent of the traffic stops made last year. And according to The Washington Post,  92 percent of those stops end with an arrest for the black driver. Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by a police officer on Saturday night. The teen, who was about to start college, was unarmed . Last year, the NAACP filed a federal complaint against the St. Louis County police department, who are currently working with Ferguson's force to quell the nightly riots, over huge disparities in arrests. The Washington Post also claims that a former lieutenant with the county police was fired in 2013 after an internal investigation found he had told officers to specifically target black people across the county. After this troubling discovery, St. Louis County Executive asked for all recent arrest statistics to discover the depth of racial profiling. The problems apparent in the violent clashes between heavily armed white SWAT officers and angry African American protestors began roughly a decade ago in Ferguson. In 2000, blacks counted slightly over half of Ferguson's population, while white people accounted for 44 percent. Now, white people make up only 30 percent of the population, but nearly 100 percent of the police force. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged the structural problems in his department. No backing down: People protest as tear gas canisters detonate around them as SWAT teams attempted to disperse the crowd of protestors on Wednesday night . 'Apparently, there has been this undertow that has bubbled to the surface,' Jackson said on Wednesday. 'It’s our priority to address it and to fix what’s been going wrong.' 'I’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,' Jackson said on Wednesday to The Washington Post. 'Race relations is a top priority right now.' But while Jackson is claiming he wants to listen now, other residents of Ferguson are saying it is too late. 'People here are angry, frustrated,' said Corey Crawford, 36 to The Washington Post. 'There needs to be justice. If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover.' Across the country there is though an understanding that something must be done. St. Louis County asked researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles to help improve their perceived racial profiling and to work on their procedures. However, distrust is still strong. Much work to do: Police Chief Thomas Jackson speaks during a news conference at the police headquarters in Ferguson, Missouri . Slogans: A march organized by area ministers makes its way down W. Florissant in Ferguson as citizens protested a white police officer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in the St. Louis suburb . Peaceful: A march organized by area ministers makes its way down W. Florissant in Ferguson, on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014 . Take Jackson's refusal to confirm how many times Brown was shot for example. He has categorically refused to do so and more importantly, name the officer who fired up to eight times at the 18-year-old. Police claim their was a physical confrontation after Brown refused to obey the police officers, other eyewitnesses claim that Brown was essentially executed while he had his hands in the air. While Jackson said he wanted to mend fences with the community, protesters were on the streets of Ferguson again Wednesday, facing heavily armed police who at time trained weapons on them from an armored truck. Jackson has faced mounting demands from protesters, clergy and even hackers to reveal the identity of the officer who shot Brown. Jackson argues that revealing that detail could bring retribution to the officer. Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street. They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account. Stand off: Police in riot gear watch protesters in Ferguson before violent clashes erupted . Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries. Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it ""ricocheted"" back, apparently upsetting the officer. Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing. He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly. Some protesters Wednesday raised their arms above their heads as they faced the police. Others held signs asking for answers about Brown's death. The most popular chant has been, 'Hands up! Don't shoot!' Brown's body remained on the street for hours - a span Jackson deemed ""uncomfortable"" but justified, given that 'you only get one chance at that crime scene' to process it correctly. Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear in a nearby building. In the shooting's aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for burrowing into the city website and shutting it down for much of the day Monday. The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings.","Tensions between predominantly white police force in Ferguson and majority black population have been growing for years .

"We've been waiting more than two decades for the iconic hoverboard from Back To The Future II to become a reality, and finally it's arrived - perfectly on cue. It's the year 2015 when Marty McFly and Doc are awestruck by the amazing futuristic skateboard in the  film classic - but what they couldn't have predicted in 1989 is that the hoverboard would be so much more than offer a nifty (yet rather dangerous) way to zip around town. It would also hold the secret to having a core of steel - and, officially called the Drift, be one of 2015's hottest new fitness gadgets. Scroll down for video . The future has arrived! It was 2015 when the Marty and Doc discovered the iconic hoverboard in Back To The Future II and now it's real-life incarnation has arrived in the form of the Drift (right) The clever device was dreamed up by Quirky, a brand that specialise in new inventions. After hearing people complain about their achy calves after snow boarding, they realised the key to minimising pain was improving balance. Unfortunately the gadget isn't quite as futuristic as Marty McFly's and a peek underneath  reveals an adjustable ball-and-pendulum balancing mechanism. According to the brand's spokesman: 'This allows for a unique range of motion while its moving roller-arm lets the rider rock, roll and pivot.' Drift simulates a variety of action sports which they say helps strengthen the core, improve balance, burn calories, and increase lower body strength. Those clever people at Quirky say 30 minutes on the board is equivalent to an hour snowboarding or surfing. Thirty minutes on the hoverboard-style Drift gadget is equivalent to an hour snowboarding or surfing . Drift simulates a variety of action sports which helps strengthen the core, improve balance and burn calories . The drift, which retails here at £149.99, has already been in a hit in America and has just started hitting gyms in the the UK. According to personal trainer Andrew Flint, the device could improve both balance and core stability: 'I would say both those are key aspects of health and fitness. 'Core stability is important in all sport - except perhaps darts. 'We use the hips as the main driver for most sports and this would directly tie into the driver of your hips. It could also help with coordination. 'In terms of burning calories, there are more effective ways of going about it. Your traditional treadmill or high-intensity interval training, for example, both have higher calorie burning ability. Futuristic? An adjustable ball-and-pendulum balancing mechanism allows for a unique range of motion . 'Core work will improve strength but won't give you a superficial six pack. Having good core stability is not usually hugely visible but will enable you to be fitter.' Andy advises  integrating the device into a fitness programme. 'It could be a good add-on to a regime, but not a stand alone workout,' he says. 'Unfortunately that ten minute workout that does everything hasn’t yet been developed - and probably never will.' Here's hoping there are some budding Docs out there who will prove the experts wrong.

"A skiing holiday is not always about the slopes. At least, not for everyone - and not entirely for me. If that sounds enticing, then pretty Megeve in the French Alps is for you. It is dotted with wooden chalets and has its own Alpine village scene going on: bars serving jazz with hot wine, interior design shops with rustic furniture and shaggy throws, a giant Christmas tree in the main square which stays up all season, horse-and-carriage rides, Michelin-starred restaurants, wonderfully cossetting hotels and aristocratic heritage. Fabulously fashionable: Megeve has been a magnet for chic skiers since the Twenties . How Megeve looks now is partly down to Baroness Maurice de Rothschild - or Baroness Mimi, as she was known. In the Twenties, the Baroness - determined to create a glamorous resort which would rival St Moritz - alighted upon the Savoyard farming village beneath Mont Blanc. She and a young architect, Henry Jacques Le Meme, built the first ski chalet, Le Meme, now a hotel, then 200 further chalets. Early ski-lifts, a golf course and airport followed. After World War II, so did the smart set, the author and artist Jean Cocteau and Brigitte Bardot among them. So popular and prestigious was the resort, Cocteau referred to it as the ‘21st arrondissement of Paris’. Plenty of reasons to blow the budget: Megeve's shops are just as alluring as its ski slopes . Cocteau’s favourite spot was the hotel Mont Blanc, now owned by hotel firm Sibuet. Here, in the art deco resturant with its Cocteau mural, you can slip into a more sultry era. Megeve has plenty to recommend it. First, it’s just over an hour’s drive to Geneva Airport, so you can pop over for the weekend, as the fur-clad couples from Manchester tell me they do all winter long. Second, it is beautifully placed beneath Mont Blanc, and offers 201 miles of pistes, which are ideal for intermediate skiers such as me. The views are sensational, the runs are wide and there are plenty of my favourite types of slope - the wooded blues - and lots of lunch opportunities. Hot and cold: Le Lodge Park (left) offers welcome warmth after a long day on Megeve's often gentle slopes . At 1895 m, L’Alpette is a lofty spot to warm up over a plate of macaroni cheese with truffles. There is a fromagerie and a dessert buffet. Light lunching this is not. But that ‘bon voyage’ glass of Eau de Vie will fire you through an afternoon’s skiing. Truffles are a theme. I eat them - on pasta, pizza, in mashed potato, scrambled egg, on nuts - by the truck load. Those French women who don’t get fat must be skiing hard. Megeve is known as the home of French skiing. There aren’t many Britons and it is very chic. Blu and Berry, in the village, offers designer labels such as Isabel Marant and Celine. And fur is standard on and off the slopes. But you do not need extra layers in my hotel, Le Lodge Park, where the very best spot is in the bar, by the fireside. Swagged with tartan, checks and cowhide chairs, it is easy to settle down for cocktails served in twinkling copper cups. Suitably stylish: The Hotel Mont Blanc is one of Megeve's most elegant hideaways - and a great place to eat . The hotel is one of five in Megeve owned by the Sibuet group. It positively shouts kitsch Alpine charm, but is comfortable and fun rather than cheesy. There is a spa offering treatments with Sibuet’s own brand, Pure Altitude. And if the glamorous owner, Jocelyne Sibuet is anything to go by, those creams must work. Or maybe it is all those truffles and that very crisp mountain air. Flexiski (020 8939 0894, www.flexiski.com) offers three nights’ B&B at the Hotel Le Lodge Park, Megeve, from £990 per person (based on two people sharing) including flights to Geneva, all taxes and airport transfers.","French ski resort has been a magnet for chic skiers since the Twenties .

"Veteran CBS news correspondent Steve Kroft enjoyed a string of hotel liaisons and exchanged raunchy texts with a New York City lawyer during a three-year affair, according to reports. The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Harvard-educated  Lisan Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, according to the National Enquirer. The magazine claimed that, while Goines called off the relationship because Kroft was becoming too selfish, they were spotted out together on December 17 - just blocks from the Upper West Side home he shares with his wife, Jennet Conant, author of 'A Covert Affair'. The Enquirer, which also printed photos of Goines, 41, and Kroft, 69, together in the street, noted that they were seen kissing in the back of a cab before they spent the night at five-star hotel. Scroll down for video . 'Serious lapse in judgment': CBS correspondent Steve Kroft, pictured left with his wife, journalist and author Jennet Conant, has admitted to having an affair with New York lawyer Lisan Goines, pictured right . When confronted with the report by the New York Post, Kroft admitted to the relationship, calling it 'a serious lapse of personal judgment' that had hurt his wife and family. 'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he said. The affair reportedly started in 2011 when Kroft spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the bar at the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend. While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, ""I have to see you again"",' a source said. A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported. Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work. 'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied. In another message, he told her: 'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. 'Mistress': 41-year-old Goines, who is also married, met 69-year-old Kroft in a hotel bar in 2011 . Together: Kroft, pictured with his wife in May 2014, said they were working hard to get past the affair . He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly resonded:  'U all over and deep inside of me,' she reportedly responded. Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it. But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said. She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added. 'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said. They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17. The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. Questions: Kroft, pictured left in 1992 with Al Gore (center) and Bill Clinton (right) famously confronted Clinton about his womanizing during an interview during his election campaign in 1992 . He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'. The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John. Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years. His reporting has earned him three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, including a lifetime achievement award. He told the New York Post that his 'personal failure' has no impact on his job as a journalist.

"More than 400 red triangle-shaped pills - each embossed with the Superman 'S' logo - were tested after being found in Ipswich by Suffolk Police . A deadly batch of ecstasy pills that have been linked to the deaths of four men contained a dangerous chemical that is stronger than those normally found in the drug. More than 400 red triangle-shaped pills - each embossed with the Superman 'S' logo - were tested after being found in Ipswich by Suffolk Police. They were found to contain PMMA, a chemical that can take several hours to work. Its slow release can prompt some users to take double the amount they would if taking MDMA-based ecstasy. Symptoms experienced by users include include initial shaking and sweating, which can develop into a rapid temperature increase, severely raised heart rate and blood pressure. When combined with alcohol or dehydration, these can prove fatal. The drugs are believed to have led to the recent deaths of two young men in Ipswich, Suffolk, one in nearby Rendlesham and a fourth in Telford, Shropshire. The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve. Police are linking his death with that of Gediminas Kulokas, 24, also from Ipswich, who died on New Year's Day. The death of Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire - the only one outside of Suffolk - is also believed to have been connected. Kulokas died less than three hours after another man, 20-year-old John Hocking, also a labourer, who died in nearby Rendlesham, near Woodbridge. Two men have also been admitted to hospital in Suffolk, possibly as a result of taking the drug. A 19-year-old appeared in court on Monday, charged with supplying the deadly drugs. Adrian Lubecki was remanded in custody at Magistrates' Court as his case was referred to Crown Court. John Hocking, 20, (left) died after taking the drug on New Year's Eve while Lithuanian factory worker, Justas Ropas (right), was found dead on Christmas Eve at the house he shares with friends in Ipswich . The reddish tablets are embossed with an 'S' Superman logo and come in either a round or triangular shape . A 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man from Ipswich were arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation. Officers have offered amnesty to anyone prepared to hand in the tablets for testing in a desperate bid to get them off the streets. Today, Suffolk Police said it had tested the pills and found PMMA, a stronger and more dangerous active ingredient than those usually found in pure ecstasy. Alan Murray, Suffolk County Council's cabinet member for health and adult care, said: 'These pills contain potentially lethal ingredients which as we have seen can have tragic consequences. 'We would urge people under no circumstances to take these or any other illegal drugs. 'This is a slow release drug taking several hours to work, and then lasting for several hours. 'Symptoms include initial shaking and sweating, which can develop into a rapid temperature increase, severely raised heart rate and blood pressure. Police believe the deaths of the three men in Ipswich may be linked after they were called to three addresses across the town in the space of one week (pictured) 'When combined with alcohol or dehydration, this can prove fatal.' 'If you have taken illegal drugs, or if you know someone who has become unwell after taking illegal drugs and needs urgent medical care, call 999 immediately and ask for the ambulance service.' Police are urging anyone in possession of the pills to hand them in to prevent further deaths or harm. Despite this appeal, so far no drugs have been handed into the force. Superintendent Louisa Pepper said: 'Our absolute priority is to prevent anyone else from suffering the tragic consequences of these drugs, by removing them from our communities. 'We're urging anyone who has tablets matching this description not to take them or pass them on, and to hand them in to us or one of the agencies listed. 'We successfully seized a large quantity of drugs at the weekend but there may still be some out there, so if you are offered them or have any information about these tablets, please contact us immediately.'

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has warned Australians to expect more attacks like the one which has shattered the peace in Paris and resulted in the fatal shooting of 12 people at the office of a satirical newspaper. In calling it an 'unspeakable atrocity', Mr Abbott urged Australians not to let the events 'change our way of life'. 'We have a strong presence in the Middle East to tackle the death cult at its source,' he said. 'The Paris shooting is an absolute atrocity but sadly we can expect more of this. We will defend our way of life, we will defend our values and freedoms.' Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott condemned the barbaric act as an unspeakable atrocity but warned Australians on Thursday that they should be prepared for more terror attacks . Terrorists killed 12 people in the massacre at Parisian magazine Charlie Hebdo . Heavily armed men shouting 'Allahu Akbar' stormed the French headquarters of Charlie Hedbo on Wednesday, killing a dozen people in what French President Francois Hollande called 'undoubtedly a terrorist attack'. The assault sparked a massive man hunt as the two gunmen managed to escape, executing a wounded police officer as they fled. The weekly newspaper had a history of causing controversy with cartoons of Islam's prophet Mohammed. In an earlier post on Twitter on Thursday, Mr Abbott labelled the attack an 'atrocity'. 'If you don't like something, you don't read it; you don't kill people you disagree with,' the tweet said. Mr Abbott also said 'freedom of expression is the cornerstone of a free society' re-affirmed Australia's high terror alert. 'The Government condemns the atrocity in Paris overnight,' Mr Abbott's stated. In a mass show of solidarity, thousands gathered in the streets of Paris to pay their respects to those killed . 'The thoughts of all Australians are with the families of those who have lost their lives in this barbaric act. 'Australia stands with the people and the government of France at this difficult time.' The attack comes less than a month after lone gunman Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage during a deadly siege in a Sydney cafe. Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the violent conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16. The Government condemns the atrocity in Paris overnight. The thoughts of all Australians are with the families of those who have lost their lives in this barbaric act. Freedom of expression is the cornerstone of a free society. The Government will continue to do all it can to protect our community from terrorism. Our National Terrorism Alert level remains at High, which means a terrorist attack is likely. Our security agencies are assessing the situation for security implications to Australia but there is no information to suggest that there is an imminent threat to Australia as a result of the Paris atrocity. All Australians should remain vigilant, and again, I urge people who see or hear something that they feel is not right, to contact the National Security Hotline immediately on 1800 123 400.

"British model and presenter Alexa Chung has added yet another string to her already-impressive bow, making her musical debut in a new short film directed by Gia Coppola. The video, which was shot at Coppola's home in the Hollywood Hills, was created exclusively for online retailer MyTheresa.com as part of their new Tunes campaign in order to promote the 31-year-old New York-based model's new Alexa Chung for AG denim collection. Appropriately, the leggy brunette is seen singing her own version of Stevie Nicks' 1994 hit Blue Denim in the clip, and also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at herself; Chung's karaoke performance is seen clearing a crowded party after she insists on repeating the song over and over again. Scroll down for video . Musical talent: Model Alexa Chung, 31, showcases her impressive singing voice in the new short film, which was created in order to promote her new denim collaboration . Fashion-forward: In the clip, which was directed by Gia Coppola, the Brit is seen modeling a dress from her Alexa Chung for AG denim collection . 'Oh no, not again, please,' one party-goer is overheard saying as the opening chords of the song begin to play. 'It's like the 90th time that she has played this song,' a second person adds. 'She's so cute, but she's singing it again,' a woman chimes in. 'How many times have you heard this song.' Chung boldly ignores the frustrated glares from her fellow guests and continues with her rendition, throwing herself into the performance and swaying in time to the music, not once needing to glance at the screen behind her, which bears the classic song's iconic lyrics. Despite the lighthearted comedy aspects to her performance however, it's clear that Chung's interest in music extends beyond the realms of this one short film. In fact, the former MTV presenter actually recorded a version of the hit at a studio in New York, before stepping in front of the camera to film with Coppola. Dancing queen: Throughout the short film, Chung dances around to Stevie Nicks' 1994 classic Blue Denim . Chart-topper in the making? As well as performing the song in the video, Chung also recorded a version of it while in New York . Dream team: The clip was made exclusively for online retailer MyTheresa.com, who enlisted the help of Pao Alto director Gia Coppola . 'The choice of song was inspired by Alexa’s new collaborative collection of denim pieces with LA based label AG,' a spokesperson from MyTheresa.com said. 'Alexa Chung’s Blue Denim was recorded in New York in November 2014 and produced by famed musician Dev Hynes. 'To accompany the track mytheresa.com commissioned Gia Coppola to direct the music clip, shot entirely in her Hollywood Hills home.' Although impressive, Chung's performance is by no means the first time that a fashion superstar has dipped their toe into the music industry. In particular, model turned actress Cara Delevingne has made no secret of her desire to pursue a career in music - and has lent her husky singing voice to more than one high-profile fashion campaign. Guiding hand: Coppola directed Chung in the film, which was shot at her own home in the Hollywood Hills . Happy holidays: Chung has recently been posting images of herself and her close friends, including Pixie Geldof (pictured) enjoying a sun-soaked vacation in the Maldives . Most recently the 24-year-old model, who is close friends with Chung, performed a specially-written song with chart-topper Pharell Williams for a short film, titled Reincarnation, directed by Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld. But this short film is the first time that Chung has ever shared her own vocal talents with the world - and if the overwhelmingly positive response on Twitter is anything to go by, many are hoping it will not be the last. 'Alexa Chung is pretty skinny and funny and now she can sing as well this is so unfair,' one user wrote, while another added: 'Alexa Chung's ad for MyTheresa.com is so good. Now I wanna wear denim and sing karaoke.' The launch of the film comes just days after Chung was pictured enjoying a sun-soaked New Year's vacation in the Maldives alongside close friends Pixie Geldof, daughter of Bob Geldof, radio presenter Nick Grimshaw and model Daisy Lowe.","The clip was created exclusively for online retailer MyTheresa.com in order to promote her new Alexa Chung for AG denim collection .

"Lisa Payton, 28, headbutted another mother at her son's birthday party and left her with a broken nose, after their children had previously fallen out . A heavily pregnant mother-of-three headbutted a woman at a toddler's birthday party, leaving her with a broken nose, after their children had fallen out weeks before. Victoria Worrall needed surgery after the attack by Lisa Payton, which took place at Megaplay in Bradford where Payton was hosting a birthday party for her four-year-old son. A judge said Payton - who was eight months pregnant at the time - had carried out 'an appalling act of violence' in front of young children, and experienced a loss of self control that was not expected from a mother in the latter stages of pregnancy. Miss Worrall was taken to hospital after she was headbutted by Payton and knocked unconscious. During an earlier hearing Payton, 28, had pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm, and she was given a 12 month suspended prison sentence. Richard Gioserano, prosecuting, said the attack happened at a play-centre on September 14 last year where Payton was hosting a party for her son. He said that 28-year-old Payton and Miss Worrall knew each other because their partners were related. 'Both have young children,' said Mr Gioserano. 'Between their children there was some trouble about a week or so before that had left bad feeling unresolved.' The court was told there was an 'atmosphere' between the pair when Miss Worrall arrived, with dirty looks exchanged between the two mothers. As the situation escalated Payton began arguing with her own brother, throwing a jug of juice at him and hitting him with a beaker and a walking stick. 'Miss Worrall got up and went over to try and calm things down,' added Mr Gioserano. 'It did not work and there was another heated exchange between the complainant and the defendant. 'The defendant headbutted Miss Worrall, knocking her to the ground and knocking her momentarily unconscious.' Miss Worrall was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary after the attack. Judge Jonathan Rose said: 'This was an appalling piece of behaviour by a young woman who has never been in trouble before, who has been a hard-working woman and who, I have no doubt, is a loving mother. 'Yet, at a children's party, children witnessed your appalling act of violence where you carried out an assault on another woman.' He handed Payton a 12 month sentence, suspended for 18 months. Judge Rose added: 'On this particular day you, for whatever reason, allowed your temper to rise, your anger to rise, and it is that that finally spurred you to violence and a loss of self-control that one should not expect from someone of your age and a mother of children, and one who is in the latter stages of pregnancy.' Payton was given a 12 month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, at Bradford Crown Court . A victim impact statement read out in court said Miss Worrall had suffered pain, discomfort, anxiety and stress since the assault. Nikki Peers, defending, said Payton was eight months' pregnant at the time of the attack and was suffering a complicated pregnancy. 'She was under a lot of stress at the time,' said Miss Peers. 'She describes feeling threatened, intimidated and bullied within that family environment, and scared and vulnerable.' Miss Peers said Payton was of previous good character, was deeply ashamed of what happened, and that the incident was an 'absolute one-off'. It was also said that Payton, of Thornton, was a volunteer who cared for vulnerable people in society. Judge Rose handed Payton a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered her to do 180 hours of unpaid work. She must also pay a victim surcharge of £100.","Lisa Payton was eight months pregnant and hosting party for four-year-old .

"Daphne Guinness has launched an angry tirade against her grandmother's biographer, calling her a 'charlatan' in a furious Twitter outburst. The 47-year-old accused author Lyndsy Spence of being a 'scurrilous profiteer' after she penned a book about socialite Diana Mitford, the most controversial of the six Mitford sisters. In the series of tweets to her 93,500 followers, she also defended her grandmother - who famously fell for the charms of fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - for simply 'falling in love'. Scroll down for video .

Ms Spence, who is also the founder of the Mitford Society, has published Mrs Guinness: The Rise and Fall of Diana Mitford. Ms Guinness wrote: 'I am a Mitford and I detest you.' She then added: 'This is completely scurrilous. I am sick of people making money and writing about my family... I KNOW what they do NOT. 'My grandmother committed no crime, she fell in LOVE. And she was in prison for 4 years... aged 23... revising history is easy for CHARLATANS.' Ms Spence has since rebuffed Guinness' criticisms, insisting her book is 'one of the few which displays Diana in a sympathetic light'. Diana, known as Honks,  left her first husband Bryan Guinness and married the founder of the British Union of Fascists, Oswald Mosley. The socialite's descendent expressed her anger in a series of  tweets sent to her 93,500 followers . They tied the knot in a civil ceremony in Joseph Goebbels' drawing room in Berlin in 1936. Hitler was the only other guest. As a result, during World War Two, Diana was locked up as an enemy to the Allies in Holloway Prison. Mary S. Lovell, who has previously written a biography on the Mitford sisters, said Diana 'became arguably the most hated woman in England for a while'.

But Diana wasn't the only Mitford with polarising political views. Decca was once an outspoken supporter of communism while Unity was also a fan of Hitler. Both she and Diana attended the Nuremberg Nazi rally of 1933 and Unity was said to have become fascinated with the leader. Although many hated the sisters for their political alliances, others admired them for their wit and beauty. The last of the famous Mitford sisters, Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, died at the age of 94 in September.","47-year-old accused author Lyndsy Spence of being a 'scurrilous profiteer'

"Patrons have come out in droves in support of an iconic hotel refusing to serve cyclists due to a 'no-lycra' policy saying they lose their appetite at the sight of the acquired look. The overwhelming reaction was sparked after four lycra-clad cyclists were told they could not have brunch at the Raffles hotel in Perth on Sunday - despite being regular customers who had only just dined there the week before. Hotel patrons have expressed their disgust at the clothing that cyclists wear and are calling on the riders to wear looser clothing because their revealing attire puts them off their food. Scroll down for video . Hotel patrons blow up about cyclists wearing lycra to food venues saying the attire puts them off their meals . The overwhelming reaction follows lycra-clad cyclists being refused service at the Raffles Hotel in Perth . However, the hotel insists there was no such ban but just a miscommunication and that the real issue was with the bikes potentially causing a safety hazard along the footpath and encouraged cyclists to lobby the council for more bike racks outside the venue. 'This decision was never a dress code issue, and if dress was communicated as the reason by our staff then we apologise for the misunderstanding and assure everyone that this is not the case,' the hotel posted on its Facebook page. Described as the 'Lycra'd loonies', patrons lashed out on the post not only complaining about the revealing look but also the smell and sweat that they claim is left behind on the seats. 'Lycra'd loonies, after pedalling around the countryside for hours, tend to get a bit on the nose, and there's nothing worse than a bunch smelly, sweaty cyclists sitting near you to put you off your tucker, one patron said. 'A good move by the publican, but he'd better be ready for a flood of these Lycra'd loonies descending on him just to get some publicity.' Matt Mcguire said that he was at the pub on Saturday when three lycra clad riders came in for lunch. 'All fat in tight clothes thinking they are gunna be the next lance Armstrong. Ban them all from entering places like that it puts you off your food.' Riki Barron was also all for the lycra ban. 'Surely the issue is with old men..............not bike racks! good on ya raffles for banning them. Lycra isn't acceptable clothing,' he posted. Social media users also complained that cyclists leave sweat on the seats at pubs and cafes . The cyclists have been described as 'Lycra'd loonies' with one patron suggesting they open up their own cafe . While Kev Parkinson decided to share some practical tips with the cyclists. 'If you're riding for exercise, wear loose clothing, you'll get more wind resistance and a better workout. You won't look as ridiculous and can stop for food wherever you like mostly.' 'If you're racing then by all means, wear lycra for the aerodynamics, but you don't have time to stop for a hot milk drink.' Drew Jones suggested that the riders to 'stick to coffee shops'. Who wants to see fat old men having some mid-life fitness crisis busting their fat guts while parading their tackle at my eye level when I take a seat,' he posted. 'Although we all appreciate that you have taken the initiative to get fit please be considerate of others. 'Your clothing is quite revealing you have just ridden countless kilometres in the sun and some not all of you are on the nose.' Carmen Louise Stone echoed those sentiments. 'Why don't you do the polite thing like the rest of us and get out of your smelly exercise clothes and have a shower before heading somewhere for a pint or coffee?' she posted. 'I don't head to a restaurant or a coffee bar straight after the gym and I would be refused so why should you be treated differently because you have a hot shot bike and fancy clothes?' David Wilson suggested that cyclists open their own cafe. 'That way the rest of the public dont need to sit in the sweat of cyclists mid way through their exercise,' he said. 'Don't really want to have coffee while 5 men walk past with their lycra clad junk at eye level either.' Ross Powell, along with his wife and two friends, were denied service at Raffles hotel for wearing lycra . The age-old issue resurfaced its ugly head on Sunday morning when outraged customers were denied their regular Sunday brunch at the local hotel because the keen cyclists were dressed in lycra. Ross Powell walked into the Raffles hotel to grab a table ahead of his wife and their two mates, who had all just gone on a morning cycle, when he was approached by a staff member who confronted him with an unexpected remark. 'Sorry mate you can't come in here - we've got a no lycra-free policy - we can't serve you,' the waiter said. Mr Powell was gobsmacked and told his companions as they walked in that they were not welcome due to their cycling attire. 'I've never been spoke to like that - it was horribly humiliating,' Mr Powell told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm 43 years old and a father of two kids - I've never been kicked out of anywhere in my life - let alone for the clothes I was wearing.' His wife, Colleen Powell, questioned the waiter when the policy had been put in place and the waiter replied with two weeks ago. 'My wife pointed out that we were served in lycra the week before and then he walked away,' he said. Mr Powell insists the move is blatant discrimination. 'I think most pubs and clubs want young people who are hip and don't like the older crowd as a general rule,' he said. 'People don't like the way we look.' 'It would be considered discrimination if it happened to people with dogs or kids - or customers wearing high visibility clothing.' Hotel management said there was no such policy but a concern for safety where some bikes were parked . Daily Mail Australia approached the hotel for comment but has yet to have heard back. However, Colonial Leisure Group State operations manger Vern Fogarty denied there was a lycra ban to The West Australian saying the concern was residents complaining about some of the parked bikes causing a safety risk. 'It is not our dress standard,' he told the paper. 'We've served cyclists in lycra in the past and we're happy to serve cyclists in lycra in the future.' Mr Fogarty said the incident was a miscommunication which has now been clarified with the staff. But Mr Powell said the hotel's response was complete nonsense and that the message could not have been misconstrued. 'It's an absolute smokescreen - it's just spin,' he said. 'There was no ambiguity - he was clear about the policy.' Animosity towards cyclists is not a new issue and Mr Powell, who owns the Canning Bridge Cycles shop in Perth, said everybody needed to 'take a chill pill'. 'We all need to get along - the roads are for both cars and bikes,' he said. Mr Powell said he called the hotel on Monday and was told he would be contacted that afternoon following a management meeting about the matter but was yet to hear back. Mr Powell, who owns Canning Bridge Cycles, called for the animosity towards cyclists to be put to an en .","Four cyclists were refused service at a hotel in Perth for wearing lycra .

"Woolly mammoths and other ice age giants may not have been killed off by an asteroid or comet impact, according to new research. A study by archaeologists at University College London and the University of California has cast doubt on a major piece of evidence that is used to support theories that an exploding space rock triggered an abrupt period of climate change at the end of the last ice age. They have found that melted droplets of rock and soil, known as scoria, that were thought to have been scattered by the explosion were in fact created by human fires. Woolly mammoths were once common across North America, northern Asia and Europe but they vanished around 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene when the climate underwent dramatic changes . By studying soil found at stone age archaeological sites in Syria, the researchers found the sites were scattered with spherical pieces of melted glass and carbon. These are similar to other melted soil droplets that have been found scattered around the globe and were thought to have been caused by a meteorite impact. However, they claim that rather than being caused by the intense heat of from such an impact, they were created by much more modest temperatures. Instead, they say that the melted droplets could have been created by fires in stone age buildings as the soil used to construct them melted. There are several leading theories for what killed off the ice age giants like the woolly mammoths. Woolly mammoths are thought to have roamed the Earth from about 200,000 years ago before eventually dying out 10,000 years ago. At this time the planet was undergoing a major change in climate that is thought to have led to the shrinkage of their habitat. Unable to find the food they needed their populations became smaller and increasingly isolated. A study in 2008 estimated that changes in climate as a result of the end of the last glacial period saw their habitat shrink from 3 million square miles to 310,000 square miles. Some researchers have suggested that the spread of forests, which overtook the extensive areas of frozen grassland and tundra where mammoths thrived, led to their extinction. The changes in climate also opened up large parts of the northern hemisphere to humans, allowing groups to spread more widely around North America, Asia and Europe. Many blame overhunting by humans for finally finishing off the dwindling populations of megafauna like mammoths. More recently some scientists have adopted theories that sudden changes in climate, known as the Younger Dyas period, left many large animal species unable to cope. It is thought this period of cooling may have been caused by the collapse of the North American ice sheets into the Atlantic Ocean, leading to the seas cooling dramatically. Others have suggested this was triggered by a large explosion from an asteroid or comet impact that spread debris around the globe. The findings now lend support to other theories for what caused mammoths and other large animals to die out, such as over-hunting by humans and changes to their habitat. Dr Peter Thy, a geologist at the University of California and lead author of the study, said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that siliceous scoria droplets result from very high temperature melting of soil and are the result of a cosmic event.' A large asteroid or comet impact with the Earth is one theories for caused ice-age megafauna to die out . Researchers studied tiny droplets of melted debris found at archaeological sites in Syria and found that they appear to have been created by human induced fires as mud used to construct stone-age homes melted . Humans are known to have hunted ice-age giants like mammoths and the latest findings lend support to theories that it was the influx of human hunters into the northern hemisphere that led to the extinctions . The idea that an exploding comet or asteroid sparked the rapid cooling that occurred 12,900 years ago was first proposed by scientists in 2007. An international team of researchers presented data suggesting carbon-rich black layers found in sediments at around that time were caused by a cosmic impact. They say the exploding space rock created wildfires, hurricane force winds and lead to the collapse of the North American ice sheets, kickstarting a 1,300-year period of cold weather and drought known as the Younger Dryas cooling. This lead to many of the large mammals - known as megafauna - that roamed the earth during the Pleistocene to die out. The same team later claimed in 2013 that the impact spread more than 10 million tonnes of spherules of melted glass and carbon over an area of more than 50 million km across four continents of the Earth. The latest study examined melted soil at archaeological sites around Syria and concluded it could not have been spread there by a large global wide explosion but was formed by fires within stone age houses . However, the new findings, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, suggest this evidence may have in fact been caused by the melting of earth in fires created by humans. The droplets studied appeared to be composed of material found in the local soil in Syria rather than matching soil from elsewhere in the world - which would be consistent with an meteorite impact. They argue that earth used for constructing buildings was often made with silica rich materials that could melt at temperatures of around 800 and 1000°C. Dr Thy added: '(Our) findings demonstrate that the presence of siliceous scoria droplets are independent of age and thus are not specific to the beginning of the Younger Dryas. 'Occurrences have not been reported from natural deposits, but are instead associated with buildings destroyed by fire and thus appear to be restricted to archaeological sites. 'We therefore conclude that melting of building earth in ancient settlements can occur during fires reaching modest temperatures.' Professor Dorian Fuller, an archaeobotanists at University College London who also took part in this work, said: 'I think they are likely to come from uncontrolled fires, as we expect these to reach really high temperatures in some places. 'Controlled fires in hearths and ovens and I guess will often be kept at lower temperature more manageable for cooking. 'I think the obvious big player in megafaunal extinctions sn humans, human population growth, the modification of environments and the changing of foodwebs. 'Human over-hunting is a somewhat simplistic version of this hypothesis. 'In the Old World the ecosystem space of large herbivores has been mostly replaced by domesticated cattle, sheep, goats, horses and agricultural fields tend to exclude large herbivores. 'In the Americas domesticated herbivores are less significant but the addition of humans only about 15000 years ago must have massively altered ecologies and and food-webs in ways that destabilized large fauna numbers.' Previous research has suggested that an asteroid impact scattered melted droplets of soil around the globe . However, Dr Richard Firestone, from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Nuclear Science, who was one of the original team to propose that an impact from space triggered the Younger Dryas period, described the new findings as 'sheer nonsense'. He said: 'The melt materials found at the site include materials such as monolith that melt at over 2,000 degrees, substantially higher than can occur in any normal fire.'","Scientists believed a large comet or asteroid explosion triggered dramatic cooling known as the Younger Dryas period at the end of the ice age .
Microscopic droplets of melted glass and carbon from the soil were thought to have been scattered around the world by the impact .
New research suggests deposits of these melted droplets were actually formed by fires inside stone age houses build by prehistoric humans .
The findings lend support to theories that humans may have killed off the giant ice-age mammals by hunting them as they moved further north ."
"Peter Maine, who was found with fatal stab wounds after going for a run along the River Wear in Durham city centre in September 2013 . The fatal stabbing of a solicitor still remains a mystery after police investigated 65 people who may have wanted to harm him, an inquest has ruled. The body of Peter Maine, 56, was found after he went for a run along the River Wear after parking his car in Durham city centre in September 2013. He was discovered with stab wounds and detectives had been investigating whether he was targeted by a killer, was the victim of a random attack, or inflicted the fatal injuries himself. Today, an inquest in Crook, County Durham, also heard that Mr Maine of Wynyard, Teesside, was facing a charge of conspiracy to defraud and under investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority following a complaint by a client. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Chapman, who led the inquiry into the married father-of-two’s death, said officers looked at 65 people who may have had recent contact with Mr Maine and may have had reason to want to harm him. But those investigations drew a blank and robbery was ruled out as a motive as he was found with his Rolex watch, wallet and keys. Coroner Andrew Tweddle asked: 'It is fair to say, there is not anybody who might be of interest to you, or might be considered a potential suspect, being involved directly or indirectly?' Mr Chapman agreed, saying: 'My initial hypothesis was it was murder and it was planned, murder and it was unplanned, or it was suicide.' Police managed to trace all but two people seen walking or running in the area of the river between 7.30am and 8.30am that day. Neither of the two outstanding people were of particular concern to police, Mr Chapman said. They also searched the Wear and its banks for the weapon used to stab Mr Maine with the three-month search of the water cost £30,000. None of the six knives found in the general area were believed to have been the one used to inflict the fatal injuries, the inquest heard. After his body was discovered near the Maiden Castle Sports Centre, police scoured the area looking for clues into Mr Maine's death . Officers also searched the Wear and its banks for the weapon used to stab Mr Maine with the three-month search of the water cost £30,000 . Mr Maine’s widow, Joanna, also told the court how the family had planned for the future and there was nothing unusual in her husband's behaviour to suggest anything was wrong. Mrs Maine, who had met her husband 30 years ago and agreed she knew him better than anyone, said: “We had just booked a holiday. When the news came, I was on the phone to my daughter and I was so surprised. 'I have spent months trying to think of things that could have been an indication as to what happened, but there is nothing.' Recording an open verdict, the coroner Mr Tweddle added: 'Whether it was murder, homicide or a case where Peter Maine intentionally took his own life, I have to be sure of the verdict, that it supports the conclusion. 'It has to be clear to anyone today that I cannot be sure that either of the things are appropriate conclusions.' Family spokesman Tim Gittins read a statement after the hearing. After the hearing in Crook, County Durham today, the Maine family solicitor Tim Gittens, left, and Detective Chief Inspector of Durham Police Steve Chapman read out statements . He said: 'After 16 months and at the end of a long and thorough investigation by Durham Constabulary and the inquest, we still do not know what happened to Peter on the morning of September 1 2013 which is a burden that our family and friends will most likely have to carry for the rest of our lives. 'Peter was a good and kind man who was very much loved by his family and friends. He is greatly missed and we will all continue to grieve our loss.' Mr Maine’s body was found near Maiden Castle sports centre, around 40 metres from the site of significant blood drops in the middle of a bridge over the Wear. He had left the family home on the wealthy estate of Wynyard, near Billingham and took his Range Rover up the A1M to Durham and visited his former offices on Old Elvet, which were to be made into student lets. CCTV showed him jogging from the property along the river bank and he was last spotted on camera alive at 7.42am. A member of the public called the emergency services at 8.01am.

"An Ohio man convicted in a fatal car crash was ordered to return to prison after writing an insensitive Facebook post boasting about his brief time behind bars. Ryan Fye's questionable status update posted last month included a photo of him making an obscene gesture and a message saying in part, 'Prison didn't break me. It MADE me.' Fye, 22, of Lorain, had been sentenced to three years in May. The post was made shortly after his early release last month. Boastful: Ex-con Ryan Fye's status update posted last month included a photo of him making an obscene gesture and a message saying in part, 'Prison didn't break me. It MADE me' Court case: Fye (left), 22, of Ohio, had been sentenced to three years in May in the death of 22-year-old William Fekete (right) The message upset relatives of William Fekete, 22, from Elyria, killed in the March 2013 crash. A judge found it disrespectful toward the family and concluded it violated sanctions imposed on Fye. Defense attorney Michael Stepanik told local media that Fye didn't violate probation or the law. Fye was responding to a Facebook threat from someone who said they 'couldn't wait to bump into' him and that prison ought to have made him tough, Stepanik said. 'It wasn't a good idea,' Stepanik told WEWS-TV in Cleveland. 'Committing a crime is a probation violation, not abiding by the rules is a probation violation. Mr. Fye didn't do any of those things.' On or around December 9, a defiant Mr Fye wrote what has been construed by some as a boastful message peppered with grammatical errors accompanying a photo of him giving his ‘haters’ the middle finger. ‘Prison didnt break me. It MADE made. Im free. Im a new man. Don't come at me like before. Yes im skinny and muscular now. 7 months of working out everyday. Love my real friends an fam. Shout outs to my fam behind bars. Ill see ya when youre time is near! Miss you brothers!’ he wrote. Family outraged: Fye was released after only seven months in prison, leaving the victim's father, Vilmos Fekete, disappointed and clamoring for justice . Fye later removed the controversial status update and wrote another lengthy message insisting that his words had nothing to do with the fatal crash. ‘Its directed towards all the Fake friends i had and have, all the people trying to snoop and talk s*** about me like im some sort of monster. It has NOTHING to do with my case what so ever nor the parties involved in my case,’ Fye wrote. ‘Its a simple gesture to those who hate me, those who always called me fat, the ones who dawned on me, and of course me saying ""f*** prison"" cause prison isnt something i would wish upon my biggest enemy. Dont judge a book by its cover unless you plan on reading the whole book. Have a good day everyone!’ Fye's attorney is now challenging the judge's decision to put Fye back in custody. He argues that the posting isn't related to the rule Fye is accused of violating, which deals with how he conducts himself in court and with probation officers, The Chronicle-Telegram in Elyria reported. On March 23, 2013, at around 4pm Ryan Fye was going 60mph in a 20mph zone in the Metroparks Bradley Woods Reservation when he lost control of his 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and crashed into a tree, reported Fox 8. Backpedal: Fye later removed the controversial status update and wrote another lengthy message insisting that his words had nothing to do with the fatal crash . Fye had four passangers in his car at the time, including William Fye, who sustained fatal injuries and died in the hospital. Two other people were critically hurt but survived. Fye pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular manslaughter in April and was sentenced in May to three years in prison, but was released in December after only seven months - a decision that outraged the victim's family and friends. 'Willie can rest in peace,' Fekete's father, Vilmos Fekete, wrote late last month after learning that his son's killer will be heading back to prison, possibly thanks to an open letter he had written to the judge about Fye's offensive Facebook note. A hearing is scheduled for January 15 for another judge to decide whether Fye has to continue serving his prison sentence.","Ryan Fye's status update posted last month included a photo of him making an obscene gesture .

"American Apparel has issued a new ethics code which demands employees who are 'casually dating' or involved in 'committed romantic relationships' inform human resources to seek approval. The new code, which is four times the length of the previous version, was introduced  in order to help 'prevent sexual harassment in the workplace', and comes less than a month after the retailer's founder Dov Charney was fired as a consultant over allegations of such offenses. 'No management-level employee may make sexual advances, welcome or unwelcome, toward any subordinate,' the code states, adding that 'company personnel should never engage in any public displays of affection in the workplace.' Scroll down for video . Cracking down: The new code has been introduced  to 'prevent sexual harassment in the workplace', and comes after the retailer's founder Dov Charney (pictured) was fired over allegations of such offenses . The lengthy new code states that romantic relationships between employees should be disclosed to American Apparel's human resources department to be assessed for potential 'concern.' It also forbids 'favoritism' and includes a 'fair treatment of employees' section, which specifically bans 'discriminatory slurs' related to sexism and racism. American Apparel's controversial former-CEO Mr Charney, who founded the company in 1998, was terminated as chairman last June after the company compiled a long list of his alleged offenses; including sexual harassment, misuse of company funds, and racist comments. He stayed on in a consultant role but was fired from that position in December. Longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider has joined the company as CEO. Strict: The lengthy new code states that romantic relationships between employees should be disclosed to American Apparel's human resources department to be assessed for potential 'concern' Last month, Mr Charney claimed to be almost broke and reduced to crashing on a friend's couch in New York after being ousted from his company. As CEO, he earned an $800,000 annual salary, but recently told Bloomberg that he only has $100,000 left in the bank. He remains the company's largest shareholder, but doesn't have control of his 43per cent stake because of an agreement with hedge fund Standard General. Mr Charney said he felt betrayed by the hedge fund that had given him a loan in July so he could boost his ownership of the company he had founded. Mr Charney turned to the firm for help when he was ousted as CEO the previous month. 'I gave them my entire life's work and they agreed to put me back in,' he stated. 'But instead they used this investigation to fire me. They betrayed me. I gave them my heart.' Standard General disagrees with Mr Charney's version of events and released the following statement: . 'We supported the independent, third-party and very thorough investigation into the allegations against Mr Charney, and respect the Board of Directors' decision to terminate him based on the results of that investigation.' Despite what has happened, Mr Charney has said he plans to keep fighting and is 'suing everyone' with what little funds he has left. The Montreal-born Mr Charney has famously been the subject of lawsuits that allege he had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees. He has admitted he had consensual sexual relationships with workers. In 2011, a former employee accused Mr Charney of keeping her as a teenage sex slave, fearing she could lose her job otherwise. She also sued American Apparel and its directors for failing to stop him from acting as a 'sexual predator.' Moving on: Longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider (left, in 2004), formerly of Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria, started as the retailer's new CEO this week . In 2012, Mr Charney once again came under fire when Michael Bumblis, a former store manager in Malibu, California, accused the CEO of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him. Mr Charney also allegedly called the man 'a wannabe Jew' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals. Mr Bumblis was later fired from his job. The company has suffered financially. It has recorded annual losses since 2010 and reported three quarterly losses last year. Its stock dropped 53per cent in 2014. Ms Schneider, who officially started as CEO on January 5, has been a senior executive at retail and clothing companies including Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria. She said in a statement that she hopes to 'make American Apparel a better company, while staying true to its core values of quality and creativity and preserving its sweatshop-free, Made in USA manufacturing philosophy.'","American Apparel's conversational former CEO Dov Charney was terminated last June over allegations including sexual harassment and racism .

"Just hours after twelve people were killed in a Paris massacre, an Australian fundamentalist preacher declared that insults to the Prophet Mohammed are 'not allowed' and a 'very likely to simulate some kind of response.' Controversial self-styled sheik Mohammed Junaid Thorne, from Perth, wrote on social media that staff at satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo had 'forbade to learn the lesson' of a firebombing in 2011. The bombing occurred a day after a caricature of the Prophet was published. 'Insulting someone's Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion,' Thorne, in his mid 20s, tweeted this morning. 'If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no limits, expect others to exercise 'freedom of action'.' Scroll down for video . Firebrand Perth preacher Junaid Thorne, who has called Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in the past, made the remarks on Twitter today . Thorne, pictured right, made an appearance at a court case for terror suspect Sulayman Khalid earlier this year . Mohammed Junaid Thorne said insulting someone's Prophet 'is not allowed under any context/religion' and argued . Thorne refused to answer questions about his statement when contacted by Daily Mail Australia on Thursday, asking 'not to be quoted or mentioned in any article'. But just hours later, he expanded on his remarks in a 563 word letter on his Facebook page, writing: 'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone. 'This goes for everyone: Muslims and others. The cartoonists in #CharlieHebdo had made it a habit of insulting our Prophet -peace be upon him-. 'They were warned and even threatened more than once. On one occasion, their premises was fire-bombed, yet they forbade to learn a lesson. 'I'm not condoning what happened, but I'm just stating that there must be a line/limit for freedom of speech, and when people or religions are being affected, the boundaries shouldn't be crossed. He said he was praying for all violence to come to an end and added: 'There is now a hashtag on twitter (calling to kill Muslims) and no one is being arrested or charged for that, neither is it gaining any media attention.' These two men, Cherif Kouachi, 32, and brother Said Kouachi, 34, are wanted in connection to the Paris killings . Attack: Two gunman are seen facing police officers immediately during last night's dramatic events . 'Je Suis Charlie': People holding up placards reading 'I am Charlie' have flocked into the streets of Paris . Thorne's remarks came as pictures emerged of the preacher last year accompanying Sulayman Khalid, 20, to a court appearance. Khalid, from western Sydney, was charged with terrorism related offences last month over an alleged plot to commit guerilla warfare in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. The court appearance concerned allegations Khalid intimidated an Iraqi cleaner at a western Sydney shopping centre. Khalid rose to infamy after wearing an Islamic State symbol onto the set of an SBS television program about the Islamic State last year. Thorne would not answer questions about how he knew Khalid, only joking: 'We used to go out in (Kings) Cross together... Since we started going to church'. Over the past twelve months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny. Preaching: Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them [on] certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.' Junaid Thorne, a self-styled Sheikh, has several followers across the country . Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country. Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them [Islamic State], I would get in trouble,' he said. 'If I was to say that [I] don't support them at all, that would be untrue. 'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.","Mohammed Junaid Thorne, from Perth, took to social media after Paris killings .

"A man and woman have both been charged over the death of a young man whose badly burnt body was found stuffed in a suitcase in a park. The body of Dane McNeill, 20, was found by a council worker at Picnic Point in south-west Sydney shortly before 5.30am on July 21. Mr McNeill, who was reported missing by his family three days before he was found, was so severely charred it was difficult to initially identify him and his age. Scroll down for video . The body of Dane McNeill, 20, was found by a council worker at Picnic Point in south-west Sydney shortly before 5.30am on July 21 . Detectives arrested a 24-year-old man  at a home at Bankstown about 8am on Wednesday. He has since been charged with murder and conspiracy to murder and was refused bail. A 24-year-old woman was also arrested on Wednesday at a home at Liverpool just after 10am. She was charged late on Wednesday afternoon. The woman is believed to be pregnant and also has a two-year-old child, Daily Telegraph reports. A third man in custody for an unrelated matter is expected to be charged this month. It is understood the pregnant woman is the girlfriend of one of her co-accused. Detectives arrested a 24-year-old man on Wednesday morning and he has since been charged with murder . Mr McNeill, who was reported missing by his family three days before he was found, was so severely burnt it was difficult to initially identify him and his age . A woman,  24, was also arrested by police on Wednesday morning and was charged later that day . His family have spoken out about their heartbreak over the loss of Dane and their deep sadness that he 'fell into the wrong crowd' in the months before his death. Every New Year's Eve, he made an effort hug to his mum when the clock struck 12. It was the haunting absence of this routine show of affection a week ago that made the occasion almost too much to bear. 'Dane's mum really missed that. Come 12 o'clock and he wasn't there - it was hard,' father Peter McNeill told AAP. On Wednesday, the Sydney family welcomed the bittersweet news that two people had been charged over their 20-year-old loved one's murder. Mr McNeill - an ice hockey star in his childhood - had lost his way with drugs six months before his death. He had twice been busted for drugs and on one occasion was caught by police with ice and three knives in a suburban Sydney street. When police searched his padlocked car on May 20 last year, they found digital scales, a black wallet with crystal meth-filled capsules and a drug tick book with names and dollar amounts. The Narellan man later pleaded guilty in court to a string of drug charges a month before his alleged murder. If anything can come from his son's death, his father hopes it's a message about the impact of ice. 'I think it's really important the rest of the people out there realise the dangers of this drug,' he said. 'He was a good boy mixed up in ice. It was out of his control, basically.' 'He got mixed up in this ice epidemic... Guys, take it easy. You don't need it,' his father told Nine News. Police allege that Mr McNeill was assaulted at an address in Heckenberg on July 18 and kept captive overnight . The 24-year-old man has since been charged with murder and conspiracy to murder and was refused bail . Mr McNeill's family and girlfriend, Jade Patterson, are preparing themselves for the next milestone without him - his 21st birthday in March. Ms Patterson hopes that now arrests have been made, Mr McNeill can 'now be at peace. 'He didn't deserve what they [allegedly] did to him,' she told SMH. 'He was a beautiful boy with a heart of gold ... no matter what though, nothing will change what I'm feeling or bring Dane back.'

"A day before Gene Warrington, 88, passed away in her hospice room she was paid one final visit by her equally ill husband. The pair, inseparable since high school and who wed in secret as love-struck teens, held hands for 45 minutes before parting. Pat Warrington could see his wife's death was imminent so returned to his own room and pulled out all his intravenous tubes. He died exactly eight hours after his wife of 69 years. High school sweethearts: Throughout their 69-year marriage, Gene (left) and Pat (right) Warrington were always together, dying just eight hours apart . Phil Warrington said his father recognized that Pat was in critical condition and made the decision to pull out his tubes. 'We were able to get them together for about 45 minutes and he held her hand,' son Phil Warrington said. 'He said it wouldn't be fun without her,' the son added. The pair, from Ohio,  met in junior high school and wed secretly as teenagers while he was home from boot camp before leaving for World War II. Pat was 16 and Gene was 18. Til death do us part:  Gene pulled out his own life saving tubes on December 27 so that he could die along with his wife of 69 years . The wedding was kept a secret so that Pat could graduate high school. After Gene returned from war, he graduated from high school in 1947, a year after Pat's graduation. 'He told me that when he came back from war, he knew he never wanted to be away from her again,' Phil Warrington said. Their family grew with three children, seven grandchildren and a dozen great-grandchildren. Throughout it, the Warringtons were nearly inseparable, even in failing health at the end of their love story, their son said. 'You could have almost predicted it,' he said. 'They did everything in their life together. They were never apart.' 'They had been feeding on each other all along,' he concluded.","Gene Warrington, 88, and his wife Pat, 86, died on December 27 in Ohio .

"A Heisman Trophy O.J. Simpson won in 1968 has been recovered more than 20 years after it was stolen in a burglary at the University of Southern California, police said Tuesday night. The trophy and a Simpson jersey were stolen in a burglary at Heritage Hall, home to USC's athletic department, during a July 28, 1994, burglary. At the time, Simpson was awaiting trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, who were killed the previous month. He would be acquitted in 1995. Southern California's O.J. Simpson tries to break a California tackle as he picks up five yards in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in this November 1968 file photo . O.J. Simpson, then a running back for the USC Trojans, accepts the Heisman Trophy on December 5, 1968. He would sell this trophy years later, but a replica, which stayed at USC, was stolen in 1994 . The trophy was recovered last month by detectives assigned to the LAPD's Art Theft Detail, the department said in a statement. The burglars had dismantled Plexiglas display cases to take the items and the theft was discovered by a janitor the next morning. Police would give no further details on where or how they found the trophy, saying the investigation was still open. They sought the public's help with further leads in the probe and any word on the location of the jersey, which remains missing. The recovered Heisman was the duplicate that is given to the university of the winning player and not the one given to Simpson himself in 1968, police said. Simpson poses with his Heisman Trophy at New York's Downtown Athletic Club in this 1968 file photo . It remained in police possession, and USC athletic officials had no immediate comment Tuesday night. Simpson's own trophy was seized under a $33.5 million judgment after a civil court found Simpson liable for the deaths of Nicole Simpson and Goldman. Simpson is now in a Nevada prison after a 2008 conviction for kidnapping and armed robbery in a hotel room heist in Las Vegas. The Nevada Supreme Court is considering an appeal seeking his release.

"A controversial new show on TLC is sparking wave after wave of protests —  as thousands of people ask for the cancellation of the TV special featuring a group of Mormon men who say they're attracted to other men but chose to marry women because of their faith. John Sanders —  who launched a Change.org petition asking for 'My Husband's Not Gay' to be axed — says 'the false and dangerous idea that gay people can and should choose to be straight in order to be part of their faith communities.' 'I started this petition because these men deserve compassion and acceptance,'  says Sanders, who has himself been a devout Christian who went through 'ex-gay' therapy and was told to 'pray the gay away' in the past. 'No young person should ever be told to be ashamed of who they are -- especially by a television network.' Scroll down for video . Happily married: 'I'm attracted to my wife, for sure. And I'm definitely attracted to men too,' Pret (left) says of his spouse, Megan (right), in the preview for My Husband's Not Gay . Sanders' petition had more than 88,000 signatures as of late Tuesday evening. He's not alone in criticizing the show. 'No one can change who they love, and, more importantly, no one should have to,' says Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD. 'By investing in this dangerous programming, TLC is putting countless young LGBT people in harm's way.' TLC officials had only a canned statement when asked by USA Today about the show: 'The individuals featured in this one-hour special reveal the decisions they have made, and speak only for themselves.' In the show, a group of happily married Mormon men have admitted that they are attracted to their own sex - yet they refuse to identify as gay because of their devout faith. These unconventional marriages are the focus of a new TLC special called My Husband's Not Gay, set in Salt Lake City, which follows three such couples and their single friend, Tom, who is seeking a wife despite his own sexual attraction to men. 'I'm attracted to my wife, for sure. And I'm definitely attracted to men too,' Pret says of his spouse, Megan, in the preview for the show. Pret and Megan have been married for nearly nine years and have two daughters together, a three-year-old and a newborn. Both life-long Mormons, they met in Sunday School 17 years ago. Jeff and Tanya, who have been married for ten years and have a six-year-old son, also seem to share a strong bond. 'We do love each other very much. We're best friends,' Jeff says of his wife, whom he met on a blind date 13 years ago. 'I wouldn't change anything about him,' Tanya adds. However she admits: 'I get a little defensive when someone calls my husband gay.' Curtis and Tera have been together the longest, having met on the first day of high school and married 20 years ago. They now have four children. Strong bond: 'We do love each other very much. We're best friends,' Jeff (right) says of his wife Tanya (left) Determined: 'There's no marriage that is perfect. Ours isn't, but with our belief in God we believe we can overcome anything,' Curtis (right) says of his wife Tera (left) 'There's no marriage that is perfect. Ours isn't, but with our belief in God we believe we can overcome anything,' Curtis says. While the three wives seem to have accepted their bizarre marital circumstances, 35-year-old Tom is conflicted about whether to tell his secret to an unsuspecting blind date. 'I want to marry a woman, but I don't know how to work out these feelings,' he says, explaining that he has no intention of dating other men. 'I'm interested in men, I'm just not interested in men,' he adds. 'I like to say I've chosen an alternative to an alternative lifestyle.' Big secret: Tom is conflicted about whether to tell an unsuspecting blind date that he's attracted to men . Unsuspecting: Tom's date waits to hear his revelation that he's attracted to men . According to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, same sex attraction 'itself is not a sin, but acting on it is'. 'Even though individuals do not choose to have such attractions, they do choose how to respond to them,' states the website Mormons and Gays. The Church admits that from a 'public relations perspective' it would be easier  to accept homosexual behavior. '[But] that we cannot do,' it states. 'God's law is not ours to change. There is no change in the Church's position of what is morally right. But what is changing — and what needs to change — is to help Church members respond sensitively and thoughtfully when they encounter same-sex attraction in their own families, among other Church members, or elsewhere.'

"A set of fingerprints left on a holiday greeting card in the back of a Florida woman's car have led police to the man accused of kidnapping her Christmas Day and forcing her to withdraw money from ATMs so he could buy drugs. Daniel Palomares, 23, has been charged in the abduction of 22-year-old Olivia Gordon, from Orlando, at a Walgreens pharmacy on December 25. Gordon told police Palomares jumped into the passenger seat of her car after seeing her emerge from Walgreens dressed in a Batman T-shirt and yellow cape, and made it clear to her that he had a gun.

Criminal on the prowl: A man believed to be Palomares (seen here in surveillance video) jumped into Gordon's car in the parking lot of the drug store and threatened her with a gun . As she drove away from the drug store parking lot, Palomares emptied her wallet of cash. He found more money inside a Christmas card, which he then unwittingly tossed in the backseat of her car, reported WKMG. Police say the 23-year-old then forced Gordon to take him to Blossom Park Condominiums, where he purchased drugs in front of her. He ordered the woman to take him to the Florida Mall parking lot, where he got high and dozed off. Gordon used the opportunity to try and escape, but Palomares woke up, grabbed her by the shoulders and threatened to shoot her, according to police. Palomares then had his captive drive to a Bank of America to withdraw money from an ATM, followed by a trip to a Wells Fargo bank 12 miles away where she took out even more cash.

"Charles Ashton (pictured) walked free from court after he groped a woman's breast and kissed her on the cheek during a funeral service . A disgraced elderly undertaker has walked free from court after admitting groping a woman's breasts at a funeral. Shamed funeral director Charles Ashton also made lewd comments about the woman's figure before even kissing her on the lips, a court heard. Handing Ashton a £600 fine, District Judge Roy Anderson told the 83-year-old his reputation was 'shredded' - but spared him jail because of his old age. Judge Anderson told the defendant: 'You are a respected undertaker but you have brought on yourself the utmost shame and disgrace. 'She found herself the victim of a nasty piece of sexual pestering from you, the effects of which plainly remain with her to this day. 'Were it not for your age I should be dealing with you in a far more robust way. But I'm prepared to deal with you now by way of a financial penalty. 'Your reputation has been shredded and that seems to me to be something I should take into account.' Prosecuting at Leeds Magistrates Court, Amanda Harris described how the incident happened at a crematorium in Leeds, West Yorkshire, during a service conducted by the business he owns with his sons. Prosecutor, Amanda Harris, said: 'He asked her to sit beside him and she agreed out of politeness. 'He placed his arms around her and grabbed her shoulder while making sexual comments to her and two witnesses, including ""you don't get many of those to the gallon,"" making reference to her breasts.' Mrs Harris said Ashton squeezed the woman's right breast and pulled her head towards him and kissed her on the cheek. Mrs Harris added: 'He told her he wanted a proper kiss and placed his lips on hers.' Defence lawyer Stephen Swan said: 'It was a moment of madness. He is at a loss to explain... From the outset he has had real concern for the victim. 'From his perspective, it's been completely devastating. I think it's a measure of him that he is so upset about what's happened.' Mr Swan said Ashton, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, still helps out five-days-a-week at the business in the town, which is now run by his sons. District Judge Anderson handed Ashton a £600 fine and told him to pay £85 towards prosecution costs. The incident occurred at a crematorium during a funeral service run by Ashton's family business (pictured) The judge added: 'For what it's worth I'm prepared to believe you will not appear in court again charged with this sort of offence. 'But if you do, then I give you the clearest indication that you will face a far more severe penalty.' Ashton, who admitted sexual assault by touching, must also pay the woman £1,000 compensation and a five-year restraining order was imposed, banning him from contacting her directly or indirectly. On leaving court Ashton asked reporters: 'Are you going to hang me? Are you going to hang me again?'","Disgraced undertaker has walked free from court after admitting groping .

"When filling in a form, most of us are happy to be either a Mr, Mrs or a Miss. But for those planning a visit to Lord’s, the choice is rather grander. Officials at the cricket ground have introduced an astonishing 52 titles for those registering online for tickets – including Viscount, Baron and Sheikh. Not to mention Queen, for the most important guest of all. Royally approved: Lord's cricket ground has a long list of titles among its fans, including Queen, seen here on first day of the second test between England and Australia in 2013 . They say they want to make all members of society feel welcome – though the majority of the list comprises aristocratic and religious titles and military ranks. The registration form for the 200-year-old ground offers an extensive list of salutations to make sure all fans can select the appropriate title for their tickets to this summer’s Ashes test matches. Other titles on offer include: Brigadier, Brother, Captain, Commander, Princess, Don, Father, Judge, Lord, Mademoiselle, Reverend, and Wing Commander. However, the list is by no means comprehensive, including earls and viscounts but not dukes. The military ranks also exclude admirals or generals. A spokesman for Lord’s said yesterday: ‘We have within our membership a complete cross-section of society, including the Queen who is a patron. Firm fan: The Queen watches the start of the second test of the Ashes between England and Australia in 2013 from the Pavilion at Lord's . Others who find the long list of titles useful are former cricketer Baroness Heyhoe Flint, and former Prime Minister Sir John Major, a well-known fan of the sport . ‘The membership committee took the decision that they wanted all members to be able to title themselves correctly.’ Usually ticket applications for sports events and concerts allow buyers to choose from just three titles – Mr, Mrs or Ms. But cricket fans entering the ballot to see the England internationals against Australia and also Test matches against New Zealand are free to select any title they wish...which is expected to encourage a few of the more mischievous members of the public to adopt titles that don’t belong to them. On the rare occasions that royalty attend Test matches – the Queen visited the Lord’s match against Australia in 2013 – it is unlikely they would opt to sit among the masses. The Queen, and other VIPs, would be seated in the pavilion and would not, of course, be required to buy tickets. The ballot for the Ashes Test with Australia, which starts on July 16, and a Test against New Zealand in May closed at one minute to midnight last night. The cricket ground, in North London, uses the ballot system as a fair way of allocating tickets for matches which are often oversubscribed, because it gives all applicants an equal opportunity. Lord’s was established in 1814 and is widely regarded as the Home of Cricket.","The online ticket registration form at Lord's offers unusual choices .

"Francesca Hilton, who died on Monday after suffering a fatal heart attack in a downmarket Los Angeles coffee shop . Paris Hilton was her great-niece, Elizabeth Taylor had been her sister-in-law, Richard Burton, Sean Connery and Frank Sinatra were among her mother’s lovers, and she grew up in a Bel Air mansion once owned by billionaire Howard Hughes and Elvis Presley. But it was in a downmarket 24-hour coffee shop that former Hollywood princess Francesca Hilton, 67, suffered a fatal heart attack on Monday and later died in hospital. Friends of Francesca, the only child of screen siren Zsa Zsa Gabor, claim she had felt depressed for weeks and kept repeating that she wanted to die. For Francesca was down and out, living sometimes in a car and sometimes in a sleazy Hollywood motel. As the ghost-writer of her mother Zsa Zsa’s autobiography, One Lifetime Is Not Enough, I first met Francesca in the early Eighties. She had last contacted me two months ago. For years she had been working on her own autobiography, tentatively entitled Hotels, Diamonds And Me, and there was talk that she might want to work with me on the book, though nothing came of it. It’s a shame, because Francesca Hilton had one hell of a story to tell. The only child born to Zsa Zsa — one of Hungarian sisters the Gabors, who specialised in marrying rich men and collecting magnificent jewellery along the way — Francesca would appear to have been born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Her blonde bombshell mother had starred in the 1952 hit film Moulin Rouge and then made a name for herself as a TV personality, uttering such bon mots as: ‘I’m a great housekeeper. When I divorce a man, I always keep his house.’ But she wasn’t worth a fortune. As for Conrad Hilton, the hotel magnate whose name Francesca bore, he never even mentioned her in his 1957 memoir and left her just $100,000 of his fortune, worth about $6 billion (nearly £4 billion) in today’s money, when he died in 1979. In the decades that followed, Francesca devoted her life and any money she had to fighting her father’s will, but lost resoundingly — and even, under a quirk of California law, forfeited the original $100,000. Those who knew her believe her fight wasn’t just for money but to establish without doubt that Conrad was her father — which he once disputed to her but not to Zsa Zsa, who said that if he did ‘I would have killed him’. Scroll down for video . Friends of Francesca, pictured, the only child of screen siren Zsa Zsa Gabor, claim she had felt depressed for weeks and kept repeating that she wanted to die . Conrad and Zsa Zsa were separated at the time of Francesca’s conception — they divorced in 1947 — and although Zsa Zsa assured me that Conrad visited her one day in 1946, raped her and that Francesca was the result, her story is in doubt. Back in the Seventies, the right-hand woman of Conrad Hilton’s son, Barron, told me that Francesca’s father was not Conrad but the actor George Sanders. The resemblance to Sanders is startling. To the end, Francesca considered herself a Hilton. But if she was on shaky ground there, anyone who saw her with her mother felt that she didn’t resemble her much, either. With her matchless allure, which had captivated billionaire Paul Getty (who wanted to marry her), the Duke of Marlborough and two U.S. Presidents, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, Zsa Zsa was dedicated to her beauty, glamour and sex drive (she once confided to me that she liked a man to be rough in bed). As a child, Francesca adored her mother, but Zsa Zsa did her best to turn her little girl into a live-in photo opportunity, throwing her lavish birthday parties to which she invited reporters from Life magazine. Zsa Zsa with her daughter, left, in the 1950s and right in the 1960s. As Francesca grew up, though, Zsa Zsa was dismayed when she balked against wearing make-up and losing weight, and rejected the glamorous Gabor image . As Francesca grew up, though, Zsa Zsa was dismayed when she balked against wearing make-up and losing weight, and rejected the glamorous Gabor image. Instead, Francesca was honest, funny, cynical and bright, so that when young reality TV star Paris Hilton hit the headlines, she remarked: ‘I’m the original Hilton heiress. I’m older, wiser, smarter. And I’m damned wider . . .’ Although Francesca didn’t grow up to be a man-eater like her mother, she had a crush on singer Kris Kristofferson, dated Peter Sellers and once infuriated Joan Collins by flirting openly with Joan’s then husband, Ron Kass. As a child, Francesca adored her mother, but Zsa Zsa did her best to turn her little girl into a live-in photo opportunity . Yet love, happiness and career success eluded her. Conrad Hilton refused to pay her an allowance and wouldn’t even let her stay one night on his luxurious estate. Only once did he grant her a temporary role in his hotel empire, as a receptionist at the Beverly Hilton, where guests flatly refused to believe she was a member of his family. After that, Francesca tried valiantly to become a professional photographer, then an actress, and managed to play a few bit parts in films. Her last career was as a stand-up comedienne, in an act that consisted of poking fun at Zsa Zsa (‘my mother and I, we’re the best of friends now we’re the same age’), her heritage and, above all, herself. Towards the end of her life, though, Francesca had very little to laugh about. After marrying and divorcing eight men, in 1986 Zsa Zsa married her final husband. Born Hans Robert Lichtenberg, a policeman’s son from Germany, her new spouse — who purported to be 27 years her junior — had been adopted as an adult by the elderly German princess Marie Auguste Von Anhalt. Now going by the title of Frederic Prinz Von Anhalt, which is his legal right, he paid a contact $5,000 to introduce him to Zsa Zsa, then married her. Zsa Zsa and Frederic fought constantly, but she was proud of their bawdy sex life and even prouder that she — ‘a little girl from Budapest’ — bore one of the most ancient titles in Europe. Frederic fought a dogged battle to keep Francesca away from Zsa Zsa. On the few occasions when he allowed them to meet, Francesca found her mother his virtual prisoner. Stricken with dementia and with one leg amputated, Zsa Zsa was able only to squeeze Francesca’s hand to let her know she knew who she was. ‘She once called me The Brat, so that’s how I announce myself,’ Francesca said wryly. ‘I say: “Mother, the Brat’s here.” ’ Zsa Zsa Gabor pictured with her husband Frederic Prinz von Anhalt in 2011. Frederic fought a dogged battle to keep Francesca away from Zsa Zsa . But Francesca was far from being a brat. She was a tortured woman who grew up with very little love, grappling with a mother more concerned with herself than with her child. ‘Do I have breakfast with my mother? Of course not. She always has it in bed,’ she once said, without bitterness. Since her death was announced, Frederic Von Anhalt has said openly that he has no intention of letting his wife, now 97, know that her only daughter is dead. So even in death, Francesca Hilton is denied access to the mother who never gave her the reassurance she craved, but whom Francesca loved so much.","Francesca Hilton, 67, died on Monday after suffering from fatal heart attack .

The rest of Scotland has been issued with a yellow Met Office warning as gusts of up to 70mph are forecast. Scotland will see the most powerful winds on Friday and Saturday, as the centres of two consecutive storms pass by the northern coast. In northern parts of England and Wales winds could reach 70mph, with gales of 50mph seen in the South. The warnings follow huge waves seen crashing into sea defences at Blackpool in Lancashire yesterday. The Met Office alert said ‘The public should be aware of potential for disruption to transport and power supplies and the possibility of structural damage. Large waves may also lead to dangerous conditions along some coasts.’ But temperatures will be remarkably mild for this time of year, reaching 15C (59F) in London - compared with the average January temperature of 6.9C (44.4F). Forecasters said the ferocious weather is being caused by an exceptionally strong jet stream triggered by cold conditions in the US. Here they come: Two storms are set to hit the north of the UK in quick succession later this week because of a strong jet stream, currently travelling at a speed of around 250mph moving across the Atlantic Ocean. It will bring winds of up to 90mph in northern Scotland . Surf's up: The grim weather predictions may be bad news for some, but for these water sports enthusiasts in St Ives it was a chance to show off their skills . Storms of up to 90mph are set to batter the country by the weekend, with winds as powerful as those which caused misery last winter due to sweep in tomorrow . Despite the storm warnings, many parts of the UK woke up to sub zero conditions causing chaos for commuters this morning. South West Trains services were suspended because of icy conditions between Haslemere and Portsmouth Harbour. A spokesman said the ice had caused ‘poor rail conditions between St Denys and Fareham’ and services would be disrupted until at least 9am. The Cambridgeshire Fens were covered with a thick layer of ice and frost this morning after temperatures dipped as low as -3.5C in parts of the country. Early warning: Waves crash against the coast of Blackpool, Lancashire, on a windy and wet day. High winds are set to blow across Britain as the week progresses with many coastal areas subject to yellow weather warnings . A storm coming: The Met Office issued official weather warnings for northern England and Scotland, warning residents to expect disruption and possible wind damage . Torrential rain swept across north west Cumbria where motorists were forced to battle through dismal driving conditions on the M6 near Shap . The windy weather will continue across the country on Saturday, but there will also be a big drop in temperature, with highs of just 7C . The Met Office has issued official weather warnings for northern England and Scotland on Thursday (left), Friday (centre) and Saturday, warning residents to expect disruption and possible wind damage . Large waves hit the normally tranquil shoreline of Ullswater Lake in the Lake District following heavy rain and strong winds which have battered the north west of England today . Yesterday, Mark Wilson of the Met Office said wind speeds would be similar to those seen in the fierce storms towards the end of 2013 . The fields of Wicken Fen sparkled with white ice as commuters had a slippery journey to work today. Temperatures went down to -3.5C in Aberdeenshire overnight, -3.1C in Dorset and -2.3C in Kent. Experts at the Met Office say today will be wet in Western areas, including Cumbria, Western Scotland and Wales, whilst the rest of the country should be dry, but cloudy. There will also be strong winds on exposed coasts in the North West, with gusts of up to 60mph. Showers are expected in Scotland tonight, which could turn wintry on higher ground. Tomorrow is set to be a dry and bright day for much of the country, with highs of 11C, but the wind will pick up in the North during the evening. The windy weather will continue across the country on Saturday, but there will also be a big drop in temperature, with highs of just 7C. Despite stormy conditions elsewhere, residents woke up to a cold and misty morning in Winchester where St Cross Church (pictured) was surrounded by frosty fields . Icy blast: Dog walkers had to wrap up warm as they ventured out along the river in Winchester, Hampshire this morning . It was also a frosty start to the day at Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire. The area was covered with a thick layer of ice and frost this morning after temperatures dipped as low as -3.5C in parts of Britain overnight . Calm before the storm: A golden sunrise over the giant cranes that dominate the horizon in Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, before storms lashed northern parts of the UK today . Stunning: The sky glows orange and yellow over the mouth of the River Tyen on the North East Coast at sunrise. Conditions are set to dramatically deteriorate . It is set to be a dry day with bright spells, but some rain is expected in the North, which could fall as snow in Scotland, the Lake District and the Pennines. Sunday will remain cold, but will generally be dry and bright with some strong winds in the North. 'It will feel much colder on Saturday as temperatures return to average,' said Dan Williams, of the Met Office. 'The temperatures are expected to get milder again at the start of next week.' Yesterday, Mark Wilson of the Met Office said wind speeds would be similar to those seen in the fierce storms towards the end of 2013, when tens of thousands of homes were left without power, trees were uprooted, trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the UK. But while the worst weather then was seen in southern England, this time rural parts of Scotland will bear the brunt, Mr Wilson added.","Two storms set to hit north of the UK on Friday and Saturday bringing rain and gales of up to 100mph in Scotland .
A strong jet stream, travelling at 250mph, is on course to hit the north of the country bringing the strong winds .
Gales could reach 100mph in Scotland and 70mph in areas of southern Scotland and the north of England .
Forecasters have warned gales could disrupt transport and power supplies and there is a risk of building damage .
Storms will hit in quick succession on Friday and Saturday and forecasters say winds will 'really pack a punch'
Gales are forecast as the UK is expected to see unseasonably warm temperatures, double the normal average ."
"Investigators say the teenage daughter of the suspect who shot and killed his longtime girlfriend and her cousin tried to wrestle the gun from her father, thinking she was about to become his next victim. Instead,  Eduardo Felix Escobar of Selma, California pulled the gun from his daughter's grip and shot himself. He died at a hospital later. Gunned down: Johana Loza (above), 36, a mother of seven, was shot dead by her boyfriend, Eduardo Escobar . Tragedy: Escobar (left) also killed Jessica Cervantes (right with husband and child) before turning the gun on himself . The Fresno County Coroner's Office and Selma police identified those who died Monday as 36-year-old Johana Loza Cervantes and 31-year-old Jessica Emmanuel Cervantes, her cousin. Police provided details of the murder-suicide at a Tuesday press conference in Northern California. According to The Fresno Bee, 'Escobar showed up at that house around 2:15 p.m. Monday with his 14-year-old daughter, who immediately went inside to talk to her mom.' As this was happening, Emmanuel Cervantes confronted Escobar outside, and following an argument a gunshot rang out. Chief Greg Garner said the couple had seven children together and that their 14-year-old daughter witnessed the murders then watched her father kill himself. First victim: Witnesses said Cervantes, pictured here with her husband, was gunned down in the street after getting into an argument withEscobar . 'She opened the door of the residence to see her father shooting Jessica Cervantes several times,' said Chief Garner. 'As she attempted to close the door, Mr. Escobar fired one round at the residence, striking the front door. He then made entry into the house and confronted Giovanni.' Escobar had a history of violent behavior, and at the time of the shooting a warrant was out for his arrest. A preliminary toxicology report showed that he was high on meth when the incident occurred.","Johana Loza, 36, was shot dead along with her cousin Jennifer Cervantes in Selma, California .

"The annual weigh-in for a 6.5m python proved to be a little difficult this year as handlers struggled to retrain the aggressive snake which looked eager to take a bite out of someone's leg. Atomic Betty, the Australian Reptile Park's largest snake, was put on a diet over the last 12 months. Her 12-goat feed was reduced to six which resulted in a weight loss of 11kg on Wednesday, bringing her down to a healthy 129kg. Scroll down for video .

Atomic Betty, the Australian Reptile Park's largest snake, was put on a diet over the last 12 months as her 12-goat feed was reduced to six . The 15-year-old snake’s weigh-in on Wednesday found that she lost 11kg, bringing her down to a healthy 129kg . Handlers hope she loses another 9kg in the coming year and will feed her eight goats . It took at least seven handlers to help control Atomic Betty as she had her fangs out, ready to strike at any moment. Billy Collett, head of reptiles, says he's happy with her current weight but would like to see her lose another 9kg in the coming year. 'It's an unreal experience getting in there and grabbing her by the head and restraining her with the team working together,' he said. 'We put her on a bit of diet over the last 12 months so we dropped her back from 12 goats down to six and we pulled 11kg off her. 'The weight we got out of her is perfect which means we've got a very healthy snake. 'We want to get her down to 120kg... so knock her back to about eight goats for the next 12 months.' Atomic Betty, 15-years-old, and is expected to live up to 30 years in captivity. According to the reptile park, in the wild her life span would be shorter but her species could grow up to eight metres long.","The Australian Reptile Park's largest snake, python Atomic Betty, was weighed on Wednesday .

"The satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo whose Paris offices were attacked by gunmen today had its old building burned down in 2011 after printing cartoons of Prophet Mohammed. Editor Stephane Charbonnier was also pictured in Al-Qaeda magazine Inspire on a list of nine men Al Qaeda was targetting, along with the caption 'a bullet a day keeps the infidel away'. Hebdo's Paris offices were attacked today by two gunmen wielding Kalashnikov rifles, leaving at least 12 dead, with Charbonnier believed to be among those killed. Scroll down for video . Stephane Charbonnier, editor of magazine Charlie Hebdo, was put on Al Qaeda's most wanted list last year for publishing cartoons of Prophet Mohammed . Mr Charbonnier was named as one of nine men the extreme Islamist group were targeting (pictured centre right). Their photographs were printed alongside the caption 'a bullet a day keeps the infidel away' Discussions: An editorial meeting at the French Satirical Weekly Charlie Hebdo on February 9, 2006 in Paris . While it is not yet known who is responsible for the attacks, witnesses report hearing the men shouting 'the Prophet has been avenged' before fleeing towards the city's east. They remain on the run and have been filmed shooting their way through Paris in a stolen car. Charbonnier's lawyer revealed today that the editor has been under special police protection since 2012, and that the offices also had officers stationed there. The controversy around Hebdo began in 2006 when the publication reprinted now-infamous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed by Danish artist Kurt Westergaard. When the images originally appeared they lead to days of protests across the Middle East and in Western cities. The decision to reprint the images landed the then-editor in court under anti-terror laws, though he was later acquitted. Satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo first attracted controversy in 2006 after reprinting Danish cartoons showing the Prophet Mohammed which caused protests across the Middle East and in Western cities . Hebdo had its offices burned to the ground in 2011 (pictured) after publishing more images of Mohammed, though nobody was inside at the time . On other occasions Hebdo named Prophet Mohammed as its guest editor, published cartoons of the holy figure in the nude, and renamed itself Sharia Hebdo with the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die of laughter'. Hebdo's old offices were burned to the ground in 2011 when attackers used Molotov cocktails to start a blaze early in the morning of November 2. There was nobody in the building at the time, and the target was thought to be the magazine's computer system, which was completely destroyed. At the time, the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Stephane Charbonnier, said Islam could not be excluded from freedom of the press. At least 12 people have died, including police officers and journalists, after two gunmen attacked the magazine's new offices in Paris today . He said: ‘If we can poke fun at everything in France, if we can talk about anything in France apart from Islam or the consequences of Islamism, that is annoying.’ Mr Charbonnier, also known as Charb, said he did not see the attack on the magazine as the work of French Muslims, but of what he called ‘idiot extremists’ Riot police were forced to stand guard outside the building for days following the attack, as the editors took a defiant stance, choosing to reprint the cartoon images multiple times. In 2012 Hebdo again printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed while violent protests were taking place across the Middle East after an anti-Islamic film made in California was put up online. During the unrest the U.S. embassy was attacked in Benghazi killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service worker Sean Smith, two CIA contractors, and injuring another ten. Around the same time Charlie Hebdo was targeted online by British extremist Anjem Choudary who wrote: 'Those who want to support the publication of ""Charlie Hebdo"" who insulted the Messenger Muhammad (saw) must take lessons from Theo Van Gogh!' Gogh, a Dutch film director, was  assassinated by jihadi Mohammed Bouyeri in November 2004 for his film Submission which criticized the treatment of women in Islam. The following year the magazine's office again had to be surrounded by riot officers after they published a cartoon booklet depicting the Prophet naked as a baby and being pushed in a wheelchair by a Rabbi. On the final page of the booklet there was a note from the editor, Stephane Charbonnier, saying the images were 'halal' because Muslims had worked on them, and that they were factually accurate as they had been derived from descriptions in the Koran. The satirical publication, widely seen as France's answer to Private Eye, prides itself on a mixture of tongue-in-cheek reporting and investigative journalism. Witnesses report the gunmen shouted 'the Prophet has been avenged' before fleeing. They have since been pictured shooting their way across Paris, where they remain on the run . In an interview with De Volkskrant in January 2013, Mr Charbonnier revealed he had been placed under constant police protection for four months after one of the cartoon issues was published. He shrugged off criticism that he was only publishing the images to gain notoriety for Hebdo, and insisted that he was instead defending the right to free speech. Mr Charbonnier pointed out that the magazine had poked fun at feminism, nuclear energy and homeland security, but the Islam issues always attracted the most publicity.","Charlie Hebdo is a satirical French magazine likened to Private Eye .

"A baby whose father plotted to kill her  while she was still in the womb is now four months old. Jamie Smith was jailed for seven years after his plot to hire thugs to attack his pregnant mistress in Peterborough in Cambridgeshire and kill their baby, was foiled. Smith paid Steven Blades and a third man to attack Jessika Santos, 18, after she became pregnant during their affair, but was foiled when the third man told police about the plot. Baby Nyara was born four months ago after her father was jailed for seven years for plotting an attack on Jessika Santos, the child's mother, to make her miscarry their child. He was due to pay an accomplice . Miss Santos has been pictured with their child, Nyara, just months after giving birth. She said: ‘How could anyone think of doing harm to something so beautiful and fragile? ‘Dads should be there to protect their children, not hurt them. I’ll never come to terms with what Jamie did.’ Miss Santos discovered she was pregnant after a one night-stand with Smith, 23, in January last year. The pair had rekindled an online friendship that had begun three years earlier. After they met for the first time they had sex in Jamie’s black Toyota - with Miss Santos unaware that Smith was cheating on long-term girlfriend Faith Dancy. Miss Santos said: ‘Literally hours after we made love, Jamie texted to say he couldn’t see me again because he was already with someone else. Jamie Smith, 23 (left), was jailed for seven years after plotting to have his mistress attacked so she would lose their unborn child. Steven Blades, 23 (right), was jailed for a year after agreeing to carry out the assault . ‘I was furious, but I’ve been let down by guys before so it hardly came as a surprise.’ The teenager broke off contact with Smith but when she discovered she was pregnant got in touch to tell him. He immediately told her he wanted her to have an abortion. Miss Santos refused and Smith hatched the plot to have her attacked with a knife and a crowbar so she would lose their unborn child. Miss Santos said she will never come to terms with her former lover plotting to kill their baby in the womb . The pair were due to meet up in February last year but on the day they were due to see each other police knocked on Miss Santos' door with the news that a tip-off had led to his arrest. Miss Santos added:  ‘A man had gone to the police telling them Jamie had tried to hire him and Blades to beat me up. ‘Jamie had been plotting to take me for a walk beside the lake at the local rowing club. Miss Santos pictured when Smith was sentenced . ‘We’d be jumped by two ‘strangers’, one carrying a knife. Jamie would be knocked out cold and I’d be attacked with a wheel brace. ‘He’d even gone as far as to supply the pair with weapons. ‘The whole thing was meant to look like a random mugging - and designed to ensure I had a miscarriage and lost our baby. ‘Luckily, one of the men Jamie tried to hire had a conscience. Telling the police had foiled the whole thing.’ Smith was jailed for seven years in August last year after a jury found him guilty of conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm at the end of a five-day trial. Blades, also 23, admitted the same charge and was jailed for 12 months. As part of the plot Smith was also to be injured to make it look more believable. Miss Santos gave birth on September 23rd at Peterborough City Hospital. She added: ‘It’s hard to not to think of Jamie when I look at Nyara - she looks so much like him and has the same blue-grey eyes. ‘I’m so angry that he could have even considered taking her life. ‘Of course parenthood is hard, but Nyara’s smile makes it all worthwhile. It’s Jamie’s loss that he didn’t want her.’","Jamie Smith was jailed for seven years for his plot to have lover attacked .

"Six breast cancer drugs are to be banned from use by NHS patients - promoting condemnation from campaigners and doctors. Thousands of women with advanced breast cancer are set to be denied ‘last chance’ medication that can give them extra months, if not years, with their loved ones. The six drugs are being taken off an approved list by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which was set up after a Tory election pledge to improve access to vital medicines in England. Banned from NHS: Avastin is one of six breast cancer drugs deemed to offer either ‘insufficient value for money’ or or have poor cost-benefit scores for breast cancer . The £280million a year Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) which began in April 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in England getting drugs banned on the NHS by Nice, the rationing body. NHS England, which took over its administration a year ago, has re-evaluated 25 drugs used in 42 treatments. It is understood that eribulin, Avastin, Kadcyla, Afinitor, Tyverb and Perjeta have been deemed to offer ‘insufficient value for money’ or have poor cost-benefit scores for breast cancer. One in six patients treated through the fund has advanced breast cancer, with 2,000 getting eribulin alone. Trial data shows the drug, derived from sea sponges, extends the life of women with an especially aggressive form of the disease by almost five months on average. The ban may see thousands with advanced breast cancer denied ‘last chance’ medication . Around half of women live longer than a year after getting eribulin, which costs around £10,000 for a six-month course of treatment. The drug is prescribed as standard care to women in 55 countries, including all major EU members, Japan, Korea and Russia. Other cancer drugs have also been axed, with full details to be released next week. Some drug companies have been told they must agree by Monday to cut their prices if they want their products reprieved (to subs please keep). But the CDF review of eribulin has concluded it does not work well enough to justify routine use – a decision that cannot be appealed except by seeking a judicial review. Professor Chris Twelves from the University of Leeds, who presented evidence on the drug last month to the CDF, said its decision came ‘out of the blue’. Regulatory authorities worldwide approved the drug’s efficacy and safety, and the CDF’s rationale was inexplicable, he said. ‘It came as a complete shock. Eribulin is standard treatment in guidelines from all the leading cancer bodies so it is difficult to understand how the CDF made this decision. ‘I saw a woman in my clinic this morning who has been taking it successfully for six months after other drugs failed and she said there was ‘nothing to compare’. ‘It goes against natural justice for there to be no appeal mechanism and such a closed process’ he added. Consultant oncologist Dr Vivek Misra, from the Christie Hospital Manchester, said an audit found the drug’s real-life performance matched trial data, with one in four patients taking it for more than two years. He said ‘This is now standard of care for women with advanced breast cancer who have no alternative.’ Although existing patients would continue to be treated, new patients would have to be ‘exceptional’ cases to get de-listed drugs. But, said Dr Misra, clinicians would face ‘Catch 22’ as exceptional requests were possible only for fewer than 20 patients. Anne Strange, 63, who lives in Woolwich, has been taking eribulin for advanced breast cancer since September and knows she’s on borrowed time. Mrs Strange, who is divorced and had administrative jobs in the NHS for 32 years, said ‘I’ve been aware it was terminal right from the off. ‘I’ve been on a number of drugs that stopped working. I said to my oncologist in September: ‘I’ve got a wedding to go to in November’ and I made it. ‘My only daughter Debbie was getting married – and I’m still here five months on. I feel terrible that other women may not get the opportunity I had.’ Danni Manzi, head of policy at Breast Cancer Care charity, said ‘This re-evaluation process is a warning sign that the entire Fund is unravelling. ‘We are extremely concerned that breast cancer drugs could be removed. ‘It would be soul destroying for many secondary breast cancer patients if they were unable to access these drugs simply due to cost. ‘We hope that the announcement is a positive one - all cancer patients deserve to benefit from clinically effective treatments.'","Six breast cancer drugs deemed to offer ‘insufficient value for money’

"Beyonce has been blasted by animal rights organisations after a photo of the star petting a tiger cub has surfaced online. While in Thailand with her daughter, Blue Ivy, and husband, Jay Z, the superstar family was snapped posing with an adorable baby tiger and feeding it from a bottle. An Instagram fan site for the singer, called BeyLite, posted the photo on January 2 along with the caption: Beyonce, Jay Z & Blue #Thailand. Beyonce, Blue Ivy and Jay Z were photographed petting a tiger cub at Thai theme park, FantaSea, in Phuket . The image was taken during the family's visit to Thai theme park FantaSea in Phuket. In the snap, Beyonce and Blue are both wearing traditional tiaras and dangling gold earrings. Though Blue looks positively mesmerised by her face-to-face animal encounter, the hitmaking couple has come under fire from those who claim they are contributing to animal cruelty. Animal rights groups are slamming the couple for 'supporting an industry that relies on animal cruelty.' Pictured: Beyonce and Jay Z at FantaSea . World Animal Protection wildlife expert, Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach released a statement in response to seeing the image online. 'A tiger is not a plaything,' he said. 'Their health and well-being should not be sacrificed for a photo opportunity. 'When you look behind the scenes, holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty. 'Many tourists unwittingly contribute to the suffering of wild animals like these. Beyonce has been chronicling the family's trip on her Instagram account, like this snap of her in Cambodia . The photo of the Carters and the tiger was posted to a fan account, called BeyLite. Pictured: Cambodia . 'They're simply not aware that their 'once in a lifetime' photo means a lifetime of misery for that animal. 'The tigers used for these photos are often crammed into tiny cages or chained to the floor for long periods. 'They are also forcibly removed from their mothers to be fed artificially by tourists. 'All in all, a far cry from their natural lives in the wild. But this sordid side of tourism is conveniently hidden from public view.' While Beyonce has been posting photo of the family's Southeast Asian trip on Instagram, which has included stops in Thailand and Cambodia, this image was not posted on any of the family's official social networking sites. The Carter family aren't the first celebrities to be blasted for posing with wild animals. One Direction allegedly also came under fire from animal rights groups after being photographed with a monkey tied up in metal chains on the set of their Steal My Girl music video. The Crazy In Love singers have not yet responded to the statement about the tiger cub.

"Stephen Fry's fiancé was banned from driving today for speeding at 101mph after the QI presenter told his boyfriend to 'get a move on' as they rushed to a literary festival. Elliott Spencer, 27, was driving an Aston Martin to Hay on Wye where Fry was due on stage in May. A court heard they were running late due to Bank Holiday traffic when the star, 57, 'persuaded' his boyfriend to 'put his foot down'. The speed of the Aston Martin, which had been loaned to the couple so they could test drive it, then shot up to 101mph in a 70mph zone. Scroll down for video . Crashing to earth: A day after they announced their engagement, Stephen Fry's fiancé Elliott Spencer was banned from driving for going more than 100mph last May . Story: Elliott Spencer appeared at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court in South Wales supported by his partner today, who 'persuaded' him to speed because they were late for an event at the Hay-on-Wye Festival . Appearing at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court in South Wales this morning, 24 hours after the couple announced their engagement, Elliott pleaded guilty to a charge of speeding and was banned from driving for seven days, and fined a total of £205. Their barrister Mark Wyeth QC said: 'Mr Fry who is Spencer's partner was due as the new president of the Lterature Festival and was due that afternoon to give his inaugural address. 'They hit a large backlog of traffic and in a moment of indiscretion Mr Fry suggested to Spencer that he might like to get a move on. 'No other drivers were inconvenienced and he eventually did make it by a matter of a few minutes, in time for the festival. 'Mr Fry assumes all responsibility because it was his decision that made Spencer put his foot down.' Fry, ‎dressed in a green corduroy jacket, checked shirt and pink tie, watched in court as his future husband was handed his punishment. ‎Spencer was told by the magistrates: 'Your partner persuaded you to increase your speed so you were not late for an engagement.' After the hearing, the newly engaged couple were ushered out of the co‎urt building via a back entrance. They then walked to Fry's £150,000 Bentley - which Spencer crashed yesterday in London - and left the small Welsh town. Smiling Fry was in a jovial mood and signed autographs and posed for selfies inside the court building before the hearing. And as the magistrates considered their decision he teased Spencer - telling him he was ""probably facing a stretch in jail"". After the case he said the time since announcing their engagement has been ""wonderful"" and that they planned to tie the knot within the next year. Speaking after the case Fry said: ""It's been wonderful. We've not fixed a date and if I had I wouldn't tell you! But I can say it will be sometime within the next year or so. ""As is the way with these things it became public when we filled in the paperwork. ""It was probably a bit much to expect a quiet ceremony."" Overjoyed: Stephen Fry and his new fiancé Elliott Spencer, 27 outside the star's London home yesterday . Official: Mr Fry, wore an engagement ring today, and said he and his partner have not set a date for their wedding . Tight turn: Yesterday Mr Spencer tried to manoeuvre Mr Fry's £150,000 Bentley out of a garage and scraped the side . Public record: This is the declaration to marry posted in the Registry Office in Dereham shortly before Christmas . Nothing could wipe the smile from Stephen Fry's face as he emerged from his plush Piccadilly home yesterday with his husband-to-be Elliot Spencer - not even his fiance scratching his Bentley. The 57-year-old QI star and his partner, 27, wore matching engagement rings as they announced the wedding is planned sometime this year. Minutes earlier, Mr Spencer had tried to manoeuvre Mr Fry's prized Bentley Continental GT out of a tight garage and scraped the side. Despite the damage to the £150,000 motor, Mr Fry simply shrugged it off with a smile, saying it was 'nothing', but was the one who took the steering wheel when the couple drove off. Earlier Mr Spencer's parents spoke about the upcoming wedding, saying they are 'over the moon' after the star revealed he will marry their son, who is 30 years his junior. Robert and Miranda Spencer, from Southampton, admitted they are delighted about the couple's decision to wed after their whirlwind romance. The couple were first seen together last November, but the pair are understood to have become serious  over the summer. Mr Spencer's parents have given them their blessing and Mr Fry said: 'I have met them and they are very nice'. The pair could been seen engagement rings on their wedding fingers and Mr Fry added: 'They are very similar, both are made of Rhodium and are almost matching.' Overjoyed: The actor said today he was 'very very happy' that he and his partner Elliott, together in September, will marry in the coming year . The engagement came less than three years after he tried to kill himself during an unhappy spell in his life where he struggled to cope with fame, loneliness and the break-up of his previous relationship. Mr Fry, who suffers from bipolar disorder, revealed that in 2012 he tried to kill himself with a cocktail of vodka and pills, and was only saved by a producer who discovered him. Friends have credited the young stand-up comic, who is 30 years Fry's junior, with putting a smile back on the actor's face following a crippling battle with depression. Friends have spoken of the joy that the young man has brought to Fry's life, with one telling The Sun: 'Since Stephen met Elliott, it is like he has a new lust for life. 'We've got the old Stephen back. He has found new hope in Elliott and they thrive off each other.' The 27-year-old writer and comedian is the son of a property developer, who is believed be a millionaire. Robert Spencer set up Hood House Limited with a business partner and the firm has built a series of new homes in Hampshire, West Sussex and on the Isle of Wight.

"Footage showing a strange object streaking across the sky beneath a jet plane has emerged, prompting questions about what the other aircraft could be. Filmed a few years ago but released this week, the video - which was uploaded to YouTube - shows the view outside the left side of a carrier aircraft with the wing in sight. Posted by Finding UFO, a group whose aim is to spot unidentified flying objects across Australia, the footage shows a small white disc zooming across the sky in the blink of an eye through the airspace above Canberra. Scroll down for video . Footage has emerged showing a strange object streaking across the sky above Canberra . Entering from the left hand side of the screen the object appears to be travelling at great speed as it streaks past along the clouds. It then seems to transit beneath the plane and out of sight . 'An unidentified flying object was caught on camera from an airplane near Canberra, Australia on April 04, 2012,' the video's description reads. Appearing on the left hand side of the plane the object appears to be travelling at great speed . It then disappears under the plane and out of sight, and does not look to be another plane or helicopter . 'It was filmed by a passenger. 'The UFO was flying very fast below the Aircraft. It doesn't look like a normal plane or helicopter but it looks like a flying saucer.' It is unclear why the passenger on the plane was filming out the aircraft's window, but commenters on the video have backed the legitimacy of the footage.

"Two lawyers representing a woman who . claims to have had sex as a minor with prominent U.S. criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz have filed a counter-defamation . lawsuit against him. Former federal judge Paul Cassell and Florida plaintiffs . attorney Bradley Edwards filed the lawsuit in a Florida circuit . court, accusing Dershowitz of initiating a public media assault . on their reputation and character, according to court documents. In a filing in Florida federal court last week, Cassell and . Edwards said their client, identified by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts, was forced . as a minor by financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with several . people, including Dershowitz and  Prince Andrew. Two lawyers representing Virginia Roberts, pictured here with her husband Robert Giuffre in Denver, who claims to have had sex while a minor with prominent U.S.criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, filed a counter-defamation lawsuit against him . On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on the lawyers' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same. In a sworn statement in a Florida . federal court, he denied he had sex with an underage girl on . Epstein's private plane and island. Buckingham Palace has also . denied the allegations against Prince Andrew. In their lawsuit, Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz . defamed them when he accused them of 'deliberate misconduct and . unethical behavior warranting disbarment' during several . interviews with U.S. and international media outlets. On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Cassell and Edwards' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same . Controversy: Prince Andrew, pictured here in Verbier, Switzerland, has been linked with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and accused of having sex with Virginia Roberts when she was a minor . Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz made defamatory . statements in 'reckless disregard' in order to support his claim . of innocence. 'I'm thrilled that they sued me, because this gives me an . opportunity to depose them and prove beyond any doubt that they . concocted the entire story out of whole cloth and that they did . not do a proper investigation and that they have falsely accused . me,' Dershowitz said on Tuesday. Dershowitz said in Monday's filing that the allegation . against him was a 'deliberate lie.' He said that while he had . flown on Epstein's plane several times, Roberts, named in court papers as Jane Doe #3, was not on . any of those trips. Lawyers: Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied . Questions: Prince Andrew is photographed with Virginia Roberts in 2001, left, and she is also pictured with her father, right, when she was seven. Roberts accused the prince and Dershowitz of having sex with her . He also said he had been to Epstein's island . once, for a day, and was with his wife and daughter the whole . time. Also on Monday, Dershowitz filed a motion in federal court . to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his . accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them. The women say the government's 2008 plea deal with Epstein, . which allowed him to serve jail time on state charges but avoid . federal prosecution, violated their rights.

"Britain's most violent prisoner Charles Bronson has disowned his younger brother - after he auctioned off cartoons he'd drawn for their mother . Britain's most violent prisoner Charles Bronson has disowned his younger brother - after he allegedly auctioned off gifts their mother. The 62-year-old, who changed his name to Charles Salvador last year in tribute to his beloved Salvador Dali, was first jailed for armed robbery in 1974. But he has since earned a reputation as 'the most violent prisoner in Britain' thanks to a long rap sheet of brutal attacks on prison officers and fellow inmates. Now in solitary at HMP Wakefield, Bronson - real name Michael Peterson - has labeled his brother Mark a traitor after finding out that six items that were meant to be gifts to his 85-year-old mum Eira had been sold off. Bronson, speaking from his cell in a taped conversation released by those campaigning for his release this week, said he would 'never forgive' his brother or cousin Lorraine Salvage and her husband Andy - who organised the auction. The auction of 200 items included drawings, t-shirts, sweatshirts and personal items. It was held at JP Humbert auction house on October 9 last year - making around £5,500. But he was adamant he had never given permission for all of the items to be sold off - and is now demanding the six 'gifts' be returned to him by the successful bidders. Speaking this week, Bronson - aka Salvador - said: 'I never even really wanted that auction. 'I done it as a favour (to Mark, Lorraine and Andy) - and out of the auction I got £5,500. I gave my brother £5,500. 'What I saw in the auction booklet I couldn't believe it - it made me so angry - there were six items that I gave my mother, six gifts - and they sold. Bronson pictured with his brother Marl (left) and mother Eira (centre). 'So they sold my mother's gifts - that's my brother done that, my brother, and my cousin Lorraine (Salvage) and Andy (her husband). 'They sold my mother's gifts - now that's unforgivable. 'I was doing them a favour - I don't need the money - I did it for them.' He went on to call them arrogant traitors: 'They are not my family or my friends they are traitors. 'The six people that bought my mother's gifts - I want them back - whatever you paid for them I will give you the same money plus a drink for New Year, but I want them six gifts back and I want them to go back to my mother.' Bronson was jailed for life in 2000 after taking prison art teacher Phil Danielson hostage at HMP Hull in February 1999 after he criticised one of his sketches. Pictured is a piece of his distinctive artwork . Bronson  - who has changed his name to Salvador - now says he has put his violent past behind him and is looking for a peaceful life creating his artworks . Lorraine Etherington, who befriended Bronson four years ago and runs the Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund, said Bronson was 'very upset' that the items had been sold. Ms Etherington, who along with Lorraine Salvage (Bronson's cousin) handed in a petition of 10,000 signatures calling for Bronson's release to Downing Street last August, said: 'Charlie was extremely upset to see the items that had sold. 'As his statement testifies, personal items to his mother, clothing, and confidential psychiatric reports were sold as well as art. 'The items signed to his mother were the biggest upset to him (and) they were sold without his knowledge. Last year Salvador had two years added to his sentence after attacking a prison governor at HMP Woodhill . Clothes worn by Charles Bronson  also went under the hammer in a sale that had been expected to raise thousands of pounds . 'As a consequence of the events that have unfolded, and how people have behaved, Charlie feels he has been used by his own family. 'Due to the way money has been divided up, he also feels he has been ripped off.' Mark Peterson, 53, said his brother gave permission for the auction. The money was to be partly donated to charity after the sale. Bronson was jailed for life in 2000 after taking prison art teacher Phil Danielson hostage at HMP Hull in February 1999 after he criticised one of his sketches. Due to the controversial nature of the material, the auction operated on a 'no estimate, no reserve' basis, but previous paintings by the artist have fetched more than £1,000 . Mr Salvador says he has put his violent past behind him and is looking for a peaceful life creating his artworks . He has convictions for wounding, criminal damage, GBH, false imprisonment, blackmail and threatening to kill - and has taken hostages in 10 prison sieges, attacked at least 20 prison officers and caused £500,000 in damage in rooftop protests. Last year he had two years added to his sentence after attacking a prison governor at HMP Woodhill. Despite the latest incidents, the muscle-bound convict - who is said to do 2,000 push-ups a day – recently claimed his violent days ended more than a decade ago. Mr Salvador now says he has put his violent past behind him and is looking for a peaceful life creating his artworks.","Auction  included drawings, t-shirts, sweatshirts and personal items .

"She's one of showbiz's most famous redheads so it's hardly surprising that actress Christina Hendricks has been snapped up to front a new hair colour campaign. The Mad Men star has been unveiled as the face - and glossy raven tresses - of Nice 'N Easy, promoting the brand's Shift A Shade campaign, which aims to inspire women to  find their true colour. Speaking about her new role, the 39-year-old from Tennessee said: 'I’m so excited. It’s a product I’ve been using ever since I went red. I love that the results are so natural looking; I know it’s going to turn out natural and beautiful and I don’t have to worry about it.' Flame-haired Mad Men actress Christina Hendricks has been unveiled as the new face of Nice 'N Easy . She continued: 'People never believe that I do my hair colour myself at home. They say, ""You don’t do your hair at home by yourself, do you?"" and I always reply and say ""I honestly do!"".' Naturally a dark blonde, as a young girl Christina was first inspired to colour her hair red by the fictional heroine of LM Montgomery’s books, Anne Of Green Gables, another of the world’s most iconic red heads. Finally making the leap early in her career, Christina coloured her hair for an Italian magazine shoot and it’s been her colour of choice ever since; through the beginnings of her acting and modelling career, to all seven seasons of Mad Men. Speaking to MailOnline about making the plunge from blonde to red all those years ago, Christina said: 'The first time I did a photo shoot with Clairol Nice 'N Easy was when I was about 19 or 20 years old, I was a model and I was blonde at the time. '[They] took me red and I was absolutely thrilled, I loved it so much I still actually have the picture from that shoot. I went back to my agency and said I’m staying red this is it, I love it, and they let me.' Naturally a dark blonde, when she was younger Christina coloured her hair red thanks to fictional heroine of LM Montgomery’s books, Anne Of Green Gables, whom she admired . The star, who was once hailed the sexiest woman in the world by Esquire magazine, revealed that her red hair has influenced her style. She said: 'I think being a red head has encouraged me to be a bit more playful with my fashion, maybe be little bit more quirky and eccentric even, so when I go out in the evening I like to play with colour and jewellery and it sort of compliments being a red head.' Mad Men will soon come to an end after seven seasons, but Christina  has already started to move on from the period drama. The  actress behind Joan Harris (nee Holloway) has been cast on Cameron Crowe's upcoming comedy, Roadies. The 39-year-old, who was once hailed the sexiest woman in the world by Esquire magazine, revealed that her red hair has helped her experiment with fashion . Cable network Showtime made the casting announcement in December. Hendricks will play Shelli, the tough-but-emotional production manager of a touring rock band and her character is described as being 'married to her job.' Hendricks' co-stars in the one-hour comedy include Luke Wilson, as a newly sober tour manager, and Imogen Poots as an electrical technician. A busy actress for several years before Mad Men, Hendricks appeared in recurring roles for shows like ER, Firefly, and Life. But it was her casting as head secretary Joan Holloway on Mad Men that brought Hendricks wider fame. Betty Draper (January Jones), Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) and Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) made names for themselves in Mad Men . Her character dealt with the business world of the 1960s, facing everything from casual sexism and rape to single motherhood. For her work, Hendricks received five Emmy nominations for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama. Fans will not have to wait for the premiere of Roadies to see Hendricks again, since the final episodes of Mad Men will air during 2015. Hendricks will also co-star with Chloe Grace Moretz, Nicholas Hoult, and Charlize Theron in the 2015 film, Dark Places.","Christina, 39, models for hair colouring brand .

"Labour has moved to suspend a councillor after sharing a parody of a Tory election poster featuring a picture of Auschwitz. Nottingham councillor Rosemary Healy claimed not to have noticed the doctored image had replaced the 'road to recovery' with the railway leading to the Nazi death camp. However, the creator of the controversial graphic, Thomas Pride, defended the parody and joked it had caused a bit of 'spluttering outrage and controversy'. The controversial image was posted by Twitter user Thomas Pride, and retweeted by Labour councillor Rosemary Healy . The image was based on a poster unveiled by David Cameron last week, with the message 'Let's stay on the road to a stronger recovery' Ms Healy, who represents the Mapperley ward on Nottingham City Council, retweeted the picture to more than 1,500 followers on Twitter . Ms Healy later tweeted 'profound apologies' and claimed not to have noticed the picture included Auschwitz . Ms Healy, who represents the Mapperley ward on Nottingham City Council, retweeted the picture to more than 1,500 followers on Twitter. She later expressed 'profound apologies' and has deleted her Twitter profile. Labour confirmed that the council's executive assistant for community protection had been suspended amid closer-than-ever scrutiny of politicians' internet postings in the run-up to May's general elections. The original post shared by Ms Healy was an altered version of a Tory poster - the original of which was mocked after it emerged the photo of a country road featured above the slogan 'Let's stay on the road to a stronger economy' was of one in Germany, not the UK. It was posted by the @ThomasPride account but replaced the road with a picture of the railway lines leading into the notorious Auschwitz camp where more than a million people - almost all Jews - died during the Second World War. 'The new Tory campaign poster featuring a German road's a bit controversial' the post quipped - adding the slogan 'more people on zero hours, more tax cuts for the rich, no more NHS'. The creator of the image was unrepentant, and reposted it after the row broke out last night . Pride also hit back at critics of what he called his 'satire' of Conservative election promises . Ms Healy quickly deleted the Tweet and posted: 'Profound apologies for that retweet which was a genuine mistake and would never have been retweeted had I recognised it for what it was.' The Conservative group leader on Nottingham City Council, Cllr Georgina Culley, told the website:  'This trivialises the horrors of the holocaust and I think Councillor Healy and her party should be ashamed. 'The city council should also act to distance itself from the perpetuation of these tweets, such remarks are offensive and a public representative should know better.' The user of the Thomas Pride account defended the image against complaints from others on the social media network that it was 'deeply ignorant' and 'belittles the Holocaust' - insisting it was legitimate satire and that he was of Polish descent.","Nottingham councillor Rosemary Healy claimed not to recognise image .

"It's not college students or teenagers but rather middle-aged Americans who are most likely to die from drinking too much alcohol too quickly, according to a study released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday. An average of six people die each day in the United States from alcohol poisoning or excessively high levels of alcohol in the blood, which is typically caused by binge drinking, the federal study found. Three out of four of those who died were between the ages of 35 and 64, the study found, countering the popular perception that young people are more likely than their elders to die from binge drinking. Shocking finding: It's not college students or teenagers but rather middle-aged American men who are most likely to die from binge drinking, a CDC study has revealed . Only 5.1 percent of the deaths were drinkers between the ages of 15 and 24, the study found. 'Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is a lot of binge drinking going on by people who are post college-age,' the study's co-author, Robert Brewer, told reporters. 'We were surprised by these findings.' The CDC defines binge drinking as consuming four or more drinks for women or five or more drinks for men on a single occasion. Fewer than a third of the people who died of alcohol poisoning were considered alcoholics, the study found. Analyzing death certificate data from 2010 through 2012, researchers found that an average of 2,200 people, more than half of them white males, died from alcohol poisoning each year. State death rates ranged from a low of 5.3 deaths per million residents in Alabama to a high of 46.5 deaths per million residents in Alaska. The regions with the highest death rates were the Great Plains, the West and New England. 'Living in geographically isolated rural areas might increase the likelihood that a person with alcohol poisoning will not be found before death or that timely emergency medical services will not be available,' the researchers wrote.","An average of six people die each day in the United States from alcohol poisoning or excessively high levels of alcohol in the blood .

"Slot machine raiders recruited two glamorous young women to distract workers at a nightclub while they made off with more than £1,000 in coins, a court heard. Danielle Mason and Nicole White, both 20, befuddled staff while the looters secretly emptied a 'Cops and Robbers' and a 'Deal or No Deal' gaming machines. The gang were found to have a stash of more than £1,120 in coins when police stopped their getaway car. A special key needed to access the slot machines was also found hidden in Mason's leggings. Danielle Mason, pictured left, and Nicole White, pictured right, both aged 20, distracted workers at Hot Shots nightclub in Burnley, Lancashire, while slot machine raiders made off with £1,000 in coins . The three men, who enlisted the young women, had more than 100 convictions between them for stealing from gaming machines, Burnley Crown Court was told. A judge jailed ringleader Jamie Finney, 28, for eight months, whilst Anthony Wainwright, 40, who was in breach of a suspended jail term for possessing a knuckleduster, was given ten months. Amateur footballer Barry Cantley, 22, was jailed for two months. Shop assistant Mason and single mother White were each given 12 month conditional discharges after a judge said they were on the 'periphery' of the raids. All five admitted theft and attempted theft as they appeared at the Crown Court. Single mother Nicole White, 20, had no previous convictions, the court was told . Shop assistant Danielle Mason, 20, also had no previous convictions . Prosecutor Stephen Parker told the hearing the group raid was planned and tools and a car were used to commit the offences, which happened just after 9pm on November 2 last year. The duty manager saw the gang playing on the bandit machines upstairs. He watched them for some time on the CCTV and thought they were acting suspiciously. The Deal or No Deal machine showed it was getting ready to be emptied or pay out. He went to speak to the group and asked them what they were doing. Mr Parker said Wainwright claimed he had put £1 in the machine and it wouldn't go down the slot and he had shaken the machine and switched it off. Jamie Finney, 28, pictured left, Anthony Wainwright, 40, pictured centre, and Barry Cantly, 22, pictured right, had between them more than 100 convictions between them for stealing from gaming machines . Fearing that they had been rumbled the gang then fled the premises and left the duty manager to inspect the machines and discover they had been tampered with. Police were called and town centre CCTV operators monitored the five as they made off and got into a car. They were stopped a short distance away by the police, who found a bag containing £1,122 in £1 coins in the vehicle. Finney had £500 on him. It was said in Nicola White's defence that she it was 'bad judgement' on her part to take part . The prosecutor continued: 'Recovered from the leggings of Mason was a set of three keys, which, in the view of the engineer who inspected the gaming machines, had been adapted to fit these particular machines. Keys for them can only be obtained from certain locksmiths. 'He tried the keys recovered from Mason and they fitted both the devices, accessing both where the £1 coins and cash were kept. One of the machines had been emptied of all money, both cash and coins.' The machine owners estimated it was likely to have had between £500 and £600 in it. Police found the special key used to open the slot machines in Danielle Mason's leggings . Wainwright later told police he had been in Manchester with the others, had a good day, had won about £1,000 and they decided to call in Burnley on the way home. He did not accept any wrong-doing on his part and claimed he knew nothing about the keys used on the machines. Finney claimed about £1,000 had been won in Salford and that he quickly hit the £70 jackpot at Hotshots, then doubled it to £140. It was said in the defence of shop assistant Mason that she was not aware this was a pre planned activity . When the machine didn't pay out, he switched it off. He claimed he had not tampered with any machine or used the key to try and open them. White said Wainwright and Finney regularly won money on bandit machines and denied any wrongdoing. She told officers the coins were Wainwright's winnings. Father-of-two Finney had 60 previous offences on his record whilst Wainwright had clocked up 40 convictions. Mason's barrister said: 'She was offered a day out and due to her rather dismal circumstances, she agreed.' Cantley had five offences on his record and had served a previous term of detention for theft from a machine. Mason and White had no previous convictions. Police have now taken civil proceedings over the money recovered from the car. In mitigation Nick Dearing, for Finney, said his client had an addiction to gambling and added: 'Rather than formal schooling, his education seems to have been attending at local amusement arcades and watching people playing on gaming machines. On good days, he will raise money, but on bad days, he will break into a machine and steal money from it.' Nicole White, pictured left, and Danielle Mason, pictured right, were each given 12 month conditional discharges after a judge at Burnley Crown Court said they were on the 'periphery' of the raids . Representing Mason, Mr Dearing told the court: 'As far as she was concerned, this was not a pre-planned activity. She was offered a day out and due to her rather dismal circumstances, she agreed.' Keith Harrison, for White, who is on benefits, said she had a young child and added: ' She was by no means the main player in all this. It was bad judgement on her behalf to go along with it.' Passing sentence Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'This was organised offending, particularly, it seems to me, on the parts of you, Mr Finney and Mr Wainwright, particularly given your previous convictions.' The thefts happened at Hot Shots nightclub in Burnley, Lancashire, in November last year .","Gang of five targeted Hot Shots nightclub in Burnley, Lancashire .

"Australian terrorist Mohamed Elomar has posted a chilling tweet wishing the Sydney siege victims 'rot in hell' just a day after they died. An image of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson was posted after the siege ended along with the caption: 'Did someone say ''Rot in Hell'' yes indeed rot hell for eternity.' It was tweeted from a Twitter account thought to belong to western Sydney jihadist Mohamed Elomar. This comes as a photo of a child described as 'Abu Omar al australi young cub of the Islamic State' was posted this week. The new picture surfaced of a 'cub jihadist' believed to be the son of notorious militant Khaled Sharrouf - as Australian jihadists celebrate a reunion in the Middle East. Sharrouf fled to the Middle East last year and was shortly followed by his wife, Tara Nettleton, and their three children. Scroll down for video . An image of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson was posted on December 17 after the siege ended along with the caption: 'Did someone say ''Rot in Hell'' yes indeed rot hell for eternity.' Boy militant: A Twitter account which purportedly belongs to Mohamed Elomar posted this image, captioned: Abu Omar al Australia young cub of the Islamic State' 'Aussie reunion in the land of khalifa', the account captioned this image of Melbourne men Mahmoud Abdullatif and Abu Jihad . In another image posted Elomar, Melbourne men Mahmoud Abdullatif and Abu Jihad are pictured, apparently joining forces with the western Sydney men in fighting for the Islamic State. 'Aussie reunion in the land of khalifa,' the picture is captioned. Jihad is pictured wielding a high-powered, silver rifle. Abdullatif, who was a purveyor of fast cars and a keen reveller at Melbourne nightclubs just months ago, is pictured heavily bearded and wearing military fatigues. Sharrouf and Elomar first rose to infamy after they posted pictures of themselves, and one of Sharrouf's sons, dangling decapitated heads in the Syrian city of Raqqa last year. Monash University terror expert Greg Barton told Daily Mail Australia the jihadists were trying to convey a particular propaganda message. Pictured: Mahmoud Abdullatif was known for his partyboy lifestyle while living in Australia . Abdullatif swapped his life of partying to fight for the Islamic State . 'I think Islamic State's quite happy to convey the picture that everyone's having a jolly good time and that it's a manly thing to do. 'Fathers can let their youngest sons join them in the fighting. But Islamic State wants to let this vibe go out to help their recruitment.' Elomar had recently advertised selling Yazidi slave girls on one of his social media accounts. 'Anyone interested got 1 of 7 yehzidi for sale,' he said. 'She won't disappoint you'. One of Khaled Sharrouf's three children . Elomar: The two western Sydney terrorists posted pictures of themselves dangling decapitated heads last year . Prof Barton said: 'They're also pushing this idea of young men not married going over and finding some attractive and submissive young wife. It's silly stuff. 'I think it's feeding this fantasy that everything is positive.' Last month, the Sydney siege claimed the lives of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson. A vile tweet was posted about the two victims on December 17, saying: 'Did someone say ''Rot in Hell'' yes indeed rot hell for eternity.' However their deaths shook the whole city as thousands paid tribute by leaving flowers nearby the Lindt cafe in Martin Place - where the crisis took place.

"Foie gras lovers in California can rejoice after a federal judge on Wednesday blocked the state's ban on the sale of the fatty duck and goose liver. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson permanently blocked the state attorney general from enforcing the law that took effect two years ago, finding that the federal government's authority to regulate foie gras and other poultry products supersedes the state's. California barred farmers from force-feeding birds corn with a tube, which is how foie gras is produced. The corn enlarges the livers of ducks and geese in order to make the delicacy. Back on the menu: Foie gras is now legal in California. A judge on Wednesday invalidated a two-year-old ban after finding that federal food regulations pre-empt California's ability to outlaw the dish . Controversial: Ducks are force-fed corn in order to enlarge their livers, which will be made into foie gras. This photo was taken at a farm in Louestault, France . The state also banned sales of the delicacy. The federal ruling came in a lawsuit brought by foie gras farmers in Canada and New York and by the Hermosa Beach restaurant Hot's Kitchen. Their attorney, Michael Tenenbaum, called the ruling a victory 'not just for foie gras but for freedom.' His statement said Hot's Kitchen chef Sean Chaney is shouting from the rooftop, 'Let the foie start flowing again!' Some restaurants had defied or tried to find loopholes in the ban, including the Presidio Social Club in San Francisco, whose managers contended the law didn't apply to them because the restaurant is on land administered by a federal agency. Chicago passed a similar ban on the delicacy but later repealed it.","California legislators enacted a law in 2004 that prohibited the sale of foie gras but didn't take effect until 2012 .

"A college has banned pupils from going to the toilet on their own during exams in a bid to stop them cheating on their smartphones.

The move has been condemned by angry parents, with one saying: 'This would be degrading to anyone - let alone to kids of 16 and 17. 'It is a clear disregard for basic human rights and is downright wrong.' In an e-mail to parents informing them of the school's decision, Mr Ashdown said: 'We have had students attempt to cheat using phones while on toilet breaks during an exam. 'This means that from now on, if a student does require a toilet break during an exam, they will be accompanied into the toilet area by an invigilator of the appropriate sex, and will not be allowed to close the door if they need to use an individual stall. 'Although this may seem a little extreme, it is the only way we can ensure a student does not use a mobile phone while in the toilet. 'Ideally, students should ensure they do not need to break their concentration by going to the toilet in the middle of the exam. 'I know I can rely on you for support with these security measures.' Principal Paul Ashdown admitted that the decision was 'extreme' but said it was 'the only way' (file picture) The college has taken drastic action over fears pupils will cheat on exams by looking up the answers on their smartphones while hidden away in the toilet. The principle said it follows cheating last year (file pictures) The new rule will come into force when mock AS and A2 exams take place later this month. Mr Ashdown said the crackdown was an attempt to 'protect the future chances of our students'. He said: 'The college is implementing this toilet breaks policy during examinations to make students aware that attempting to cheat is simply not worth it. 'A very small minority of students attempt to cheat and they use increasingly inventive and sophisticated techniques, including using mobile phones smuggled into the toilets. 'However, the consequences of cheating are very severe because students will find themselves disqualified from that exam by the exam board, and possibly even disqualified from all their other exams too. 'We are protecting the future chances of our students by implementing strict security measures. 'The majority of students will not need to use the toilet during an exam, but if they do, our experienced invigilator team will supervise closely, but sensitively, to ensure that no cheating takes place.'","College bans pupils from going to the toilet on their own during exams .

"A Florida man who was wearing a T-shirt advertising that he had drugs in his possession has been arrested after police found he was carrying crystal meth and cannabis. John Richard Balmer, 50, of Hudson, Florida, was arrested by Pasco County Sheriff's Office, who compounded his misfortune by posting a mugshot featuring the T-shirt on their Facebook page. According to custody documents, Balmer is facing charges of possession of methampehtamine and a further charge of possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana. John Balmer, pictured, was arrested wearing a T-shirt claiming 'I have drugs' after Pasco County Sheriff's Office found cannabis and methamphetamine when he was searched at a Kmart store in Hudson, Florida . John Balmer, pictured, is being held on a bond of $2,150 after his arrest on the two drugs charges . He is on a bond of $2,000 for the crystal meth charge and a further $150 for the second charge. Balmer was arrested on Monday at the Kmart in Hudson, Florida, which is about 30 miles north west of Tampa. Pasco County Sheriff's Office published a photograph of Balmer's arrest with the comment: 'OHH THE IRONY! 50 year old John Balmer was arrested and charged with possession of meth at the Kmart in Hudson. Pay close attention to the t-shirt.' Balmer's T-shirt asked 'WHO NEEDS DRUGS - No, seriously, I have drugs.' The T-shirt is available for $12.49 on eBay. According to an arrest report seen by the Tampa Bay Times, when Balmer saw a sheriff's deputy walk into the store he tried to pass a 'bag of green leafy substance' to the person standing behind him in the queue. Balmer then approached the counter, paid for his items and left the bag on the floor. Shop staff told the deputy about the bag and he was arrested at the scene.

"It’s been said that music is a universal language, and now a new study claims that it really does cut across cultures. Researchers found that whether you are a pygmy in the Congolese rainforest or a hipster in London, aspects of music move us in the same way. Certain combinations of notes from popular pieces of music heard in films, for example, made people from different cultures feel similarly calm or excited. Researchers found that whether you are a pygmy in the Congolese rainforest or a hipster in London, aspects of music move us in the same way, making us either feel excited (illustrated with a stock image) or calm . Researchers from Technische Universität Berlin, the University of Montreal and McGill University in Montreal, Canada, came to their conclusion after travelling deep into the rainforest to play music to Mbenzélé Pygmies - an isolated group of people without access to radio, TV or electricity. They compared how the Mbenzélé responded both to their own and to unfamiliar Western music, as well as the way that a group of Canadians reacted to the same pieces. The team discovered that although the groups felt differently about whether specific pieces of music made them feel good or bad, they agreed upon whether the music made them feel calm or excited, according to the journal Frontiers in Psychology. In the experiment, the researchers played clips of 11 western and eight pygmy melodies of between 30 and 90 seconds long. Researchers from Technische Universität Berlin, the University of Montreal and McGill University in Canada, came to their conclusion after travelling deep into the rainforest to play music to Mbenzélé Pygmies (shown) - an isolated group of people without access to radio, TV or electricity . A team of German and Canadian researchers played clips of 11 western and eight pygmy melodies of between 30 and 90 seconds long to two different cultural groups - one living in the Congolese rainforest, and another in Montreal. The western music - which included orchestral movements and excerpts from the films, Psycho, Star Wars and Schindler’s List - was designed to induce a range of emotions, including calm, excited, happy, anxious and sad. The pygmy pieces were all upbeat polyphonic vocal pieces that are intended to be performed in ceremonial contexts. A total of 40 pygmies in the Congo who sing regularly for ceremonial purposes and 40 Canadian musicians in Montreal were asked to display emoticons with smiling or frowning faces to show whether the music made them feel good or bad. Researchers also asked the participants to rate whether the music made them feel calm or excited. While the two different groups had different opinions about the clips that made them feel good or bad, they agreed that the same tracks made them feel either excited or calm.

Researchers also asked the participants to rate whether the music made them feel calm or excited. As they listened to the music, measurements were taken to record the participants’ rates of respiration, heart rates and the amount of sweat on their palms. ‘Our major discovery is that listeners from very different groups both responded to how exciting or calming they felt the music to be in similar ways,’ said Dr Hauke Egermann, of Technische Universität in Berlin. ‘This is probably due to certain low-level aspects of music such as tempo, pitch and timbre, but this will need further research.’ He noted that the Canadian musicians described feeling a wider range of emotions as they listened to the western music, compared with the pygmy singers, who did not feel as many when listening to either type of music. Dr Egermann suggests this could be because of the varying roles that music plays in each culture. Researchers also asked the participants to rate whether music - including a clip from Star Wars (stock image shown) made them feel calm or excited. As they listened to the music, measurements were taken to record the participants’ rates of reparation, heart rates, and the amount of sweat on their palms . Professor Nathalie Fernando, of the University of Montreal’s Faculty of Music, said: ‘Negative emotions are felt to disturb the harmony of the forest in pygmy culture and are therefore dangerous. ‘If a baby is crying, the Mbenzélé will sing a happy song. ‘If the men are scared of going hunting, they will sing a happy song - in general music is used in this culture to evacuate all negative emotions, so it is not really surprising that the Mbenzélé feel that all the music they hear makes them feel good.’ Stephen McAdams, of McGill University’s Schulich School of Music, added: ‘People have been trying to figure out for quite a while whether the way that we react to music is based on the culture that we come from or on some universal features of the music itself. ‘Now we know that it is actually a bit of both.’ The brains of improvising jazz musicians - such as Jamie Cullum - 'light up' in areas usually associated with words, a study revealed in June . The brains of improvising jazz musicians ‘light up’ in areas usually associated with words, researchers revealed in June. Jazz players engrossed in spontaneous musical improvisations showed activity in areas of the brain traditionally associated with spoken language and syntax - used for deciphering phrases and sentences. However, this musical conversation shut down brain areas linked to semantics, which process the meaning of spoken language, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. The scientists used MRI scanners to track the brain activity of jazz musicians in the act of 'trading fours’ - a process in which musicians participate in spontaneous back and forth instrumental exchanges, which usually last for four bars at a time. Dr Charles Limb, an associate professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the university’s School of Medicine said: ‘We’ve shown in this study that there is a fundamental difference between how meaning is processed by the brain for music and language. 'Specifically, it’s syntactic and not semantic processing that is key to this type of musical communication. Meanwhile, conventional notions of semantics may not apply to musical processing by the brain.'","Researchers from Technische Universität Berlin, and universities in Montreal, played music clips to pygmies in the Congolese rainforest .

"At around 337kg, he is Australia's heaviest man. But Ulu Tuipulotu, 26, who 'pumps a whole loaf of bread' for breakfast and is addicted to a popular video game, wants to change his life. The western Sydney man, who gorges himself with food while playing the first person shooter Call of Duty on his couch for as long as 12 hours a day, is determined to see his next birthday and be at the future weddings of his nieces and nephews. 'I want to be there, bro,' said Mr Tuipulotu, whose diet includes wolfing down a whole chicken for lunch. He has gone public with his weight loss struggle after signing up to a two-year sponsored psychological and physiological program ran by a Sydney hypnotherapist. Doctors have bluntly warned Mr Tuipulotu he will die if he cannot lose weight. But it's not going to be easy. He has attempted diets, such as Lite 'N' Easy packaged food plans. He's tried Optifast, a milkshake weight loss plan, as well as going to the gym. Nothing has worked so far. Scroll down for video . Fighting for life: Ulu Tuipulotu, 26, is determined to see his nieces and nephews get married one day . Weighing around 337kg, Ulu Tuipulotu, pictured, is determined to lose more than two thirds of his body weight . On the scales: Mr Tuipulotu today went public with his fight for life. He has lost fifteen kilos since starting a program of physical activity and hypnotherapy . Instead the unemployed man, who lives with his Tongan family in Quaker's Hill, plays online games for most of the day and touts himself as one of the best Call of Duty players in the world. 'Like a boss,' he told Daily Mail Australia. In his own words, Mr Tuipulotu has always been 'big'. He was born weighing 12.5 pounds and, at age 5, weighed 60kg. But it did not become a problem until his weight began to balloon around age 13. Now he is around four times the weight of the average Australian male, which is 85.9kg. His family also struggle with their weight. His mother Sue checks in at 180kg, his dad Sale weighs 130kg and sister Nine tops 120kg. 'We just love food as a people,' Mr Tuipulotu told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm speaking Pacific Islanders in general. Me, I just took it to the extreme'.' Mr Tuipulotu's downfall was non-stop snacking on cheeses, biscuits and packets of Arnotts Shapes . Ulu Tuipulotu, Australia's heaviest man, plays the hit video game Call of Duty (pictured) for as many as 12 hours a day . But it was his family who convinced him it was time to try something drastic. Sydney hypnotherapist Mark Stephens, who has worked with extremely obese patients in the past, has committed Mr Tuipulotu to a two-year program involving hypnotherapy and multiple sessions a week with personal trainers. Mr Stephens told Daily Mail Australia his client had tried just about everything before his mother, Sue, watched a program about the success another morbidly obese man, Jordan Tirekidis, had with hypnotherapy on the Nine Network's A Current Affair program. Mr Tirekidis lost 200kg. '(My family) are really pushing to go hard on it (his weight loss program),' Mr Tuipulotu said. 'So I've got to do it, hey?' BREAKFAST: . 'I  pump down a whole loaf of bread, toasted, and Milo (a chocolate drink) LUNCH: . 'Probably a whole chicken, like a boss.' DINNER: . 'Yeah whatever, takeaway' - including KFC, Hungry Jacks or McDonald's . SNACKS: . Chips, drinks, donuts, Arnott's Shapes, biscuits and cheese . Game player: Pictured here in his home in western Sydney, Ulu Tuipulotu, is an avid Call of Duty fan . Big boy: Tuipulotu was born at the sizeable weight of 12.5 pounds.

Mr Tuipulotu, pictured centre, grew heavier as his schooling progressed . Mr Tuipulotu and his family began the program around four weeks ago after meeting with Mr Stephens. Mr Stephens said: 'With hypnosis, the worst thing that can happen is nothing. The best thing is you can change your life. Dietitian Dr Joanna McMillan said the reasons why Mr Tuipulotu is overweight are apparent in his unhealthy diet, which included constant snacking on cheese, biscuits and Arnott's Shapes while playing games. 'It's not hard to see why he was so overweight when he has that kind of a diet,' she said. But he could make drastic changes by just making small changes to his diet each week. 'Let's just focus on three meals and two snacks and don't eat in between,' she said. 'Cutting down on that amount of bread. Introducing vegetables.' Australia's heaviest: Mr Tuipulotu, pictured today after setting the scales at 337kg . Dr McMillan said the psychological side of weight loss is often forgotten. 'I often think the mind connection is what is given a bit of lip service to in any weight loss program.' 'Whether hypnotherapy, or seeing a counsellor or a hypnotherapy or a counsellor or a psychiatrist each of these people have their own approaches. 'People have to find what works for them.' Sydney GP Dr Brian Morton said hypnotherapy should be used as part of a program involving proper diet and exercise. He said he had seen it work as part of a program for smokers trying to quit. For others, it was 'useless'. 'It's not going to be magic,' Dr Morton said. Mr Tuipulotu is pledging to plough ahead, having lost 15 kilos over the space of a month. He said he is already beginning to feel the benefits of a healthier lifestyle, including more energy when he walks around. 'I can feel lots of changes,' he told Daily Mail Australia. And he warned others not to follow his lifestyle. 'Look at me, man,' he said. 'You don't want to be here.'","Australia's heaviest man has publicly pledged to lose 225kg .

"Film fans will soon be able to walk in the footsteps of their favourite Hollywood stars – as English Heritage is set to offer special tours of the fairy tale castle used to film highly anticipated blockbuster, Into The Woods. The film's producers took full advantage of England's rich history when scouting for locations, including selecting picturesque castles and ruins for the set. To celebrate the January 9th release of Into the Woods, Dover Castle in Kent will be offering themed guided tours from January 10. Film fans will soon be able to tour the real-life fairy tale castle used as the backdrop for Into the Woods . Chris Kline and Anna Kendrick were spotted last year filming at Dover Castle . The tours will showcase the areas which featured most prominently in the film and explore the real life stories of the kings and queens who resided there. Into The Woods is the big screen adaptation of the award-winning Broadway musical and features an all-star cast, including Meryl Streep as the Witch, Anna Kendrick as Cinderella and Johnny Depp as the Wolf. And the English monument also plays a starring role, as it was transformed to play a key location within the story. The famous wedding scene in the musical was filmed at the historic Kent attraction . Dover Castle in Kent will begin offering themed tours on January 10, following the film's January 9th release . The film tells the tale of a childless couple who set out to end a curse placed upon them by a vengeful witch, encountering characters from well-known fairy tales along the way. Anna Kendrick was spotted in wedding attire at the location . One of the most spectacular castles in the country, Dover Castle became the setting for a fairy tale castle, which is home to a handsome prince in the story. King Henry II's magnificent Great Tower and Inner Bailey walls took centre stage for scenes set at 'the King's Palace', and one of its grand gateways adorned with a curtain of flowers provided the backdrop for a 'Royal balcony moment' at Cinderella's wedding to her Prince. Becky Smith, General Manager at Dover Castle, said: 'The team here was very involved in working with the location team and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 'It's not every day you get to witness a giant causing an earthquake, or get to host a fairy tale ball!' 'We had to strike a careful balance between the needs of our visitors, the protection of the historic buildings in our care and the film-makers' requirements, which I feel we achieved very well. 'This is a fantastic opportunity to show off the majesty of Dover Castle in a high-profile, British-made film. 'We're really excited to see how Henry II's splendid Great Tower looks on the big screen and it just goes to prove that the best fantasies are inspired by reality.' Although located high above the coast in real life, in the film the castle lies at the edge of the woods, so a woodland scene was created from lorry-loads of trees, shrubs and greenery on the grass banks within the castle's outer walls. Atmospheric night-time scenes were filmed here, with only burning torches to light the way, while another dramatic scene saw an earthquake strike the castle. The tours will showcase the areas that featured most prominently and also recount the real life royal stories . The romantic ruins of Waverley Abbey in Surrey were also used in filming Rapunzel's scenes for the movie . The romantic ruins of England's first Cistercian Abbey, Waverley Abbey in Surrey, were also transformed, this time into a fitting storybook tower where Rapunzel, played by MacKenzie Mauzy, was held captive. 'The sets had the sense of a fairy tale, but at the same time were very real and haunting,' says Mauzy. 'Our set designers did such an amazing job that it was hard to tell the difference between my character's tower and the ruins of the Abbey, itself. You instantly become part of that world, because it seemed so real.' Dover Castle has also recently provided the filming location for Avengers: Age of Ultron and Hollow Crown, starring Benedict Cumberbatch.","Dover Castle provided location for Cinderella's castle in Into The Woods .

"They are the longest-wed presidential couple and on Tuesday former President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara  celebrated their milestone 70th wedding anniversary. The 90-year-old - who was released from a Houston hospital one week ago after being treated for shortness of breath - excitedly tweeted a message to the former first lady about the time they have spent together. The couple were married on January 6, 1945, just weeks after Bush returned from serving in World War II. 'Seventy years ago this very day, Barbara Pierce of Rye, NY made me the happiest, and luckiest, man on earth,' Bush tweeted. Together forever: George H.W. Bush, 90, sent out a loving anniversary message to his wife, Barbara Bush, Tuesday, to commemorate their milestone 70th wedding anniversary, along with this photo . The big day: Navy Lieutenant George Bush and Barbara Pierce were married in the First Prsbyterian Church in Rye, New York on January 6, 1945 . Celebrating: The pair - are the longest-wed presidential couple - went on to have six children . The couple - who in 2000 surpassed the 54-year record set by John and Abigail Adams as the longest-wed presidential couple - first met at a Christmas dance in Andover, Massachusetts. Bush was only 16-years-old at the time, Fox News reported. He proposed 18 months later before leaving to fight in World War II as a pilot in the navy. Bush was sent home from the war in September 1944 after being shot down and nearly killed during a mission over the Pacific and four months later they were married. Bush was 20 and Barbara was 19. The pair would go on to have six children - one of whom died from leukemia as a toddler -  including future President George W. Bush. Bush, the oldest living former U.S. president, was taken by ambulance to Houston Methodist Hospital last month  for what was described then as a precaution after experiencing shortness of breath. His hospital stay included Christmas. Former President George H.W. Bush was released from a Houston hospital last week after a weeklong stay for treatment of shortness of breath . The former president also spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. He was discharged in January 2013 after a nearly two-month stay. He was released from the recent stay on December 30. Bush made had made two public appearances in November. He was at Texas A&M University where his son, former President George W. Bush, talked about his book about his father. He also served as the coin-toss captain for the Houston Texans during a Nov. 23 game that honored the U.S. Armed Forces. Bush served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president before being elected the nation's 41st president in 1988. After one term, highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voters' concerns about the economy. His son eldest son, George, went on to succeed Clinton in office, serving two consecutive terms as president from 2000 to early 2008. His second son, Jeb, is mulling a bid for the presidency himself, announcing a few days before his father's hospitalization that he would 'actively explore' the possibility. Bush has skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House. In June, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the winter, Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston, Texas. Bush, also a former U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director, has a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair for mobility. On Monday his spokesman said his breathing had 'returned to normal' but he would remain in a hospital for at least another night pending approval from doctors for him to return to his Houston home. The former president and first lady Barbara Bush want to 'thank everyone for their good wishes and prayers,' McGrath said Monday.","Former President George H. W.

"McDonald's Japan has . apologised to customers and vowed to ensure product safety after . objects including a tooth and plastic were found in its food. The food safety scandal comes as the fast-food chain is hit by sliding sales and a shortage of french fries caused by a labour dispute. McDonald's Japan is on track to record its sixth straight year of sales declines and its first annual loss in 11 years. Convenience stores in particular have drawn away customers with broader ranges of ready-made meals and low-priced coffee. McDonald's Japan has apologised to customers and vowed to ensure product safety afterobjects including a tooth and plastic were found in its food . Today's apology came after a diner found a roughly 1 1/2 inch strip of vinyl in a Chicken McNugget at the . weekend. That prompted the chain to halt sales of nuggets made . on the same day as the contaminated item at a plant in Thailand. The company is still investigating the cause. Other incidents that have damaged the restaurants brand include the discovery of a human tooth in a french fry in August, and a child cutting its mouth on a piece of plastic in a sundae in December. McDonald's sought to reassure the public about its standards at a news conference with Takehiko Aoki, senior vice president at McDonald's Holding Co (Japan) Ltd, saying he was 'confident that my family can eat McDonald's products'. Mr Aoki said the believed the company's response to the food safety scare had been 'appropriate'. McDonald's Japan began sourcing nuggets from three . Thai plants less than six months ago. The change was aimed at . boosting confidence in product quality after Chinese supplier . Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd was accused of selling expired meat. McDonald's Japan vice president Takehiko Aoki, centre, reassured the public about the restaurants food standards and said he was 'confident that my family can eat McDonald's products' The Thai plant that produced the nugget containing vinyl is located in Saraburi and is owned by Cargill, who have not commented on the incident. On Monday, just days after the latest discovery, McDonald's . Japan resumed sales of all sizes of french fries for the first . time in three weeks. A labour dispute at U.S. West Coast ports . had delayed imports, forcing the company to ration portions. Meanwhile, McDonald's fans in Venezuela are still waiting for french fries to return to their menus. The imports delays in the U.S. comes as . socialist Venezuela grapples with shortfalls of basic goods . ranging from medicines to flour due to strict currency controls . that stymie imports. McDonald's restaurants are coping by replacing the spuds . with salad or local fare such as fried yuca or 'arepa' corn . pancakes - but it's no happy meal for McDonald's fans. Two cashiers at separate restaurants said fries had been . missing for two weeks and that business had dropped as a result. Arcos Dorados S.A., McDonald's Corp's key operator . in Latin America, did not reply to queries about whether . Venezuela's Byzantine three-tiered exchange rate system was to . blame. French fries only became available again in Japan on Monday after a three week absence caused by a labour dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, and they are still off the menu in Venezuela . But the company's senior director for corporate communications, Sonia Ruseler said the shortage was down to a 'temporary issue with distribution which we are trying to solve'. A protracted labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports forced . McDonald's to ration fries in Japan last year. Fries sold at McDonald's restaurants in Latin America are . imported from Argentina, Canada or the United States, according . to Ms Ruseler. Weary Venezuelans were quick to blame the country's currency . controls, implemented more than a decade ago to stem capital . flight and viewed as the root of the current economic crisis. 'Fries are definitely imported and there are no dollars to . bring them in,' said Patricia, whose granddaughter, Arantxa, ran . off to play when she learned there were no fries on offer. 'A month ago we came and she did eat, because there were . fries,' said Patricia, who declined to give her last name.","A diner found a 1 1/2 inch strip of vinyl in a Chicken McNugget .

"A pair of frisky Louisianans were arrested last week for allegedly engaging in oral sex in a moving vehicle. A Kenner police officer pulled over driver Mario Espinal, 33, and his passenger Arletha Alexander, 46, on New Year's Day after first noticing them driving with no headlights around 10pm. The officer said he then noticed someone's head 'moving in an up and down motion' before the passenger began to 'scramble' back to her seat. Once  at the side of the road, the officer says he found Espinal with his pants hanging down by his knees, reports NOLA.com. Caught: Mario Espinal, 33, and his passenger Arletha Alexander, 46, were arrested New Year's Day after a cop noticed them engaged in oral sex with Espinal behind the wheel of a moving vehicle . In his pants leg was a bulge that turned out to be Espinal's underwear. When questioned, Espinal allegedly came clean to the officer, saying Alexander offered to trade him oral sex for a ride. Alexander, however, demurred. She told the officer that she would never perform such an act on Espinal because, reports NOLA, 'she didn't even know him.' Both were arrested. Espinal was charged with obscenity, prostitution, crimes against nature, driving with no license, failure to obey a police officer, failure to use headlights and having no registration certificate. He was held without bond thanks to an unrelated fugitive charge. Alexander's bond was set at $9,500 after she was booked for prostitution, obscenity, crimes against nature and four traffic attachments. She remained behind bars as of Tuesday. Pants down: Espinal and Alexander were cruising down this Kenner, Louisiana street during the alleged incident. Espinal's pants were slung near his knees when the officer pulled them over.

"Matthew Tvrdon pleaded guilty to killing Karina Menzies but denies her murder . A mother who saved her children from a terrifying hit-and-run rampage suffered from a crippling disease which meant she could not save herself. Karina Menzies, 32, managed to throw her daughters to safety before she was hit by a van and killed in an unprovoked attack on Friday. The mother-of-three could not run away from the vehicle because her legs had been severely weakened by a progressive nerve condition. She was one of 14 pedestrians, including seven children, hit in the 30-minute spree of horror as a driver sped through suburban streets, mowing down families on their way home from school. Last night, Miss Menzies’ brother Craig paid tribute to his ‘hero’ sister, saying: ‘She died saving her kids. 'She’s got them out of the way and, at the same time, put herself between them and the van to prevent it hitting them. She’s let the van take her. ‘She would have done this instinctively because that is the person my sister was. She was the bravest, kindest, most loyal person in the world and I can’t believe she’s gone.’ Mr Menzies addressed more than 200 friends and relatives who gathered yesterday to lay flowers and stage a vigil at the spot where his sister was hit. While Miss Menzies reacted quickly to save her daughters, she could not escape the vehicle because her legs were weakened by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, friends revealed.

Officers are investigating the theory that the driver may have deliberately targeted mothers and children because he was angry after a row with his wife. Footage: Caught on CCTV, the white van involved in the incident careers across four lanes... ...heading for Adam Lewis (right), his partner Annie and daughter . ...before mounting the pavement. A 31-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Miss Menzies as well as 13 counts of attempted murder . He dumped his van and fled on foot but was arrested outside the Merrie Harrier pub in Llandough just minutes later. There have been claims that the man reversed back over some of the people he hit and reports that he was carrying a weapon, thought to be a crook lock, which he allegedly used to batter some of those who had been knocked down. While Miss Menzies is the only fatality, two others are in a critical condition in hospital and five children are receiving treatment. Others hit include two schoolgirls aged around ten, who moments before had been browsing birthday cards in a shop; a mother and her son, who was riding a bike; and a couple who were seen on CCTV pushing their two-year-old in her pram moments before the van swerved across four lanes of traffic and mounted the pavement. Adam Lewis, 23, was thrown to one . side, and his partner Annie Jones, 22, has had to have surgery after . breaking her leg. Their daughter was thrown into the air. Mr Lewis claimed it appeared that the van had sped up and targeted them deliberately. He added: ‘I saw the van coming in my peripheral vision but it was too late to do anything. 'I got pushed from behind with the wing mirror but unfortunately my partner and my baby took the brunt of it. 'My baby was face down on the pavement and my partner was holding her leg – it was broken. Grief: Karina Menzies' brothers Gareth, left, and Craig and sister Laura Williams mourn their loss .

"The quick thinking of Max Willson, right,  saved his sister Mini, left, after she put her hand through glass . The son of former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson saved his sister's life by guiding an ambulance to a remote vineyard where they were staying in France - using a bottle of wine. Max Willson, 16, rushed to help his 10-year-old sister Mini after she put her hand through a pane of glass and severed an artery while they were on holiday at the family's French château. Their father was in Britain working and their mother was out at the time of the accident and the panicked teenager  did not know the address of the rural house to call emergency services. Instead he attempted to stem the bleeding by using a towel, some duct tape, a place mat and a dog lead to hold it in place. He then remembered they kept wine produced at the vineyard in the château cellar and rushed to grab a bottle so he could find the address on the label. The teenager, who has Asperger's Syndrome, searched Google to find out how to ring emergency services in France before using a translator to explain to authorities what happened. Through his directions, paramedics were able to find the estate and take his sibling, who was nine at the time of the accident, to hospital for treatment. Max said: 'I knew time was of the essence. You could bleed out with a wound like that. 'I put a red towel on a sign close to the house so they would know where to come to. 'At the end of the ordeal, I realised it's pretty amazing what you can do under pressure.' Scroll down for video . The children were on holiday with their mother Michaela at the picturesque Chateau Gourgues near Saint-Emilion in the Bordeaux region of France in August last year when the accident happened. Their father, former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson, was back in the UK at the time and his wife, who was on holiday with their children, was out . Max did not know the chateau's address but remembered the wine they kept in the cellar had the vineyard's address on and read that to call handler . Max, who boards at £27,000-a-year Bredon School near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, partly credits the training he received through the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) for saving his sister's life. The CCF is a Ministry of Defence-sponsored youth organisation which runs courses in school and Max has now been nominated him for a CCF award. His motoring journalist father, who has appeared on several TV and radio shows including a stint on Top Gear, said: 'l'm enormously proud of him. 'For Max to cope like that on his own in a foreign country it makes his achievement even more impressive,' he added. 'Had he not acted so quickly, Mini might not be here now.' He praised his son's school for providing cadet training and said it was doing a great job and he had written to the headmaster to tell him so. 'We underestimate these kids with these syndromes,' he said. 'It's surprising. When they're in the right educational environment, they can do stuff that the rest of us can't.' Mr Willson bought Chateau Gourgues in 2005 and spent four years restoring it to its original grandeur complete with towers and turrets. The journalist and his wife try to visit every weekend, and the family spent eight weeks at the vineyard, which produces Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rosé, over the summer. In 2008 his Rosé won the highly commended award at the International Wine Challenge, and it is now stocked in local restaurants.

"Iron-fisted U.S. House Speaker John Boehner is moving quickly to punish conservative Republicans who tried to oust him Tuesday during the biennial leadership election. Hours after the contentious vote, Florida Rep. Daniel Webster – who actively campaigned against Boehner and persuaded 12 GOP members to support him – found himself left off the membership list of the powerful House Rules Committee, where he served for the last two years. Rep. Rich Nugent, a fellow Floridian who voted for him, suffered the same fate. 'My philosophy,' Webster told reporters after he heard the news that he had been bumped from the committee in a vindictive move, 'is don’t burn any bridges, don’t make it personal.' 'But that's not everybody’s philosophy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CONSEQUENCES: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio punished at least two renegade Republicans on Tuesday, just hours after they voted for someone else in the speaker election . SPANKED: Florida Reps. Daniel Webster (left) and RIch Nugent (right) were left off a powerful committee that serves at Boehner's discretion after they joined a conservative cabal and tried to oust him . The speaker of the House chooses members from his or her own party to serve on the Rules Committee, which moves the procedural levers of power as decisions are made about which bills to move to the House floor 0 and how they'll be considered. Boehner attracted high-fives among his supporters in the House for flexing his muscles, even as conservatives' flak bursts all around him. 'It's about time,' a Republican congressman told DailyMail.com on Tuesday evening. 'This is a new ball game, and the speaker doesn't have to put up with childish antics anymore. You mess with the bull, you get the horns.' The lawmaker spoke on condition of anonymity. The changing landscape he referred to reflects a new and enlarged Republican majority that will give Boehner and his allies new breathing room and spare them the strategic problem of how to attract the support of tea party members and others on the party's right wing. With 246 out of 435 House seats in Republican hands – Democrats control just 188 – centrist Republican leaders can now afford to alienate conservatives without risking the embarrassing failure of key pieces of legislation. Members on Boehner's right flank, 25 of whom refused to support him on Tuesday, have complained that he gave away the store in December with a so-called 'CRomnibus' budget that funded the Obamacare law's implementation for the rest of the government's fiscal year. The trade-off was putting the Department of Homeland Security on a shorter leash – its funding is only guaranteed through the end of February – in the hope of forcing President Barack Obama to back off from his promised amnesty of millions of illegal immigrants. America's immigration authorities are part of the Homeland Security apparatus. But tea party-minded Republicans who fear Boehner will give away that bargaining chip next month, rather than risk the backlash that would come with shutting down critical terror-fighting agencies, are now in a much weaker position. They could be seen as mere annoyances when the time comes to fight with their speaker again. 'They p***ed him off,' the GOP lawmaker told DailyMail.com. 'That's not a good thing to do on the first day of a new Congress. It's going to be a long two years for some of those guys.' REBELLION: Boehner won his gavel for a third term despite the best efforts of 25 right-wing opponents who had hoped to oust him . Other congressmen groused on Tuesday about the tight discipline and strict loyalty Boehner has demanded in the past. Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp, who voted for Webster in the speaker election, told Politico that his decision had cost him a chance to regain a seat on the Agriculture Committee that he lost in 2012. 'I am already hearing from my colleagues, and myself, about retaliation against those who voted their conscience, their constituents, their principles, to change the status quo,' he said. 'My colleagues fully expect that. That’s what they expect out of this leadership team.' Huelskamp and Michigan Rep. Justin Amash also lost their slots on the House Budget Committee in 2013 after they were among 12 Republicans who opposed Boehner the last time around. North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones and Arizona Rep. David Schweikert found themselves dropped from the House Financial Services Committee for the same reason. But Boehner and his aides had promised in the run-up to Tuesday's mini-drama that there would be no recriminations. 'Boehner has said publicly that there will be no retribution for ""no"" votes,' his spokesman Michael Steel told The Daily Caller last week. The speaker also told USA Today in September that no Republicans would lose their committee assignments if they opposed him. 'I just don't think it's necessary,' he said then. But he also predicted that 'very few' would defect. The 25 who bolted on Tuesday – the largest such group in a century – appear to have changed his mind. Texas Republican Rep. Pete Sessions, who chairs the Rules Committee, told reporters that the panel 'works at the behest of the speaker, and the speaker – I believe any speaker – would want and need a person focused on that agenda.' He added that the Rules Committee is a place where 'we do things for the team,' throwing a rhetorical elbow at 'self-serving' members. 'WELCOME TO THE NEW USSR': Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas (left) and Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida (right) were among Boehner's challengers on Tuesday, and Yoho later said Boehner's reprisals were 'something I would assume Vladimir Putin would do' Conservative Rep. Steve King of Iowa joined the cabal and vented his anger after news surfaced that payback was in the air . Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who ran for speaker against Boehner and cast his vote for himself, reacted with frustration on Tuesday when he learned that revenge was in the air. It was 'a sad day for American politics,' he told Roll Call, and 'something I would assume Vladimir Putin would do.' As he stepped on an elevator, he shared the news about Webster's and Nugent's demotions with fellow members – well within reporters' earshot – saying, 'Hey, welcome to the new USSR.' Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, who was one of the loudest voices calling for Boehner's ouster, vented on Tuesday that the speaker's retributions risked turning him into 'a sore winner.' Boehner won his gavel for a third consecutive term easily on Tuesday despite the coordinated effort to oust him, securing 11 votes more than he needed. With 408 lawmakers present, it took 205 votes to win; Boehner got 216. Eighteen Democrats were absent, mostly due to the funeral of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy was waylaid by a flight cancellation caused by snow. New York GOP Rep. Michael Grimm officially resigned his seat Tuesday following his guilty plea to a charge of tax evasion.","25 Republicans broke with their leadership and voted against Boehner on Tuesday when he was re-elected speaker of the House .

"A stranded cargo ship carrying 1,200 luxury cars has refloated itself on a high tide just hours after a previous salvage mission failed. The 51,000-tonne Hoegh Osaka was grounded deliberately on a sandbar as it left Southampton on Saturday night after it started listing dangerously in a busy shipping lane with 25 crew aboard. A plan to re-float it today costing a reputed £10million had to be abandoned amid warnings of poor weather - but at lunchtime today it began to drift of its own accord, sparking frantic attempts to tow it to a more stable position in the Solent. Scroll down for video . Towed to safety: The 51,000-tonne Hoegh Osaka was pulled through the Solent by two tugs as it refloated itself on high tide today . Frantic effort: Still listing at a perilous 52 degrees, the ship had begun to drift despite a salvage attempt today having to be called off . Still listing 52 degrees, the ship was towed out into the mouth of Southampton Water by two tugs this afternoon and into the neighbouring port, to the bemusement of locals and holidaymakers heading to the Isle of Wight. A spokesman for Svitzer, the firm leading the salvaging operation, said: 'She appears to have come adrift herself on the high tide. 'They are rushing down there to take advantage of it and hopefully get control of her movements. They are going to see if they can stabilise her and get her off the bank and into safe waters in the Solent.' Solent Coastguard said it found out the ship was floating when salvage workers raised the alarm while still on board. A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman added: 'The ship self floated at 1.55pm and all salvors had left the vessel safely. 'The list of the ship is unchanged and the vessel is under tow to a preferred holding position two miles east of the original grounding position.' The ship was moved to Alpha Anchorage, a point in the Solent just outside Portsmouth Harbour, after the MCA originally said it would be held inside the harbour itself. An existing 200-metre exclusion zone was extended to 500 metres as the ship moved at a speed of around two knots. Valuable: The ship was carrying 1,400 vehicles including Jaguars, Minis, Land Rovers, JCBs and Rolls Royce Wraith worth £260,000 . Safety: The ship being towed at a speed of two knots this afternoon. A new 300-metre exclusion zone was set to be established . A new 300-metre exclusion zone will be established around the vessel while the damage is assessed. Salvage teams say it may have taken on a substantial amount of water which will need pumping out. The car transporter was originally to be towed to Southampton but at 4.30pm the Maritime and Coastguard Agency announced a change of plan. It was carrying around 1,400 vehicles including 1,200 Jaguars and Land Rovers, 65 Minis, 105 pieces of JCB construction equipment and a Rolls Royce Wraith worth an estimated £260,000. All were destined for the Middle East, and the ship was sailing for Bremerhaven in Germany when it ran aground at 9.20pm on Saturday. As the ship tilted at 45 degrees, a dramatic air and sea rescue operation was launched which lasted several hours and resulted in 23 crew and the pilot being successfully winched from the ship. A 24th crew member was plucked from the water by lifeboat crews after he jumped from the low side of the ship and suffered a broken leg. Its owners Hoegh Autoliners said the 590ft-long ship had to be grounded deliberately on the Bramble Bank sandbar after it started listing dangerously. They are still investigating what caused it to tilt. Selfie: The 51,000-tonne vessel ran aground next to a busy shipping lane which takes tourists from Southampton to the Isle of Wight . Fame: The sandbar is well-known among locals and hosts an annual cricket match between rival yacht clubs. The grounding was deliberate . Dwarfed: A passenger launch next to the ship. Salvage crew members were still aboard when it began to drift of its own accord on the tide . Chief executive Ingar Skiaker said: 'The pilot and the master took the decision to save the vessel and its crew by grounding her on the bank. This showed great skill and seamanship on behalf of our crew when faced with such challenging circumstances. 'At this stage it is too early to speculate on the cause of the list but we are starting an immediate investigation. An investigation is ongoing as to what occurred last night and that is being conducted by the MAIB. 'Our chief concern now is to ensure there is no environmental damage from this incident. There is no oil spill reported at this point, however we understand that the UK authorities have brought their spill response to a state of active readiness.' The ship's 500 tonnes of fuel were kept on board to prevent any leakage while attempting to move it. Stronger winds today may also have played a part in the ship shifting. At midday, wind speeds reached 25mph with gusts of 37mph before peaking at around 1pm with 28mph winds and gusts of 37mph. Mission: The ship's 500 tonnes of fuel were kept on board to prevent any potential 'environmental damage' while attempting to move it . A salvage tug lights the hull of the stricken Hoegh Osaka cargo ship after it ran aground on a sand bank in the Solent near Cowes . Members of RNLI pictured as they inspect the listing Hoegh Osaka during the rescue of the 25-strong crew, which included a helicopter . It was revealed yesterday that water had seeped into the ship after a digger it was carrying came loose and smashed into the hull, puncturing it. That damage has now been fixed. But the MCA said the water let in would need to be removed prior to a refloating and this would take too long to carry out before the weather window for the operation closes, with stronger winds forecast for the coming days. They had instead intended to anchor the ship down to prevent it from moving so it could up put upright and refloated on a future date. Bramble Bank is a well-known sandbar in Southampton Water, and is the scene of an annual cricket match between two yachting clubs when the sands are exposed in low spring tides. In November 2008, the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2 with 1,700 passengers on board ran aground on Bramble Bank but was able to continue its journey on the rising tide after four tugs pulled it clear.","Hoegh Osaka ran aground as it left Southampton for Bremerhaven, Germany, on Saturday with 25 crew aboard .

"It could just be the worst ever counterfeit - but this photocopied £20 note still managed to fool staff at one shop.

'I'd done three weeks of intense physical therapy, and the therapists had helped me to stand up and take a few steps. But none of them were available on the day of the wedding. 'So I put my faith in God and walked 69 feet in public for the first time. It was a magical experience.

These include zumba classes, scuba diving, dancing, supplements, determination and the support of her groom-to-be, who is a specialist in nutrition, and therefore 'knows how to eat healthily'. 'It costs a lot to be overweight,' said Rob, who runs his own business creating websites. 'Once she decided to lose the weight, she needed a support system in place to help her through it.' Describing the moment he saw his future wife walk down the aisle, the 45-year-old added: 'It was amazing. There was a lot of pressure on Tami and she was incredible. 'Seeing her come through the doors and walk toward me was just amazing.' Tami was left seriously injured after the car she was traveling in crashed on October 25, 1999. Smiles all round: Finally feeling back to her old self, Tami decided to walk down the aisle . Princess-like: Zumba classes, scuba diving and dancing were also behind Tami's turnaround . Fairytale ending: Disney World's Wedding Pavilion in Florida proved to be the perfect setting for Tami . At the time, she was wearing a seatbelt, but had reclined her seat, meaning she was not properly secured. As a result, she was left with a broken back and a crushed spine. 'There wasn't a physical mark on my body, but my spine was crushed. They told me I would never walk again,' she said, adding that she was underwent 40 hours of therapy per week after the crash. Eleven years later, in 2010, Tami met Rob, who is originally from Australia, via eHarmony. However, they only met in person for the first time in May 29th 2013. For Tami, it was love at first sight. 'I knew from the minute I met him that I was going to marry him,' she told DailyMail.com. Incredibly, Rob did not know his future wife was paraplegic - until she arranged to visit Sydney and he met her at the airport. This is despite her having dropped hints into their phone conversations. 'He showed up at the airport to pick me up, but he did not realize I was in a wheelchair until I arrived,' said Tami, adding that she had mentioned she would be bringing some equipment with her. Rob said that although Tami told him to look up the names of the equipment on Google, he 'didn't want to.' 'When I saw she was in a wheelchair I was like ""Ok"". We had a brilliant two weeks,' he said. After meeting at the airport, the pair explored Sydney together. In subsequent months, Rob, who has a son,  moved to Atlanta. He proposed in a hotel in front of Hilton Head Lighthouse on September 3, 2013. Before the proposal, Rob made sure he gained permission from Tami's entire family for her hand in marriage, including a 'yes' from her dementia-suffering uncle Lennie Martin, who replied: 'It's about time!' Almost there: Incredibly, Tami had bought her dress for her 'dream' Disney-themed wedding years earlier - and it was simply luck that the gait trainer could fit beneath it, aiding her as she walked down the aisle (pictured) Incredible: Tami reaches her husband-to-be after fulfilling her dream to walk - not be pushed - down the aisle . Emotional: The bride-to-be herself was fighting back tears as she looked up at her future husband . Determined: 'I will never be told I can't do anything,' said Tami (pictured exchanging rings with Rob) 'I will not take no for an answer. I don't give up. It was the same with the weight loss - I wouldn't stop until I was 148lbs' Newly-wed: Tami (pictured being carried out of the Wedding Pavilian by Rob) was aided in her weight loss efforts by a surgical procedure. However, she also attributes her success to a number of other factors . Happy couple: Describing the moment he saw his future wife walk down the aisle, Rob, 45, said: 'It was amazing. There was a lot of pressure on Tami and she was incredible.' Above, the newly-weds together . During their engagement, Tami continued - and still continues - to undergo hours of therapy at First Step Physical Therapy, where Dr Sue Leger and Dr Josh Davis encouraged her to  stand up. Rob said the treatment has worked wonders for his wife. 'She never used to feel anything from the waist down, but now she's feeling,' he said. 'She can almost hold her weight on the parallel bars. 'It's  taught us that even if you have physical issues, putting mind over matter can really help you to live a normal life. But you also have to have the right support system around you.' Now, the inspirational couple are set to move into a new house in Atlanta together. And Tami has only bigger and better plans for the future - she hopes to start a family, walk longer distances without the aid of anything, and is even considering becoming a motivational speaker. 'The sky is the limit. I am open to anything, whatever God has planned for me,' she said. She also hopes to continue to raise awareness of the dangers of reclining your seat while traveling.

Pentreath takes the para-selfies by attaching his GoPro camera to an extended pole . 'There are so many aspects of paragliding you just wouldn’t get from any other sport,' said Pentreath. 'The freedom, the amazing views, flying in and out of clouds, the feeling of being pulled skywards at speeds of up to 10 m/s in a strong thermal, the sense of adventure and of course the friends I’ve made and the amazing places I’ve seen. 'I’m forever reminding myself what a huge privilege it is to be able to do this amazing sport.'
