"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans has yet to rebuild a single fire station more than two years after Katrina destroyed or damaged 22 of the city's 33 firehouses. Appalled by the city's lack of action, an actor is leading the way in reconstruction of the fire stations. Without city help, firefighters have resorted to repairing their  stations along with volunteer carpenters. ""I gave up on ever hoping that politicians in this country -- local, state or federal -- would step in to help these guys,"" actor Denis Leary told CNN. Leary, who stars as a firefighter on a TV show called ""Rescue Me,"" is using his charitable foundation to bring together volunteers from a New York carpenter's union and the New Orleans Fire Department to rebuild the stations. So far, they've rebuilt five, with two more slated to be finished in a couple months. Leary says it's a sad commentary on society when actors and musicians become the key players in helping a city rebound. Brad Pitt, Harry Connick Jr. and U2's The Edge are among the stars helping out across New Orleans.  See the desperate state of the firehouses » . ""We have The Edge, you know, an Irish musician coming over here to help solve the problems in New Orleans,"" he said. ""But we can't get FEMA or our own president to respond. It's not shameful, it is just funny."" He added, ""I have so given up on ever getting a politician's head to turn and face facts in that situation.""  Watch Leary's rescue mission » . After Katrina hit, FEMA estimated it would take 10 years and millions of dollars to rebuild the fire stations. In the interim, firefighters have been working and living in trailers attached to the decimated firehouses. ""It's a bit heart-wrenching,"" said firefighter Chuck Brokmeier. Jerry Cremins, a member of the New York District Council of Carpenters, came down last year to pick his son up from Loyola University. He couldn't believe the devastation. ""It doesn't translate that well on TV,"" Cremins said. Deciding he had the skills to help, Cremins reached out to Leary's firefighters foundation. Volunteers from the union are now working shoulder to shoulder with New Orleans firefighters. Cremins said he has made nine trips to New Orleans, all on his own dime and own time. There's no question bringing fire stations back fosters a sense of pride, but he said some of the work has just been a nightmare. ""It was astounding to me that they haven't been helped out -- that local governments and municipalities haven't held up their obligations,"" Cremins said. ""That is basically when citizens have to step in and get the job done."" Leary said some of the stories firefighters tell are almost unbelievable. He says a firefighter once told him about a station that had about three feet of water. ""He said one of the guys from FEMA came in here and told us that they would pay for the hinge on this door below the water line, but the two hinges above the water line they weren't going to pay for,"" Leary said. Edward Blakely, the czar of New Orleans recovery effort, appreciates the work from Leary's foundation and volunteers. He said the city has been focusing on rebuilding its police headquarters to combat the growing crime problem. The police headquarters just recently reopened, now allowing the city to focus on the fire stations, Blakely said. ""We say to the citizens: 'Look, we are going to have a better city. You don't want us to put it back just the way it was. You want us to improve it,' "" Blakely said. ""That's what we're going to do. That takes a little more time, but it's worth it."" New Orleans is in a tough situation, according to Blakely. Under city law, he said, there has to be enough money in city coffers to pay for a project before construction starts. And because no construction firm is going to do the work before getting paid, Blakely added, funding projects has become a shell game of sorts since Katrina. It's frustrating to firefighters, and certainly taking its toll on morale. The fire gear they all wear is light sensitive, and is supposed to be stored in a dark locker to make sure the uniforms remain as fire resistant as possible. In a trailer, that just doesn't happen, said district chief Tim McConnell. He said there's no question the lack of rebuilding is a safety hazard. ""The time it takes you to lock up a trailer, to get from there and get on the ... [fire truck], all that delays response time just a little bit,"" McConnell said. Firefighters are also quick to note that none of them abandoned their posts during Katrina. McConnell said his firefighters may not be happy, but you won't hear them complain. ""I truly believe when people see the infrastructure being rebuilt, they will want to come back to the city,"" McConnell said. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- In the best fairy tales, there is always a castle: tall turrets, an intimidating moat and a breathtaking view. In Scotland, those ancient castles overlook deep lochs and tower over cities. The wandering traveler will find these envy-inducing castles in every corner of Scotland. In honor of Sunday's National Tartan Day, a holiday celebrating the influential role Scots have played in American history, CNN has chosen 10 magnificent castles to explore in the old country. From the capital city of Edinburgh to the dramatic landscapes of the Highlands, here are some of the most striking castles in Scotland. Cue the castle-owning daydreaming. 27 photos of glorious Ireland . Eilean Donan, Inverness-shire . This 13th-century castle in the middle of a loch is one of the most iconic in Scotland. Located in the Highlands looking out toward the Isle of Skye, this stunning castle is connected to the mainland via footbridge. It was restored in the early 20th century and is often featured in television and movies. Visitors can wander through the rooms to see period furniture, artifacts and weaponry. Edinburgh Castle, City of Edinburgh . Perhaps the most famous (and most visited) castle in Scotland is right in the center of the capital city. Perched on top of the city on Castle Rock, this fortress has a strong presence in Edinburgh's skyline. The oldest section of the castle dates to the 12th century, and many visitors travel here specifically to see the Crown Jewels of Scotland. Guided tours are available. Culzean Castle, Ayrshire . Observant travelers might recognize Culzean Castle from the back of the 5-pound note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland. This cliffside castle on the Ayrshire coast has been associated with the Kennedy family for centuries. It is a particularly memorable example of a fairy tale-like structure with its turrets and battlements, stationed above the stormy seas and surrounded by gardens and forests. Ballindalloch Castle, Banffshire . Often called ""The Pearl of the North,"" this 16th-century castle is in the heart of one of Scotland's whisky regions, Speyside. Unlike other castles in Scotland, this is one of the few castles in the country that remains private: The Macpherson-Grant family has continually lived here over the centuries. The castle is open to visitors during the summer months and has a shop with a variety of Scottish goods including tartans and jewelry. 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels . Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire . Movie buffs might recognize Castle Fraser from ""The Queen,"" starring Helen Mirren (it appeared as a backdrop). Castle Fraser is one of the grandest, most romantic-looking castles in the country. Built between 1575 and 1636, the castle sits on more than 300 acres of landscaped grounds and woodlands. Inside, it has the feeling of a family home with portraits of the Fraser family and original furniture. Stirling Castle, Stirlingshire . One of the largest (and most important from a historic/architectural perspective) castles is Stirling Castle. An easy trip from both Edinburgh and Glasgow, this castle was once the destination of knights and nobles who flocked to the luxurious property with its elaborate gardens. It's a good spot for families to visit; costumed characters in historic roles are on the grounds, and children can dress up in period costumes and play medieval instruments. Earth's greatest unexplored places . Urquhart Castle, Inverness-shire . The mythical Loch Ness Monster, Nessie, might lure travelers to the Scottish Highlands, but it is Urquhart Castle that delivers the drama. One of the most-visited castles in the country, this castle's Grand Tower overlooks expansive Loch Ness. An early medieval fortification was built here, but the ruins seen today date to the 13th to 16th centuries. The castle also played a strategic role in the Wars of Scottish Independence. Glamis Castle, Angus . One of the most towering -- and historically interesting -- castles in Scotland is Glamis Castle. This structure has the claim to fame as being the setting for Shakespeare's ""Macbeth,"" along with being the childhood home of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (her younger daughter, Princess Margaret, was born here). The surrounding estate is made up of 14,000 acres of gardens, farms and forests. Inveraray Castle, Argyllshire . Located in western Scotland on the shore of Loch Fyne, this castle has a fairytale facade with an enchanting interior. Many visitors indulge in the tea room here, offering a glimpse into royal life. ""Downton Abbey"" fans might recognize it from the season 3 Christmas episode. The castle has a lovely 16-acre garden surrounded by a massive 60,000-acre estate. Crathes Castle, Aberdeenshire . Found in the Aberdeenshire woodlands, Crathes Castle dates to the 16th century and has ties to Scottish warrior-king Robert the Bruce. Towers, turrets, and ghost stories make this an especially intriguing castle to visit, along with the beautiful walled garden. Travelers interested in art will be drawn to the collection of portraits and painted ceilings.","Scottish castles have starred in ""Downton Abbey"" and ""The Queen""
The setting for ""Macbeth,"" Glamis Castle is also Princess Margaret's birthplace .

"(CNN) -- Silence is golden. Or at least that was the plan. Indie band Vulfpeck hatched a scheme to earn a big payout from Spotify. But they'd have to be clever; the music streaming service pays artists less than a penny a play. So, here's what Vulfpeck did. The band uploaded a 10-song album called ""Sleepify"" and asked their fans to stream the album on repeat while they slept, hoping to multiply the royalty rate exponentially. There was even some incentive. The band was going to use the money to pay for a free concert tour and go to the cities that streamed the album the most. Every track is completely silent -- no music at all -- and only about half a minute long. According to the Spotify's payment plan, each song needs to be listened to for at least 30 seconds to count as an official listen. Cha-ching! Fans came up big. Vulfpeck racked up about $20,000, according to reports. At the half-a-cent per play rate the band says it gets from the service, that's 4 million plays. But not so fast, Spotify told the band: The album violated its terms of content. And ""Sleepify"" was gone. When contacted, Spotify's Graham James had little to say. ""Sorry. Not commenting on this one,"" he told CNN. There's no word on whether Vulfpeck will get paid. Such a setback might deter other bands. But not Vulfpeck. It bounced back with a new three-track album called ""Official Statement."" On the first track, ""#Hurt,"" Keyboardist Jack Stratton spills his guts about the situation. ""The gist of it was that, while they enjoyed 'Sleepify' and thought it was funny and clever, that it violated their terms of content,"" he said. ""So I don't know what's going to happen with it -- it's very uncertain at the moment. And in light of that uncertainly I want to take 30 seconds silence to ponder the uncertainty."" That ushers in the second track, ""#Reflect"" -- 31 seconds of silence. Sound familiar? Track three is a 32-second instrumental called ""Parted Sea (Strong Pesach)."" Can lightning strike twice? We'll see. But for a repeat, Vulfpeck fans will have to hit repeat, again and again and again ....

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The homeless men and women shuffle across the frozen ground of the tent camp and surround a steel drum burning wood. They use the flames to cook food and to stay warm. The tents in Seattle are covered with tarps and plastic sheets to help keep out the elements. The tents they live in are small, covered by tarps and plastic sheeting to keep water out. Several tents are collapsed under the weight of a recent snowfall. For Bruce Beavers, however, this camp is just about the best place in the world he could be living right now. ""This is a place for people who lose their jobs, lose their houses, to have some kind of structure and for them to get back out in the world,"" he says. Set up in the parking lot of a church near Seattle, Washington, the camp houses anywhere from 50 to 100 homeless people each day. Residents call it Nickelsville. The name takes a page from the infamous ""Hooverville"" shantytowns of the Great Depression that were named for a president many thought did not care about their economic hardships.  Watch resident give tour, explain rules » . Some residents here say they blame Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels and a system they believe makes it difficult to escape homelessness. ""In shelters, if you don't get there in time enough, you don't have your bed no more 'cause there are so many people trying to rush in to get it,"" Beavers says. ""Got a lotta people losing their homes. You don't want to go all the way to the bottom. Nickelsville is kind of a catch in between."" Like many of the other Nickelodeons -- as the people who share this church parking lot call themselves -- Bruce Beavers never expected to be homeless. He managed warehouses and hardware stores, had a 401(k) plan and owned his home. But Beavers said he lived beyond his means and eventually lost everything. Beavers and other homeless say they were tired of a shelter system that often splits up families into different housing, does not provide a place for people to keep their possessions while they look for work and offers too few beds. So they say they decided to try their own way. They formed a camp where the homeless living there would know they had a guaranteed place to stay. There would be around-the-clock security to keep people from having their things stolen, the tents would be built from donated materials, and alcohol and drugs would not be permitted. It would be a place for people trying to get out of homelessness. Evan Balverde is a plumber who came to Nickelsville after an accident forced him to stop working. ""We don't just take in everybody,"" Balverde says. ""We'd like to, but the thing is just a lot of these people out here are mentally incapable or they're drug addicts or alcoholics and stuff, and that's why they are on the streets. We don't put up with that. ""We're here for people in rough times and homeless, but if you are doing it to yourself, then this isn't the place for you."" The dubious legality of the camp set the organizers on a collision course with the city, and several times police have moved the Nickelodeons off the land on which they were squatting. An invitation to relocate the camp outside a local church gave Nickelsville a reprieve, at least for the time being. Johnny Turner, a homeless man who helped found the camp, says he would like to see Nickelsville grow into a permanent shelter that could accept more people needing a place to go. ""We need more Nickelsvilles,"" he says. ""There's nowhere else.""  See photos of Depression-era tent cities » . Al Poole of the Seattle Human Services Department says the city spends nearly $8 million a year on the homeless. Still, there aren't always beds available for every person needing one, and sometimes families do need to be placed in different shelters. While tent cities might fulfill an immediate need, Poole explains, they also can have the negative effect of turning people who live near the camps against the homeless. Walking around the neighborhood that borders Nickelsville, it is hard to imagine that many residents are happy that their homes now face a homeless camp. And many residents were upset, says homeowner Roland Bradley, when the camp first arrived at their street. ""We had a meeting at the church the week before they came,"" Bradley says. ""One of the concerns that people had was about crime and people breaking into their home and children being molested and noise. But that hasn't happened."" Motioning to the camp, Bradley adds: ""The reality is that could be us one day.""","Tent city in Seattle, Washington, houses 50 to 100 people .

"(CNN) -- Legalized marijuana has found its way into playground commerce, leading to a group of Greeley, Colorado, fourth-graders being disciplined for selling and trading pot. The incident began when a boy sold a bag of marijuana to three classmates for $11 on Monday. The 10-year-old had taken the pot from his grandparents, school spokeswoman Teresa Myers said. One of the three children purchasing the pot, also 10, couldn't pay his portion, so they struck a deal. The next day, that child returned with a marijuana-laced candy bar he had also taken from a grandparent to trade for the pot, Myers said. Another child witnessed the transaction and saw one of the kids take a bite of the candy bar, she said. The witness reported it to an adult. Marijuana has been legal for recreational use since January 1, so the grandparents involved haven't broken state law, said John Gates, the school district's safety director. But he doesn't feel they're without blame. They're guilty, at the least, of irresponsibility ""for not securing their weed,"" Gates said. ""If the marijuana hadn't been accessible, this wouldn't have happened,"" he said. In a letter that went home with students, Monfort Elementary School Principal Jennifer Sheldon emphasized the new responsibilities that Colorado parents face with the legalization of marijuana. ""We urge all parents, grandparents and anyone who cares for children to treat marijuana as you would prescription drugs, alcohol or even firearms,"" the letter said. ""This drug is potentially lethal to children, and should always be kept under lock and key, away from young people."" The children involved will be disciplined, but not expelled. ""We aren't trying to harm fourth-grade students who made a bad choice,"" she said. ""This is an adult problem.""","School says boy sold classmates a bag of marijuana for $11, and one couldn't pay .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish police have arrested 750 people after a nationwide investigation into fake businesses, according to a statement Wednesday. The mass arrests were part of a crackdown on a scam through which $28 million of public funds were paid out for Social Security benefits, according to the police statement. Police targeted fake companies operating in tourism, construction, industrial cleaning and package delivery, and made the arrests over recent months. ""Among those arrested are 30 managers of the fake companies who, without any real business activity, registered people for Social Security to illicitly obtain benefits, or to obtain residency or working permits for foreign citizens,"" the police statement said. A total of 8,400 people were registered on Social Security rolls as part of the scam, and in 2,100 cases, they received some form of government payout. In addition, 362 foreigners were able to get working or residency papers in Spain through the fraud, the police said. The investigation uncovered 4,000 crimes of document and other fraud linked to the payments from public funds. More than half of the 750 arrests were made in Madrid and Barcelona, but there were also dozens of arrests each in the cities of Almeria, Alicante, Jaen, Granada, Valencia and Guadalajara. The operation, which the police said was the largest to date, represents about half the arrests made in the past year to crackdown on such fraud. Police say it has cost the state a total of $64 million. The police statement did not detail how they would recover the money or revoke fraudulent working papers. The Labor Ministry press office said the 8,400 people falsely added to social security rolls were recorded as part of the government's employment statistics. But they are likely to have had little impact on the real statistics, which show 5.9 million Spaniards out of work and the unemployment rate at 25.9%.","Spanish police have arrested 750 people after a nationwide investigation into fake businesses .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An Israeli judge on Monday convicted former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of taking bribes while mayor of Jerusalem. Judge David Rosen of the Tel Aviv District Court convicted Olmert of receiving about $161,000 in bribes related to a controversial Jerusalem housing project called Holyland. The judge acquitted Olmert on a third count of bribery. The developer of Holyland, Hillel Cherney, had been previously convicted of bribing Olmert and other high-level officials in exchange for Holyland approvals. Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003. Sentencing is scheduled for April 28. Olmert, an attorney who in 1973 became the youngest person ever elected to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009. He announced his resignation shortly after police recommended corruption charges against him. In August 2012, he was convicted of breach of trust and acquitted on two corruption-related charges after a trial that lasted nearly three years. He was given a 3-month suspended jail sentenced and fined about $19,000 in that case. The allegations stemmed from Olmert's time as mayor as well as prime minister. Prosecutors accused him of double-billing government agencies for travel, taking cash from an American businessman in exchange for official favors and acting on behalf of his former law partner's clients.","A judge says Ehud Olmert took bribes from a developer while he was mayor of Jerusalem .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a massive landslide that struck in Washington state's Cascade Mountains rose Tuesday to 35, the Snohomish County medical examiner said. Eleven people are still missing after a rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the rural town of Oso on March 22. The news came as the White House announced President Barack Obama will visit the area on April 22, the one month anniversary of the slide, and meet with search crews.

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council approved sanctions Thursday against Nigeria's Boko Haram. It added the terrorist group to the United Nation's 1267 sanctions list, a list of al Qaeda-linked organizations subject to arms embargoes, travel bans and asset freezes. ""Today, the Security Council took an important step in support of the government of Nigeria's efforts to defeat Boko Haram and hold its murderous leadership accountable for atrocities,"" said Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""By adding Boko Haram to the U.N.'s 1267 sanctions list, the Security Council has helped to close off important avenues of funding, travel and weapons to Boko Haram, and shown global unity against their savage actions,"" she added. Nigeria had asked the United Nations to make the move as attacks in Africa's most populous nation appear to be escalating, spreading beyond Boko Haram's hotbed in the rural northeast. Twin blasts killed at least 118 people Tuesday at a market in the central city of Jos. The explosions went off 20 to 30 minutes apart, sparking an inferno that sent crowds running and screaming, covered in blood. Nigerian authorities described the blasts as ""terrorist activities"" but declined to speculate on who might be responsible. In separate attacks in Borno state this week, at least 30 people were killed by members of the terror group, according to local residents. Boko Haram attackers swooped in on motorcycles Monday and killed 10 people in one village, residents said. A day later, gunmen stormed a nearby village and killed 20 others, residents said. During the attacks, Boko Haram set fire to homes and food stores, residents said, and fired machine guns. The group has not claimed responsibility for those attacks. Both villages are close to where more than 200 girls were kidnapped from a school last month. A Boko Haram leader claimed responsibility in a chilling video and said he was willing to free the girls in exchange for imprisoned militants. ""The sanctions designation is the latest step in the international community's long-term effort to help Nigeria counter this terrorist threat,"" Power said. ""We will continue doing everything we can to help the people of Nigeria bring back their girls, and we will work with the government of Nigeria to eliminate Boko Haram, including refuting their backwards and bloodthirsty ideology, because no child anywhere should ever be afraid to pursue a brighter future."" CNN's Richard Roth, Nana Karikari-apau, Faith Karimi and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","The move helps hold the group's ""murderous leadership accountable,"" says official .

"(CNN) -- Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was involved in an ""altercation with another inmate"" at the Bristol County House of Correction and Jail in Massachusetts, a county sheriff's department spokesman said Wednesday. Hernandez, 24, who is being held on first-degree murder and weapons charges in the shooting death last year of his friend Odin Lloyd, had the altercation with an unidentified inmate Tuesday, said Bernie Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bristol County Sheriff's Office. Neither man was seriously injured. Sullivan said the incident was under investigation. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told CNN that jail officials will be looking at how the two came into contact because ""no more than one inmate is supposed to be out at a time"" in the unit where Hernandez is housed. Hernandez's lawyer could not be reached for comment. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked up Lloyd from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death on June 17. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later, according to authorities.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday made it somewhat easier for victims of online child porn to recover limited financial restitution from some of those who download their images. The majority in the 5-4 ruling concluded that lower courts could use discretion in continuing to award damages, but restitution should be based on certain criteria. Awards should be tied to the ""proximate"" harm inflicted by the sexual predator and those who later view the resulting pictures onlline. The case involves ""Amy Unknown,"" an unwilling if ubiquitous presence in one digital cave for more than 15 years. Images of her childhood rape, sexual abuse, and other criminal acts at the hands of a relative have been widely distributed in the underground world of Internet child pornography. ""Of course the victim should someday collect restitution for all her child pornography losses,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""But it makes sense to spread payment among a larger number of offenders in amounts more closely in proportion to their respective causal roles and their own circumstances so that more are made aware, through the concrete mechanism of restitution, of the impact of child-pornography possession on victims."" The case tested the interpretation and limits of a federal law designed to help those victims. At issue was the level of proof -- or causal relationship -- prosecutors must show between the defendant's conduct and the victim's harm. Lower courts have struggled to determine what share of damages should be paid in individual cases. During January's arguments, the justices exhibited sympathy for the woman's pain and suffering. Now 24, she has struggled to put her life together. But many on the court had worried whether it was fair to hold a few individuals caught possessing the illegal images for full liability, when many more may be equally culpable for damages. A Texas man caught possessing two images of ""Amy"" -- the pseudonym given to protect her identity -- argued that he should have to pay little or nothing, for a variety of reasons, including the fact he was not directly involved in the attack on the girl or in the distribution of the images. Her lawyers countered that Doyle Paroline is liable for the full $3.4 million in restitution she sought for lost income, psychological and physical treatment, and other injuries suffered as ""proximate result"" of the crimes. The high court's ruling will not make it easier for those like ""Amy"" to collect full damages from one or just a few violators. But the justices made clear those like Paroline cannot escape restitution by arguing their involvment in the offenses was comparatively minimal, or that determining a fair amount in the aggregate would be all but impossible. ""This would serve the twin goals of helping the victim achieve eventual restitution for all her child-pornography losses and impressing upon offenders the fact that child pornography crimes, even simple possession, affect real victims,"" said Kennedy. A ruling favoring all of ""Amy's"" legal claims could have put the burden on the defendants prosecuted first . The woman's lawyers told the court she has spent the past five years or so filing about 250 restitution requests. She has collected about $1.75 million in amounts from $100 to $1.2 million. Amy was 8 when the violent abuse was committed by her uncle, Eugene Zebroski. Zebroski was prosecuted a year later and sent to prison for 10 years. He was ordered to pay $6,300 in mandatory restitution to his niece, the amount of counseling she required up to that time. A decade later, Paroline was separately discovered having 300 images of child porn on his computer, including two of ""Amy."" He pleaded guilty and served two years. Paroline was among an estimated 71,000 people worldwide who viewed the attacks. Complicating matters is that distribution of those images may be a permanent part of the Internet due to high-speed digital technology and greater encryption software for voyeurs of this activity. Paroline's lawyer, Stanley Schneider, said during arguments that since his client was the only defendant in his prosecution, the illegal acts should not be viewed in the aggregate when it came time to determining restitution. Chief Justice John Roberts, in dissent, said ""Amy"" deserves restitution, but the law as written is too generic to deal with the ""unique"" harms suffered by sexual abuse victims. ""When it comes to Paroline's crime -- possession of two of 'Amy's' images -- it is not possible to do anything more than pick an arbitrary number for that 'amount.' And arbitrary is not good enough for the criminal law,"" said Roberts. ""The statute as written allows no recovery (from Paroline); we ought to say so, and give Congress a chance to fix it."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor alone said the federal law allowed ""Amy"" to collect the full amount from Paroline alone if necessary. The Obama administration took a middle ground in the case, with the Justice Department suggesting individual judges be given the discretion to formulate a reasonable amount of restitution. Officials said about $18,000 by each possessor of the child porn would be appropriate in this case. ""Amy"" gave a victim impact statement in Paroline's case where she said she lives in ""constant fear"" knowing those images were spread around the world, making her feel ""abused over and over and over again."" The emotional pain has caused her to require weekly psychotherapy sessions. She has dropped out of college and cannot stay employed. The case is Paroline v. U.S. (12-8561).

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A Turkish airstrike on the border with Iraq killed 35 people who are now thought to have been smuggling cigarettes, a senior Turkish lawmaker said Thursday. Turkish air force jets launched the strike late Wednesday after unmanned aerial vehicles showed a group moving from Iraq toward the border with Turkey in an area ""mostly used by terrorists,"" a statement from the military general staff said. But a senior member of Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) said early indications are that those identified by the drones and subsequently killed were civilians. ""These people were thought to be terrorists; however, the first initial investigative information we have from the local authorities, especially from Sirnak Governor's office, indicate that these people are involved in cigarette smuggling,"" said the AKP's deputy chairman and spokesman Huseyin Celik. He said the strike had killed many members of the same family. ""Even if there was a situation 100% that these people were smugglers, these people should not have been subjected to this, they should not have been bombed. It is out of question,"" he said. Expressing his condolences to the affected families, he vowed that a full investigation would be carried out and no cover-up would be allowed. A local official in Turkey's southeastern province of Sirnak earlier said the airstrike had killed at least 31 Kurdish villagers. ""A group of villagers were coming from northern Iraq across the border after 9:30 p.m. Their path was blocked by soldiers and then four planes bombed them,"" said the official, Yunus Urek of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party. The incident occurred in a region where there is a large Kurdish population. The people were from the border villages of Ortasu and Gulyazi, according to Urek, who said he was in Ortasu. Urek said the victims frequently cross the border ""for their daily needs like sugar or fuel."" He said one person survived the strike. Turkish authorities said an administrative and legal investigation was under way. ""Since the area where the group was located was often used by terrorists and a movement towards our border was determined, it was evaluated that the area should be held under fire by air force planes,"" the Turkish military said in a statement released Thursday. The military statement claimed the the strike was in the Sinat-Haftanin area of northern Iraq, where many militant training camps are situated and there are no civilian settlements. Vahdettin Ozkan, the governor of Turkey's southeastern province of Sirnak, also said a full investigation is under way. ""A crisis center has been set up at the governor's office, and prosecutors and security forces have been sent to the region,"" he told Turkey's Anadolu news agency. Some observers have sounded the alarm in recent months about escalating tension between Turkey and its Kurdish minority, warning it may reignite a conflict that has simmered since 1984 and claimed more than 30,000 lives. Turkey has been going on the offensive against Kurdish separatists based across its border in northern Iraq with bombings and incursions. In October, an attack killed 24 Turkish soldiers in the southeastern section of the country, where Turkey borders Iraq. The Turkish government blamed terrorists for that attack, and the United States pinned responsibility for the attack on militants from a Kurdish separatist group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. Earlier this month, Turkish police detained dozens of people in a wave of raids focused on pro-Kurdish media organizations. The Kurds represent the largest ethnic minority in Turkey. For decades, they were the target of repressive government policies, implemented by officials who sometimes referred to them as ""mountain Turks."" CNN's Yesim Comert and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","35 people are confirmed killed by Turkish jets in an airstrike on the border with Iraq .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Sportsman Channel's promo for Sarah Palin's new reality television venture features the gun-toting politico-turned-celebrity exploring her idea of American freedom: man caves, target shooting and race cars. ""Amazing America's"" teaser ""She's coming with a full heart and a full magazine,"" might be getting snickers but some think she's redefining political branding. That's because, in this media obsessed culture, all of that on camera wilderness exploring, dog racing, and hunting, when coupled with fundraising and endorsing grassroots conservatives, adds up to a hefty boost in the Palin brand and political influence. ""It keeps her visible,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""The way she's doing this, through reality television, might be the way politics is moving. Some kind of combination of being active in political arena...and acting in reality television might work."" In many ways it has for Palin. She turned her failed 2008 vice presidential bid into a one-woman franchise that includes highly sought after speaking engagements, political endorsements, book deals and pundit gigs . Does Ted Nugent speak for you? Her political action committee, SarahPAC, amassed just over $1 million through the end of last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The PAC netted more than $5 million in 2012 and was able to use that money to donate to dozens of tea party backed candidates such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona and, fellow reality television star-turned-politico, Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisconsin. Given the demographics of the Sportsman Channel, Palin's new show will likely trend Republican, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Such viewership won't do much to expand her brand beyond her base of supporters. ""The people who would watch that would be disproportionately NRA members and white males to be blunt about it,"" Sabato said. However, Palin can and likely will leverage that solidified support among her base to get voters to support candidates and causes she backs, political experts say. ""I've been very impressed with the way she has used her notoriety and her appeal to get the average American in tune with our government,"" said Crystal Wright, an editor and blogger with ConservativeBlackChick.Com who has spoken favorably of Palin in the past. ""We've seen her grow and find her appropriate voice in the political arena. I'm not surprised she has her own TV show. The role she's had in the grassroots level in getting them engaged in the political process is a good one."" And there is, some conservatives point out, precedence for blurring the lines between celebrity and a political career. ""I think the answer lies in history. California twice elected actors to run the state. Did (Ronald) Reagan's film career (including Bedtime for Bonzo) limit him? Or Arnold's (Schwarzenegger) movies hamper his political career,"" said Mike Opelka, director of news operations at the conservative theblaze.com. But the high profile celebrity approach to politics may not bode well for her immediate prospects as an elected official. ""She's making money,"" Sabato said. ""That's all she has a motive to do right now. It can't be getting into politics. There's no way. She has negatives through the roof. It would be like Dan Quayle getting back in."" Palin backs Abbott after Nugent appearance, endorses Sessions' challenger . There is also risk in celebrity politics, political experts say. ""It could go either way. There's a way she can leverage it by remaining in the public eye and make it clear that she is a part of everyday America,"" Zelizer said. ""The big danger is that she makes herself look silly and not serious."" Then again, Palin has had far more influence outside elected office than when she served as governor of Alaska. ""I don't know if it necessarily helps her expand the base as it solidifies the base,"" said Ben Fergusson, a conservative radio host and CNN political commentator who added that independent voters may turned off by Palin's popularity. ""It may alienate others.""","Sarah Palin's new show ""Amazing America"" broadens the politico's brand .
Palin's appeal among grassroots conservatives remains high .
She has leveraged that appeal to support candidates and causes she favors .
Her brand will likely not appeal to independents and she runs the risk of going too far ."
"(CNN) -- Author Tim Federle believes that everyone has a little bit of Nate Foster in them. Even if you're not a gay theater nerd with dreams of stardom, Federle thinks everyone has felt like an outsider at some point. He may be onto something with his Nate Foster novels, about the semi-autobiographical teen character who chases Broadway dreams to New York for an open casting call in ""E.T: The Musical."" Federle's 2013 debut middle-grade novel, ""Better Nate Than Ever,"" struck a chord with critics and readers and was named one of 2013's notable children's books by the New York Times and Publishers Weekly. Its sequel ""Five, Six, Seven, Nate!"" comes out Tuesday and was listed among the best books of January by Amazon. ""Five, Six, Seven, Nate!"" picks up where the first book left off. Federle, who was a Broadway dancer and choreographer, takes readers further backstage with Nate as his Broadway dreams begin to come true, but he has to do some growing up along the way. Federle says his aim was to write a novel he would have loved when he was younger and feeling left out. The real message isn't about Nate's love of Broadway or his sexuality, Federle says, but about embracing whatever makes you unique. Fast facts . Age: 33 . Hometown: Pittsburgh . Other titles: ""Better Nate Than Ever"" and ""Tequila Mockingbird,"" a literary cocktail guide voted the top food and cookbook of 2013 on Goodreads. Fun facts: Federle appeared in the original Broadway casts of ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Gypsy"" before coaching the child stars of the show ""Billy Elliot."" For fans of: Broadway musicals and TV shows like ""Glee,"" ""Smash"" and ""Dance Moms."" Five questions for Tim Federle . CNN: What's happening with Nate in your new novel? Federle: ""Five, Six, Seven, Nate!"" opens on my 13-year-old protagonist packing up a duffel bag and bidding his Midwestern town goodbye, heading off to start rehearsals for his New York City debut in ""E.T.: The Musical."" The book is an insider look at what happens when a big-budget Broadway show comes together (and occasionally apart), as seen through the eyes of a diehard theater nerd who just happens to also be a chocolate milk aficionado. Think: ""Smash"" with zits. CNN: How was writing the sequel different from your first book? Federle: I wrote ""Better Nate Than Ever"" in total secret while working on the show ""Billy Elliot."" Once the book came out and started getting a lot of unexpected attention, I felt like the ""Velveteen Writer"" -- like a bit of a faker who was suddenly turned real. So the biggest difference in writing a sequel is that now there are expectations. But also, and this is the awesome part, now there are fans, too! CNN: Since ""Better Nate Than Ever,"" has the message changed or evolved in your new book? Federle: The books are highly autobiographical, and I learned as a dancer that even when you get cast in a dream show, there are still setbacks and surprises (and critics). For Nate, he's finally part of a tribe of people who truly ""get"" him in ""Five, Six, Seven, Nate!"" but now he's dealing with cutthroat child stars and the nervous clamor of a brand-new town. If the message between books has evolved at all, it's probably: ""Hold on to what makes you unique, but get ready to grow up a little, too."" CNN: You've said before kids can be your toughest critics. What have you heard from them? Federle: I've received quite a few all-capped emails YELLING AT ME FOR ENDING THE FIRST BOOK ON SUCH A CLIFFHANGER!!!!! Also, several kids named Nate have written to say it's ""cool or whatever"" to have their name in the title of a book. CNN: Nate's sexuality is important to the story but not the focus of your book. How did you decide to handle that and what kind of reaction have you received? Federle: You can't tell the story of a 13-year-old boy who knows every lyric to ""Phantom of the Opera"" without also referencing how much teasing he gets at school. Believe me, I remember. Middle school readers can handle a lot of truth, especially when it's broached delicately, so the response to Nate's subtle maybe-he-is-maybe-he-isn't-gay subplot has been overwhelmingly positive -- with librarians and parents cheering on Nate's goofy perseverance in spite of how hard it can be just being a kid. I think every adult I know felt like an outsider in middle school, and these books are for anyone who might be going through that now and could use a laugh.","Tim Federle's ""Five, Six, Seven, Nate!"" picks up where ""Better Nate Than Ever"" left off .

"(CNN) -- A body found in an Indiana lake has been identified as that of Teleka Patrick, the Michigan doctor who's been missing since December, the Porter County Coroner's Office confirmed. Her body was discovered Sunday in Lake Charles, west of Gary, Indiana, officials said. The cause and manner of death are still pending further investigation, but are consistent with drowning, the coroner said in a statement Tuesday. An autopsy revealed no trauma, the statement added. Mysterious disappearance . The 30-year-old medical resident failed to show up for work on December 6 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The night before, her 1997 Lexus was discovered abandoned more than 115 miles away in a ditch off of Interstate 94 in Indiana, directly south of the lake where she was ultimately found. Police brought out dogs to track Patrick's scent. They led investigators out of the ditch where Patrick's car rested to the highway. There, the scent went cold. ""We looked everywhere,"" Sgt. Rick Strong of the Indiana State Police told CNN in December. Videos provide clues . Surveillance video and home videos uploaded to YouTube provided investigators with clues about Patrick's movements in the weeks, days and hours before she vanished. The YouTube videos showed Patrick talking, cooing and singing to someone unnamed and apparently unknown. Patrick's mother told CNN she wasn't aware of any romantic relationship her daughter may have had. But the videos have an intimate feel to them. ""Hi, baby,"" Patrick says in one. ""I am just coming to you to say 'hi' and tell you about my day."" In another video, Patrick shows a table set for two with omelets and pancakes. ""If you were here, this is what would be your plate,"" she coos. In a surveillance video from a Radisson hotel in Kalamazoo, not far from where she worked, Patrick is seen on the night of December 5 around 7:30 p.m., hours before police found her car in Indiana. She spent about 10 minutes talking with employees at the reception desk but ultimately left. There's no audio on the video, and it's not clear why Patrick failed to book a room. But at 7:48 p.m., she strode across the hotel's tiled floors, out the door and onto a hotel shuttle bus. Those are the last known images of her. Her family says Patrick, who had just moved to Michigan, bought a plane ticket to come visit them for the holidays in Florida. In January, family members urged investigators to remain focused on the possibility that foul play was involved in her disappearance, after reports surfaced that gospel singer Marvin Sapp had filed a personal protection order against Patrick in September. In court documents, Sapp said Patrick ""has claimed him as her husband, had moved from California to Michigan, joined his church, had contacted his children and had been to his home. ""I have at least 400 pages of correspondence from her which I have never responded,"" his complaint reads. Questions remain . While the discovery of Patrick's body answers some questions, it leaves many more unanswered for the grieving family of a young doctor described as ""wonderful,"" ""beautiful"" and ""talented."" Investigators have said they have no evidence of foul play, but they also don't have conclusive evidence that Patrick's movements on December 5 were voluntary. ""We have scoured, searched and looked at everything we could possibly look at -- all the exits, all the businesses, all the hotels,"" Strong said late last year. ""We posted fliers; we talked to neighbors (who live near the highway). We did a full-blown, on-the-ground search in the wooded area north of where the car was."" Carl Clatterback, a private investigator hired by Patrick's family, told CNN that investigators are looking into the videos. A central question: Who was Patrick talking to in the videos and does that person know anything about what happened to her? CNN's Tiffany Campbell and Julia Lull contributed to this report.","Body of the 30-year-old medical resident discovered in Indiana lake April 6 .

"(CNN) -- It's one thing not to boast about your $100,000 yacht. It's another to be so rich, you actually forget you own one. For two years, the 10-meter-long Rinker 342 Fiesta Vee boat floated in a Swedish marina, its owner nowhere to be seen. The keys were tied to railing on the deck for all to see, adding to the mystery of the abandoned boat in the village of Stromstad, on the south Norwegian border. ""You could just get on board and start it. But no, no one did,"" said the area's police Inspector Christer Fuxborg, on what's got to be one of the world's most honest towns. As unpaid mooring costs mounted up, fears began to grow that something terrible had happened to the owner, whom no one had ever seen. Inside the cabin were Norwegian documents dating back to 2008, one of the few clues police had to the missing sailor. They launched a Facebook appeal, which was picked up by the Norwegian press. Eventually, their mysterious Norwegian owner came forward. It seemed the boat had simply slipped his mind. ""He had forgotten about it,"" said Inspector Fuxborg, who declined to disclose the owner's name. ""I think he must be really rich to forget he owned a boat like this."" ""He was surprised -- he thought he'd sold it years ago."" Despite being unmaintained for two years, the swish yacht was in good condition. The owner's biggest concern will now be paying the mooring fees. ""As a guest to the harbor you usually pay a fee of $30 to $50 per 24 hours, during summer,"" said Inspector Fuxborg. ""But I don't think he'll have any problem paying it."" See: Stupid stunt? Sailor walks the mast .","How do you 'forget' a $100k boat? Quite easily it seems .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department is about to reverse a century of resistance to technology, requiring that federal agents record interviews of most suspects under arrest. It's a policy change that the department, at the behest of agents, has resisted for decades. A memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole, first reported Wednesday by the Arizona Republic, says that beginning July 11, ""There is a presumption that the custodial statement of an individual in a place of detention with suitable recording equipment, following arrest but prior to initial appearance, will be electronically recorded."" The policy will apply to the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and U.S. Marshals Service. Cole's memo was issued without any public notice on May 12. U.S. law enforcement officials confirmed the authenticity of the memo. The Justice Department declined to comment. There are exceptions. Those include national security or intelligence interviews or those done under the public safety exception to the requirement that suspects be read their Miranda rights. And it also doesn't apply to interviews of suspects before arrest. Recorded interviews are common practice among state and local police departments nationwide. Even inside the Justice Department, the inspector general's office records interviews. But until the Cole memo, Justice Department policy discouraged recorded interviews for decades, in part because of fears that it could aid defendants on trial. That meant that even in high-profile trials, juries are often treated to the spectacle of FBI or other agents having to testify about what their hand-scribbled notes taken during interviews were supposed to mean.

"(CNN) -- On Mother's Day, we celebrate the mothers in our lives because we know motherhood is the hardest job any woman will ever have. But some have it harder than others. Disasters can strike any place, any time. But, as Save the Children uncovered in its 15th annual State of the World's Mothers report, released Tuesday, that devastation hurts some more than others: Women and children are at the greatest risk and are 14 times more likely to die in a disaster than men. I've met many of these mothers. They were huddled in a shelter in the Philippines after Super Typhoon Haiyan, one of the largest cyclones ever to hit land, destroyed their homes and livelihoods. They were also my own friends and neighbors who lost homes, businesses and belongings when Superstorm Sandy devastated parts of the East Coast. When President Barack Obama visited the Philippines last month, the Tacloban community had yet to be rebuilt. Now there are devastated areas closer to home after storms across Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Save the Children report shows that children and mothers with the fewest resources often face the most daunting challenges during emergencies. In Sandy's aftermath, it took weeks for relief efforts to reach hard-hit families living in some of New York City's low-income areas, such as Far Rockaway, Queens. ""This community was nowhere on any maps for five weeks for services, and for resources, and for help,"" said Aria Doe, executive director of the Action Center in Far Rockaway, of the struggle to get supplies and services to the many mothers, babies and children who were stranded without electricity, water, food, supplies or transportation. In the Philippines, Haiyan swept through the central part of the island nation, killing people and ruining housing, livelihoods and infrastructure across nine of the poorest regions. It damaged or destroyed more than 2,258 health facilities, including hundreds of village health stations, which provided primary health and childbirth services to people in smaller communities. At the time of the typhoon, in the region it hit, 250,000 women were pregnant and almost 70,000 were expected to deliver in early 2014. The Save the Children team met Hazel Rapsing, 25, a mother of two toddlers. She went into labor at the peak of the storm as her entire neighborhood evacuated. Her baby decided to come 10 days early. ""I was scared because the typhoon was getting really strong. I was wondering whether I would be able to give birth. How long would I be in labor?"" Rapsing said. ""I was worried about what kind of treatment my baby would get. It was a state of emergency and everyone was busy. I was praying to God to take care of me."" Despite the storm, an ambulance arrived and took Rapsing to a clinic, where she gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Ullicel. Rapsing's home was leveled, so she and her family are staying with relatives until they are able to rebuild. While I cannot begin to imagine how frightening it must have been to go into labor during one of the most powerful typhoons ever recorded, having to protect your newborn as you're fleeing for your life can be just as terrifying. Abigail Matulac had given birth to a beautiful baby girl, Kazumi, only two weeks before Typhoon Haiyan hit the shores of Sicogon Island, where she lived in an isolated, low-income community with her husband and three small children. Like most families there, they didn't expect the storm to be as intense and waited too long to evacuate. Once they had no choice but to leave, Matulac wrapped her infant in thick cloth to keep her warm. The wind was so strong that they couldn't even open the door of their house and had to climb out the window and then crawl up a mountain to find a safer place to shelter. ""I've been bleeding for a while after I gave birth and was afraid that I would have a relapse from the stress,"" she said. ""I was breast-feeding my baby during that entire time to help keep her calm and quiet."" The family was lucky to make it through the storm unscathed without needing medical services for the children, because about 82% of the health facilities in the storm area were damaged. Because of that, about 1.1 million people, including 163,000 children under 5, have inadequate health services. Whether in the United States or the Philippines, all mothers strive to ensure that their children are protected and healthy when a disaster strikes. What we need to do is strengthen community-based preparedness and early response. In areas of recurring crises, we need contingency planning and flexible funding -- and must engage women in the planning. We need social protection programs that meet the needs of the most vulnerable. And we need to invest more in reducing the risk of disasters. This includes more funding and greater integration of risk reduction into government and donor policies and programs. Fortunately, our evidence also shows that we can save and dramatically improve the lives of all mothers and children, even in the most challenging places to live, if we invest in the services they need, including education.","Carolyn Miles: Moms struggle, but especially those trying to save children in a disaster .

"(CNN) -- Humorist Dave Barry is back with a new book. The prolific writer shares parenting stories in ""You Can Date Boys When You're Forty: Dave Barry on Parenting and Other Topics He Knows Very Little About."" He has written more than 30 books, but this is the first that headlines his role as a parent. Despite the title, Barry explains, it's not purely a parenting book. ""I wouldn't want anybody to think that this is a book where they're going to learn useful information about parenting,"" he said. ""Or, really, anything else."" Like many of his books, this is a collection of essays sharing his opinions on a wide range of issues and experiences. Readers will learn about his impressions of ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" his tips on how to cook a steak and his hatred of his mail. The 66-year-old also shares personal stories about his kids, Rob, 33, and Sophie, 14. He reveals that he ""made the ultimate sacrifice"" for his daughter: He took her to a Justin Bieber concert. Barry received a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his nationally syndicated humor column. For nearly 30 years, he has lived in Miami, which has provided plenty of fodder for his fiction and nonfiction books. ""If you want to write humor, just come here,"" he said. ""You don't really need a sense of humor at all. You just write down what people actually do here, and it strikes everyone else as outrageously funny."" Barry spoke to CNN about his new book, his daughter's changing musical tastes and his plans for his next project. Below is an edited transcript. CNN: What parenting advice would you offer? Dave Barry: I'd say lighten up. I think a lot of parents get pretty intense. As far I can tell, more it's the moms than the dads, partly because the dads, let's face it, are irresponsible scum and don't even necessarily know how old their children are or what their names are. It's the moms who are doing everything. But they sometimes get a little hovery. A little intense. And a little too determined to actually control the outcome of their child's lives, which you really can't do. But there seem to be parents who believe they can. CNN: Have you modified your parenting style having a daughter versus a son? Barry: Absolutely. Girls turn into women, and they do it really fast and dramatically and terrifyingly. Suddenly -- boom! -- they are women. And then, boys come around. I didn't worry about sex or social life or anything like that. With Sophie, I'm really aware of boys, because I happen to be one, or I was one. I'm a male, and I know we're scum. We're all scum. We know it. When they show up, they're nice to me, because I'm the dad. But they're not fooling me. I know they're scum, deep inside. I want them to go away. It would be nice if I could get a humane trap, a boy trap, that I would put on the lawn. It would be baited with something that boys like, like fireworks, something insane. When I hear it clang shut, I would go out and take the boy and release him humanely in the Everglades. CNN: How does Sophie feel? Is she OK with waiting until she's 40 to date? Barry: No. She would completely disregard anything I would tell her about boys. She is so entrenched. She is in this world. They are so connected, these kids. She is close, personal best friends with basically every young teenage girl in North America. They are all connected on Twitter or Instagram or whatever it is they're on now. She is constantly communicating with at least 17,000 people at once. She is part of this matrix of girls. So she has no interest at all in what I have to say. She doesn't have time, really, to communicate with me, other than, ""Would you prefer waffles this morning or Fruity Pebbles?"" That's my main communication. I make her breakfast. Her interest in my opinion about boys is, I would say, close to zero. CNN: Aside from the Bieber concert, what other sacrifices have you made as a parent? Dave Barry: The bad news is, (Sophie) is on a travel soccer team. Instead of watching her dance, now I watch her play soccer. I like it, but it's the travel part that I don't get. We'll drive 400 miles to watch our team lose. I'm thinking, why couldn't we just stay home and play somebody that can beat us? Why do we have to go to all that effort to lose? I like being a parent, but there are sacrifices. CNN: Do you have any advice for Justin Bieber, who has been in the news lately for the wrong reasons? Barry: He should listen to somebody beside whoever he's listening to now. I don't think he's getting a ton of guidance. My main advice is to him is, ""Just stay away from my daughter, Justin Bieber. She doesn't like you any more anyway."" She likes One Direction. I think. As of this morning, anyway. CNN: What is your next project? Barry: I wrote a book called ""The Worst Class Trip Ever."" It's about an eighth-grade class trip that goes really wrong. I was a chaperone on a class trip with my daughter. Nothing went particularly wrong; it's just, I thought, ""Man. This would be a good opportunity for a book. Things could go really wrong."" You have a bunch of kids and a bunch of parents who are basically rank amateurs, wrangling children in a strange place. Things could go really wrong. That was my idea. It's a class from Miami, based on my daughter's middle school really, that goes on a class trip to Washington. Five kids get involved in a seriously bad situation. High jinks ensue.

"(CNN) -- The first clue was a boat floating in the ocean with no one on board. So teams of rescuers took off, unsure of they were looking for when one crew saw the unmistakeable second clue. There on a sandbar were three huge letters -- S.O.S. And there on a nearby rocky island were five people on a rocky outcrop off the northeastern coast of Australia, happy to see a helicopter after eight hours of waiting. The incident occurred Monday when five people were snorkeling in the Pacific Ocean. They anchored their boat near the sandbar, the Courier-Mail newspaper of Brisbane reported, but the boat drifted away after its anchor broke. They stamped out a large distress signal in the sand, but they knew it was only a matter of time before the tide claimed the signal. The rocks were high enough, but the group had no phones or food, which floated away with the boat. ""We were a bit (sun)burned and it would have been fairly cold (if they had to stay out through the night),"" Lyn Forbes-Smith told The Courier-Mail. She said they had gone diving at 8 a.m. and were picked up about 4 p.m. A helicopter rescue crew from Central Queensland took off and after an hour spotted the SOS. ""We did two sweeps and then when we came across some guys on the rocks and we saw SOS written in the sand so we knew it was them straight away,"" crew member Damien Kross told Seven Network. ""It was actually quite good because we knew we found them."" By the time the helicopter got there, the water level had made it impossible to send a boat in for a rescue attempt. The crew used a winch and basket to bring the three men and two women into the helicopter. Kross said the five were in good spirits despite being a little dehydrated.","Five people were snorkeling off northeastern coast of Australia when boat got away .

"(CNN) -- This will be the first Memorial Day since my buddy from the Marine Corps committed suicide last June. As the holiday draws closer, the series of text messages I received from our mutual friend on that spring day keep pushing their way into my mind. ""I'm sorry for the text, man. But I just can't do any more phone calls today."" There was a moment of silence before he continued to write that our friend ""blew his brains out yesterday. The funeral is Saturday in New Jersey. That's all I know at this point. I'll give you a call tomorrow."" I remember looking out the car window at the lights of random buildings flashing by as I sat in the passenger seat on the way home from my niece's wedding. My heart pounding as the familiar sense of violent death and loss worked its way into me. In the years since I fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, Memorial Day has always had a certain type of sting to it. It has been a day for quiet reflection and thoughts of friends who'd fallen. Men like Marine Capt. Robert M. Secher, or ""Cubby,"" as we affectionately called him, who was killed by a sniper in Hit, Iraq in 2006. Brothers who now, still, years later, I think of every day. Rob, along with others I've known, fell while serving as U.S. Marines engaged in combat with an enemy who was trying to kill them. But this year things already feel different. Because my buddy died by his own hand. So it became clear that the cost of a war is even greater than I could imagine. Because war has such an insatiable appetite for death that it continues to kill Marines and soldiers long after they're done actively participating in it. Iraq war vet introduces military suicide prevention bill . The day he took his own life, my friend posted a picture of himself on Facebook. The photo has since been removed, but the look in his eyes has been burned into me forever. I thought I could see a mix of sadness and anger in his eyes. And I can still feel a silent and private hopelessness. I remembered how in my own dark time after the war -- it lasted nearly two years -- my soul felt like it had been shot to pieces by things I saw. The things I smelled. And the things I did. I recalled how life becomes somehow smaller as you systematically isolate yourself from those you love. And those who love you. What is wars' true toll on the spouses and children? Then there's a slide down a slope that begins with feelings of confusion, then moves along to anger and then finally, indifference. And somewhere in that dark and heavy indifference lies the point of emotional exhaustion where you find yourself standing at the edge of an abyss. Soothed by the fact that once you jump in, all feelings will end. In a 2012 suicide data report, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that on average, 22 veterans a day commit suicide. The problem is so prevalent that the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) -- which is, in my opinion, the most effective, relevant and impactful organization representing my generation of veterans -- has made combating suicide their No.1 priority for 2014. Why suicide rate among veterans may be more than 22 a day . I believe there is a stigma within our society when it comes to seeking mental health care. As a result, I fear that many who would benefit from treatment choose to stay silent. Yet, in an IAVA survey, 77% of the veterans who responded said they ""sought care when it was suggested that they do so by a friend or family member."" Opinion: Suicide on the homefront in military families . So if you know someone who may be struggling, please let him or her know that it's OK if they're not OK and there's no shame in it. Reach out to them and urge them to seek help. Because unfortunately, as is the case 22 times each day, that person's life may depend on it. Help for veterans and their families is available at the Veterans Crisis Line 24/7. Call 1-800-273-8255 or send a text message to 838255. You can also chat online.

"(CNN) -- So we thought Asian kids did great in school. Think again. A new study suggests that women and minorities are less likely to receive early support from potential academic mentors. Researchers from Wharton, Columbia and NYU ran an interesting field experiment: Pretending to be students, they e-mailed more than 6500 professors at top U.S. universities admiring each professor's work and asking to meet. The e-mails were all identical except for the senders' names. Names that one can associate with a gender or race -- like Brad Anderson, Meredith Roberts, LaToya Brown, Juanita Martinez, Deepak Patel, Sonali Desai, Chang Wong, and Mei Chen -- were used. The researchers found that faculty were most likely to respond to e-mails from white males. But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians -- professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students. One of the researchers noted, ""We see tremendous bias against Asian students and that's not something we expected. ... A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group. We expect them to be treated quite well in academia."" The study highlights the pernicious nature of the ""model minority"" stereotype of Asians, and the fact that Asians are still viewed as the most foreign ""other"" in our American culture -- perhaps the biggest outsiders in the politics of ""not like us."" A common refrain I hear from well-meaning friends and colleagues is: ""What's so bad about the Asian stereotype? Seems to me Asians have done all right."" I get it. As a woman of color, I'm keenly aware that on the spectrum of bias, there are plenty of worse things to be called than good at school. It doesn't sound so terrible to be thought of as hardworking or quiet when there are so many more obviously sinister racial myths out there to bust. But the flip side of the model minority myth is an assumption that Asians do just fine and don't need any mentoring or help in the academic or professional world. Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement. And this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace. There's still a huge disparity between the percentage of Asians graduating at the top of their class from the best schools in the country and the percentage of Asians who go on to achieve top leadership positions in their chosen fields. Disturbingly, I have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of Asians in senior leadership roles is due to systemic, external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace, or whether it's Asians who are responsible for taking themselves out of the C-suite pipeline because ""they're just happy being the worker bees."" Is there any truth to the perceptions that Asians are passive, lack leadership skills and assertiveness, are unwilling to take initiative or risk, and even unable to have fun or a decent sense of humor? Some people definitely think so. I'm not the only American of Asian descent who has been told, in the form of a compliment, that I'm surprisingly outgoing, funny, or sociable -- for an Asian. I still get friendly compliments on my ""very good English."" And at one of my very first legal job interviews, one judge put it succinctly: ""I've always thought your people were very bright."" It's the very benignity of these model minority stereotypes that render them so persistent and difficult to eradicate. So, what can we do about it? We can start by improving mentor and sponsor programs. Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world. Employers should consider the real affinities that may actually exist within their workforce and offer employees the tools, training and access to identify, cultivate and maintain their own meaningful mentor and sponsor relationships. At one law job early in my career, I was assigned to a ""mentor"" who himself had only been at the firm a few weeks. Why? He was from Seoul. I'm from California and grew up in D.C. And I'm not even Korean-American. Meanwhile, I went to a college that graduates about 400 students a year, and a white male senior partner whose office was down the hall had gone to this same small college, yet no one at the firm had stopped to think that perhaps I might have something in common with him. Sure, it's also incumbent on people to take initiative and simply walk down the hall and introduce themselves to potential mentors. But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers -- in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose -- to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential. Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.

"(LonelyPlanet.com) -- With more than 2,000 islands, ranging from tiny atolls to the veritable continent that is Crete, maritime Greece is unmatched for sheer variety. Beaches, history, walking, cycling, water sports, festivals, food ecology: chances are if you want it, they've got it. Here are just a few of the incomparable offerings Greece's islands hold. Lonely Planet: Europe's six surprise islands . Best for beaches: Crete, Lipsi, Kefallonia, Skiathos, Mykonos . Almost every Greek isle has great beaches, but few come with a Venetian castle, like laid-back Frangokastello Beach in southern Crete. For lapping turquoise waters, try Platys Gialos and Kambos on quiet Lipsi, and the stunning cove at Myrtos Beach in Kefallonia. To see and be seen, bowl up to one of Skiathos' 65 beaches, join the mainstream masses at 1200m-long Koukounaries Beach or bronze up on nudist-friendly Banana and Little Banana Beach, popular with the gay and lesbian set. Even more full-on are the legendary Paradise and Super Paradise beaches on decadent Mykonos. Best for history: Rhodes, Delos, Corfu, Patmos . Gape at Rhodes' magnificent, walled old town, where the Knights of St John ruled from 1309-1523, and explore their quarter before visiting the 14th-century Palace of the Grand Masters. Tiny Delos, near Mykonos, was once dedicated to Apollo; see ruins of shrines to the gods and explore mosaic-rich ancient dwellings. Kick back in Corfu's old town, with its Venetian, French and British architecture. On ethereal Patmos, visit the Monastery of St John the Theologian, and see the grotto where the saint wrote the Book of Revelations. Best for walking: Crete, Naxos, Alonnisos, Skopelos . The varied terrain on Greece's biggest island, Crete, ranges from gentle plateaus dotted with windmills to canyons and mountains. Hiking the Samaria Gorge, Europe's longest at 16km, brings you through the homeland of Crete's famed wild goat, the kri kri. The Zakros-Kato Zakros (a former Minoan palace site) amble in eastern Crete is more relaxed. Cool relief awaits on the forested 'river walk' at southern Plakias (inquire at the excellent Youth Hostel Plakias). The Greek Mountaineering Club of Hania informs about trekking opportunities and conditions, while Hania'sAlpine Travel organizes walking and trekking tours. Fertile Naxos boasts numerous walks along the old paths connecting the villages of the central plain; these traverse ancient temples, Hellenistic towers and Byzantine churches. For guided walks contact Flisvos Sport Club. The Sporadic isles of Alonnisos and Skopelos, full of forests, orchards and wildflowers, offer more excellent walks; contact the Alonnisos Walking Club and Skopelos Walks. Lonely Planet: The Mediterranean without the crowds . Best for cycling: Evia, Kos, Thasos . The meandering country roads of Evia make for blissfully stress-free cycling. Another favorite is well-equipped Kos, bursting with bike-rental places. Excellent forested trails (and a popular international race) bring mountain biking aficionados to Thasos. Best for diving and snorkelling: Karpathos, Milos, Paros, Kastellorizo . For organized dives in sea caves full of colorful aquatic life, check out Karpathos Diving School on Karpathos. Milos has phenomenal diving; Diving Center Milos brings you face-to-face with deep-sea fish, dolphins and even monk seals. Snorkeling is also great here, and on Paros and remote Kastellorizo. Lonely Planet: What's the world's sexiest accent? Best for responsible travel: Zakynthos, Chios, Crete . Volunteer to protect endangered wildlife like sea turtles on Zakynthos with the Earth, Sea & Sky Center and Sea Turtle Protection Society. Get your hands dirty while tending endemic mastic trees, and explore Chios' other eco-tourism opportunities with Masticulture in Mesta. Finally, enjoy guilt-free eating and sleeping in Crete's secluded mountains at Milia Traditional Settlement, powered by solar energy and living off its organic farm and good vibrations. Best for food and drink: Lesvos, Samos, Corfu, Folegandros, Crete . Lesvos is renowned for its olive oil and its ouzos (it produces some 70 percent of all Greek ouzos). The national aperitif is served with mixed mezedhes (appetizers) at traditional ouzeries (ouzo restaurants), which blend the island's old Turkish influences with Greek seafood specialties. Lesvos produces fine wine, as does Samos, famed for its sweet muscat dessert wine. Like other Ionian islands, Corfu was never Ottomanised, and its cuisine remains Italian-flavored. Folegandros' Cycladic specialties include matsata (pasta with rabbit/chicken in red sauce), astakomakaronada (lobster with spaghetti) and liokafto (sun-dried fish). Crete is famous for its olive oil and specialties like dakos (rusks topped with tomato, olive oil and cheese) and myzithra (sweet cheese, used in kalitsounia pastries). Horta (wild greens) provide seasoning for fish or roast lamb. © 2011 Lonely Planet. All rights reserved.","Greece's islands offer beaches, history, walking, cycling, water sports and festivals .

The hike, which he started at Camana, Peru, on April 2, 2008, ended Monday at Maruda Beach, Brazil. Four months after he started, he was joined by Peruvian forestry worker Gadiel ""Cho"" Sanchez Rivera. Sanchez intended only to guide Stafford for five days through a dangerous area near Satipo, Peru, but stayed to the end of the expedition. The 859-day journey took Stafford through three countries and a place in his body and soul he never imagined. ""I'm more tired and more elated than I've ever been in my life,"" Stafford said in a release. ""We've lived through some very serious situations and there have been times when we genuinely feared for our lives, but we never ever thought of giving up. The fact that everyone told us it was impossible spurred us on. ""At first it was terrifying but it's changed in our eyes during the expedition and a place that was once mysterious and dangerous to us is now a place where we feel safe. We've never had more relaxed evenings than when we sit in the middle of the jungle alone around the campfire. It's not a scary place for us now; it's beautiful; we've fallen in love with it and it feels like home."" Despite collapsing from exhaustion on a roadside Sunday morning, Stafford had been confident he would finish in time Monday to catch a scheduled flight home to Leicestershire, England. ""Feeling much better,"" he wrote in a blog post from northeastern Brazil on Sunday, after catching three hours of sleep. ""... will walk all night from now to complete the remaining 85 kilometres."" It's the kind of fortitude that Stafford has summoned time and again since setting out from the Amazon's River source to raise international attention about rain-forest destruction and to help raise funds to combat it. Along the epic trek, the two men encountered pit vipers, electric eels, anaconda, mosquitoes and scorpions, but very few doubts about whether they'd reach the Atlantic. ""After grabbing something to eat, and replying to emails I finally got my head down at 1:27am,"" Stafford wrote in a piece for CNN.com last week, after hiking for 15 straight hours. ""We've never walked 55km in a day before so we are satisfied with what we've achieved, if a little stiff."" Stafford's mother, Barbara, said Monday she did not spend ""an awful lot"" of time worrying about her son. ""I only got hear about the bad stuff that had happened only after it had happened,"" she told CNN. ""I can't say there was ever a second when I thought he wouldn't make it unless something dire happened."" Stafford, a former British army captain, and his hiking buddy have seen their share of setbacks. Stafford contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis, a skin disease, and had to have a botfly removed from his skull. Sanchez suffered a nasty machete cut. But their biggest challenges were far less dramatic. ""Although everyone would like me to say that the hardest thing has been our encounters with (indigenous residents) pointing bows and arrows at our chest, for me that wasn't the hardest part,"" Stafford told CNN last month. ""The adrenalin kicks in and you deal with exciting, potentially dangerous moments like that easily."" ""It's been the mundane that had really challenged me,"" he said. ""The weight of the rucksack, the basic food, the constant mosquito bites, the constant thorns. The little things that in a two-day expedition wouldn't bother you have been the things that have actually been challenging."" The greatest pleasures of the journey, Stafford said, have been the warmth of the Brazilian people, with village children frequently welcoming him and Sanchez to new towns and their parents offering home-cooked meals. Having never visited the Amazon before starting his expedition, Stafford says his quest to save the region won't end with his hike. ""I'm committed now to this place for the rest of my life,"" he wrote on CNN.com this month, ""and I intend to take 'Walking the Amazon' around the world and keep alive the stories of the people we've met along the way, the lives in the Amazon and the tale of the jungle."" Though he says that deforestation means the Amazon ""is changing faster than many of us can comprehend,"" Stafford has also found reasons to be hopeful about its survival while hiking. ""Although (deforestation) is still going on in the moment,"" he told CNN, ""there's a generation coming through Brazil that are very aware of environmental issues and really do care about the Amazon."" As he closed in on the Amazon's mouth, Stafford found time to nurse less lofty desires. He said the first thing he'll do after touching down in England is grab a pint of beer. And his Peruvian partner, he says, can't wait for a pint of fresh milk. Back in England, Stafford's mother told CNN she will fix him a favorite meal when he gets back -- shepherd's pie.","NEW: Ed Stafford said he's ""more tired and more elated"" than ever in his life .

"(CNN) -- Juventus became the first Italian club to reach 100 points in the league after comfortably defeating Cagliari 3-0 in their final Serie A match of the season. The Old Lady of Turn had already secured their third scudetto in a row but goals from Fernando Llorente, Claudio Marchisio and an own goal by Cagliari goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, from a stunning Andrea Pirlo free kick that hit the post and bounced in off Silvestri, ensured that Juve finished on a record 102 points. It has been a chaotic season of football in Italy, marred by fan violence, racism and continued failure in the UEFA Champions League. Earlier this month the Italian Cup Final was delayed after three Napoli fans were shot before the game, causing Napoli's ultras to riot and throw flares on to the pitch. But, domestically at least, Juve has been devastatingly consistent with a season of records for Antonio Conte's side. The victory ensured that they maintained a 100 percent record of home victories throughout the season, winning 33 of their 38 games and finishing an incredible 17 points clear of their nearest rivals Roma. ""I want to say a massive thank you to all the players, every one of them has been phenomenal,"" Conte told Sky Sports Italia after the match. ""Our objective was to win a third consecutive scudetto, instead we've set record after record."" Incredibly, given Conte's success since taking charge of Juventus, his position has been in some doubt with rumors suggesting he was Monaco bound. ""Tonight the appointment is to celebrate the title,"" Conte said when asked about his future.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- ""So when I was driving down this hilly, windy road in Malibu, I really went to a dark place and thought, 'You know, I could turn right [over the side of the canyon] and no one would know. It would look like an accident,' "" remembers Jim Moret, the chief correspondent for ""Inside Edition"" and a former CNN anchor. ""My wife would get $3 million of insurance. It would solve all of our problems. Of course the big problem wouldn't be solved because I would be dead."" Ironically, after 2½ years without a full-time job, the veteran newsman had finally found work with ""Inside Edition,"" but an upside-down mortgage and a mountain of debt fueled by subprime loans had brought him to a financial meltdown. It had him literally staring into the abyss of suicide. ""Whether your home is worth $150,000 or $5 million,"" he writes, ""the real prospect of losing everything you have worked your entire life to achieve is devastating and utterly demoralizing."" Like George Bailey in the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" it had occurred to him that financially, he was worth more dead than alive. But when he thought about his family, he pulled back from the precipice and got to thinking, ""What if I had one day left, how would I view life? What's important? What would I value? How do I look at friendship and love and gratitude and laughter and music and forgiveness and adventure? And none of those things had anything to do with money. Money was the root of my desperation."" Moret didn't seek professional help. Writing was his therapy, he says, so with his wife's encouragement, he wrote about the experience and the life-changing insights it gave him. But as he got further into it, it dawned on him: ""Wow. I just might have a book here."" The final result is ""The Last Day of My Life,"" which Moret calls an ""inspirational memoir."" ""In the 20 or so chapters, if you can find one or two or three that you can relate to, then I feel wonderful, because the idea is that you can see yourself through my story. I'm telling you what my choices were and what I choose to feel is important and then I ask you a question at the end of many chapters. Who would you apologize to if this were your last day? Who would you forgive? Those two things there are really powerful and heavy statements and questions and it's difficult to forgive somebody who's wronged you."" Moret deals with the issue of forgiveness in the chapter on his troubled relationship with his biological father, ""Gidget"" star James Darren, who legally renounced his parental rights when Moret was 13. Moret writes candidly about the feelings of abandonment it caused and his quest to forgive his dad. ""If you're not completely honest in a book like this, then the book is devalued considerably. It's worthless. I've put everything out there."" Moret says he and his family are still hanging on and haven't lost their home yet, but moving ""is not as big a deal to me anymore."" ""If you look at every day as if it's your last, and treat every day as if it's your last, you can kind of reset your clock every day. 'I've got 24 hours left, how do I proceed? What do I approach first?' And what's good about that mindset is the little things don't bother you as much. There's certain things we just can't control. You're not going to read this book and go, 'everything will be great.' This is not 'The Secret.' "" ""The Secret"" is a self-help book that talks about using positive visualization to attract the things in life you want. "" 'The Secret' really focused on material things,"" Moret said. ""My book really focuses on the nonmaterial things, the things you're ultimately remembered for and that you want to be remembered for, and that make every day really meaningful."" How would Moret like to be remembered? ""As a good dad, husband, son, brother and friend. Maybe as a decent musician, too. I hope I am regarded as someone who touched a few lives in my time here.

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Egypt will play Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations final after thrashing bitter rivals Algeria 4-0 in a semifinal that saw their opponents finish with just eight men. The game was evenly poised until Rafik Halliche brought down Emad Moteab in the area eight minutes before the break. Halliche was sent off and Hosni Abd Rabou converted the spot-kick to put Egypt on their way for a possible third successive title. Mohamed Zidan added a classy second after 65 minutes before Nadir Belhadj then saw red for a horror challenge on Ahmed El Mohamady five minutes later. Mohamed Abdelshafy grabbed his first goal for Egypt nine minutes from the end, but there was still time for Algeria goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi to pick up a second yellow card -- and for Mohamed Gedo to make it 4-0 in stoppage time. The result proved sweet revenge for Egypt who missed out on a World Cup spot when they were beaten by Algeria in a play-off. There was controversy surrounding Egypt's opener. The penalty decision appeared clear-cut but Hosni converted with the help of a stuttering run-up which incensed Chaouchi, who made a vehement protest to the referee and was lucky not to be sent off himself. Zidan doubled the advantage after turning Belhadj inside out before dispatching a left-footed shot into the far corner. Belhadj's evening got worse after he launched a two-footed lunge on El Mohamady and was rightly given his marching orders. Abdelshafy came off the bench to add a third with a neat finish from an acute angle. Chaouchi was then dismissed two minutes from time as he swung his foot at Gedo, who moments later finished past substitute keeper Mohamed Zemmamouche for the fourth. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Ghana edged past near-neighbors Nigeria 1-0 in a match which produced much less drama. Asamoah Gyan scored the only goal midway through the first half when a Kwadwo Asamoah corner caught out the napping Super Eagles defence and the Rennes striker applied the finishing touch. It was one-way traffic thereafter as wasteful finishing from Nigeria, coupled with some dogged defending and solid goalkeeping from Richard Kingston, helped the four-time former winners seal a place in the final for the first time since 1992.","Defending champions Egypt will play Ghana in the African Cup of Nations final .

"(CNN) -- A Philadelphia law firm filed suit against Blackwater USA on Thursday on behalf of the families of Iraqis killed and injured in last month's shooting in Baghdad's Nusoor Square. In this September 24 photo, an Iraqi looks at a car that was destroyed during the September 16 incident. The suit calls the incident a ""senseless slaying"" and claims it was part of ""Blackwater's lengthy pattern of egregious misconduct in Iraq."" ""This was a summary execution, an execution without a trial,"" said Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights which is part of the legal team. The September 16 shooting in western Baghdad left 17 Iraqis dead, according to Iraqi officials who called the incident ""premeditated murder"" in a report released this month. Blackwater, which guards U.S. diplomats, has said that its contractors ""acted lawfully and appropriately"" in response to an attack on a U.S. Embassy convoy. But Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh has said an Iraqi investigation found no proof that the convoy was attacked. A joint U.S.-Iraqi investigation is ongoing. The FBI is leading the U.S. investigation. The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., says Blackwater ""created and fostered a culture of lawlessness amongst its employees, encouraging them to act in the company's financial interests at the expense of innocent human life."" The suit was filed on behalf of the estates of Himoud Saed Atban, Usama Fadhil Abbass and Oday Ismail Ibraheem, who were killed. It also represents Talib Mutlaq Deewan, who, the suit said, was ""seriously injured."" Susan Burke, attorney for the plaintiffs, told CNN that Deewan and the other parties approached her firm, Burke O'Neil LLC, which she said represented parties involved in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal. The Center for Constitutional Rights, based in New York, is also part of the legal team. Deewan is not on the official Iraqi list of casualties provided to CNN by Iraqi police, but Burke said witnesses can corroborate he was present and injured in the incident, although she would not specify what injuries he suffered. The suit seeks compensatory damages and punitive damages ""in an amount sufficient to strip defendants of all of the revenue and profits earned from their pattern of constant misconduct and callous disregard for human life,"" to be determined by a jury. A senior Iraqi government official said earlier this week that an Iraqi report will recommend Blackwater pay $8 million to the families of each of those killed. North Carolina-based Blackwater has worked in Iraq since the U.S. invasion in March 2003 and has received more than $1 billion in U.S. government contracts, including $832 million to protect State Department officials since 2004, according to a U.S. congressional staff report. On September 16, the suit alleges, Blackwater was not protecting any State Department official -- the official had already been dropped off. However, the Blackwater team involved in the shooting was reportedly coming to the aid of a second team that was protecting a diplomat. One of Blackwater's guards attempted to stop his colleagues from shooting, the suit claims, but was unsuccessful. And an anonymous U.S. military official in Iraq told The Washington Post newspaper that Blackwater's conduct was ""obviously excessive, it was obviously wrong,"" according to the lawsuit. A Blackwater spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN seeking comment on the lawsuit. Blackwater turned over more than 400 internal ""incident reports"" to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which held contentious hearings regarding the company. A House report showed Blackwater ""consistently uses excessive and unnecessary force. ... Blackwater's own incident reports reveal that Blackwater forces fire first in 84 percent of the self-reported incidents involving gunfire."" The suit alleges ""reasonable discovery"" will establish the company has hired former military officials known to have been involved in human rights abuses in Chile, along with ""mercenaries"" from the Philippines, Nepal, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Honduras, among other countries. Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, security contractors have immunity from Iraqi law. But the Nusoor Square shootings have put contractors' role in the 4-year-old war under new scrutiny.  See a description of how contractors operate » .

"(CNN) -- Rockets from Gaza came down in Israel overnight, according to the Israeli military. This comes on the heels of a cease-fire announcement Hamas made toward the Jewish state late Wednesday local time. Nine rockets were fired from Gaza, eight of which landed ""in open areas,"" an Israeli military spokesman said. ""The ninth has been intercepted by the 'Iron Dome' over Ashkalon. No one was injured."" ""Iron Dome"" refers to an Israeli missile defense system. On its website, Hamas' military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, acknowledged firing eight rockets just before midnight Wednesday at an Israeli military base as a retaliatory measure. Another independent militant group admitted to firing one rocket into Israel at 12:45 a.m. Thursday (5:45 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday), also citing retaliation. Gaza has remained quiet since the rockets were fired, but Israeli aircraft can be heard flying overhead, a CNN producer in Gaza said. The Palestinian group Hamas said in a statement posted before late Wednesday that its military wing has agreed to an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire with Israel following a sharp increase in violence between the two sides. Hamas -- which controls the Palestinian territory of Gaza -- said it would observe the cease-fire as long as Israel remained committed to the agreement. There was no immediate response to the cease-fire announcement from Israel, which said more than 75 rockets had been fired into its territory from Gaza in the three days prior to the announcement. Eight Palestinians and one Israeli died between Sunday and Tuesday in a spate of rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes, officials on both sides reported; Israel also said a Palestinian child was killed when a rocket launch attempt by militants backfired. Israeli warplanes struck two targets in Gaza on Tuesday in response to the rocket fire, the Israeli military said. Hamas security sources told CNN the strikes targeted a site used to train Palestinian militants to launch rockets as well as another training facility run by the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades with two people injured. ""We stress that our confrontation with the Zionist enemy in this round was in its minimum in fire and counterattacks,"" the brigades said in a statement announcing the deal. It said the agreement includes ""all other resistance factions"" operating from Gaza, which has been under Hamas control since 2007. Israel says nearly 300 rockets have been fired into its territory from Gaza since the beginning of 2012. CNN's Yousuf Basil and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","NEW: Rockets from Gaza came down in Israel overnight, Israeli military says .

"Finnmark, Norway (CNN) -- Millions of people know Clement Clarke Moore's poem ""The Night Before Christmas,"" written in New York in 1822 and believed to describe Santa's mode of transportation, a reindeer-driven sleigh, for the first time. But Santa's reindeer have a story and a history all of their own, one tied to the oldest indigenous culture in Northern Europe and accelerated by an American entrepreneur whose principal intention was not delighting children around the world, but creating an appetite for what he hoped would become a mealtime staple as ubiquitous as beef. For thousands of years here in the snowy Arctic of northern Norway, reindeer have been a symbol and a way of life for the Sami, Northern Europe's oldest surviving indigenous people, spanning parts of Norway, Finland, Sweden and the Kola Peninsula of Russia, in an area that is known as Sapmi. (They are also called Laplanders.) About 10 percent of Samis still herd, with the bulk of the reindeer population found in Kautokeino and Karasjok, Norway, where even today the reindeer are herded up into the mountains for the long winter and brought down again in spring. The Sami are some of the most tenacious people on earth -- the cowboys and cowgirls of the tundra, deeply in tune with nature and able to deftly move and guide huge herds of animals during brutal winters over vast expanses. To many, there are no better herders in the world. Reindeer first came to Alaska, via Siberia, through the work of an Alaskan missionary named Sheldon Jackson. In the mid-1800s, many Inuit were starving due to the commercial overfishing of whales, the core of the Inuit diet, for whale oil. Consumed with the idea finding an alternative food source for this culture, Jackson turned to the idea of reindeer herding and husbandry. Thanks to Jackson's lobbying, the U.S. government agreed, appropriating funds to support seeding the plan by knowledge transfer of expert herders to the Inuit, starting with a short-lived attempt with Siberians, and later, the Sami. And so in 1898, more than 100 Sami reindeer herders and their families, and nearly 600 reindeer, made the passage from the north of Norway to the United States, ending up in Alaska to introduce reindeer herding, Sami style, to America. While reindeer are at the heart of traditional Sami culture, the idea of a jolly, gift-giving Santa Claus flying around with his herd has no part in their history or tradition. The two ideas collided in popular culture via a businessman in Alaska named Carl Lomen. When the reindeer came to Alaska and began to flourish, Lomen, a native of Minnesota, saw the commercial, mass-market possibilities of reindeer meat and fur for the United States and sought to promote it aggressively. Lomen was as much a clever marketer as a businessman, and in 1926 he conceived, along with Macy's department store, a promotional Christmas parade led by Santa, his reindeer, a sleigh and several Sami herders in their vibrant traditional dress. Eventually, similar parades were held in cities around the country, and a meme was born. Lomen is said to have further accelerated his marketing efforts by planting fake children's letters in local newspapers, the fictitious children asking for Santa and his reindeer to visit their towns. In the 1920s, the Lomen Reindeer Co. owned more than a quarter-million reindeer, and Lomen became known as ""the reindeer king."" But reindeer meat never took off in America for many reasons, most notably pressure from the cattle lobby and changes in laws about who could own reindeer in the U.S. -- the right eventually going in 1937 to indigenous American cultures, excluding even the Sami. (The law was reversed 60 years later.) Lomen's company was forced out of the reindeer business as a result, but his marketing efforts unleashed a worldwide obsession with Santa and created a common narrative now known around the world, and even elaborated on: Rudolph, the most famous reindeer of all, was not based in mythology or literature stemming from an indigenous culture, but was instead concocted as a character in a coloring book distributed in 1939 by the now-defunct Montgomery Ward department stores. As a Sami descendant, I became curious about the origin of Santa and his gang of reindeer last year on the Arctic tundra, where I experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to rig up even one reindeer. Forget flying. As beautiful and majestic as the reindeer are, they can be skittish, and the idea of rigging eight together and making forward progress seemed ambitious, even in a children's poem. For a sled, only one reindeer is the Sami tradition, but sometimes more are used when pulling supplies. I've queried many herders about the feasibility of eight reindeer -- it is possible in the right hands, but not common. And these days in Sapmi, the snowmobile has replaced the reindeer for transportation purposes, anyway -- something Santa may want to consider. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laura Galloway.","Reindeer are a way of life for the Sami people of Northern Europe, says Laura Galloway .

"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch admitted Thursday there had been a ""cover-up"" of phone hacking at his flagship British tabloid newspaper and apologized for not paying more attention to a scandal that has convulsed his media empire and rocked the British political establishment. And he said that he had shut down the best-selling News of the World out of ""panic"" in the face of public fury about the revelation that a murdered teenage girl had been a victim of phone hacking. Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times in London, as well as controlling the Wall Street Journal, New York Post and Fox News, said his News Corp. had been a victim of the cover-up, not the perpetrator. ""Someone took charge of a cover-up, which we were victim to and I regret,"" he said at the Leveson Inquiry, an independent British probe prompted by charges of illegal eavesdropping by his newspaper. He blamed ""one or two very strong individuals"" at the paper, but did not name them. ""I also have to say that I failed,"" he said of the fact that he did not pay enough attention to the problem of phone hacking. He then paused a long time before finally continuing: ""And I am very sorry for it."" If he had known the depth of the problem in 2007, when a private investigator and a Murdoch journalist were sent to prison for phone hacking, he ""would have torn the place apart and we wouldn't be here today. But that's hindsight,"" he said. The hacking scandal has led to dozens of arrests, two parliamentary investigations and the Leveson Inquiry, a judge-led independent probe set up by the British government. Murdoch suggested key parts of the scandal have been overblown. ""The hacking scandal was not a great national thing until the Milly Dowler disclosure, half of which has been somewhat disowned by the police,"" Murdoch said. He was referring to the revelation that people working for him had hacked into the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old who later turned out to have been murdered. The Guardian newspaper originally reported that the hackers had also deleted some of her voice mails, leading to false hopes that she was still alive and deleting them herself. In fact, the messages may have expired automatically. Murdoch Thursday described the atmosphere when news of the Milly Dowler hacking became public in July 2011. ""You could feel the blast coming in the window. I can say it succinctly. I panicked. And I am sorry I did,"" he said of his decision to close the tabloid. He later said he should have closed it years earlier. ""This whole business is a serious blot on my reputation,"" he said. Murdoch was also grilled over his media empire's back-channel lobbying of the British government, and said he learned of the existence of one of the key lobbyists only ""a few months ago."" Murdoch said he was ""surprised"" at the extent of the contact by the employee, Fred Michel, with the British government as it considered a bid by News Corp. to take full ownership of British Sky Broadcasting. That bid that collapsed because of the phone-hacking scandal. ""You call it lobbying, I call it seeking of information,"" Murdoch told the Leveson Inquiry. ""I didn't see anything wrong with his activities. I was I surprised that it had gone on so long, that there were so many e-mails, yes."" A government aide quit Wednesday over the revelation of the extent of the contacts, and there have been calls for the resignation of Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is named in the correspondence. Murdoch spent hours Wednesday downplaying his political influence, even as British Prime Minister David Cameron said politicians had been too close to Murdoch over the years and the government aide, Adam Smith, resigned over communications between the culture ministry and News Corp. Murdoch insisted Wednesday that he had ""never asked a prime minister for anything"" as he chronicled his personal relationships with prime ministers going back to Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s. The media baron also denied using the power of his press for personal gain. At the same time, Cameron was saying politicians from across the political spectrum had been too close to Murdoch. ""I think we all, on both sides of this house, did a bit too much cozying up to Mr. Murdoch,"" he told the House of Commons as his government was battered over testimony Murdoch's son had given to the Leveson Inquiry the day before. James Murdoch testified Tuesday that before Cameron became prime minister, he had met the politician over drinks at a pub and told him the company's Sun newspaper would support his Conservative party in the next election. The younger Murdoch insisted that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the News of the World, as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family's media empire. The scandal has forced News Corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking. James and Rupert Murdoch have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them. They have always denied knowing about the scale of the practice, which police say could have affected thousands of people, ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans. CNN's Dan Rivers, Erin McLaughlin, Elaine Ly and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","NEW: Murdoch says he would have torn News of the World apart if he knew more in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Police in Miami Beach, Florida, said Thursday no charges will be filed against retired NFL star Darren Sharper after a four-month sexual assault investigation. A police spokeswoman, Vivian Thayer, said the case was closed, but could be re-opened if new evidence emerges. Thayer said an assistant state attorney decided to shutter the investigation because there was no physical evidence, no witnesses and the alleged victim made conflicting statements about the sexual encounter. Sharper, 38, faces rape charges in Arizona and California and a warrant for his arrest was issued in Louisiana. He also is under investigation in Nevada. He has pleaded not guilty to assaults in California, where he has been jailed in Los Angeles since February after turning himself in. His next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. Shaper's attorneys have said that he had consensual sex with women. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. The five-time Pro Bowl player intercepted 63 passes in his career, tying for seventh all-time. He is tied for second all-time in interceptions returned for touchdowns with 11, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He recently worked as an NFL Network analyst but was fired after the rape allegations surfaced.","Darren Sharper has been charged in two states while another seeks his arrest .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Do you ever listen to stories? You do. You don't even know you do. Also you tell stories all the time."" Doris Lessing receives the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2007 at the age of 88. Very neatly, master storyteller and Nobel Prize-winner Doris Lessing spells out mankind's addiction to storytelling. Stories occur naturally to people in one form or another, and finding reasons for their existence is unnecessary, according to the 89 year-old author. ""It is so deep in all of us. Storytelling is obviously some part of our minds, because it's always going on in one way or another."" Lessing regards her own propensity for telling stories as a lifelong duty. Born to British parents in Persia (now Iran,) she began writing at seven, and says it was her innate capacity for it, rather than inspiration which got her started. ""I was born to write, as other people are born to paint ... that's all,"" she says, ""Writers tell stories. This is what we do."" Much of Lessing's fiction is based on her experiences growing up in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where she moved as a young child. She was raised on storytelling in the time-honored fashion -- she was read to and told stories by her mother, going on to spin her own tales for her younger brother. As she grew older these childhood stories somehow morphed into the powerful fiction she has become known for, bravely tackling the harsh social and political realities of her upbringing. Her first novel, ""The Grass is Singing"" was published in 1950 after she moved to London, and fearlessly dissects the tension between oppressed black Africans and white colonials. Arguably her most famous and influential work, ""The Golden Notebook,"" meanwhile is held by many critics as one of the most important feminist novels ever written. When she was awarded the Nobel prize for Literature last December, the Swedish academy called her ""the epicist of the female experience"" who had ""subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny."" Lessing's prodigious writing skills are all the more impressive since they are largely self-taught. Her formal education ended at age 13 when she dropped out of a school in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury, and she left home at 15 to work as a nursemaid but remained a voracious reader -- ""I educated myself by reading."" She also started writing stories and later sold two of them to magazines in South Africa. Lessing has never forgotten the importance of reading as a way to educate yourself  (""you know there are some people in the world who still do"") and feels strongly about helping people in developing countries to gain access to books. ""[There are] places where there is no proper education. In large parts of Africa for example, you find them begging for books."" In her acceptance speech on receiving the Nobel Prize, she painted moving pictures of the desperate struggle for knowledge people in some developing countries still endure: . ""Not long ago a friend who had been in Zimbabwe told me about a village where people had not eaten for three days, but they were still talking about books and how to get them, about education."" She strongly advocates storytelling as an essential part of childhood, and claims there is a distinguishable difference between the attitudes of people who grew up reading books, and that of those who grew up with television and whose parents feel television and the Internet are satisfactory substitutes. People brought up on books are ""infinitely better informed, better educated"" than those who don't have a genuine passion for reading instilled in them, says Lessing. The storyteller, on the other hand, needs to be aware of the potential power of their words. Lessing has firm principles about her work: ""I don't write what I don't believe, or I don't write anything which I think is wrong."" This uncompromising attitude coupled with her anti-apartheid campaigning helped get her and her books banned from Rhodesia and South Africa in the 1950s. Half a century later the left-wing radical has become a grand old lady of the literary scene. Unimaginably, her latest book, ""Alfred and Emily,"" released this year, will be her last. The book presents the effect of World War I on her parents, and in the first of the novel she imagines what their lives would have been like had that terrible event never happened. ""For my father it was easy, he always wanted to be a farmer, in Essex, or Suffolk, or somewhere. So I've given him the life he wanted. And my mother, who was an extremely clever woman -- I've given her a life where she could use all these abilities, which she never had the chance to do in her own life."" The second half is a more faithful account of their experiences during the war, and how distant they were from the lives they wanted. Perhaps her graceful exit with ""Alfred and Emily"" was intended to demonstrate a deeper value to storytelling. Much more than an exercise in imagination or controversy, it opens the door to an endless universe of second chances.","Writer Doris Lessing spells out mankind's dependence on stories .

"(CNN) -- They left the field with their heads bowed. Looks of shock, anguish, disbelief spread like wildfire. It mattered little. They had blown it. As Liverpool's players walked off the turf at Selhurst Park, the remnants of their title challenge were left in tatters. In the space of nine second half minutes, Liverpool's hopes of winning a first league crown in 24 years were obliterated by a Crystal Palace side which continues to produce wonders. Leading 3-0 courtesy of goals from Joe Allen, Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez, Liverpool appeared perfectly set to take the title race down to the final day of the season. But Palace hit back in style -- scoring three dramatic, late goals to snatch a point and leave Manchester City in pole position to win its second Premier League crown. ""It is 99 goals we have scored, which is a phenomenal achievement by the team -- but you have to defend,"" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told the BBC. ""It is no good scoring all those goals if you defend as we did tonight. ""There is no doubt. Manchester City will go on and win it. We needed to win to keep the pressure on going into the last game and we did not do that. ""You have to have that maturity to see it through and we did not do that. It was bitterly disappointing and I would expect Manchester City to go on and win their two home games. ""Congratulations to Crystal Palace, they produced a great fightback and punished our mistakes."" With 78 minutes of the contest having elapsed, Liverpool led 3-0 and was cruising to the top of the Premier League and a three point advantage. Palace, a revelation under manager Tony Pulis, had rarely threatened and appeared to have run out of steam. But what followed would have shocked even the most seasoned of football supporters as Liverpool imploded. This was carnage -- carnage which would have been greeted with glee by those in the blue half of Manchester. First, with 11 minutes remaining, Damien Delaney's deflected drive reduced the deficit. Merely a consolation, or so one thought. Two minutes later and Palace scored another, substitute Dwight Gayle firing home from 10-yards to reduce the arrears further. Liverpool, whose defense has been fiercely criticized so often this season, appeared dazed and confused as if it had been hit with a right hook from a heavyweight boxer. And with just two minutes of normal time remaining, Gayle lashed home an unlikely equalizer to break Liverpool hearts. ""It was obviously very frustrating,"" added Rodgers. ""For 75 minutes we were outstanding. We scored three goals, we created many chances, then we conceded with 12 minutes to go and we have to see the game out better than that. ""You cannot come here against a very good side, be the threat that we were and then defend as we did. It is criminal really. ""It is the fault of the team, coach, manager, everyone. We win and lose together. The supporters were brilliant for us. They helped us get in front but we ended up conceding three goals in the last 12 minutes. We win and lose together, so we will take the blame and move on."" It had been inconceivable that Liverpool would fail in such spectacular fashion following their impressive start to the second half. Leading through Allen's first half header, Sturridge's deflected effort gave the visiting side a two-goal cushion before Suarez added a third in the 55th minute. It looked as if Liverpool would simply continue to score at will, gradually chipping away at City's superior goal difference. That it didn't owed much to the team's poor defending as much as Palace's grit and determination. This result will surely allow City to take the crown -- but Rodgers is not giving up just yet. He added: ""We go top tonight as well, with 81 points with a week to go in the season and we are sat here devastated. ""We finished seventh last season. We are ahead of schedule. We have made great strides but I am certainly here to fight and win titles and I will be relentless in that. ""We are trying to build something sustainable. This season has shown we will be capable of doing that. Next year I believe we will make more strides forward and hopefully be up there challenging again."" Liverpool must now wait and see how Manchester City gets on against Aston Villa on Wednesday night. Rodgers' side lead the table by one point but has played a game more. Victory for City would leave it requiring victory in its final home game against West Ham to seal the title. Juventus triumph . Meanwhile, in Italy, champion Juventus celebrated winning the title with a 1-0 victory over Atalanta. Simone Padoin's 72nd minute strike was enough to give the home side all three points. In the night's other game, Lazio was held to a 3-3 draw by Verona.","Liverpool held 3-3 by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park .

"(CNN) -- It was far from vintage Barcelona, but it was enough to keep alive the Catalan club's dwindling hopes of retaining the Spanish league title. With white handkerchiefs waving in the Camp Nou to indicate the fans' frustration at what appeared to be another disappointing setback, Lionel Messi came to the rescue on Sunday to earn a 2-1 victory against Athletic Bilbao. Having been knocked out of the Champions League, then losing the Copa del Rey final to Real Madrid, Gerardo Martino's team had been staring down the barrel of an unthinkable fourth successive defeat. With Atletico Madrid having gone seven points clear at the top of the table with Friday's 2-0 win over Elche, it would've spelled disaster if Barca could not recover from Aritz Aduriz's opener for the fourth-placed Basques. The early signs weren't good. After Messi had a goal ruled out for offside, Aduriz hit the Barca woodwork with a spectacular overhead kick, then Alexis Sanchez smacked the Bilbao bar when it seemed easier to score. Aduriz ghosted through Barca's frail defense to slot in a low shot five minutes after the break, and teammate Markel Susaeta had an effort ruled out for offside soon after. To the home supporters' intense relief, Pedro provided the equalizer in the 72nd minute with his 15th league goal this season, diverting a low shot from Sanchez into the net from close range. Soon after that, Messi picked himself up after being fouled on the edge of the penalty area and fired a free-kick through the wall. It ended what, for the four-time world player of the year, was a goal drought -- four games without scoring -- as he netted for the 26th time in La Liga, leaving him third in the Pichichi standings behind Atletico's Diego Costa (27) and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo (28). It proved to be the winner, though Barca needed Javier Mascherano -- who squandered a great scoring chance not long beforehand -- to make a brave block to stop a goal-bound Bilbao shot in time added on. The result left Barca four points behind Atletico with four games to play -- the last of which will be between the two teams at the Camp Nou. It lifted Barca into second place above Real, without a match this weekend ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg at home to Bayern Munich. Atletico, meanwhile, will be seeking to make it an all-Spanish final as the capital team hosts English club Chelsea in Tuesday's opening leg. Earlier Sunday, Sevilla consolidated fifth place with a 4-0 win at home to Granada, Rayo Vallecano moved up to mid-table safety with a 3-1 win that almost certainly condemned Real Betis to relegation, and Celta Vigo beat second-bottom Almeria 4-2. In Germany, third-placed Schalke suffered a shock 3-1 defeat at Stuttgart which moved the home side four points clear of Hamburg in the relegation playoff place. Fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen moved to within four points of Schalke with a 4-1 win at second-bottom Nuremberg. In France, second-placed Monaco clinched a spot in next season's Champions League with a 1-0 win at home to Nice, thanks to an early goal from former Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov. It put Monaco seven points behind champions Paris Saint-Germain, who won the French League Cup on Saturday. Third-placed Lille lost more ground, being held 0-0 at Marseille. In Portugal, Benfica clinched a 33rd league title with two matches to play as Brazilian forward Lima scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Olhanense. Benfica had been runner-up to Porto for the past three seasons. Seven points back, Sporting Lisbon clinched Portugal's second Champions League place with a 1-0 win at Belenenses, with Porto in third another 11 points adrift with a game in hand. In the Netherlands, PEC Zwolle caused a big shock by winning the Dutch Cup for the first time, coming from behind to beat league-leading Ajax 5-1. Ryan Thomas and Guyon Fernandez scored twice to give the mid-table team a place in the Europa League qualifying rounds next season. It had lost its only other finals in 1928 and 1977.","Lionel Messi gives Barcelona a 2-1 victory with his 26th league goal of season .

"(CNN) -- A bomb blast in the northern Nigerian city of Kano killed at least four people late Sunday, according to local police. The blast occurred at a busy intersection in a predominantly Christian area of the city and left several cars burning, Kano police spokesman Rabilu Ringim told CNN. Police cordoned off the area and were searching for suspects and any additional bombs. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, the spokesman said. Terrorism in Nigeria has been in the global spotlight recently since more than 200 school girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing.","The attack took place in the northern Nigerian city of Kano .

"(CNN) -- Exploring Kenya's Masai Mara can satisfy that quest for a once-in-a-lifetime adventure within all of us, catering to our childhood dreams of seeing African wildlife up close and experiencing the magic of an unknown culture. ""If you are an adventurer at heart, love good food, want to experience a culture that will change your life, and love animals, you must visit the Masai Mara,"" iReporter Neal Piper said. Kenya's most famous national park is rich with safari opportunities and provides a genuine, escapist vacation filled with breathtaking views and unique experiences. But visiting the Masai Mara is an intense adventure, one that requires extensive planning. Tourists should coordinate with a reliable safari company and pack accordingly. Safari experts share their tips . ""This is not a spur-of-the-moment, 'let's go over and rent a car' trip,"" iReporter Linda Lowenthal said. ""There are a lot of security and health concerns, and careful advance planning is critical, especially for first-timers."" The planning is well worth the memorable time you're sure to have in Kenya. ""It's been one of the only trips where work and home life have completely been absent from my mind,"" Brandon Harris said. What to bring . Traveling to an entirely foreign destination like Masai Mara requires a different kind of packing. Because you never know where a day on the savannah will take you, bring snack bars, bottled water, hand sanitizer and safari-appropriate clothing. To preserve your memories of all the African wildlife, don't forget to bring a camera, either. ""Have a good camera with lots of memory so that you can take as many pictures as possible,"" iReporter Kevin Jackson said. ""The one thing people kept asking me was to take pictures for them because they ran out of room on their camera."" Also, it's a good idea to have cash handy. Venturing into the wild means giving up on the luxury of using a credit card. ""The park fees must be paid in cash and the fee is per person, per day,"" iReporter Brandon Harris said. ""Four our group this ran upwards of $700 USD."" iReporter Jessica Lacher also recommends expecting a rough ride into Masai Mara because the roads are probably not what you're used to. Eatocracy: In Masai Mara, don't be afraid to try the intestines . How to explore . The sheer, vast expanse of what the Masai Mara has to offer is impossible to see in one day, or even repeated safaris across the landscape. Plan to spend some time exploring your different options. iReporter Gary Fricke decided to take his chances in a hot air balloon. ""This proved to be a great way to view wildlife in areas that could not be driven by autos. The balloon rides leave at dawn and are well worth the early wake-up. Most provide a champagne breakfast when you land. Wildlife viewing is what the Masai Mara is all about!"" Odds are, you'll want to see Masai Mara from the ground as well to get up close with Africa's intriguing wildlife. Go for a full-day drive complete with a picnic lunch. ""It is best to have one's trip organized by a certified safari operator because they already know which are the best places to stay given one's budget,"" iReporter Marlene Francia said. ""The safari drivers are also in constant contact with the other drivers once already inside the Mara and often, drivers stop mid-road to ask each other where the latest animal sightings are."" To maximize your sightings, plan your trip based around the migration patterns of the animals. Between June and September is optimal. Wildebeest migrate from Tanzania to the Masai Mara from July to September. iReporter Louisa Wong recommends going in July to see the wildebeest to avoid crowds of other tourists. Where to stay . To get the most out of your experience in the Masai Mara, staying in the park is a favorite option for many first-timers and repeat visitors alike. The Mara Sopa and Serena lodges are reasonably priced and located directly in the park, iReporter Soumava Bandyopadhyay said. But don't be surprised by power outages and a lack of electricity and water at times. It's worth hearing the sounds of wildlife right outside your room, adding to the sense of adventure the Masai Mara provides. iReporter Marlene Francia stayed in the Siana Springs Tented Camp, which combines genuine tents with a bit of luxury. ""Each 'luxury' tent is in its own spacious quiet plot with private views, complete with two large beds, sitting area, dressing room, toilet and hot bush shower stalls. Guests are provided with romantic candles to use after the generators are shut off, hot water bottles for extra comfort to ward off the evening chill."" There are also eco-friendly camps for those wanting a genuine experience. iReporter Louisa Wong stayed with her family at the Porini Safari Camps, which are run by the local Masai tribe. Getting local . ""The only tip I really have is be kind to the Masai ... and they will give you an experience of a lifetime,"" iReporter Jodi Lupien said. Visitors often go to see the wildlife, but forget about the rich culture that flourishes in the Masai Mara. Meeting and socializing with locals is the best way to immerse yourself in the culture. ""Keep an open mind, prepare to have fun, be respectful of the people and the wildlife and enjoy what this wonderful country has to offer,"" Francia said. ""East Africa is one of the last places on earth where animals in huge numbers make their annual migration from the Serengeti to the Mara and back and of course, the Masai people, who live in the Mara.""","Kenya's most famous national park, the Masai Mara, is rich with safari opportunities .

"London, England (CNN) -- The 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the British throne marks a major milestone in the remarkable life of a monarch who, though reluctantly thrust into the spotlight at a young age, has won almost universal praise for her steadfast dedication to duty. Her long reign (second only to Queen Victoria's) has seen Britain transformed from a war-weary declining imperial power into its modern incarnation as a member state of the European Union that rarely looks to its monarch for leadership, but still holds her in high esteem. And while it has witnessed its fair share of joy -- not least the recent marriage of the queen's grandson Prince William to Catherine Middleton -- Elizabeth's rule has also weathered many storms, both public and personal, as the monarchy has tried to keep pace with changing times. Elizabeth Alexander Mary was born in 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York. She did not become heiress presumptive to the throne until 1937 when her father was crowned King George VI after the scandalous abdication of his older brother -- events recently dramatized in the Oscar-winning film ""The King's Speech."" As World War II erupted, Elizabeth was quietly groomed for statehood. While living out the blitz on London in nearby Windsor Castle, she was privately tutored in matters of constitution by Henry Marten, an eccentric yet respected teacher who reputedly kept a pet raven in his study. She began making tentative steps to public life in 1940 when, aged 14, she made her first radio broadcast: a speech to children displaced by conflict. At 16 she was made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a British army infantry regiment. Wartime offered her certain freedoms beyond the constraints of royal life. In 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles. When victory was declared in Europe, a uniformed Elizabeth mingled with jubilant crowds outside Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth celebrates 60 years on throne . Peacetime brought the return of Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece, a handsome young naval officer who had, by all accounts, had won her heart when she was just 13. The pair married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Their first son, Charles, was born just over a year later. With her father's health in rapid decline, Elizabeth began accepting more official duties, taking his place at the annual Trooping the Color military parade in 1949. In 1952, when Elizabeth and Philip were on an official trip to Kenya, news came of her father's death. She was now queen. The next decade saw the queen settle into her role. After her 1953 coronation, she embarked on numerous official trips, oversaw state openings of parliament, welcomed visiting leaders such as President Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Nikita Khrushchev, and toured a coal mine. In 1964, the queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son Edward joined Charles and fellow siblings Anne and Andrew. There was, however, barely any let up in her busy schedule. By the arrival of her third decade on the throne, she was in her element. Prince Charles was embarking on a military career, Princess Anne, an acclaimed horsewoman, was married -- drawing huge crowds of well wishers. Girls given equal rights to British throne under law changes . While indulging in her own equestrian pursuits, she continued to throw herself into public life, clocking up dozens of overseas trips and official visits around the UK -- one of which in 1976 saw her become one of the first people to send an email (she continues to champion new technology today). There were family problems in 1976 when her sister's marriage collapsed and constitutional problems with growing debate among Commonwealth countries about the role of the monarch, but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977. Another royal wedding followed in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer at London's St Paul's cathedral. Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television, happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the queen's life. The queen's 40th year on the throne, 1992, marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart. Princess Anne and Mark Philips divorced, Charles and Diana separated after claims of infidelities while Sarah Ferguson was photographed topless with an American financial manager. To cap it all, a huge fire ripped through Windsor Castle causing major structural damage. In the wake of the blaze, a furore broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration. ""1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,"" the queen said in a speech later that year. ""In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis."" Kate has graduated as 'fully fledged' royal . These problems overshadowed the queen as she made an historic visit to meet Nelson Mandela in 1995, but criticism reached new heights in the wake of Diana's tragic death in 1997 when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread outpourings of grief. This marked a turning point. After days of silence, the queen returned to London, talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from Diana's life. The gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away. After Diana, the queen's popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer, more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family. This was evident In 2005 when, to public approval, she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. The queen's most recent decade as monarch has largely been one of celebration. In 2006, she marked her 80th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world. She has witnessed both her grandsons graduate as military officers and, of course, she oversaw the marriage of Prince William and Catherine, the woman who -- when her husband eventually inherits the throne to become king -- will succeed her as Britain's next queen. Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this story.

"(CNN) -- A former team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers was arrested Friday on charges of conspiracy to illegally distribute anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and painkillers to his patients, though authorities declined to comment on whether the drugs were ever prescribed to players. Dr. Richard A. Rydze, 62, faces a 185-count indictment for allegedly dispensing the drugs from September 2007 through March 2011, though other related charges date back to 2005, prosecutors said. ""Doctors have a tremendous power in prescribing medication, and the vast majority use that power to dispense medicine to help sick people,"" said Steven M. Dettelbach, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. ""This doctor is accused of using his prescription pad like a personal ATM, doling out steroids, painkillers and other medicine for his own gain."" Two other men -- William Zipf, 56, and James Hatzimbes, 42 -- were also indicted, accused of related conduct, the U.S. attorney said in a statement. Rydze and his alleged co-conspirators are accused of enriching themselves by distributing the drugs for ""bodybuilding and athletic performance enhancement,"" while scheduling so-called ""steroid clinics"" at a Pittsburgh wellness center run by Hatzimbes. The veteran football doctor told ESPN that the practice never involved members of the Steelers team. ""Because I was associated with the Steelers, the assumption was that I was giving everyone on the Steelers growth hormone or steroids,"" Rydze told ESPN.com. ""You say a team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and you are saying he is buying growth hormone from a pharmacy in Florida -- what the hell else are you going to think?"" He said the ""whole thing got way overblown."" ""I was doing some kind of little bit of research back then and using growth hormone to help heal people with tendon injuries. That seems to be, in my estimation in looking at that hormone, the only role it really plays in helping people. It does seem to make you heal better, quicker. So we were using it with various orthopedic patients. ""It was never done in athletes,"" he said. ""It was never with any Steelers."" Rydze allegedly often diagnosed his patients as having hormone imbalance, pituitary deficiency or adrenal insufficiency, and then prescribed the drugs, the indictment said. The steroids included Stanozolol, Nandrolone Decanoate, Testosterone Enanthate, Testosterone Cypionate, Oxandrolone and Testosterone. Attorneys for the three men could not be immediately reached for comment. The Steelers also did not immediately return calls requesting comment.","Dr. Richard A.

"Paris (CNN) -- One of Paris' most upscale districts was once again the site of an armed jewelry store robbery Thursday, police said. Police said a number of luxury watches were stolen in a midday heist near Place Vendome, just blocks from the presidential palace and other important buildings. A couple, each armed with a handgun, entered the store and managed to escape with several luxury watches, police said. Police declined to give an estimate for the value of the stolen goods, but CNN affiliate BFMTV reported that they were worth 800,000 euros (about U.S. $1.1 million).

"Muharraq, Bahrain (CNN)  -- Once upon a time, harvesting pearls was a way of life for the people of Bahrain, a glistening archipelago of 33 islands off the coast of Saudi Arabia. Bahrain lived for pearls. And the world, in turn, coveted Bahraini pearls, considered the best there is. But with the discovery of oil in the 1930s, and as much cheaper Japanese cultured pearls flooded international markets, Bahrain's pearling industry all but died. Now, though, the island kingdom-by-the-sea wants to preserve its ancient pearling traditions as Bahrain prepares for a listing as an UNESCO World Heritage site. ""We have made a selection of several sites in the country that we felt would best reflect the pearling tradition of Bahrain,"" Britta Rudolff, UNESCO affairs counselor, told CNN. ""Those include oyster beds in the sea, many historic houses in the urban parts of Muharraq"" and a ""seashore element that connects the two."" The island of Muharraq is Bahrain's second-largest city and its former capital. Sections of the area will be restored and turned into a cultural heritage attraction. Traditional houses will be refurbished and oyster beds protected by a buffer zone restricting fishing and allowing for boat tours for tourists wanting to try their hand at pearl-diving. Rudolff said that although pearling was an ""industry that was all across the Arabian Gulf ... Bahrain was a place that lived for pearls."" The heyday of Arabian pearling occurred between 1850 and 1930. Pearls were the world's most valuable gem -- far eclipsing diamonds -- for most of the 19th century and earlier. For Bahrain, pearls were the backbone of the economy. Tens of thousands of divers, who hunted for pearls hidden inside oysters simply by holding their breath, worked the island nation's shallow waters with just a nose plug, leather finger gloves for protection against the sharp coral, a bag around their necks and a rope. Bahrain has two sources of water -- sweet freshwater springs and salty seawater -- a combination believed to have contributed to its wealth of pearls. The shallow water surrounding the island nation is also considered significant. ""Centuries ago, the divers would've gone out on a boat like this -- a dhow -- which is a traditional boat,"" Mohamed Slaise, who conducts pearl diving excursions in Bahrain, told CNN. ""The point is to get as many oysters as you can. With about 100 oysters, you find 10 pearls."" Slaise told CNN that you hang a net, called a Dee, on your head and fill it up. ""You use two hands. That's the whole point."" There are now only a handful of oyster beds off Bahrain, which have not been commercially harvested for decades. The chances of finding a commercially viable pearl -- at least 2 mm in diameter -- are slim, experts say, and it can take years to find enough pearls to make a necklace. The trade of cultured pearls is forbidden in Bahrain, and there are only a handful of pearl merchants left in the country, dealing mostly in local collections of previously-held stock. The only pearl divers now are a few fishermen and a few local hobby divers for visitors. Part of the pearl initiative is to encourage pearl diving in the country again, since experts believe that harvesting oysters actually helps replenish oyster beds. ""Every 10,000 oysters, we get 25 pearls with commercial value,"" Talal Mattar of Mattar Jewelers, told CNN. Mattar, whose family has been in the pearl-trading business for 150 years, said pearls are collected, classified and stored over years. ""This is very difficult to find something like this,"" he said, showing off a perfectly round shimmering Bahraini pearl. ""Sometimes it takes two to three years and you still don't find a round one."" CNN's Leone Lakhani and Daniela Deane contributed to this report.","Pearling's heyday was between 1850 and 1930 .

"(CNN) -- Economic inequality is now center stage in the global debate, and the World Economic Forum asserts that this issue is the single biggest risk facing the planet. Yet, amid all the justifiable concern, we may be on the cusp of a ""game-changing"" point in history. World Bank research indicates that, for the first time in about 200 years, overall global income inequality (one of the key measures of economic inequality) appears to be going into reverse. This is a cause for optimism, and will be a key topic discussed at the 50th G77 summit of developing nations in Bolivia this weekend. The meeting, which the G77 is co-hosting with China, has the overriding ambition of promoting a ""more equitable world order."" The powerful forces that determine the overall global income landscape are complex and cross-cutting. Chief among them are growing income equality between countries, as the global ""South"" (Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia) develops, at the same time that there is increased income inequality within many nations. These opposing mega-trends, like tectonic plates, are pushing against each other. China and India have been key in promoting greater global income inequality between nations. Combining their recent economic growth, and very large collective populations (estimated at more than 2.5 billion people), both have lifted a massive amount of people out of poverty -- an estimated 600 million between 1981 and 2004 in China alone. This is truly remarkable. And it has helped catalyze what Branko Milanovic, former lead economist of the World Bank's Research Department, has described as the ""profoundest reshuffle of individual incomes on the global scale since the Industrial Revolution."" But at the same time, there is a more pernicious, countervailing mega-trend: growing income inequality within many countries across both the developed and the developing world. This issue has become increasingly politically important, especially since the international financial crisis in 2008-09. Taken overall, the interplay of these forces over the past 200 years has resulted in greater global income equality. However, in the period since 2002, something dramatic may be on the change. There is evidence that the ""positive effect"" of growing income equality between countries, driven by the development of the South, is superseding the ""negative effect"" of increasing inequality within nations. If true, this would be a momentous moment in world history. As the World Bank itself says, this conclusion is hedged with uncertainty as data sources on income across the world are inevitably incomplete and imperfect. So more evidence, over a longer period, is needed to judge whether the process is real, robust and sustainable. What is certain, however, is that there has been a transformation in the overall fortunes of the South. The most prominent beneficiaries have been a much heralded ""new"" middle class -- estimated to be as large as a third of the world's population -- disproportionately located in key Asian emerging economies like China, India and Indonesia. Also welcome news is World Bank research indicating that much of the bottom third of the global income pyramid has generally benefited too. As in China, many other hundreds of millions of people across the South have transitioned away from absolute poverty. Elites within emerging markets have also tended to prosper. Many of these people are part of the top global 1-5% of income earners (a group which is otherwise dominated by individuals in developed countries). This strata, at the very apex of the global income hierarchy, have generally seen their incomes rise massively in recent years. Unfortunately, however, not everyone in the South has shared fully in this rising tide of prosperity. Much of Africa, and some of Latin America, for instance, has generally not benefited nearly as much as Asia, at least to date. A key question on the minds of G77 leaders at this weekend's summit is whether the development of the South has enough momentum to continue driving forwards a more equitable world order. This will depend on whether the high economic growth of emerging markets persists, and also whether the trend toward rising income inequality within countries can be slowed or arrested. On the former, there is no inevitability to ever-growing income inequality within countries. Growing discontent in many nations means the political and popular will to address this issue is growing, but the debate over what long-term reform agenda is needed divides the left and right. On the latter, the trajectory of the global economy will continue to shift toward the South. However, the remarkable wave of emerging market growth of recent years will decelerate, and the global transformation it has produced -- an economic change of unprecedented speed and scale in world history -- is unlikely to be repeated again. As the G77 meets, the world therefore stands at a historic crossroads, which could potentially see the first sustained period of greater overall global income equality since the Industrial Revolution. But if emerging market growth decelerates faster than anticipated, or income inequality within countries accelerates, this process could go into reverse. If so, the political salience of the inequality agenda could skyrocket yet again across much of the globe.","World's developing nations to meet at 50th G77 summit in Bolivia this weekend .

"St. Petersburg, Russia (CNN) -- Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Friday criticized Western nations for failing to ensure that weapons it plans to supply to Syrian rebels do not fall into the hands of al Qaeda. ""Where will those weapons end up,"" Putin told the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, which was moderated by CNN's John Defterios. Putin questioned how weapons could safely be supplied to rebels if the U.S. recognized one of the key opposition groups was al Qaeda's affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. ""If the United States and the State Department recognize that one of the key opposition organizations al-Nusra is a terrorist organization officially recognized as terrorist which is linked to al Qaeda, how can they give weapons to that part of the opposition?"" he said. ""There are no answers to those questions... so it is not as simple as some people would suggest. We believe that our position is well founded ... we believe only the Syrian people themselves can guarantee a long-term solution."" His comments came as Syrian rebels said Friday they have received heavy weapons -- including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles -- from ""brotherly nations that support the Syrian revolution."" At the G8 summit in Northern Ireland this week, Putin came under intense pressure to back plans to sideline Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Putin is the only G8 leader who supports the Assad regime and during the meetings U.S. President Barack Obama said the two had ""differing perspectives"" but shared an interest in ending the violence. On Friday, Putin laid it out more starkly: ""There is indeed a certain difference of view between us and, let's say, the U.S.,"" he said. The G8 summit came days after the U.S. pledged to play a greater role in assisting Syrian rebels, citing evidence that al-Assad's regime used chemical weapons against the rebels and his own people. But Putin declared that he would not risk arms getting into the hands of rebels who ""who kill their enemies and eat their organs,"" referencing a widely circulated video that purports to show a rebel fighter eating the heart of a dead soldier. Putin reiterated his determination Friday to seek a peaceful outcome. ""We should encourage the sides, the parties to the conflict to engage in dialogue and achieve positive results,"" he said. ""This discussion was among interested parties among partners and there were differing opinions during that debate ... despite the depth and complexity of the problems, we were looking for a way to compromise."" The Russian leader also laid out plans to boost his country's anemic economic growth and crack down on tax evasion following promises made at the G8 meeting. Putin was speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said she had a ""certain degree of skepticism"" over Turkey's accession to the European Union after the government's heavy-handed approach to protestors. Merkel said she was ""shocked to see how the authorities dealt with demonstrators."" Turkey has been wracked by more than two weeks of protests against the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Merkel said discussions centred on whether it was the right time for Turkey to join, but that was ""a totally different issue than whether the whole process as such will be stopped."" Putin said Russia would be tracking corporate accounting but would also look to create new investment opportunities. He added that the country's plans to create ""dynamic economic growth"" which needed a balance between long terms goals and urgent issue. He said the country needed to increase its labor productivity, promote investment and innovation. Putin said the country's tax policy should be working to develop business incentives, modernize business and create high quality jobs. However, he said, ""this is not the end of the course."" The country would also look closely at ""policy fiscal accounting and book keeping ... we have been talking about that for a long time."" Putin added: ""Developing our tax policy is not justification for an increase in tax burdens for business."" Putin will be chair of the G-20 summit in September, following from the G8 summit of major developed nations. At the G8 -- made up of UK, U.S., Germany, Russia, France, Italy, Japan and Canada -- the leaders also agreed to step up efforts to make individuals and companies pay the taxes they owe. Stung by mounting evidence that major companies are shifting profits across borders, G8 leaders said countries should change rules to prevent that from happening and multinationals should report what tax they pay and where. Tackling illegal tax avoidance has become increasingly important for governments as they struggle to revive their economies while paying down debt levels that exploded in the wake of the global financial crisis. Pressure has intensified in the wake of Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's suggestions this week the stimulus program could be scaled back this year and end it completely in 2014. Stock markets around the world sank, including by nearly 4% in Russia.","Russian president criticizes West for failing to ensure weapons don't reach al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Two former World Cup champions have already crashed out of contention for this year's trophy, and a third one will join them on Tuesday. Tiny Uruguay -- arguably the country that punches the farthest above its weight in global soccer -- is hoping it won't be them. But they need to beat Italy to get out of the group stage and into the knockout round. Italy has won the World Cup four times and been runner-up twice, but Uruguay has won it twice themselves. Ahead of the crunch match, here are some numbers that might surprise you: . Size of Uruguay's population: About 3.3 million people, making it the smallest country in the World Cup this year. That's not many more than Italy's capital, Rome. Number of times Uruguay refused to defend its World Cup title: One. Uruguay hosted, and won, the very first World Cup, back in 1930. Four years later, the South Americans refused to travel to Italy for the World Cup because the Italians didn't come to South America in 1930. Uruguay is the only champion that didn't defend its crown. Uruguay's record against Italy: They've won three, lost two and drawn four against Italy. Uruguay has scored 10 goals against Italy. Italy has scored nine against Uruguay. Star striker Luis Suarez is one of the most controversial players in the world today. He's been banned from matches for biting opponents -- twice! -- and for racially abusing them. Number of games Suarez has been banned from for biting: 17. (Seven in 2010 when he was Ajax, and 10 in 2013 at Liverpool.) Number of games Suarez was banned from for racial abuse: Eight. He was also fined 40,000 British pounds (currently $68,000) for the comments he made to Manchester United's Patrice Evra. And Suarez earned a red card in a 2010 World Cup match against Ghana for an intentional handball in a scrum at the goal line to keep the Africans from scoring what would have been a game-winning goal. Uruguay's match against Italy kicks off at noon ET. Costa Rica kicks off against England at the same time. England is out of the tournament no matter what happens Tuesday, while Costa Rica, the surprise powerhouse of World Cup 2014, is hoping to secure the top place in Group D.

"(CNN) -- After a seven-week lull following the botched execution of an Oklahoma man, executions resumed in the United States this week with three men put to death over 24 hours -- one in Missouri, one in Georgia and one in Florida. Three more are scheduled to die by lethal injection in the next five weeks, and more than 3,000 men and women await execution in the 32 states where it's currently legal and in three others where it's no longer used for new crimes but still on the books for existing convictions. But major legal and technical considerations will continue to surround the issue for the foreseeable future. Here's an update on the most important issues: . Oklahoma's death penalty remains on hold while investigators look into the death of Clayton Lockett . The convicted murderer's gruesome death in April brought fresh attention to the death penalty debate, for a rare presidential comment on the issue and a Justice Department review of state death penalty practices. Lockett, who was convicted in the 1999 death of an Oklahoma woman who was buried alive after being raped and shot, died on April 29 of an apparent heart attack after the vein that was to have carried fatal doses of three drugs into his body collapsed. It took 43 minutes for him to die, according to a timeline provided by Oklahoma officials. While state officials said Lockett remained unconscious the entire time, a media witness for KFOR said he uttered the words, ""Man,"" ""I'm not,"" and ""something's wrong,"" before blinds to the execution chamber were closed. His lawyer, Dean Sanderford, said the inmate's body twitched and convulsed before he died. The state Department of Public Safety, acting on orders from Gov. Mary Fallin to get to the bottom of what happened, is investigating whether prison officials followed protocols. The review is also supposed to include recommendations about how to prevent something similar from happening again. Capt. George Brown, a Department of Public Safety spokesman, said investigators continue to interview people while awaiting the autopsy report into Lockett's death. The governor has made clear that the state won't carry out any more executions until the review is complete, Fallin spokesman Alex Weintz said. ""It will get done when it gets done, but at the same time, there's no reason it would take until November,"" he said this week. Oklahoma's botched lethal injection marks new front in battle over executions . We'll have more debate over the drugs used to carry out lethal injections, and where they come from . One of the big problems with executions lately involves the drugs used. After many manufacturers stopped producing drugs suitable for executions or blocked their use in capital punishment, states have had to turn to new drugs and new sources. Lockett's execution, for instance, used an anesthetic called midazolam, which has been used in only a few executions. Some experts say it may not put inmates under as completely as other drugs that have been used in executions, such as sodium thiopental or pentobarbital. That's a particular problem in multidrug executions, as experts say the second and third drugs frequently administered can cause pain while paralyzing a potentially still-conscious inmate, said Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center . When Georgia put a man to death late Tuesday, executioners reportedly used pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate that's frequently used to euthanize animals. And while that execution went off without complication, Dieter said it doesn't mean we're likely to see a rush toward a single-drug execution protocol called for in a recent report by the Constitution Project. That's because there are problems with all of the drugs used in single-drug executions. Sodium thiopental isn't available anymore, and it appears that states can get pentobarbital only from controversial compounding pharmacies, which aren't federally regulated, raising questions about quality and potency. We don't exactly know where states like Georgia are getting the drug because they've passed secrecy laws shielding their sources, raising concerns among death penalty opponents that the drugs could be poorly made and cause inmates pain and suffering during their executions. The secrecy laws have also made it tough on defense lawyers trying to argue that lethal injection causes a painful death. Courts have ruled that condemned inmates don't have a right to know what drugs will be used to kill them, said Fordham University law professor Deborah Denno, who has extensively studied the lethal injection debate. ""Departments of correction are becoming so secretive that lawyers can't get enough information to litigate a case,"" she said. ""It's a Catch-22."" Death penalty fast facts . Still, some analysts say other factors will probably continue to slow use of the death penalty . Many polls show declining support among Americans for the death penalty. In February, the Pew Research Center, for instance, said the number of respondents who said they strongly favored the death penalty fell was 18%, down 10 percentage points from two years before. A number of states have stopped using capital punishment, including Illinois, which abolished it in 2011. Connecticut, Maryland and New Mexico are no longer handing out death sentences, but existing sentences may be carried out. In other states, such as Oregon, Washington and Colorado, the law is still on the books but governors have declared a moratorium on its use, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Death penalty in the United States gradually declining . And then there's the not-so-subtle pressure from U.S. allies in Europe, where the death penalty isn't used. They've raised the issue as a black mark on the U.S. human rights scorecard. While such pressure hasn't made a huge difference, it could be on the mind of President Barack Obama, who after Lockett's death ordered the Justice Department to add a review of state execution protocols to its existing study of the federal death penalty, which also is on hold. In May, Obama reminded reporters that he had previously said some crimes -- mass killings and the murders of children -- may warrant the death penalty. ""But I've also said that in the application of the death penalty in this country, we have seen significant problems -- racial bias, uneven application of the death penalty, situations in which there were individuals on death row who later on were discovered to have been innocent because of exculpatory evidence,"" Obama said. ""And all these I think do raise significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied. And this situation in Oklahoma I think just highlights some of the significant problems there."" It's not clear there's much Obama or the Justice Department could do to limit how states approach lethal injection, an issue the Supreme Court has addressed just once -- in 2008 -- and which courts seem hesitant to reopen, according to Denno. Some states have taken on the issue themselves. Tennessee, for instance, said it will just electrocute inmates if it can't get the drugs it needs for lethal injection. But a sitting president's involvement in the issue, along with whatever comes out of the Justice Department review, could set the table for new court battles and a more intense debate over the uncertain future of the death penalty, Dieter said. That's especially true, he said, if another state struggles to put an inmate to death. A sea change, he said, ""could be just one more problematic execution away.""

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: Kathleen Koch is author of the best-selling book, ""Rising from Katrina,"" which explores how citizens recover from disasters. She was a CNN correspondent for 18 years. For the last year my dining room has looked like the local post office, minus the junk mail. Stacks of letters from around the country piled high. But in this case, there was only one destination -- Japan. While most were collecting money to help the survivors of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, I wanted to send something equally crucial to their recovery: hope. ""Words of Hope for Japan"" began in March 2011 with a trickle, just 10 letters, all from individuals. But soon they were pouring in at the rate of 200 a day! Schools, churches, Rotary Clubs, Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops. In the end, some 5568 cards and letters arrived from the United States, Canada and Mexico making it the largest letter-writing campaign for Japan in the country. So many felt moved to offer words of support and condolence to those who had lost so much. The most touching letters came from the Gulf Coast where I'd grown up. People there understood what Japan was going through and were eager to ""pay it forward"" because of the help and encouragement they received after Hurricane Katrina. ""For months, you never heard the sound of a bird. I missed that most of all. There were times when we thought that we would never have a normal life again,"" wrote a grandmother from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, where a storm surge similar in height to the tsunami had decimated nearly every building near the beach. ""We learned so much from it, however,"" she continued. ""You can live with a small amount of food each day; water is very precious; family and friends are the most important; and God loves us."" A New Orleans teenager penned a three-page letter and described spending days stuck in the Superdome. ""When we left the city, the sun was shining so brightly. I looked up and smiled because I learned that after a storm, there is sunshine. Rays of sun will shine upon your heart, body and soul when you feel alone in the dark or when you are about to give up."" A Biloxi, Mississippi, 10-year-old drew on her post-Katrina experience when she warned the Japanese to ""stop digging through gunk and mud. ... If you keep doing that soon you will get sick. And if you get sick you won't have medicine to cure yourself."" Many cards and letters simply exuded joy and optimism. Flowers, rainbows, hearts and smiley faces accompanied exhortations to ""Be Happy,"" ""Have Hope,"" ""Don't Worry,"" and ""Stay Strong!"" I'd planned to send the letters straight to Japan, but an industrious woman in Atlanta, Georgia, offered to translate them since not all Japanese speak English. Asako Akai-Ferguson organized more than 200 volunteers around the world to painstakingly translate each card. The project was a godsend for translators who had helplessly watched the disasters unfold. ""I have been extremely frustrated being so far away from home and not being able to do anything to help the survivors of the earthquake, other than just sending money,"" e-mailed Virginia volunteer Sachiko Ide. And by all accounts, the letters have helped. Our first batch of one thousand went to a middle school in Minamisouma that had been turned into a shelter. Japanese philanthropist Dr. Minoru Kamata hosted a surprise concert there, handing out letters and posting dozens on bulletin boards for the audience to read. ""Though the damage in the disaster area is awful, I believe that these letters must warm victims' hearts very much. I don't know how to thank you,"" he e-mailed afterwards. The Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) in Tokyo has delivered the majority of the letters. Carl Williams, coordinator of JACL relief efforts, sent photos of a group of school children he encountered in Iwaki City on the four-month anniversary of the tsunami praying at the shoreline near the site of their destroyed school. He handed out cards and completely changed the somber mood. ""They had all just been crying minutes before. Can you believe it?"" he marveled. The tsunami had so badly damaged the robes in a kimono store in Ogatsu, Japan, that the plan was to shutter it. Encouraged by the letter he received from ""Words of Hope,"" the owner changed his mind and decided to re-open his business. A Missouri woman received a response from a woman in Ishinomaki City whose town was destroyed by the tsunami. ""She said my letter made her very strong and smile,"" said Deborah Kamp Clifton. ""It made her realize that she has wonderful friends all over the world."" Simple, old-fashioned snail mail. Not even we realized the power it would have.","""Words of Hope for Japan"" is a letter writing campaign for earthquake, tsunami victims .

"(CNN) -- How can it be? The United States and Iran, sworn enemies for 35 years, are talking about working together to quell the al Qaeda-inspired insurgency sweeping northern Iraq. Such cooperation sounds unthinkable. They are fierce adversaries on issues such as terrorism, Iran's nuclear ambitions and Syria's civil war. Iranian leaders call the United States the ""Great Satan,"" while former President George W. Bush labeled Iran as part of an ""Axis of Evil."" It was headline news last year when their leaders spoke briefly by phone, the first contact at that level since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 drove the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from power. But should we be too surprised by this latest version of strange bedfellows, now known as ""frenemies"" in the modern vernacular? There's even an old saying of uncertain origin to define it -- the enemy of my enemy is my friend. What's going on? This time, the common enemy is the threat of a regional war based on sectarian battle lines, pitting Sunni and Shia Muslim governments and peoples against each other across the Middle East. Only the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its al Qaeda backers would want that, it seems. They seek to establish a Sunni-dominated Islamic state stretching from Iraq to northern Syria. ""We are now closer than ever to a regional war in the Middle East,"" Paulo SÃ©rgio Pinheiro, who heads the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said Tuesday. ""Events in neighboring Iraq will have grave and violent repercussions for Syria. The most dangerous aspect of these developments has been the rise of the sectarian threat, a direct consequence of the dominance of extremist groups like ISIS."" Shiite majority Iran seeks to protect Shia interests and power in Iraq, while the United States wants to see a stable Iraq after pulling its troops out of the country in 2011 to end its eight-year campaign that began by toppling Saddam Hussein from power. Also, Iran has sounded a more positive tone toward the West since last year's election of President Hassan Rouhani to succeed the more volatile Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Where do things stand? On Monday, the United States and Iran held ""very brief discussions"" about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in Vienna, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Secretary of State John Kerry suggested possible collaboration with Iran on Monday, telling Yahoo! News that ""we are open to discussions if there's something constructive that can be contributed by Iran -- if Iran is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of Iraq."" A senior State Department official said while Washington was open to engaging the Iranians, ""these engagements will not include military coordination or strategic determinations about Iraq's future over the heads of the Iraqi people."" The official said on condition of not being identified that the discussion concerns the ISIS threat to ""many countries in the region, including Iran,"" as well as the need to support a more inclusive approach by the Iraqi government than the sectarian efforts by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary William Hague announced plans on Tuesday for Britain to reopen its Tehran embassy, which has been closed since an attack by protesters in 2011 triggered a dramatic breakdown in relations. What's in it for the United States? Even a conservative member of Congress who once advocated military strikes on Iran said Washington needs Tehran's help. ""The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN on Sunday. A host of experts agree, including Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser during the Iraq war. ""There is a political solution here that I think could be both in Iran's interest and the U.S. interest,"" O'Sullivan said. Whether the United States likes it or not, working with Iran on the Iraq crisis might be a necessary evil, retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said. ""There are necessary steps that we have to take with Tehran that we've probably never taken before, and would prefer not to take,"" Marks said. What's the downside? Teaming up with Iran could certainly have its pitfalls. The United States is wary of furthering Iran's already considerable influence in Iraq. The Shiite Iranian regime is Maliki's closest ally in the region, and a U.S.-Iranian partnership could alienate Iraq's Sunni population as well as Sunni nations in the region such as Saudi Arabia that are U.S. allies. Meanwhile, the United States doesn't want to jeopardize international talks on Iran's nuclear program that resumed this week. The talks are intended to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and the United States and Israel have repeatedly said they would use military means if necessary to achieve that outcome. Will Iran and the U.S. work together on the ground? A senior security official in Baghdad said Iran has already sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help fight the ISIS militants. Rouhani then denied that happened, but said he would be open to helping if asked, according to Iranian state TV. A Pentagon spokesman said Monday that military coordination with Iran was not in the cards, similar to what the senior State Department official told CNN.

"London, England (CNN) -- The release of confidential U.S. diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks achieved many things: making a star -- and wanted man -- of its main protagonist Julian Assange as well as redrawing the world's foreign policy map. But also hidden among the cables are stories that reveal an often overlooked phenomenon: dictators, governments and leading industrialists being drawn to football's cultural and political power like moths to a flame. The cables outline how powerful people have tried to harness football for their own ends and how the game has been used by ordinary fans as a crucible of opposition in otherwise restrictive societies. Below details the ""soccerleaks"" worth knowing: . Myanmar's junta considered buying Manchester United . Myanmar's de facto leader General Than Shwe was almost talked into buying one of the world's most popular football clubs, Manchester United, for $1 billion by his favorite grandson Nay Shwe Thway Aung. In the end, such an investment only months after nearly 150,000 people were killed by Cyclone Nargis, was deemed inappropriate. ""The grandson wanted Than Shwe to offer $1 billion for Manchester United,"" the cable explains. ""The senior general [Shwe] thought that sort of expenditure could look bad, so he opted to create for Burma a league of its own."" According to a cable in June 2009 called ""Cronies Launch New Soccer League"", select businessmen were told that [General] Than Shwe had ""chosen"" them to be the owners of the new professional soccer teams. The brainwave came from Zaw Zaw, chairman of the Myanmar Football Association and a rising ""crony"" with multiple business interests in everything from rubber to jade mining, and Aung who, according to exile website The Irrawaddy, is a hated Manchester United-supporting playboy. The cable concluded that the new league ""may be a way for the regime to distract the people from ongoing political and economic problems."" According to FIFA.com, the league has been a resounding success; average attendances have risen from 2,000 to 13,000.   Mysteriously, Zaw Zaw relinquished the ownership of his club Delta United, but not before he had further curried favor with the General. In a separate cable titled ""Update on Crony Zaw Zaw's activities"", it was revealed that: ""Contacts confirm that Zaw Zaw hired Senior General Than Shwe's grandson to play on the [Delta United] team."" Bulgarian football riddled with mafia cronies . The opening sentence of one cable emanating from the U.S. embassy in Sofia says it all. ""Since the fall of Communism, Bulgarian soccer has become a symbol of organized crime's corrupt influence on important institutions."" The cable ""Bulgarian Soccer Receives a Red card for Corruption,"" dated January last year, lists a litany of shady crime figures and mafia bosses who, it is claimed, all control Bulgaria's top football clubs in an effort to not just launder the proceeds of their criminal activity, but to launder their reputations too. Accusations of match fixing and illegal betting have led to attendances in the league to plummet as Bulgaria's football fans desert a game which they feel has now become a symbol of corruption. Bulgarian football is, according to the cable, a dangerous thing to be involved in. ""The last three presidents of Lokomotiv Plovdiv, which has been periodically owned by the crime group VIS, have been assassinated."" Questions on corruption in Bulgarian football sent to the Bulgarian Football Union by CNN have so far remained unanswered. Sierra Leone coach implicated in drug smuggling; currently in jail . The problems that face Sierra Leone, following its brutal, bloody civil war, paint a bleak picture. To make matters worse, the country is now on the frontline of the war on drugs, with the West African state being used like many others in the region as a transit point for cocaine being shipped to Europe from South America. According to the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime, at least 50 tons of cocaine, with a street value of $2 billion, enters West Africa en route to Europe every year. One WikiLeaks cable entitled ""Cocaine Bust: Minister of Transportation Sacked"" from August 2008 refers to a bizarre incident when an aircraft with over 700 kilograms of cocaine was found abandoned at Lungi airport. The minister for transportation, Ibrahim Kemoh Sesay, was fired after a close relative, national football team coach Mohamed Sesay, was arrested in the scandal. ""His [Mohamed's financial] contributions during the election, according to rumor, earned the ministerial position for [Ibrahim] Kemoh Sesay and the coach the position of the national football team for himself. If the allegations are true, these positions were strategically selected and likely used to facilitate narcotics trafficking beyond this particular case."" Mohamed Sesay is currently serving a five-year jail term. ""He was team coach for the 2010 African Cup of Nations qualifiers,"" Sorie Ibrahim Sesay, spokesperson for the Sierra Leone Football Association and a distant relative of both men, told CNN. ""This was a man instrumental in getting funds for the federation because of his political influence with the government ... but we had this problem and he was relieved of his duties."" President Ahmadinejad personally sacks the Iranian national coach . A cable from June 2009 titled ""Iran's First Fan: Dissatisfaction with Ahmadinejad May Extend From the Soccer Pitch to the Ballot Box,"" reveals the extent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had draped himself around the national team to improve his popularity. ""[Ahmadinejad] has staked a great deal of political capital in Iranian soccer,"" the cable read. ""A personal fan and former player, Ahmadinejad has made several press appearances practicing with Team Melli [the national team's nickname] ... in an effort to capitalize on soccer's popularity with constituents."" The cable alleges that Ahmadinejad personally sacked the coach, national hero and record international goal scorer Ali Daei, in an attempt to save Iran's faltering 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign. He also insisted that star midfielder Ali Karimi be recalled. Ahmadinejad's faith in football was such that he believed the team had to win a vital qualifier against the UAE two days before the presidential election because he ""'cannot afford a loss on the eve of the election in such a tight race."" In the end Iran beat the UAE 1-0 at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran thanks to an Ali Karimi goal. The elections ended in bloodshed a few days later. Karimi led the team onto the pitch for Iran's final, crunch game against South Korea wearing a green armband, allegedly to show solidarity with the Green Revolution raging back home, proving that presidential patronage doesn't guarantee obedience. The team drew 1-1 and never made it to South Africa. Entire Eritrea national team disappears after loss; turn up in Australia . A recent Human Rights Watch report detailed just how bad the situation is in Eritrea, with its semi-permanent state of conscription and reports of political prisoners being held in starvation conditions in underground prisons. With travel outside the country effectively banned, athletes and footballers -- the lucky few allowed to leave Eritrea -- have taken the chance to flee while on international duty. One cable from the U.S. embassy in the capital Asmara, titled Eritrea's ""Squabbling Colonels, Fleeing Footballers, Frightened Librarians"" details how the national football team, nicknamed the Red Sea Boys, took the chance to defect once they had lost to Tanzania 4-0, opening a window on conditions in the country. ""Only the coach and an escorting colonel reportedly returned to Eritrea. (One wonders why, given their likely fate.),"" the cable said. ""[President] Isaias [Afewerki] has previously claimed the CIA was luring Eritrean youth abroad; if the soccer team has in fact defected, he will undoubted try to twist logic in some way to blame the United States."" President Afewerki denied that the team had disappeared, but 11 of the 12 players arrived safely in Australia, claiming political asylum. But, rather ominously, it looks like it will be a while before the [former] Red Sea Boys will see their families again. ""[President] Isaias [Afewerki] is clever, very good at operational security, and two decades younger than Mugabe."" Football riots in Jordan highlight deep divisions . A cable from July 2009 entitled ""Jordanian Soccer Game Halted Amidst Anti-Regime Chants, Hooliganism Towards Palestinians"" details how a match between two of the country's most decorated clubs, Al Faisaly and Wihdat, was called off after rioting between fans. ""Jordanian police intervened to stop fan violence and the chanting of anti-regime slogans,"" explained the cable. ""The unrest began when Faisali [sic] fans started to chant slogans against Palestinian-origin Jordanians, including Queen Rania."" Al Wihdat -- once described as Palestine's unofficial national football team by Yasser Arafat -- represents the Jordanians of Palestinian origin who make up as much as 70% of the population. Al Faisaly represent the Hashemite Jordanians, who see themselves as the ""true"" Jordanians and fear becoming a minority in their own country. Often the simmering hatred explodes during Jordan's biggest derby match. ""The game exposed the growing rift between East Bankers [Hashemite Jordanians] and Palestinians in Jordan,"" the cable concluded. ""The King's silence on the event is noteworthy, as is a reluctance among our contacts to discuss the issue."" A few days after the cable was released the issue once again made international headlines when 250 Wihdat fans were injured during riots when Wihdat beat Faisaly 1-0. Al Jazeera reported that police beat several fans to death. The government has since opened an enquiry into the violence.","Hundreds of thousands of cables released by WikiLeaks .

"(CNN) -- Every woman who's worked in an office has her story about discrimination or, as they say in the HR confabs, ""inappropriate behavior."" Mine is the day I was chatting with colleagues in a newsroom some years back when I suddenly felt two meaty hands massaging my shoulders. ""I'm not sure who you are,"" I said before turning to face my uninvited masseur. ""But take your (expletive-deleted) hands off me."" The mystery hands belonged to my editor. I thought about that day while reading ""The Good Girls Revolt,"" the just-published history of the first class-action discrimination lawsuit ever brought against a media organization in 1970. Lynn Povich, a 47-year journalism veteran who started as a secretary in the Paris bureau of Newsweek magazine in 1965, tells the story of 46 women with degrees from top schools who got tired of a system that relegated them to jobs checking facts and clipping newspaper stories, while men with similar credentials got the bylines and big salaries. Povich and her female coworkers recruited fellow plaintiffs at secret meetings in the ladies' room. They hired Eleanor Holmes Norton, the civil rights lawyer who today is a District of Columbia congresswoman. And then they announced their lawsuit on March 16, 1970, inspiring the headline ""Newshens Sue Newsweek for Equal Rights"" in the New York Daily News, which went out of its way to note that most of the plaintiffs were young, ""and most of them pretty."" The magazine's official response: ""The fact that most researchers at Newsweek are women and that virtually all writers are men stems from a newsmagazine tradition going back almost fifty years."" Noted. A string of similar lawsuits against other news organizations ensued, and journalism's male guard was embarrassed into making some changes. Today, a woman is editor of the New York Times, and a woman has just been named that newspaper's public editor. You might think that gutsy efforts like those of the ""Dollies,"" as the Newsweek women were called by their male bosses, would have led to a media world that was all fixed on the gender front 42 years later. You'd be thinking wrong. It's a funny thing about journalism. The public has this idea that the media world is run by bleeding-heart liberals more focused on homeless shelters than tax shelters. You know, progressive thinkers looking to change the world. Reality is it's a business like most others, run largely by men who push back at serious threats to their authority. In the old days, I had to stand up to cretins like Massage Man. Betsy Carter, a Newsweek researcher who would go on to found New York Woman Magazine in 1987, had to put up with some guy she barely knew who walked by on deadline and ""planted a soft kiss on her neck,"" as Povich describes it. Today's woman journalists are less likely to get massaged and smooched on the job. But 42 years after that lawsuit, women are still shut out: Men make up 60% of newspaper employees, write 80% of newspaper op-eds and author most articles in ""thought leader"" magazines such as the New Yorker, which last year had 242 female bylines, 613 male. The record for ""new media"" is better than print, though men and women are still nowhere near parity. In a report earlier this year, the Op-Ed Project said 33% of op-eds in the Huffington Post and on Salon were written by women. At Newsweek, where a woman, Tina Brown, has run the show since the merger of Newsweek and The Daily Beast website in November of 2010, the imbalance has improved in the four decades since the women's lawsuit. In a March 18, 2010 cover story ""Are We There Yet"" written by three Newsweek women, the authors said 39 percent of the people on the masthead were women, up from 25% in 1970. But men still had the star power, writing 43 of the 49 cover stories the previous year. Now try to square those numbers with these: Over the past 10 years, between 70 and 76% of all journalism and mass communications graduates have been women. At one of my journalism jobs, I blew a fuse one day over my male colleagues getting the high-profile web page spots where readers would find their stories while my work was out of sight. I complained, and my boss shot back an e-mail saying I'd cooked up a ""conspiracy theory."" Lest I should get any future impulses to be uppity, he warned, ""I don't plan to address this issue again."" Even a newshen with a byline is supposed to know her place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Antilla.","Susan Antilla: Women used to be routinely harassed and passed over in newsrooms .
She says more women have gotten better posts, but men still dominate the business .

"(CNN) -- Sniffer dogs will search an Oregon high school for explosives before students return from the Memorial Day weekend, because one of their classmates was planning to attack them with bombs, police said. The 1999 shooting spree at Colorado's Columbine High School served as Grant Acord's benchmark and inspiration, Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson said. But the prosecutor said the teen wanted to top Columbine in a planned attack at West Albany High School. With the help of explosive devices, checklists and diagrams, Acord's ""goal was to model the Columbine shootings with some adjustments that would make it a greater success,"" Haroldson said. The prosecutor said police found six types of explosives in the 17-year-old's possession after they arrested him Thursday night at his mother's house in Albany, Oregon. They recovered napalm, pipe and drain cleaner bombs, as well as Molotov cocktails Friday from ""a secret compartment that had been created in the floorboards"" of the teen's bedroom, Haroldson said. Albany police became suspicious after they ""received information that associated ... Acord with manufacturing a destructive device with the intent of detonating it at a school."" West Albany High School's principal, Susie Orsborn, sent a note to students' parents, asking them to urge their children to come forward and speak with police if they knew anything about the plan. Acord, a juvenile, will be charged ""as an adult with attempted aggravated murder,"" Haroldson said. He will also face bomb-making charges and ""unlawful possession of a deadly weapon with intent to use against another person."" He is scheduled to appear in court for the first time Tuesday. CNN is attempting to reach Acord's attorney for comment. A woman who answered the door at the house believed to belong to Acord's mother told CNN affiliate KATU that she has no comment. Albany police searched the school twice -- the first time on the night they arrested Acord. But state police want to conduct a more thorough search with dogs before students return to class.

"(CNN) -- The United States and China put on sharp display Thursday their continuing differences over territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas, disputes that are now boiling over into violence. In a joint news conference at the Pentagon, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Fang Fenghui, described their private discussions as ""refreshingly frank"" and ""constructive"" before expressing opposing views of who is to blame for the broadening tensions. China and Vietnam are currently locked in a standoff after China installed an oil rig on an island in the Paracel chain (jointly claimed by the two countries), sparking protests in Vietnam, including violent attacks on Chinese and ethnic Chinese residents. Fang said, ""We do not make trouble but we are not afraid of trouble,"" adding ""in matters of territory, our attitude is firm. We won't give an inch."" Dempsey countered, ""We have to acknowledge there are territorial disputes,"" including ""what exactly is the status quo and who is seeking to change it."" It was a veiled reference to Washington's position that Beijing is attempting to change the status quo by more aggressively seeking to establish control over numerous island chains simultaneously claimed by China and several South East Asia nations. In addition to the current standoff between China and Vietnam, China and Japan both claim sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands, while China and the Philippines are competing for control over several small land formations, such as the Scarborough Shoal. On his recent trip to Asia, President Barack Obama announced a new military base access agreement with the Philippines. The United States says it takes no position on sovereignty but encourages all sides to resolve the disputes through diplomacy. In response to China's installation of the oil rig in the Paracel Islands, the State Department released a statement this week saying, ""This unilateral action appears to be part of a broader pattern of Chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region."" Despite the differences that exist over these issues, Dempsey announced that China would participate in the bi-annual Rim of Pacific naval exercise that takes place in Hawaii. Dempsey also announced a secure video conference link between him and Fang will be established later this year. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this story.","Territorial disputes over islands in Asia are boiling over into violence .

"(CNN) -- This year, it's hip to be dead. The deaths of so many celebrities in recent months have highlighted the continued public fascination with stars -- even beyond the grave -- and the booming industry surrounding dead celebs. ""It's been a crazy year,"" said Scott Michaels, who runs findadeath.com, a site devoted to tales of dead celebrities, as well as the ""Dearly Departed Tour"" in Los Angeles, California, where enthusiasts can visit sites of some of the city's most notorious deaths. ""It's weird because even [stars], who are already dead, like Anna Nicole Smith, are back in the news. Death has become trendy."" It's also a gold mine. Mark Roesler, chief executive officer and chairman of CMG Worldwide -- which markets and manages several deceased celebrities (some more easily managed dead than alive) -- said fans often feel connected to stars long after they are gone. ""I think that with celebrities, we feel like we own a piece of them,"" he said. ""It's almost like being part of the family."" That family expanded during what some have dubbed the ""summer of death."" From May to September, Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, David Carradine, Walter Cronkite and Patrick Swayze all died. The fascination with such celebrities can mean big bucks for their estates. And if death is the new black, Michael Jackson is poised to become the new arbiter of style. With the release of the documentary ""Michael Jackson's This Is It,"" and a companion double CD, the legendary pop icon's estate stands to add millions to its coffers. Jackson will join the realm of Elvis Presley, Heath Ledger and John Lennon who rake in the cash and keep fans enthralled even from the grave. Have you seen ""This Is It""? Share your review. At the end of October, Forbes releases its list of ""top-earning dead celebrities."" Last year's top 13 -- Elvis Presley, Charles M. Schulz, Heath Ledger, Albert Einstein, Aaron Spelling, Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), John Lennon, Andy Warhol, Marilyn Monroe, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, James Dean, and Marvin Gaye -- earned a combined $194 million in 2008, according to the magazine. Not bad for a group that is unable to make personal appearances or sign autographs. Roesler's company represents two stars on the list (Monroe and Dean) and quite a few living clients (people as varied as Scott Baio and boxer Roberto Duran) as part of its roster of more than 300 entertainment, music, sports and historical figures and organizations. Roesler, who declined to comment on whether he or his company is working with the Jackson estate, said dead celebrities are often less risky for companies to use in marketing campaigns. ""The fact that they are deceased, it's not possible to have any more scandals. Andin today's day and age, companies are becoming less of a risk taker,"" Roesler said. ""Even for someone like Michael Jackson, people have thrown a lot of dirt around Michael Jackson and we all know what that landscape is ... and it's unlikely that anyone is going to bring up anything that would derail any type of major promotional effort."" Share reviews of ""This Is It"" Some people take their fascination with dead celebrities to the outer limits. These fans make pilgrimages to the scene of their favorite celebrity's death, their grave, and where they lived. In the case of Elvis Presley, it's the same location, which has made Graceland one of the most popular destinations in the United States. Michaels' findadeath.com is a favored destination of those who refer to themselves as ""death hags."" From visiting grave sites to collecting autopsy photos, death hags are part of a fan culture that can rival a star's fan club in life. ""Stars' lives are pretty spectacular and we followed their careers,"" said Michaels. ""So it makes sense that we follow their deaths."" Why the attraction? Well, death is the great equalizer, said Alan W. Petrucelli, author of ""Morbid Curiosity: The Disturbing Demises of the Famous and Infamous."" ""It reminds us that despite all of the money, glamour and fame, [celebrities] are going to die just like we all are going to die."" Petrucelli has a collection of memorabilia which includes photos of some famous people after their deaths: singer Selena, President John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Sharon Tate and actor River Phoenix. ""Some people think it's gruesome,"" Petrucelli said. ""People also collect memorial cards and programs if the funeral or memorial service is open to the public. The day after a celebrity dies I go on Ebay and you will see lots of different items available. ""And of course, a star's family can make money off of their likeness,"" Petrucelli added. ""Death sells."" Karen Bard, eBay's pop culture expert, said the site sees an uptick in items related to a celebrity after their death. Bard said the star doesn't have to be someone who is popular at the moment. While her site was flooded with Michael Jackson memorabilia after his recent death, Bard said there has also been a great deal of interest generated by the sale of the crypt above the final resting place of Marilyn Monroe, who died almost 50 years ago. ""[A death] clearly incites a buying and selling cycle in an accelerated fashion,"" Bard said. ""We see unique things pop up that are always capturing the public's attention and there are people out there willing to buy them."" Alex Roman counts himself among the death devotees. He proudly wears his ""Death Hag"" t-shirt, visits Hollywood Forever Cemetery -- where several stars are buried -- and blogs about old Hollywood on his web site ""Alex Living in L.A."" Roman said he loves learning the history behind the lives and deaths of celebrities, and understands the allure. ""There is a definite fascination and people are drawn to it on many levels,"" Roman said. ""The fascination with death is that it's a frightening thing, yet it is something you are curious about. So there's that juxtaposition that makes it so interesting."" Michael's business has attracted some breathing celebrities. He said he's even given Ryan Seacrest a tour. As the old saying goes, death is one of only two guarantees in life. And with the number of stars moving on these days, there could be more business opportunities for Michaels and those in his industry. ""God has been very generous to Dearly Departed Tours,"" Michaels said, laughing.","Fan fascination can continue well after a celeb's death .

"(CNN) -- Congress' inaction to extend unemployment benefits to millions of struggling Americans is not only irresponsible policy, it is morally wrong. The economy is getting better for some, but the tragic effects of reckless public policy and deregulation spurred by the disproportionate political influence of big money still linger for far too many ordinary Americans. Congress, the elected representatives of the people, must find its moral compass, push through this unending nightmare of political gridlock and do right by the people. Contrary to the silly and obsessive partisan gamesmanship that currently paralyzes our politics, much more is at stake than the next election or some empty ideological argument. On the line are the lives of decent hardworking Americans, trying to cross over into the dignity of work but still caught in the barbwire of a historic global recession. Opinion: For women, equal pay and economic justice are civil rights issues . Some argue that unemployment benefits are a disincentive to people finding employment. But the sheer number of our unemployed neighbors and family members speaks volumes about the fallibility of such a claim. According to The Washington Post, the long-term unemployment rate has not been as high as it is now since World War II. A jaw-dropping 4 million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. The problems we face are systemic and structural, and the vast majority of the unemployed are crippled not by a lack of interest or drive, but of opportunity and access. That's why long-term solutions for economic growth are needed. But in the meantime, we will actually do further damage to a struggling economy if our elected officials shape public policy by the very same stereotypes and faulty assumptions that keep some unemployed in the first place. For a major reason that the unemployed cannot find work is because they are unemployed. The data show that they face bias and discrimination. If anyone has the ability to provide some relief from this vicious cycle, it is Congress, and its members should feel obligated to do so. Moreover, those of us who are faith leaders, particularly we pastors in the African-American churches, should speak up too. Because black unemployment is twice that of whites and has been for as long as the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track by race, we have an obligation to honor our historic reason for being -- defending those on the margins of the margins. Lessons with MLK: Eight students recall a special class . As we celebrate the life of the most famous black pastor, Martin Luther King Jr., we should remember that the black church mission connects faith with justice and personal salvation with social transformation, and addresses personal piety and public policy for the well-being of the whole person and the whole community. It fights for the weak and sees the Gospel as ""good news to the poor."" More than 50 years after Dr. King and others marched on Washington for jobs and freedom, African-Americans remain disproportionately unemployed and impoverished. The unemployment rate for African-Americans was at 12.5% when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the most recent numbers last month. Yet the fact is the black unemployment rate will undoubtedly increase if extended unemployment insurance is cut off now, adding to the devastating impact that rampant unemployment has already had on the black community for decades. And given our nation's shifting demographics, that's bad for everybody. The greatest MLK speeches you never heard . Playing politics with the very unemployment insurance afforded to American workers who are now unemployed is both immoral and economically destructive. That's why now, more than ever, we need to hear the voices of people of faith and people of good will raising the moral and practical questions about who we are to one another. And the black church -- that American church built by those who worked without wages or benefits, born fighting for freedom and thus the source of America's greatest freedom fighter -- ought to lead the way. If we really want to honor Dr. King and protect the American promise, we must demand that Congress do the right thing for American workers and the right thing for the American economy. Do not shrink a struggling economy, putting us all at risk. Rather, extend the safety net of unemployment insurance to those who cannot help but stimulate the economy by spending it immediately on the basics of food, gas and medicine, even as we debate the best prescription for long term economic health. It's just the right thing to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Raphael G. Warnock.","The Rev. Raphael Warnock says restoring unemployment aid is the right thing to do .
He calls on Congress to find its moral compass .
Warnock wants black churches to reclaim their mission of engaging in social justice issues ."
"(CNN) -- A possible threat posed by thousands of westerners who have been drawn to Syria by the ongoing civil war has become a top worry among counter-terrorism officials in Europe and the United States, FBI Director James Comey said Friday. Dozens of U.S. residents have gone to Syria, made plans or attempted to go, Comey told reporters. Of equal concern, he said, were citizens of European and other countries who can easily enter the United States because of visa-waiver agreements. He drew comparisons to the thousands of foreigners who received military training in Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s, after first being drawn with U.S. encouragement to fight communism and then to join militant factions during the Afghan civil war. Some of those fighters became al Qaeda operatives, he noted, drawing a line from the Afghan war to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States. ""There's going to be a diaspora out of Syria,"" Comey said. ""And we are determined not to let lines be drawn from Syria today to a future 9/11."" The comments came in a meeting with reporters at FBI headquarters that covered a number of topics. Comey said his agency was working with police around the country to try to help them respond to, and possibly thwart, mass shootings. He said the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit is now providing advice to police in cases where they discover a possible plot in the planning stage. In the past week, he said, with the FBI's help, one police agency was able to intervene and get a person to mental health treatment, possibly stopping an attack. Comey declined to provide more details about the incident. Comey also said police agencies around the country are now getting FBI training to do cyber investigations. As more crime moves from the street to online, more victims of theft could be helped by local police who are trained to do such investigations. That would allow the FBI to better use its limited resources, he said. ""Our strategy is for the FBI to try and focus its resources on the national security intrusions, and the largest most sophisticated criminal operations,"" Comey said.","FBI Director James Comey says dozens of U.S. residents have gone to Syria .
Europeans and others who have gone to Syria also pose a concern to the U.S., he said .

"(CNN) -- It's been a while between celebrations for Lee Westwood, but the English golfer feels he is regaining the form that took him to the top of the world rankings. Back in 2010, Westwood was the man who ended Tiger Woods' record 281 consecutive weeks as No. 1. He stayed there for four months, and returned to the summit for a few weeks in 2011, but has been in danger of becoming the sport's ""nearly man"" after failing to capitalize on strong positions in the four majors. Before Sunday's triumph at the Malaysian Open, Westwood's last tournament win was at another lower-tier European Tour event in Sweden two years ago. Having finished seventh at the Masters at Augusta this month, the 40-year-old believes he is back on course after starting work with a new coach and reuniting with his old caddy Billy Foster. ""I was going back to what I had done before because it had worked,"" said Westwood, who won his 23rd European Tour title with his 13th victory in Asia. ""It's started to work already -- the last couple of weeks I've played well in Houston and at the Masters last week and this week I've obviously played very well. ""Now I feel like I've got a short game and starting to roll a few putts in. It makes a helluva difference if you can get up-and-down if you miss a few greens, and it keeps the momentum going."" Westwood won by seven shots from European Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts, South Africa's 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and Austria's Bernd Wiesberger. He had led compatriot Andy Sullivan by one shot going into the final round, and extended that advantage to four when play was halted for four hours due to the possibility of a lightning strike. Sullivan dropped even further off the pace after the resumption and finished tied for 13th with a six-over-par 78. Westwood -- who won the Kuala Lumpur event in 1997 before it became co-sanctioned -- finished with a birdie as he signed for a bogey-free 68, while 71st-ranked Wiesberger shot 67, Oosthuizen made 68 and Colsaerts 70. Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, who made headlines on Friday when he leaped into a water hazard to avoid a swarm of giant hornets, tied for eighth place after closing with 67. Meanwhile, Michelle Wie claimed her first victory since 2010 on Saturday, triumphing at the LPGA Tour's Lotte Championship in her native Hawaii. The former teen prodigy, now 24, followed up her runner-up finish at the season's opening major tournament -- the Kraft Nabisco Championship -- as she won by two shots from fellow American Angela Stanford. World No. 1 Inbee Park of South Korea was third.","Former world No. 1 Lee Westwood ends 22-month for a European Tour title .

"(CNN) -- Imagine searching the country of Belgium for three pieces of metal, the largest about the size of half a tennis court -- a moving tennis court. That's the reality for searchers in the south Indian Ocean as they look for two objects, a satellite find that Australian officials call the strongest lead in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and its 239 passengers. A third object was spotted by a Chinese satellite on March 18 and made public Saturday. The objects are drifting in one of the most inaccessible places on Earth, giving search planes only about two hours before they have to return to Australia. Ships from several countries are assisting in the search, but haven't turned up anything. And conditions aren't helping. Massive waves, high winds and currents could push the three objects farther east and farther apart, according to a NASA simulation. Below the water's surface lies an even murkier search climate with the sea floor 9,000 feet down and deeper than most submarines can go.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A man claiming to have a bomb tried to enter the cockpit of a Turkish Airlines plane about to land in Istanbul, Turkey, but was tackled by passengers and taken into custody, Turkish media reported Wednesday. The man, identified as 40-year-old Cuma Yasar, was wearing a snowmask as he approached the cockpit during the descent of the Boeing 737-800 from Oslo, Norway, into Ataturk International Airport, the state news agency Anadolu said. He threatened to blow up a bomb he said he was holding, and urged the captain to fly back to Oslo, the news agency reported. But passengers Firat Faysal Ali and Dag Gjerstad tackled the man, the agency reported. Airport police took him into custody after the plane landed but found no explosives on him, it said. But they did find an identification card for the handicapped on Yasar, who suffers a mental illness, it added. Airport operations were not disrupted, an operations supervisor at the airport told CNN.","Passenger claiming to have a bomb approached the cockpit, Turkish media report .

"Boston (CNN) -- Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be allowed to view autopsy photos of the attack's victims and meet with his sister without being watched by the FBI, a federal judge said Wednesday. Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole to keep Tsarnaev ""from personally reviewing autopsy photographs of victims"" other than those the government plans to use at his trial, set for November. Letting him see the rest ""would violate the victims' rights to dignity and privacy and subject them to needless harm and suffering,"" they wrote. The photos are already covered by a protective order in the case. Also, the government's request didn't apply to Tsarnaev's lawyers, who have had access to the pictures. But defense attorneys refused to accept any restrictions, calling the request unprecedented and unwarranted, and O'Toole agreed. Tsarnaev, now 20, is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race along with his brother Tamerlan, who was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed Boston. The city marked the anniversary of the attacks on Tuesday, pausing to remember the three people who died and more than 200 who were wounded, many of whom lost limbs. The trial is set for early November, with the government seeking the death penalty. Defense lawyers are expected to argue Tsarnaev was under the ""domination and control"" of his brother. Tsarnaev was not in court for Wednesday's proceedings. O'Toole also said meetings between Tsarnaev and his sister shouldn't be subject to monitoring by investigators, though he held off on issuing a final order on the matter. Tsarnaev lawyer David Bruck argued that letting federal agents monitor their conversation would intrude on the defense. ""The decision to take the most casual remarks, an ironic comment, and provide it to the prosecution ... becomes ammunition on the death penalty,"" Bruck said. If the charges against Tsarnaev are true, he said, ""This is about a family,"" and lawyers should be allowed to observe the relationship between the siblings without interference. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini argued that defense lawyers were trying to combine a legal visit with a social one. O'Toole said he didn't think there was a security issue involved and he was inclined to grant the defense request, but didn't issue a formal ruling. CNN's Ronni Berke reported from Boston; Matt Smith reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Prosecutors ask to keep Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from viewing autopsy photos .

"(CNN) -- President Obama made it very clear: The second term is all about the domestic agenda. If only the world would cooperate. Obama outlined his goals for the next four years, sketching above all a progressive vision of a country with less inequality and more justice. And, judging by his inaugural speech, he plans to put his shoulder to the wheel. After all, much of the first term was consumed with averting a national economic catastrophe. Now he can get on with building a legacy, reviving that hope and change he promised back during the 2008 campaign. But the most subtly striking part of Obama's inauguration speech was how it largely ignored the rest of the globe. In his 20-minute address, he dedicated perhaps one minute to foreign policy. America, he said, will ""try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully."" He vowed the country ""will remain the anchor of strong alliances"" and it will support democracy. He also declared the United States ""must be a source of hope for the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice..."" and stand for ""human dignity and justice."" Opinion: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism . Beyond that, he did not spare a single word for tens of thousands killed by dictators, as they have been in Syria; nothing about the struggle for liberal democratic rights in places like Egypt, which sets the tone for the Middle East. Nothing about repression and thwarting of freedom of expression, the rollback of democratic rights, or the push to destroy existing democracies, statements that could have come as welcome words of encouragement for people who share American values of freedom and justice in places like Egypt, China, Iran, Russia or Mali. The president should keep in mind that millions around the world yearn to know they have the backing of the most powerful country on Earth. As he surely knows, even his words make a big difference. And while Obama plans to dedicate his efforts to the domestic agenda, a number of brewing international crises are sure to steal his attention and demand his time. Here are a few of the foreign policy issues that, like it or not, may force Obama to divert his focus from domestic concerns in this new term. Opinion: Obama finally meets Machiavelli . Syria unraveling: The United Nations says more than 60,000 people have already died in a civil war that the West has, to its shame, done little to keep from spinning out of control. Washington has warned that the use of chemical or biological weapons might force its hand. But the regime may have already used them. The West has failed to nurture a moderate force in the conflict. Now Islamist extremists are growing more powerful within the opposition. The chances are growing that worst-case scenarios will materialize. Washington will not be able to endlessly ignore this dangerous war. Egypt and the challenge of democracy: What happens in Egypt strongly influences the rest of the Middle East -- and hence world peace -- which makes it all the more troubling to see liberal democratic forces lose battle after battle for political influence against Islamist parties, and to hear blatantly anti-Semitic speech coming from the mouth of Mohammed Morsy barely two years before he became president. Iran's nuclear program: Obama took office promising a new, more conciliatory effort to persuade Iran to drop its nuclear enrichment program. Four years later, he has succeeded in implementing international sanctions, but Iran has continued enriching uranium, leading United Nations inspectors to find ""credible evidence"" that Tehran is working on nuclear weapons. Sooner or later the moment of truth will arrive. If a deal is not reached, Obama will have to decide if he wants to be the president on whose watch a nuclear weapons race was unleashed in the most dangerous and unstable part of the world. North Africa terrorism: A much-neglected region of the world is becoming increasingly difficult to disregard. In recent days, Islamist extremists took American and other hostages in Algeria and France sent its military to fight advancing Islamist extremists in Mali, a country that once represented optimism for democratic rule in Africa, now overtaken by militants who are potentially turning it into a staging ground for international terrorism. Russia repression: As Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds in crushing opposition to his increasingly authoritarian rule, he and his allies are making anti-American words and policies their favorite theme. A recent ban on adoption of Russian orphans by American parents is only the most vile example. But Washington needs Russian cooperation to achieve its goals at the U.N. regarding Iran, Syria and other matters. It is a complicated problem with which Obama will have to wrestle. A tale of two terms: Unfinished business and battles ahead . Then there are the long-standing challenges that could take a turn for the worse, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Obama may not want to wade into that morass again, but events may force his hand. And there are the so-called ""black swans,"" events of low probability and high impact. There is talk that China and Japan could go to war over a cluster of disputed islands. A war between two of the world's largest economies could prove devastating to the global economy, just as a sudden and dramatic reversal in the fragile Eurozone economy could spell disaster. Japan's is only the hottest of many territorial disputes between China and its Asian neighbors. Then there's North Korea with its nuclear weapons. We could see regions that have garnered little attention come back to the forefront, such as Latin America, where conflict could arise in a post-Hugo Chavez Venezuela. Four priorities for the next four years . The president -- and the country -- could also benefit from unexpectedly positive outcomes. Imagine a happy turn of events in Iran, a breakthrough between Israelis and Palestinians, the return of prosperity in Europe, a successful push by liberal democratic forces in the Arab uprising countries, which could create new opportunities, lowering risks around the world, easing trade, restoring confidence and improving the chances for the very agenda Obama described in his inaugural speech. The aspirations he expressed for America are the ones he should express for our tumultuous planet. Perhaps in his next big speech, the State of the Union, he can remember America's leadership position and devote more attention to those around the world who see it as a source of inspiration and encouragement. Obama's second-term priorities . After all, in this second term Obama will not be able to devote as small a portion of his attention to foreign policy as he did during his inaugural speech. International disengagement is not an option. As others before Obama have discovered, history has a habit of toying with the best laid, most well-intentioned plans of American presidents. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","President Obama devoted nearly all his Inaugural speech to domestic issues .
Frida Ghitis says there are world crises that will command Obama's attention .
She says turmoil in Middle East, repression in Russia, tension in Asia are urgent issues ."
"(CNN) -- Same-sex marriages are on hold in Indiana after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved an emergency stay request Friday evening. Shortly after the state's ban on same-sex marriage was overturned by a federal judge Wednesday, Indiana Attorney General Gregory Zoeller's office announced it would file an appeal. His office filed an emergency motion with the federal appeals court. The motion reads, in part, ""Time is of the essence to stay the district court's final judgment ... in order to maintain the historic status quo of man-woman marriage that Indiana and its citizens have adopted."" Bryan Corbin, the attorney general's public information officer, released a statement to CNN saying, ""The AG's Office noted the confusion and inconsistency for the public that has occurred since Wednesday as most county clerks are issuing marriage licenses to -- and performing marriages for -- same sex couples, but a few clerks are not."" Hoosiers Unite for Marriage, an Indiana group supporting same-sex marriage, expressed disappointment in the attorney general's office pursuing a stay. ""Hundreds of loving, committed couples were finally able to join in marriage this week, and we delivered more than 12,000 petition signatures today asking Attorney General Greg Zoeller not to pursue any appeals of the ruling overturning the state's ban on same-sex marriage,"" said Kyle Megrath of the group. ""More than anything, this is a terrible blow to the legally wedded Indiana couples and their families who were finally recognized this week under Indiana"" he said. The attorney general's office said that both sides will be able to submit arguments to the federal appeals court ""in the appeal of the underlying lawsuits challenging Indiana's marriage law,"" as part of the stay. A federal judge initially struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban Wednesday, saying it ""violates the due process clause and equal protection clause and is, therefore, unconstitutional.""","A federal judge initially struck down Indiana's same-sex marriage ban Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Belgian police are now confident that a shooter who killed three people at the Jewish Museum of Belgium was carrying a camera to record the attack, a senior Belgian law enforcement official told CNN Tuesday. Initial analysis of the surveillance footage from Saturday's attack in Brussels had not conclusively shown he was carrying a video camera. However, the police still do not have leads on the identity or the whereabouts of the shooter, nor on the gunman's specific motivation or ideological background, the official said. The official told CNN that investigators do not believe the attack was a ""hit"" targeting an Israeli couple who were two of those killed. There has been media speculation in the past several days in Israel and Belgium that the couple had ties to Israeli intelligence agencies. ""It's clear from the surveillance video that the Israeli couple were not specifically targeted by the gunman. We believe they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" the official said. ""If they had been the specific target, the gunman would not have continued with his attack by entering the museum."" The two Israelis killed were a couple in their 50s from Tel Aviv, Israel's Foreign Ministry said. The third victim was a French woman. A fourth person shot, a Belgian national who works at the museum, remains in critical condition, deputy public prosecutor Ine Van Wymersch said Monday. That contradicted museum spokeswoman Chouna Lomponda, who said Sunday that the fourth person had died. AK-47 assault rifle . Images from the museum in Brussels show the gunman behind Saturday's deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away. He used an AK-47 assault rifle to carry out the shooting, police said Sunday. Photographs and video released by Belgian police show the man wearing a cap and blue shirt, carrying two bags over his shoulder. The images do not show his face clearly. The shooter left on foot after the attack and headed toward a different part of downtown Brussels before he disappeared, according to police. Authorities are hunting the suspect, who is believed to have acted alone, Van Wymersch said. Investigators hope the public will help to identify the suspect. Terrorism has not been ruled out, Van Wymersch said Monday. Could the killer attack again? It has been challenging to identify the killer because he was wearing a baseball cap, the senior Belgian law enforcement official told CNN on Monday. There is concern that the gunman could strike again, the official said, and that authorities could be dealing with a ""Mohammed Merah"" type of killer. Merah, a French-Algerian Islamist radical who received terror training with al Qaeda-linked militants in Pakistan, shot and killed three French paratroopers in two attacks in March 2012 before killing three schoolchildren and their teacher at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France, during a 10-day shooting rampage which he filmed with a camera attached to his torso. But the official stressed that no evidence has emerged in Saturday's attack in pointing to any link to Islamist terrorism. The official said the killer shot the Israeli couple first in the museum entryway with one of his weapons. The couple had been consulting the wall display. He then pulled out a Kalashnikov assault rifle and shot the others inside the museum. Surveillance cameras picked up the killer walking on two or three streets before he disappeared. The official said the killer appeared to be skilled in using weapons and likely planned the attack meticulously. The official stressed Belgian authorities are investigating all possible angles, including Islamist terrorism, neo-Nazi attack, and other categories. With regard to the threat from Islamist terrorism, he noted there has been longstanding concern over the 100 or so Belgian Islamist extremists who received training in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region over the years, and high current concern over several hundred who have more recently traveled to fight in Syria. The concern is they might be able to use skills acquired there to launch attacks back home. Belgium's Interior Ministry raised its terror alert level in the wake of the attack. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Police think gunman was carrying a camera, a Belgian law enforcement official says .

"Nouakchott, Mauritania (CNN) -- Mahjouba was raped in March on the nighttime streets of Mauritania's capital, but she will not bring charges against the man she says did it since she may be the one who ends up in prison. The 25-year-old says the legal advice she received was to not go to court, leaving her to suffer in silence. There is no law in Mauritania that defines rape. According to a local U.N.-funded group working with the victims, the law criminalizes the women instead of their rapists -- and society ostracizes the women. Mahjouba, who asked not to use her real name, said: ""I am sure that if I raise my voice I'm going to be criminalized by my society and I will pay the price harshly ... and as a result I may stay single for the rest of my life."" She added: ""I consulted a lawyer secretly, and he advised me sincerely not to seek justice because that would throw me in jail. I know what happened to other girls who decided to go to court and face the community. Their lives were destroyed completely forever. So I already know what would happen to me if I had to follow that path. ""This Islamic republic has no place for rape victims like me."" Mauritanian laws are based on Sharia law and the penal code forbids relationships between both sexes outside marriage. That includes a consensual relationship between a boyfriend and girlfriend but can also criminalize a woman who is forced to have sex. Sidi Athman Ould Sidi Salem, a law specialist and legal adviser to the government, said: ""If raped women don't bring strong evidence, which is not easy, they would be accused of Zina -- an Arabic word meaning sex out of marriage -- and end up in jail. It's because the victims of rape are always accused of a Zina which make a lot of problems."" Sidi Athman added: ""The rape issue has been one of the many taboos that haven't been investigated (by the government)."" UNFPA, which promotes health and equality issues, is working with local groups and the government to define rape in law and protect its victims. Thierno Coulibaly, UNFPA assistant representative in Mauritania for its reproductive health program and population and development program, said he was not aware of any rape victim in the capital currently in jail but could not comment on what was happening outside the capital. Even with legal protection, women victims of rape still face a social stigma that is hard to overcome. He said: ""Women are still afraid to complain if they are victims of rape because there is an attitude from the society."" Coulibaly added: ""There is no law to define rape but there will be one. And work is being done with police officers and judges ... to let them understand the problem is not the woman, but the perpetrator of the rape."" The U.N.-funded Mauritanian Association for Maternal and Child Health (known by its French acronym AMSME) is at the forefront of trying to change both the law and society. When a woman reports a rape, police contact AMSME and the woman is taken to the El Wafa center. Zeinebou Mint Taleb Moussa, a former midwife and president of the organization, set up the El Wafa center in 2001 to provide help for rape victims. Mint Taleb Moussa said: ""There is no mention of the words 'rape,' or 'sexual violence' in the Mauritanian laws which left a growing number of women as victims ... All the words that are related to sex are extremely taboo and can never be mentioned publicly."" Mint Taleb Moussa said there were 308 rape cases registered by her organization in 2008 and 205 in 2009, but she noted that ""what has been reported is only the tip of the iceberg."" She said they mainly deal with cases in the capital, Nouakchott, but there remain many unreported rapes in the city and the country. She said rape victims bring shame to their families and the woman's reputation, and few women have the courage to report the crime and be registered. Mint Taleb Moussa added: ""We focus basically on the capital Nouakchott, but we think of covering the interior regions as well."" Mint Taleb Moussa has tried in vain for a decade to get her message into the national media to assist rape victims. ""I requested having a program in the state mass media -- radio and TV -- but my request was turned down. Recently, the national TV hosted me for the first time on a program, but it was censored without giving any justification ... It's a big problem here to defend rape victims,"" she said. AMSME is also working with government and religious leaders in a bid to get a new rape law. Sidi Ould Beyade, spokesman for the Ministry of Welfare, Children and Family, said the ministry has begun work on the issue to help end the ordeal of rape victims. ""For the first time, the ministry is now in touch with NGO activists, lawyers and opinion makers with the purpose of studying the situation, first, and then trying to act.""","Rights groups working to get a law defining rape in Mauritania .

"(CNN) -- Like millions of other Americans, Dan and Sally Sligh packed up their vehicle and headed out for a Memorial Day weekend trip. As they crossed the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River outside Seattle, Washington, the bridge gave way and their pickup truck plunged into the frigid waters. Luckily, everyone survived Thursday's incident. When a bridge fails, such as the I-5 bridge in Washington state, it raises questions about the safety of millions of travelers. Where are America's risky bridges? Are interstate bridges being properly inspected? What will it take to make the nation's bridges safer? Related: Find deficient bridges near you . We shouldn't be worried, but we should be wary: that's the message from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which puts out a ""report card"" on the safety and maintenance of U.S. bridges. Right now, America's got a C+. That may be a passing grade, but it's not good enough, says infrastructure expert Barry LePatner. That's because there have been nearly 600 bridge failures since 1989, LePatner told CNN. And one out of every nine U.S. bridges is rated as ""structurally deficient,"" according to the ASCE. Thursday's collapse was apparently caused when a tractor-trailer struck one of the overhead beams of the bridge, which is nearly six decades old. LePatner said it is ""totally unacceptable"" that the bridge did not have another support structure. ""Bridges today have redundancy so that where you have something hitting a structural element, there (are) other supports to keep the bridge up,"" he noted. ""That is something that bridge engineers understand, but politicians are not funding."" President Barack Obama has championed infrastructure spending since taking office, yet he hasn't been able to convince lawmakers to support his initiatives. ""The problem is we've had some trouble out of Congress just going ahead and funding,"" Obama said last week during a speech in Baltimore, Maryland. The president directed government agencies to ""do what it takes to cut timelines for breaking ground on major infrastructure projects in half."" ""Sometimes it takes too long to get projects off the ground,"" Obama said. Maintaining bridges and other key transportation links is not only a safety issue -- it's an economic matter, as well. ""We are on the brink of losing our competitive edge in the global marketplace as a result,"" Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, said Wednesday. Politicians are turning their backs on this issue, said LePatner. They ""do not see infrastructure as a high priority and the American public and our economic system is paying a terrible price for this."" Of course, a lot of this issue surrounds money. To make all necessary repairs to America's bridges, the Federal Highway Administration estimates it will cost $76 billion. Who's going to pay for that? Taxpayers? No thank you, say most of the Americans who answered a recent Gallup poll. Two thirds said they're against paying more in gasoline taxes to fund bridge and road repairs in their own states. And it didn't matter if the respondents were Republican, Democrat or independent. Here's another sobering stat: the average age of all 607,400 bridges in the United States is 42 years. It points to the fact that so much of this issue revolves around trust. Do we trust the systems now in place that are aimed at finding bad bridges and taking appropriate action? The federal government requires all bridges to be inspected at least every two years. If inspectors find something wrong, they can order emergency repairs or cut the size of vehicles allowed to cross, or even shut the bridges down entirely. Washington's I-5 bridge had been inspected as recently as November. It was built in 1955 and had been rated ""functionally obsolete,"" according to a federal database. LePatner explained that this classification doesn't mean that the bridge is necessarily unsafe. ""What it does indicate is that there are serious failures because of lack of maintenance,"" he said. ""A bridge that is designed in 1955 could never have contemplated heavy 18-wheeler trucks."" Bridge engineer Andy Herrmann says that the current U.S. model of inspecting bridges is working just fine. ""Engineers are watching -- trying to ensure the public safety,"" said Herrmann, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers who has spent 40 years designing and maintaining bridges. ""If you look at the Champlain Bridge in New York state, they were watching that bridge very carefully and when it got to the point where the deterioration was suddenly accelerating, they decided to close it immediately."" The bridge, which linked Crown Point, New York, with Chimney Point, Vermont, was demolished in 2009 and a newly built bridge opened to traffic in 2011. In some instances, the new generation of bridges that are being built today include new monitoring technology instead of relying solely on bridge inspectors. When the I-35W bridge collapsed in Minneapolis in 2007, 13 people died and 145 others were hurt. The bridge that replaced it cost $233.8 million. Out of that budget, about $1 million paid for smart technology that senses danger and warns of a potential structural threat. Sensors were built into the bridge to monitor corrosion, stress and the movement of the structure from constant traffic. A tiny beam of light is used to measure very small differences in the movement of the bridge when vehicles pass over. Data from the sensors is monitored, providing an extra layer of engineering oversight. ""We want these bridges to be safe,"" said Herrmann. ""But we need to provide the funding, the investment to make them safe."" The number of America's deficient bridges has actually decreased ""ever so slightly over the last couple of years,"" Herrmann said. That's mostly because of increased funding from state and local governments, he said. Is that a good sign? Herrmann said yes, but he added, ""If we don't start accelerating we could start losing ground."" Would you support an increase of your state's gasoline tax to pay for bridge and road repairs in your state? Let us know in the comments section below.","After collapse of Washington state's Interstate 5 bridge, should drivers worry?

"(CNN) -- The debate on climate change is over. Scientists are now as certain that climate change is a real, man-made threat as they are that cigarettes kill. But cleaning up our air has much more to it than combating shifts in Earth's temperatures and environment. The administration's new pollution standards -- new Environmental Protection Agency regulations that place tough limits on emissions from coal-fired power plants -- are an answered prayer for working families. I'm talking about those many families who endured damaged homes or lost work hours from our more frequent, and more severe, extreme weather. Dialing down air pollution is a gust of relief for a retiree without the luxury of air conditioning, who battles climbing temperatures and brutal heat waves. It's a breath of fresh air for every child playing in the shadow of a power plant, at risk from an asthma attack just by being outdoors. Placing limits on carbon pollution from power plants is about ensuring that we have clean air to breathe and communities that are safe to live in. Carbon pollution limits are about defending families who have borne the heaviest burden of the main pollutant that is driving climate change. Events like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy were unlike any weather disasters before. They showed the world who suffers the most from the impacts of extreme weather: low-income families and communities of color. These family communities lack the resources to insulate and protect themselves from the severity of this emerging crisis. Even worse, it is the weeks and months after -- before people go back to work and businesses reopen -- that leave working families especially vulnerable. As we enter hurricane season again, we know that extreme weather events come and go. But before they arrive, it is lower-income families and people of color -- forced by housing market dynamics and land costs -- who live the very closest to carbon pollution sources, such as highways, factories and power plants. In addition to that, they are already predisposed to health risks. The American Lung Association says that in excess of 20.2 million low-income people live in areas with at least one failing grade for its air. There are 4.5 million people breathing air that fails all three of the association's air pollution tests. Sixty-eight percent of African-Americans have homes within 30 miles of a coal plant. Considering that one in six African-American kids has asthma, compared with one in 10 children overall, that is a dangerous fact. An African-American child is 3.6 times more likely to visit the emergency room for asthma, as compared with white children, according to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health. Let me tell you a personal story. On the last Sunday of summer in 2005, my niece called me from New Orleans. ""We're leaving,"" she said. ""Where are you going?"" I asked brightly. ""On vacation?"" Her answer, and the landfall of Hurricane Katrina the next day, became one of the most humbling periods of my life. Humility and anger turned into my dominate emotions. I was angry for not knowing whether family members caught there without transportation had made it out safely. Or if they hadn't, whether they had survived. I was angry when federal officials told me that I had to wait weeks to find my sister, trapped by rising waters in an assisted-living facility. I was angry that my 92-year-old uncle, stranded on his roof, was flown to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack when he landed. Hurricane Katrina was the storm of the 21st century. It devastated an area the size of Great Britain. More than 1,800 Americans died. Three hundred thousand homes were destroyed. There was $96 billion in property damage. I served on the Louisiana Recovery Authority. I saw Congress write one big check and then skip town. I respected President George W. Bush, who personally visited the Gulf 17 times. Laura Bush visited 24 times. She made certain books were donated to schools whose libraries were washed away. Katrina was not a single disaster but three, a storm that wiped away miles of the Gulf Coast, a flood caused by breaches in the New Orleans levees and an outbreak of violence and lawlessness in the city. We can be thankful it wasn't worse. We can be thankful President Barack Obama is taking aim at one of the prime causes of climate change and extreme weather: air pollution. The EPA's carbon pollution standards are the most significant step forward our country has ever taken to protect our health by addressing climate change. They secure the hope that someday soon, power plants will no longer be free to dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into our air. Despite what critics are saying, this is no ""war on coal.""

"(CNN) -- For those who grew up in the '90s, ""Boy Meets World"" was definitive pop culture. From 1993-2000, the names Cory, Topanga, Shawn, Eric, and Feeny were synonymous with Friday night, and 14 years since Mr. Feeny uttered the words ""class dismissed"" on the series finale, nostalgia-addicts still miss the ABC sitcom. Now, the Disney Channel is hoping to reach a new crop of kids who will feel that same attachment, as the spin-off series ""Girl Meets World"" premieres June 27. Cory and Topanga are back, but don't expect the same couple we saw exiting the classroom all those years ago. They are surrounded by a new crew of comedic teens, and those behind the new series are hoping they've created a show that will please fans of the original, but also connect with a younger set looking for a program to call their own. CNN recently caught up with the cast and creator of ""Girl Meets World"" in Los Angeles and discovered a whole new world. The Matthews family of the original series has moved from Philadelphia to New York City in the new series -- which is in line with the series finale. On top of a new location, the teens of this modern sitcom are facing a different breed of angst-filled drama, chock full of social media insecurities. ""We're dealing with a lot of the same issues that we dealt with on the original series: themes of freedom from your parents and individuality and family support and relying on your friends,"" says Cory Matthews himself, Ben Savage. ""But it's in a lot more complicated framework because the world's a lot more complicated. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Internet -- these are issues we didn't have to deal with in the '90s, which is shocking, but it was a totally different world."" ""Girls Meets World"" stars Rowan Blanchard as 12-year-old Riley Matthews, the older of Cory and Topanga's two kids. Riley is trying to find her place amid the pressures of family, friends and junior high. Savage returns as Cory, but now it's his turn to teach lessons. He's moved on from bumbling student to junior high school teacher, leading his own daughter's class. Topanga is now a full time lawyer and mother, remaining the voice of reason for the Matthews family -- though Danielle Fishel was nervous about stepping back into the character's shoes. ""I didn't know if it was going to be easy because it had been 14 years since I had done it consistently,"" Fishel says. ""But, literally, the second Ben and I were in a room together, I was Topanga and he was Cory and it was like no time had passed at all."" Still, Fishel was taken aback when she saw where the pair had ended up. ""I'm a little surprised that their oldest child is as old as she is, just because when they left for New York, Topanga was so focused on becoming a lawyer,"" the actress admits. ""I have a feeling it was Cory who was really ready to start a family and that was something they negotiated."" Savage and Fishel both confess they did not re-watch the series to get back into character, hoping to craft new versions of the pair we first met as seventh grade students. But the show's younger actors have each taken a crash course on the original series, despite the fact some of them were not born until after it wrapped. In fact, the teen stars view their characters as updated versions of the originals. Blanchard sees Riley as the Cory of the new show, while Sabrina Carpenter, who plays rebellious best friend Maya Hart, doesn't hide the fact her character is the Shawn. Riley's crush on new school transfer Lucas is noticeably similar to the dynamic of Cory and Topanga. But Carpenter is quick to point out this isn't the same show recycled. ""A lot has changed since the '90s,"" she says. ""Technology is insane and the way that people dress, the way that people talk to each other, the way that people don't talk to each other."" Michael Jacobs is the creative mind behind both series, and wasn't initially interested in rebooting the brand. It wasn't until he considered creating a set of characters for a new generation that Jacobs saw the value in a spin-off. He is well aware of the high expectations ""Boy Meets World"" fans have for the new series, and has taken to heart concerns this could mess up their childhood memories of the show. ""I don't want the new show to be compared in its pilot episode to an entire series,"" Jacobs says. ""The worst nightmare I have is that we've gotten all of this wonderful press and everyone is disappointed. I want the old audience to know if you stick with us, you will be extremely well rewarded with the growth of these characters."" For now, Cory and Topanga are the only returning characters, but that doesn't mean we won't see old friends over the course of the season. Rider Strong (Shawn Hunter) and William Daniels (Mr. Feeny) will reportedly both make appearances, and the writers promise nods to the old show. For Fishel, there is one aspect of ""Boy Meets World"" she hopes stays in the '90s -- the fashion. ""It's so nice to not have to worry about feathered bangs or chokers or oversized crop tops,"" the relieved actress says. ""We did a flashback scene and I had to wear lace and a choker, the crimped hair and the bangs. I'm like, 'Oh my gosh! I'm so glad I don't look like this anymore.'"" Jacobs is certain the relatable characters of the original series are what stood out for fans, and believes he and the writers have struck gold a second time around. ""The fact that the lead of the show was not 6-feet, sandy-haired, blue-eyed. The lead of the show was us! We want to do it real. I want a stumbling, gawky, unsure of herself child to grow up in front of us again. We did it once and we were successful.""","""Boy Meets World"" spinoff ""Girl Meets World"" makes its long-awaited debut .

"(CNN) -- Dropbox, the popular cloud-storage service, is investigating whether a security breach is to blame for a recent wave of spam e-mail sent to users. The company is investigating internally and has brought in an outside team of experts ""to make sure we leave no stone unturned,"" according to a post from an employee on the Dropbox forums. ""While we haven't had any reports of unauthorized activity on Dropbox accounts, we've taken a number of precautionary steps and continue to work around the clock to make sure your information is safe,"" the post says. On Monday, users of the forums had begun complaining about receiving a flood of spam in their e-mail. Some of them said the e-mail address impacted is one they have only used to create their Dropbox account. Many of the users who complained are from Europe and at least some of the spam messages are scams masquerading as messages from European gambling sites. Many users also had wondered whether an hour-long outage Tuesday was related to the problem. But in the forum post, Dropbox said the outage ""was incidental and not caused by any external factor or third party."" It has been just over a year since a glitch briefly let people use any password they wanted to sign into any Dropbox user's account. The company said that problem, which lasted for about four hours, was caused by errors in a code update. Dropbox has roughly 50 million users who, according to the site, upload a billion files to the service every 48 hours. The company has emerged as a leader in the emerging field of cloud, or Web-based storage. The cloud is designed to save hard-drive storage space for users by instead letting them store and retrieve documents to multiple devices from remote Web servers. That kind of remote storage is being viewed as the future of computing by companies like Apple, Google and Amazon, all of whom offer cloud-storage features. But it has raised the obvious concerns among some security analysts, who say remotely stored info could become a tempting target for hackers.","Dropbox is investigating spam attacks on users .

"(EW.com) -- When Fox announced its new reality series, ""I Wanna Marry 'Harry,'"" many viewers flashed back to 2003 and the days of ""Joe Millionaire"" -- a.k.a. the first time women were fooled into fighting for a man's heart on TV, only to find out he wasn't who he said he was. But other than the whole Prince Charming angle, is there much of a difference between Joe and ""Harry""? People asked ""Joe Millionaire"" winner Zora Sabrina (formerly known as Zora Andrich) to chime in. As she put it, ""Just when I thought they've covered every reality show idea ... Fox is at it again! I suppose it has been a decade, so in all fairness, a good deceptive reality show was due."" EW: Bad heir day - 'I Wanna Marry Harry' a royal ratings bomb . Despite the ""feelings of uncertainty and insecurity"" she claimed she felt while watching the new show, Sabrina still had some thoughts on the contestants. ""At first glance, I like Kimberly,"" she wrote. ""She said something along the lines of how she doesn't care to be with a prince, just someone who cares for her and treats her well and she seems genuine. Matt a.k.a. Harry comes across as sincere, earnest and naturally uncertain of how, if at all, he can successfully pull off this hoax. And, the masquerade ball premiere couldn't be more apropos: Let the mystery and deception begin!"" As far as the other women were concerned, here's what Sabrina had to say: ""Fox has equally selected a fun mix of 12 personalities: Overly confident, overly guileless and overly trusting. Goodness, where do they find these women (sympathetic smile)?"" EW: 'I Wanna Marry Harry' - Why the idea of a royal 'Bachelor' makes total sense . That said, the ex-reality star admits, she personally ""never felt bothered"" by ""Joe Millionaire's"" premise. ""I was more caught off guard after seeing the first preview and learning the [show's] working title, The Big Choice, was changed to Joe Millionaire,"" she explained. ""I felt like there was a lot more judgment directed at participants who would partake in a show with 'millionaire' in the title."" So, will these girls really believe they're dating a prince? ""It certainly feels a little far fetched, but I'm sure some of the contestants will fall for the misrepresentation,"" said Sabrina. ""Others will likely know or at the very least, suspect, they are not dating the real Harry."" One can only hope, right? See the original story at EW.com.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's busy harbor is never short of action, but the great big yellow duck that floated into town on Thursday captured the city's attention. Thousands lined the harbor front and work ground to a halt in offices with sea views as the much-hyped 'Rubber Duck' made its grand entrance. For two weeks local media has been on something of a ""duck watch,"" closely monitoring the movements of the 16.5-meter (54 feet) inflatable sculpture. The man behind the seriously over-sized bath toy, Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, described the Hong Kong response as overwhelming and said he was happy to have finally made it to the city, his first visit. ""I've wanted to come for years -- and my duck made it here before me!"" he quipped. The sunshine-yellow duck drew up beside Ocean Terminal to the sound of a brass band and thousands of camera shutters. ""Hong Kong has been changed forever,"" declared Hofman as his inflatable friend lent a surreal air to the city's iconic skyline. It's a very well traveled duck. Since it started on its global adventures, Rubber Duck has taken up temporary residence in cities all over the world, including Osaka, Sydney, Sao Paolo and Amsterdam. It will be in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour until June 9. For children? Though it may be modeled on a child's toy, this massive public art installation isn't just for kids. ""I see it as an adult thing. It makes you feel young again. It refers to your childhood when there was no stress or economic pressure, no worry about having to pay the rent,"" said Hofman. There were a lot of smiles and laughter as Rubber Duck made its splash but Hofman says he doesn't expect everyone to react with big grins. ""If it makes you smile, then that's OK, but maybe it makes you cry because of the urban environment. I make work not to give answers but to question things,"" said the 36-year-old father of three. Hofman conceived the idea for the project in 2001. Twelve years on his own reaction to Rubber Duck is no longer simple. ""It's getting complex because I have so many thoughts about it and so many minutes of talking and thinking about it,"" he said. He urged everyone who can to get out and enjoy the free public art. ""Be amazed, be creative. Look at it with your eyes and absorb the energy of the work in this location,"" he said. Next stop for Rubber Duck is the United States. The exact destination is a closely guarded secret. ""I can't say, it's confidential,"" said Hoffman. ""In the States it will stay a secret until the last week.""

"(CNN) -- Actor Andrew Koenig, who had been missing since February 14, committed suicide, his father told reporters after his son's body was found Thursday in a park in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""My son took his own life,"" Walter Koenig said at a news conference in the park. The body of the former ""Growing Pains"" star was found by several friends who conducted their own search of Stanley Park, where Andrew Koenig liked to walk, his father said. Koenig, 41, was reported missing by his parents after he did not board a flight to Los Angeles from Vancouver last week. Walter Koenig -- himself an actor, known for his role as Pavel Chekov in the ""Star Trek"" series -- flew to Vancouver with his wife, Judy, on Tuesday to help with the search. ""He was obviously in a lot of pain,"" Walter Koenig said. The Koenigs said they received a letter from their son last week in which he wrote in a ""despondent tone."" He had stopped taking medication for depression about a year ago, his father said. Unknown to his parents at the time, Andrew Koenig sold or gave away many of his possessions and moved out of his apartment in Venice, California, before traveling to Canada, the family said. Walter Koenig was helping the friends ""get another sweep of Stanley Park"" Thursday morning and was nearby when they found his son, he said. Koenig asked others who may be considering suicide ""before you make that final decision, check it out again, and talk to someone."" ""If you're one of those people who can't handle it anymore, you know, if you can learn anything from this, there are people out there who really care,"" he said. ""You may not think so and ultimately it may not be enough, but there are people who really care."" Families of those who are troubled should not ignore the warning signs, he said. ""Don't ignore it, don't rationalize it,"" he said. Andrew Koenig's mother, Judy Koenig, said people who are depressed ""don't realize there is help and they need help."" She said they should ""connect with each other if there's something that's bothering you."" Andrew Koenig had many people who loved him, but ""in his pain, he didn't realize it was available to him,"" she said. Koenig fell in love with Vancouver in 1988 when he first visited to film an episode of the TV show ""21 Jump Street,"" his father said. Koenig appeared in 25 episodes of ""Growing Pains"" from 1985 to 1989, playing Richard ""Boner"" Stabone, according to a filmography posted on the Internet Movie Database Web site. He also appeared in episodes of several other television shows. He was described as ""a gifted and passionate multitalented young man"" on his father's Web site. He performed at The Improv and had roles in movies that included ""NonSeNse,"" ""InAlienable,"" ""The Theory of Everything"" and ""Batman: Dead End."" He also acted on television in ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" ""G.I. Joe,"" ""My Two Dads,"" ""21 Jump Street,"" ""My Sister Sam"" and ""Adam-12,"" the Web site said, and edited, directed, produced and wrote a number of films. Koenig was an activist interested in many causes, his father's Web site says. He was arrested at the Rose Bowl in 2008 while protesting U.S. involvement in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in China. He opposed U.S. participation because of China's support for a repressive regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma, the Web site says.","Andrew Koenig, 41, was a star of '80s sitcom ""Growing Pains""

"Moorland, England (CNN) -- Like a modern-day King Canute, Sam Notaro is determined not to let rising waters flood his home. He lives in Moorland village in Somerset, southwest England, which has been hit hard by weeks of flooding. Streets have turned into rivers, cars are submerged up to their windshields, and homes have been abandoned. But Notaro is a lone holdout. He's created his own flood defense barrier, using a digger to raise a soil embankment topped with heavy clay to act as a seal. So far, it has kept the worst of the waters out of his home, with the help of pumps -- but the question is how long it will hold. ""Like I say, if it rises a meter, I don't know if it will be enough. I don't know,"" he said. He may be the only one left, but he's not without help in his struggle against the elements. Marines -- part of a hundreds-strong military deployment by the UK government -- waded through the waist-high water Tuesday to help bolster his makeshift flood defenses. Notaro appeared stubbornly resolved to continue his battle despite the losing odds. ""We were backed into a corner. It was low so we pushed some soil up, and then you've got to keep going, haven't you?"" he said. King Canute, an 11th-century ruler of England, Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden, by legend went to the seashore and tried to hold back the rising tide -- but failed. In the low-lying Somerset Levels, where some homes have been underwater for weeks, many will know his sense of powerlessness. Dead birds litter beaches . Exceptionally strong winds in western England and Wales on Wednesday may add to people's woes. The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, issued a ""red"" warning, its most serious, saying winds were expected to gust at 80 mph across a wide area and might reach 100 mph in the most exposed parts of west and northwest Wales. After the wettest January in England since 1766, even if the heavy rain stops, ground water levels are so high that it could be weeks before life returns to normal. And Britain is not the only place facing wild weather. Huge waves are crashing onto the Portuguese coast, causing extensive damage, and there are high wind alerts in parts of Ireland, which faces the worst storm yet of the winter. Ireland's western Munster province and the town of Wexford could be buffeted by gusts up to 105 mph Wednesday, the national weather service said. Winter flood warnings have also been issued in parts of Brittany in northwest France. Meanwhile, the beaches of France's Atlantic coast are littered with dead birds, casualties of exhaustion after days of battling relentless wind and rain. The country's League for the Protection of Birds estimates more than 5,000 birds have died, many in the Charente-Maritime, Loire-Atlantique and Vendee areas. 'Money is no object' Some 5,800 properties have flooded in England since the beginning of December. Amid increasing questions over the government's response, Prime Minister David Cameron said Tuesday that ""money is no object"" in the relief effort and promised more troops to help despairing homeowners. ""Britain is facing ... its wettest winter in 2Â½ centuries, and some of the worst flooding in decades,"" he said at a Downing Street news conference. There are still 16 severe flood warnings -- meaning there is danger to life -- in place, most of them in southeast England, as well as hundreds of lower-level flood warnings and flood alerts. And it's not over yet. ""There is absolutely no sign of this threat abating and with further rain and strong winds forecast throughout the week, things may well get worse before they get better,"" Cameron warned. He pledged up to $16 million to help farmers whose fields are underwater and said more troops would be made available. Opposition leader Ed Miliband of the Labour Party told UK media that the flooding was a ""wake-up call"" and that investing in flood defenses had to be a priority for the government. Some of the worst-affected areas in recent days are in the Thames Valley west of London. Well-heeled towns and villages in Surrey and Berkshire, including Wraysbury, Chertsey and Datchet, near Windsor Castle, have been inundated as the Thames has burst its banks on its way downstream to the capital. Sandbags lined the entrances to small businesses and homes in Datchet menaced by the river's murky brown waters. Agency: More flooding to come . More than 1,100 homes have flooded along the Thames Valley in the past two weeks, the Environment Agency said. The agency warned that the towns of Windsor and Maidenhead, as well as communities along the Thames in Surrey, remain at high risk from the river Wednesday and Thursday. ""Significant flooding"" of homes and businesses is expected, it said, with the Thames expected to rise in places to its highest level in more than 60 years. With more rain forecast, water levels farther downstream will potentially rise over the weekend and early next week to the highest levels seen so far, the agency added. The Thames Barrier, which is deployed to prevent the tidal river flooding central London with devastating consequences, has been repeatedly pressed into action in recent weeks. ""The barrier is working very, very hard,"" said Toby Willison, regional director for the Environment Agency. The agency operates the defense system -- which works by stopping high tides coming in when the river level is already high. ""At the moment it's operated 29 times since the beginning of December ... which when you consider it was completed in 1982 and has only opened 154 times since 1982 -- it is operating much more frequently at the moment than it ever has done in the past,"" he said. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moorland, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Max Foster, Jim Boulden and Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva contributed to this report.","NEW: Irish province faces gale-force winds with gusts up to 105 mph, forecasters say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It won't be your imagination if the moon looks bigger and brighter Friday night, like ""a cosmic flood lamp."" NASA says the moon will appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter. Every few years, a full moon coincides with the point in the satellite's elliptical orbit that brings it closest to the center of the Earth. Friday night, the moon will be fully illuminated just four hours after reaching that point, according to a feature story on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Web site. The moon will appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than ""lesser full moons we've seen earlier in 2008,"" NASA says -- provided it is being viewed in a clear sky. At the moon's closest approach -- the orbital perigee -- it is about 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometers) closer to Earth than at the other extreme -- the apogee -- the space agency says. The full moon, as always, will seem largest when it is near the horizon, as it rises and sets, ""but it's really just an optical illusion,"" said NASA spokesman J.D. Harrington. When the moon shines directly overhead, he said, it's hard to tell the difference in size. On its Web site, NASA notes that ""for reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects."" ""If you go outside around midnight,"" NASA says, the moon ""will be close to overhead and act like a cosmic flood lamp."" As the moon goes through its orbit every month, the distance from its center to the center of the Earth averages about 239,000 miles (384,600 kilometers). Friday evening the distance will be about 222,000 miles (357,300 kilometers). An alignment of the full moon and the orbital perigee occurs at most once in 1½  years, and Harrington says this year's phenomena shouldn't be much different from previous ones. The moon's brightness always varies with its distance from Earth, but having the full face of the moon illuminated emphasizes that variation. The close approach of the moon and having the moon, Earth and Sun lined up -- as happens twice a month -- bring higher-than-normal ocean tides, so it is no surprise that having both at once means even higher tides. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the difference will be minimal. In most places the tide will be just an inch or so (a few centimeters) higher than normal ""spring"" tides, those that come with the new or full moon. Some locations might see a difference of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), it says.","Full moon will look bigger, brighter Friday because it is closer to Earth .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey woman accused of driving a van with her three teenage children into a river has been charged with attempted murder, weeks after a Florida woman drove a minivan with her three children into the Atlantic Ocean. Police say Joann Smith, 49, of Florence Township sped off a boat ramp into the Delaware River on Tuesday. She's charged with three counts of attempted murder and three counts of endangering the welfare of children. A man driving on West Front Street in Florence saw the sinking vehicle and ran out to help Smith and her three children, ages 15, 14, and 13, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said. One of the children came away from the capsized van with a cut leg. Smith was checked into a medical facility for evaluation. Her bail was set at $600,000, Florence Township Police Capt. Brian Boldizar said. She will probably have a first appearance in Superior Court in Mount Holly on Thursday afternoon, Burlington County Prosecutor Robert D. Bernardi said. The incident comes after another mother was accused of driving a minivan into the Atlantic Ocean with her three children in Florida on March 4. Ebony Wilkerson was charged with three counts of attempted first-degree murder, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said. He said investigators think she was trying to kill her children -- ages 3, 9 and 10 -- when she drove them into the surf in Daytona Beach. Bystanders and beach rangers rescued the children from the water. Wilkerson tried to keep rescuers from pulling her children from the minivan and fought her son for control of the steering wheel, Johnson said. Johnson said Wilkerson told investigators she was trying to drive out of the surf, not into it, and has denied trying to harm her children.","Police say a New Jersey woman sped off a boat ramp into the Delaware River .

"London (CNN) -- British lawmakers investigating a phone hacking scandal Tuesday asked media baron Rupert Murdoch, his son James and former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks to testify before them, hours after former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused their newspaper group of illegally obtaining private information about him. Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee asked the three to appear in a week, on July 19, a representative told CNN. ""Senior executives"" of Murdoch's British newspaper company ""will cooperate,"" News International said in a statement, without specifying who. If the Murdochs and Brooks do not answer the summons, Parliament can compel them to do so, Labour lawmaker Chris Bryant said on Twitter. He added that he believes he too is a hacking victim. The chairman of the committee, John Whittingdale, told CNN that he has plenty of questions to ask. ""The first thing is that James Murdoch has said he has discovered that Parliament, and that means my committee, was misled by some of the executives who have given us evidence in the past,"" he said. ""So we will obviously want to know who has misled Parliament and what it was they said which was untrue."" Meanwhile, a Downing Street source told CNN the British coalition government will vote in favor of a parliamentary motion by the Labour opposition calling on News Corp. to withdraw its bid for satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Whittingdale predicted any vote would be lopsided, if not unanimous, against the elder Murdoch. ""I would have thought that, if Parliament sends a signal as strong as is likely, he would be very foolish to ignore it."" Officials must first establish who authorized the ""very serious criminal activities"" under scrutiny, Whittingdale said. ""Anybody who was complicit in that, who knew about them, potentially is vulnerable."" The news represents a further threat to Rupert Murdoch's plans to create Britain's largest media company by acquiring the satellite broadcaster. News Corp. has been seeking to buy the 60.9% of the BSkyB shares it does not already own. Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg are among lawmakers who have already urged Murdoch to reconsider the bid. Brown, speaking Tuesday to the BBC about allegations that The Sunday Times illegally obtained private information about him, accused Murdoch's newspapers of having ""links with criminals."" Brown said the paper appeared to have gotten access to his legal files. He said he was ""genuinely shocked"" by its methods. The Sunday Times denied Brown's allegations and said it pursued the story about him in the public interest. ""We were told that Mr. Brown had bought a flat cheaper than any normal valuation and that he obtained it through a company in which Geoffrey Robinson, a close ally, had been a director,"" it said Tuesday in a statement. ""We had reasonable grounds to investigate this matter ... We believe no law was broken in the process of this investigation, and contrary to Mr. Brown's assertion, no criminal was used and the story was published giving all sides a fair hearing."" Brown's allegations, however, widen the scandal that brought down Britain's best-selling newspaper, News of the World, to other newspapers also owned by Murdoch's News International media group. Suspicions that News International would fill the Sunday tabloid gap by publishing its six-day-a-week tabloid The Sun on Sundays were reinforced by the company's acquisition on Monday of the domain name thesunonsunday.co.uk. News International's parent company, News Corporation, announced Tuesday it would buy back $5 billion of its own shares over the coming year, after a fall in its share price since the phone hacking scandal exploded last week. Top Metropolitan Police officers testified before lawmakers Tuesday about their investigation into illegal breaches of privacy by News of the World, following accusations police did not probe deeply enough when they first looked into matter. Assistant Commissioner John Yates, who concluded in 2009 that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation, admitted to the Home Affairs Select Committee that his decision was ""crap."" And he said he believed his own phone had been hacked ""in the period 2005-2006."" He blamed News International for not handing over all the documents they had. But lawmakers hammered his decision. ""Why did you not look at the information that was sitting in bags at Scotland Yard?"" demanded conservative lawmaker Michael Ellis. Yates insisted he had ""never, ever, ever"" received a payment from a journalist, but said it was ""highly probable"" that there were some corrupt officers among the 50,000 in the Metropolitan Police. News International is accused of attempting to bribe police officers for information -- including personal contact details for members of the royal family -- in addition to the violation of privacy allegations. Yates said he did not see Gordon Brown's name on a list of potential hacking victims when he examined the evidence police had in 2009. The accusations that journalists working for News International papers went after Brown were published Monday by rival outlet the Guardian. The Guardian said the tabloid The Sun -- the country's best-selling daily newspaper -- obtained details about Brown's son's health and published a story about him, while people working for the broadsheet Sunday Times tricked the former Labour Party leader's accountants into handing over financial details. Both papers are part of the News International stable. The company denied that The Sun illegally obtained information about Brown's son. ""We are able to assure the Brown family that we did not access the medical records of their son, nor did we commission anyone to do so,"" News International said in a statement. It said its story about Brown's son ""originated from a member of the public whose family has also experienced cystic fibrosis"" and wanted to highlight the plight of those afflicted with the disease. ""The individual has provided a written affidavit this afternoon to a lawyer confirming this,"" the statement said. The efforts to obtain information about Brown and his family dated back some 10 years, and include periods when Brown was prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, according to the Guardian. Brown declined several CNN requests for an interview about the allegations. The latest allegations follow Sunday's closure of the News of the World over other allegations of illegal breach of privacy. The decision to pull the plug on the 168-year-old paper came amid accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities, as well as claims it may have bribed police officers. Police said Thursday they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone-hacking. London's Metropolitan Police Monday angrily blasted leaks from its investigation into illegal eavesdropping by News of the World, shortly after British media reported that the paper tried to bribe royal protection officers to get private phone numbers for members of the royal family. Police said News International had shared information about alleged efforts by reporters to bribe police, and that both sides had agreed to keep the information confidential. Police said they were ""extremely concerned and disappointed"" at the leaks, which they said ""could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation."" Police, the royal family and News International all refused to answer CNN questions about allegations that a reporter sought company money to pay a royal protection officer for the confidential details about the royal family. The controversy over phone hacking has continued despite the shuttering of News of the World. Murdoch has not apologized to the family of a murdered British teenage girl whose phone messages were illegally intercepted, a lawyer for 13-year-old murder victim Milly Dowler's family said Monday. Brooks has been promoted to chief executive of News International, and Murdoch has stood by her. Murdoch flew Sunday to London, hours after the final edition of News of the World hit the stands. The publication was the first British national paper Murdoch bought, in 1969, as he began to propel himself from Australian newspaper proprietor to international media magnate. With its closure, News International now owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corporation also encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. CNN's Jim Boulden, Andy Carey and Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Anybody who was complicit ... potentially is vulnerable,"" panel head says .

"(CNN) -- When the American Legion calls for Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gen. Eric Shinseki to resign, you know something is profoundly wrong. In a statement entitled ""Shinseki Must Go,""' Daniel Dellinger, national commander of the American Legion, said, ""His record as the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs ... tells a story of bureaucratic incompetence and failed leadership."" ""The disturbing reports coming from the Phoenix VA Medical Center are just one of what appears to be a pattern of scandals that have infected the entire system,"" Dellinger continued. ""It has been more than 20 years since the American Legion has called for the resignation of a public official. It's not something we do lightly. We do this because of people who have been failed by the system."" Note the key charge: ""A pattern of scandals that have infected the entire system."" This is an historic opportunity for Congress to look beyond personality and scapegoating and to take seriously the potential for a ""breakout"" that would replace the current breakdown with a new Veterans Administration capable of serving today's veterans with modern technologies and standards. Congress should start by looking at institutions that handle people and information effectively, accurately and with great accountability. The next time you make an airline or hotel reservation, ask why the Veterans Administration can't be that customer-friendly. The next time you use your smartphone, ask why there isn't a ""veterans app"" that makes it easier for our veterans to keep track of their VA appointments, records, diagnoses, etc. The next time you use an ATM machine to get cash in less than 11 seconds, ask why it can take 175 days to transfer a veteran from the Defense Department to the Veterans Administration. In contrast to the modern systems we deal with on a daily basis, the VA bureaucracy is a disaster. A former chief of staff of the Army, Gen. Edward ""Shy"" Meyer used to have a saying about large organizations: ""They are all lakes of mediocrity dotted by islands of excellence."" Today even this is too generous a description of what modern bureaucracy has become. In many federal agencies, we have islands of corruption rising from a sea of incompetence. Few parts of the federal government exemplify both types of terrain so well as the Department of Veterans Affairs. As Dellinger's call for Shinseki to resign indicates, stories of corruption and incompetence -- potentially criminal conduct -- at the VA have become so common that they outrage but no longer surprise. Several weeks ago, I wrote about a former VA employee's allegation that agency employees in Los Angeles intentionally destroyed veterans' medical records to eliminate the shameful backlog of patients waiting for appointments -- many of them for months or even years. CNN recently followed that report of fraud with an infuriating story of its own, the story to which the American Legion commander referred about the misconduct of VA officials in Phoenix. The report described allegations that these bureaucrats conspired to hide their backlog from superiors in Washington by maintaining a secret waiting list of hundreds or even thousands of veterans who waited months for care before the VA entered those patients into its computer system once it was able to schedule an appointment. And in March, the Daily Caller reported that top-level managers in Mississippi remained in their positions despite a special counsel's report of wrongdoing, including a whistleblower's allegation that patients were prescribed narcotics without seeing a doctor. Note that in each of these cases, the general incompetence and mismanagement at the VA is so severe that engaging in potentially criminal conduct appears to all involved to be a preferable system -- until someone finds out about it, that is. Some of the corrupt officials engage in outright theft. In February, a former VA medical center director in Ohio pleaded guilty to 64 charges. His crimes, according to the The Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland, included ""money laundering, wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiring to defraud the VA through bribery and kickback schemes in which he accepted tens of thousands of dollars from contractors in exchange for inside information."" In fact, if you want to see how bad the corruption at the VA is, just take a look at the list of press releases on the VA Inspector General's website. There are many headlines such as ""Former VA Employee Pleads Guilty to Theft of Government Funds,"" ""Former VA Claims Examiner Pleads Guilty to Theft, Mail Fraud and Money Laundering,"" and ""Veterans' Benefit Fiduciary and Former U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Employee Plead Guilty to Embezzling Nearly $900,000."" The VA doesn't need to employ criminals to lose large sums of money, however. It's capable of losing taxpayer funds all on its own through sheer incompetence. As of February, there were 400,000 disability claims considered ""backlogged."" That is, they've been in processing for more than 125 days. As one veteran of combat in Afghanistan told us, ""Appointments are so far back it's ridiculous and claims are even further behind. ... You can definitely get an appointment -- it's just going to be three to six months down the road."" To fix this mess, the VA created a new program, the Veterans Benefits Management System. But as the Washington Examiner describes a new report by the department's Inspector General, ""Poor planning, slow software and cost overruns raise the spectre that the $500 million electronic document system being deployed by the Department of Veterans Affairs will not break the months-long delays to process disability compensation claims."" The computer system started out flawed as millions of dollars were spent to scan files ""without a clear plan,"" the result being that users had to ""wade through hundreds of pages of electronic documents, sometimes for hours, to find the information they needed."" And it still takes employees longer to create a claim in the new system, which reportedly crashes on a regular basis, than it did in the old one. We probably should not be surprised at this money being spent to build systems that work just as poorly as the ones they replace. The VA and Defense Department have spent $1.3 billion over the past four years attempting unsuccessfully to develop a single system for electronic health records. This record of corruption and incompetence is nothing to be proud of, and certainly nothing to reward. In fact, it's intolerable. Senior VA officials, however, are not only keeping their jobs but are receiving bonuses. From 2007 to 2011, the bureaucrats in charge of the VA distributed nearly $17 million in ""extra compensation"" to senior officials at a time when hundreds of thousands of veterans' claims were backlogged. At a facility in Pittsburgh, employees were given bonuses despite the fact that 29 veterans contracted Legionnaires' disease, five of whom died. With 13 years of continuous war behind us and an aging population of veterans from previous wars, the workload at the VA is only going to increase. This is not a temporary problem, and our veterans are not just going to disappear. In fact, as time goes on, there will likely be more of a demand for care since issues such as PTSD sometimes do not manifest themselves until years later. In a big bureaucracy, people are promised comfortable jobs; it's difficult to fire them, and they are typically not held to any real performance standards. This breeds an environment favoring incompetence and corruption. We cannot allow this kind of behavior to undermine those VA employees, some of whom are veterans themselves, who are working hard to help. And we cannot allow employees who are trying to do the right thing to be dominated and corrupted by incompetent leadership. We have to fix it, and that has to start by holding officials responsible for doing their jobs. As House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller has said, ""What's missing from the equation is not money or manpower, it's accountability."" Miller has proposed a bill that would make it easier to fire employees for poor performance, and Sen. Marco Rubio has offered a companion bill that would eliminate some of the red tape designed to make it impossible to fire public employees. Replacing the department's senior leadership would be a start. But in fact, the entire VA model needs to be replaced. The current system is an obsolete, paper-based bureaucracy incapable of serving America's veterans. A truly modern VA would be digital, mobile, virtual and personal. We owe it to our veterans to get the replacement right.","American Legion has called for VA secretary to quit after recent scandals .

"(CNN) -- British royal watchers are in a tizzy over comments reportedly made by Prince Charles comparing Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler. According to the Daily Mail newspaper, a woman claims Charles made the offhand comment during a tour Monday of the Canadian Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was talking with a 78-year Polish woman who escaped the Nazi Holocaust by sailing to Canada in 1939 -- just before Germany seized the city of Gdansk, the newspaper said. ""I had finished showing him the exhibit and talked with him about my own family background and how I came to Canada,"" the newspaper quoted Marienne Ferguson as saying. ""The prince then said, 'And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler,' "" the newspaper quoted her as saying, referring to Russia's disputed annexation of Crimea. Ferguson said she agreed with Charles. ""I must say that I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do,"" Ferguson said. ""I was very surprised that he made the comment as I know they aren't meant to say these things but it was very heartfelt and honest."" CNN could not independently confirm the conversation early Wednesday. Representatives for Prince Charles declined to comment. ""However, we would like to stress that the Prince of Wales would not seek to make a public political statement during a private conversation,"" Clarence House said in a statement. In the British system, the queen is head of state, but foreign policy is set by the elected government. As heir to the throne, it would be considered unusual for Charles to make such a statement. So far, there's been no response from Russia. Britain's The Guardian newspaper reported a Putin spokesman declined to comment when approached by reporters. On Twitter, British member of Parliament Mike Gapes criticized Charles. ""In constitutional monarchy policy and diplomacy should be conducted by parliament and government,"" he wrote. ""Monarchy should be seen and not heard."" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, however, defended Charles to the BBC -- saying the conversation was clearly private. ""I have never been of this view that if you are a member of the royal family somehow you have to enter into some Trappist vow of silence,"" the BBC quoted him as saying. Some view such comparisons as inflammatory given the tense state of relations in Europe over Russia's actions in Ukraine. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton garnered some criticism in March when she made a similar comparison. For others, such comparisons may dredge up the painful history of Western Europe's unsuccessful efforts to contain Hitler in the 1930s. In 1938, Hitler annexed Austria over meek European objections, then supervised Germany's takover of the Sudetenland under the pretext of protecting the Czechoslovakian region's large ethnic German population. Similar issues were raised before Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. The failures of Western European governments to stop the German advances under what was then known as the policy of ""appeasement"" have been endlessly debated by historians considering the impact of Hitler's early moves on the bloody and brutal years that followed.

"(CNN) -- In the current nationwide series of Veterans Administration scandals, the real focus has to be on rethinking the system that is failing to serve our veterans and their families. I strongly favor Secretary Eric Shinseki resigning or being fired. He has clearly failed to lead and manage this vast bureaucracy. There are too many problems in too many places for him to remain as secretary. No one should believe, however, that simply replacing the secretary with a new person will solve the Veterans Administration's problems. Scapegoating one or even a team of senior leaders will produce only marginal results and ultimately be drowned out by an enormous bureaucracy. The real challenges in developing a 21st century Veterans Administration are challenges of systemic reform that go far beyond any single person or even a new senior leadership team. The VA is a classic example of the principle W. Edwards Deming, the father of the quality movement, was trying to communicate with his red bead experiment. Deming had a bin full of mixed red and white beads. The goal was for workers to obtain only white beads, but he required them to scoop a random assortment blindly from the bin. Of course, they always came up with red beads as well as white beads. The experiment illustrated the point that organizations fail when the systems are bad, even if the workers are willing. Trying to fix the VA by replacing the secretary but not the whole system is like trying to obtain white beads by replacing the person dipping blindly into the bin. In private industry, businesses have used information and communications technologies to create highly reliable, efficient, personalized, and instantaneous new systems. The ATM is a good example. Anywhere in the world you can walk up to an ATM, stick in your card, and within seconds get cash from your bank account. There is no bank teller involved. There are no business hours involved. At most banks even deposit slips are a thing of the past. Government bureaucracies like the VA have seen little innovation. In many cases they have gotten worse as more layers of bureaucracy grow on top of the existing systems. The VA may be the best place to start applying breakout thinking because of the scale of its bureaucracy and the scale of its problems. The VA workforce is larger than the Marine Corps. More than 314,000 work full time for the VA compared to 202,000 in the Marine Corps (potentially shrinking to 150,000--at which point there would be half as many Marines as VA bureaucrats). The VA treats some six million veterans a year at more than 1,400 different sites including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, etc. In 2013 there were nearly nine million veterans enrolled -- or better than one out of every three veterans in the United States. Just the size of the VA training system is enormous. According to the VA, it helps train 90,000 health professionals every year in its medical centers. Over 50 percent of all American physicians have had some training in the VA system. The scale of VA bureaucracy has grown dramatically. Between 2006 and 2013, the number of full-time employees jumped more than 40 percent, from 220,000 to 314,000. Yet with 94,000 additional government employees, the system has not been able to match the private sector's standard of care. Consider the issue of waiting times for treatments. The national average waiting time in an emergency room is 26 minutes. At VA facilities, veterans wait twice that time on average and that understates the problem in especially mismanaged sites. The Washington Times reports: . ""A recent inspector general investigation of a VA facility in Las Vegas found that up to 25 percent of patients experienced a length of stay of more than six hours on all but one of the days in a week monitored... ""During a 2011 investigation, the watchdog found that a majority of ER patients had an average length of stay exceeding nine hours at a facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and roughly 27 percent of veterans spent over six hours in the emergency room."" This means that one out of four veterans in those sites was experiencing a wait more than 12 times longer than the national average. That is a systems problem, not a scapegoat problem. Simply firing a couple of managers without replacing systems, structures and culture will not solve systemic problems. Waiting times are just the tip of an extraordinarily large iceberg. This map shows the serious problems at VA centers around the country. We are finding new issues to add to the map every day. Compounding the VA challenge is the fact that it has to be considered in combination with the Department of Defense's Military Health System, which serves nearly 10 million people at a cost of more than $50 billion a year. Every effort to integrate Department of Defense and VA medical record systems has failed. The result has been an absurd process of transitioning from active duty health services to VA health services. At a time when you can instantly make airline and hotel reservations or get money from an ATM worldwide in seconds, it takes 175 days to transition a veteran's care from the Defense Department to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The DoD and VA spent $1.3 billion to build a joint electronic medical record system for their health care services before the two secretaries announced in February that they were abandoning the effort. This is on top of the over $2 billion the Defense Department has spent on a failed upgrade to its own electronic medical system. In other words, even though military health costs are growing rapidly and taking up more and more of the DoD budget, the Department is failing to modernize its system and to integrate it with the VA. But this is where the solution for the MHS and the VA must begin. Sadly, this dysfunction is not new. Anyone upset at today's Veterans Administration should consider the founding of the Veterans Bureau in 1921 and take comfort that the admittedly appalling corruption or mismanagement we see today pales in comparison to that which marked the first two years of the original Veterans Bureau. The first director, Charles Forbes, hired tens of thousands of bureaucrats. Many were cronies or patronage positions. They did such a bad job that fewer than 50,000 veterans were getting help out of more than 200,000 wounded veterans from World War I. Forbes stole hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money . As the scandal broke, President Harding summoned Forbes to the White House and ""took him by the neck and shook Forbes 'as a dog would a rat,'"" as Amity Shlaes writes in her book ""Coolidge,"" ending the tenure of the first director of the modern Veterans Administration. Appropriately, Forbes wound up in jail for this corruption. We can take some comfort that for all its current problems the system is vastly more honest and accountable than it was in 1921. Now we have to have the courage to develop a system worthy of our veterans, our active duty military and their families for 2021 and beyond.","Newt Gingrich: VA secretary should quit, but replacing him isn't the solution .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 22 people were killed and 38 others injured in a blast at an army checkpoint in the northern Pakistani city of Bannu on Sunday, intelligence officials said. The blast struck an army convoy traveling from Bannu to Miranshah, the officials said. The convoy included both military and civilian vehicles. According to the intelligence officials, an improvised explosive device had been planted in an 18-seater van. The majority of those killed were passengers on that van. In the wake of the attack, which he strongly condemned, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he was canceling a planned trip to Davos, Switzerland. The World Economic Forum starts there Wednesday. ""Our nation is united against extremism and terrorism and the sacrifices rendered by our citizens and personnel of law enforcing agencies will not go in vain,"" Sharif said, in a statement from his office. Pakistani Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan also condemned Sunday's attack and has sought an explanation about the hiring of the private vehicles used in the convoy. The main Pakistani Taliban faction, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the blast. ""The bombing was carried out to (avenge) the killing of Maulana Waliur Rehman, commander of TTP South Waziristan, who was killed on May 29, 2013, in a U.S. drone strike in Miranshah,"" TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said. It's not the first attack carried out by the TTP to avenge Waliur Rehman's death. Gunmen opened fire at the base of one of Pakistan's highest peaks in June 2013, killing 11 people -- 10 tourists and a local guide. Taliban 'conducive to talks' Despite the violence, the TTP on Sunday called for fresh talks with the Pakistani government, in a news conference recorded by its media wing. Senior leader Azam Tariq, appearing alongside spokesman Shahidullah Shahid, claimed that the TTP has ""always been conducive to talks but that the media has been twisting the TTP's stance in a negative light."" The pair said that continuing talks was ""not in the hands of the TTP but in that of the Pakistani government."" ""It is the Pakistani government on the order of the United States that started the war on the homes of the TTP and it is only the Pakistani government that can stop this war,"" said Tariq. ""It is in the hands of the government to create an environment where talks can take place."" Tariq also said that the authorities were ""using the media as a medium of propaganda for their war."" The Taliban have stepped up attacks on news outlets in Pakistan. On Friday, a targeted attack on a local channel's digital satellite newsgathering vehicle left three employees dead.

"(CNN) -- They may have just been sanctioned by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play rules but Paris Saint-Germain is showing no sign of putting away the checkbook. The French champions announced an agreement has been reached with Chelsea late Friday to sign Brazil international defender David Luiz subject to the player passing a medical and agreeing personal terms. Neither club confirmed the extent of the fee agreed although reports earlier in the day had suggested a figure in the region of Â£40 million ($67 million) was likely. ""Paris Saint Germain, Chelsea and David Luiz would like to confirm that they reached an agreement regarding the terms of an upcoming transfer of the Brazilian defender that would occur during the next transfer window which is due to start on 10th June 2014,"" read a statement released by PSG. ""In accordance with the player's wish to prepare for and play in the World Cup in his home country in the best possible conditions, both clubs and David Luiz wished to reach an agreement as soon as possible."" If the $67 million fee reported is correct it will make Luiz the most expensive defender ever, overtaking the $57 million PSG paid to sign Thiago Silva from AC Milan in 2012. How the Parisians aim to incorporate the deal into their commitments to comply with UEFA's new financial regulations remains unclear, however. Selling players or increasing revenues is a possibility but president Nasser al-Khelaifi has publicly stated his intention to continue to invest in the team. PSG were sanctioned last week along with English champions Manchester City for breaking FFP rules which aim to stop clubs getting into unmanageable debt or allow wealthy benefactors to give top teams and unfair advantage. Backed by the Qatar Investment Authority, PSG have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on some of the world's best players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edison Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi in recent years. The club claimed any losses incurred on these transfers was wiped out with a huge and back-dated sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourist Authority but UEFA concluded that although this deal was valid it was heavily overvalued. As a result, PSG were found to have exceeded the permitted losses of $62 million over the course of the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons and accepted a fine of $83 million and a squad capped at 21 players rather than the usual 25 for next season's Champions League campaign.","PSG agree deal to sign David Luiz from Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Mitch McConnell trounced his tea party-backed opponent in Kentucky's Republican primary, leading a quartet of establishment GOP candidates to victories around the country Tuesday. After an expensive and bitter campaign, the Senate minority leader led defeated challenger Matt Bevin 60%-36%, with 97% of precincts reporting, according to numbers compiled by The Associated Press. In addition to Kentucky, more moderate candidates won in Republican Senate primaries in Georgia and Oregon and in a House showdown in Idaho. And the results in Kentucky, Georgia and Oregon could improve the GOP's chances of taking back control of the Senate come November's midterm elections. Democrats hold a 55-45 voting majority in the Senate. They're defending 21 of the 36 seats in play, half of them in Republican-leaning states or states where the two parties have similar levels of support. The only states where the Democrats hope to play offense are Kentucky and Georgia. If the GOP flips six Democratic held seats, they will win control of the Senate and McConnell will get a promotion from minority leader to majority leader. ""We can take the reins of power away from Harry Reid and make this President accountable,"" McConnell said in his victory speech. ""Make me the majority leader, and Kentucky will lead America."" How McConnell crushed the tea party . Here are rundowns in the other state races: . Georgia: Republican businessman David Perdue will face Rep. Jack Kingston in a runoff in July. Perdue got 30% of the vote; Kingston received 27%, according to numbers complied by The Associated Press. Perdue and Kingston beat out a trio of more conservative candidates in the GOP primary. Among Democrats, Michelle Nunn easily won in her bid to follow in the footsteps of her father, longtime Sen. Sam Nunn. Oregon: Sen. Jeff Merkley easily won the Democratic primary, and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby is the projected winner of the GOP Senate primary, topping a more conservative rival. Idaho: Rep. Mike Simpson won the GOP primary in the state's 2nd Congressional District, defeating tea party candidate Bryan Smith. 5 key primaries to watch Tuesday . Ugly and expensive race . Bevin, a businessman from Louisville, announced last summer he would challenge McConnell. He quickly gained the support of tea party activists and some influential Washington-based anti-establishment groups. The race between the two men quickly turned ugly, and expensive, as both campaigns and outside groups spent big bucks. The Senate Conservatives Fund dished out $1 million to support Bevin. But the group recently fell quiet with McConnell's formidable lead in public opinion polls. McConnell had a large campaign war chest, as well as backing from two Kentucky-based super PACs, and such powerful national groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association. Calls for unity . Soon after the race in Kentucky was called for McConnell, two of the groups backing Bevin -- the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Madison Project -- closed ranks behind the Senate minority leader. ""Now it's time for Republicans to unite for victory in November,"" said a statement from the Senate Conservatives Fund. McConnell now faces a much tougher test against Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. Grimes, considered a rising Democratic star, faced no real opposition in her primary and already has had big names -- such as former President Bill Clinton -- team up with her on the campaign trail. Grimes connected to big donors, big hitters . Speaking to supporters who held up signs that read ""Obama needs Alison Grimes"" and ""Kentucky needs Mitch McConnell,"" McConnell previewed his primary election theme: tying his opponent to President Obama, who lost Kentucky big in 2012 and is highly unpopular there now. ""My opponent is in this race because Barack Obama and Harry Reid want her to be in this race,"" said McConnell, adding that ""a vote for my opponent is a vote for Obamacare and the President who sold it to us on a mountain of lies."" The pro-McConnell outside group Kentuckians for Strong Leadership said they would spend nearly $600,000 starting Wednesday to run a television commercial that ties Grimes to Obama. Grimes, who spoke at her victory celebration just minutes after McConnell's speech ended, fired back. ""I'm here to tell you tonight, my fellow Kentuckians, I am not an empty dress, I am not a rubber stamp and I am not a cheerleader. I am a strong Kentucky woman who is an independent thinker who, when I'm Kentucky's next senator, the decisions I make will be what's best for the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, not partisan interests,"" Grimes declared. She's expected to use McConnell's GOP leader status and his frequent moves to block legislation to make him the symbol of gridlock in Washington. The most recent polling indicates the two candidates are all tied up. When all's said and done, the race could become the most expensive Senate campaign in history, breaking the $82 million record set in the 2012 Senate battle in Massachusetts. Key races to watch .

"(CNN) -- We've seen this dynamic before: A mundane and wonky issue that many have never heard of suddenly elevates to national prominence. Remember the debt ceiling and that it was mostly an unknown quantity five years ago? This time it's renewing the authority of this thing called the Export-Import Bank to do business. The obscure independent agency provides loan guarantees to foreign companies struggling to secure financing to purchase goods from American manufacturers. But much of its financing goes to aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing and costs taxpayers about $200 million per year, which critics contend wastes money and skews private markets. The agency's authority to make loans expires September 30 and Congress is now tasked with deciding once again whether to renew it. Is this government agency worth saving? But it also is the latest battle emerging within the Republican Party, once again pitting the establishment against the tea party. Michael Needham, CEO of Heritage Action, the political arm of a similarly named conservative think tank and leading opponent, said the Ex-Im Bank is, ""the purist form of corporate cronyism that exists in Washington, D.C."" On the other side of the debate is Christopher Wenk, senior director for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents business interests in the capital. Wenk said the bank's demise would cost 200,000 jobs and that the chamber's members nationwide are ""scratching their heads about why this is such a big deal in Washington."" The agency has been in place for nearly 80 years. Congress reauthorized it in 2012, passing overwhelmingly despite some noisy Republican opposition. There was no Republican pushback to its previous reauthorization. Why the controversy now? With the rise of the tea party in 2010 and the resulting influx of lawmakers fiercely opposed to more government spending, the issue had the means to gain some traction. Needham said his organization devoted time and resources to lobby against and were ""excited"" to see 93 House members and 20 senators oppose it the last time around. Heritage and other conservative groups, including Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, have now had two years to gin up a coalition and pressure Congress. In addition, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, a fierce opponent of the bank, was elected to lead the committee that oversees it, helping to raise the profile of opponents. The bank has long had critics, but nothing has risen to the level where Congress might try to shut it down. The bank has been involved in numerous lawsuits, including by Delta Air Lines and related groups who contend its lending practices boost foreign competitors through aircraft sales. Delta flies worldwide. Environmental groups have also launched court challenges, opposing the bank's heavy backing of fossil fuels. In a campaign address about cutting government waste, candidate Barack Obama called the Ex-Im Bank ""corporate welfare."" In the 1980s, William H. Becker and William M. McClenahan wrote in their book ""The Market, the State and the Export-Import Bank"" that President Ronald Reagan was ""initially unsympathetic"" as opposition from the left and the right rose. But neither Reagan nor Obama tried to dissolve it. Obama now supports it and asked Congress to raise its borrowing cap and extend its authority for five years. The politics . It's also an election year and the issue was elevated last week because the newly elected House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, flipped his position and came out in opposition, emboldening the more conservative wing of the party. No. 2 Republican hates Export-Import bank . His shift comes after his predecessor, Ex-Im Bank supporter and outgoing majority leader, Eric Cantor, lost his primary to Dave Brat, who campaigned against corporate welfare. While the Chamber of Commerce and tea party-linked groups have been battling it out in Republican primaries, this issue is adding to the feud. ""Some see it as a prime opportunity to make a political statement,"" Wenk said. ""That's' one of my biggest beefs right now."" Neither Heritage nor the Chamber of Commerce would discuss their political strategy, but both said that using this issue in campaigns is very likely.","The Export-Import Bank is up for reauthorization .
Conservatives oppose the 80-year-old institution .
Supporters say its demise would cost U.S. jobs .

"(CNN) -- Hackers repeatedly attacked the Web site of Australia's largest film festival Saturday, asking organizers to apologize to the Chinese people for planning to screen a documentary on an exiled Uyghur leader. Uighur democracy leader Rebiya Kadeer waits to speak about the unrest in Xinjiang in Washington. The attacks were carried out on the opening day of the Melbourne International Film Festival -- in what organizers are calling the third phase of a ""concerted campaign"" to withdraw the film ""The 10 Conditions of Love."" The documentary examines the impact on the family of activist Rebiya Kadeer as she fights for greater autonomy of the ethnic minority group, the Uyghurs, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China's northwest. Kadeer is the president of the World Uyghur Congress, made up of exiled Uyghurs. China accuses the group of inciting riots in the region this month that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 1,000. ""The first stage was the local Chinese embassy asking us to withdraw the film,"" festival director Richard Moore said Sunday. ""The second was to find a way for other Chinese films to withdraw from the festival -- five did so. We believe that this is probably not the end of it."" Organizers have also been ""bombarded"" with threatening e-mails, Moore said.  Watch Moore discuss the harassment » . ""I couldn't repeat the language even if I tried,"" he said. ""Lots of f-words and c-words, calling us racists, haters of Chinese people."" The first attacks came soon after the festival opened Saturday. Several others followed throughout the day. In one, visitors to the site were greeted with a pop-up message that said: ""We like film but we hate Rebiya Kadeer."" The message was accompanied by a Chinese flag and ended with: ""Please apologize to all the Chinese people."" That attack was traced to an IT professional in Shanghai, China, Moore said. ""He admitted hacking the site. He said he was acting as a private citizen and was protesting the film,"" he said. Authorities are investigating the source of the other attacks, but they appeared to be from different sources. ""We're managing to plug leaks as fast as we can,"" Moore said. The first screening of the documentary takes place Sunday night. The filmmakers have invited Kadeer to attend another screening, scheduled for early August. ""Every year, there's some level of controversy, from pro-life or anti-death (penalty) sort of position. We've never had an incident of an international scale before,"" Moore said. ""The timing has absolutely been a critical one."" The rioting in the Xinjiang region earlier this month stemmed from a brawl between Uyghur and Han workers at a toy factory in another part of China. Han make up the majority population in China -- and many Uyghurs resent the presence of Han in Xinjiang, many of whom came looking for work. Two Uyghurs reportedly died in the toy factory brawl. To protest the deaths, Uyghurs took to the streets in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi -- and fighting broke out between the two sides, with deadly results.","Attacks occur on the opening day of the Melbourne International Film Festival .

"(CNN) -- Loretta Fuddy, the Hawaii official who confirmed the authenticity of President Obama's birth record in Hawaii, died Wednesday night in a small-plane crash. The aircraft, with nine passengers on board, crashed into the ocean about a mile off Kalaupapa, Molokai, on Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The other eight people survived, Petty Officer Stephen Woodbury said. One person swam ashore, a Maui Fire Department helicopter picked up four, and a Coast Guard helicopter rescued three. Fuddy was director of the state's health department. ""Our hearts are broken,"" Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a prepared statement. ""Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii. Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience.""

""I have seen the original records filed at the Department of Health and attest to the authenticity of the certified copies the department provided to the President that further prove the fact that he was born in Hawaii,"" she said at the time. A biography at hawaiihealthconnector.com said she was a recognized leader in the public health field and won numerous awards for her work. Her hobbies included singing in a church choir, ""enjoying her cat Flint, and spending time with her grand nieces and nephews.""","Loretta Fuddy died Wednesday night in a crash about a mile off Kalaupapa, Molokai .

"(CNN) -- Peter Trimble found his formula through trial and error. A design student at the University of Edinburgh, he was aiming to produce an artistic exhibition for a module on sustainability, when he stumbled on ""Dupe,"" a living alternative to concrete. A lab technician introduced Trimble to Sporosarcina pasteurii, a bacterium with binding qualities, sometimes used to solidify soil to hold road signs in place. The student tested it with one of the world's most abundant resources - sand. Pumping bacterial solution into a sand-filled mould, he added nutrients, urea derived from urine as fertilizer and calcium. After a year, and hundreds of failed experiments, this process manufactured a stool around 70% the compression strength of concrete. The process requires less than one-sixth of the energy used in concrete production, and is completely biodegradable. Crucially, Trimble believes his mechanism has the added benefit that it could be employed by anyone, anywhere. ""Once you have the basic framework it should be transferable. Imagine a Tsunami-hit farm in Indonesia that is not getting supplies. You could use sand and bacteria on site, practically free, and have shelter housing that is far more permanent."" Trimble is working with NGOs to apply Dupe to Aboriginal settlements and insecure regions of Morocco. But while the applications are new and experimental, the concept of growing the material for our built environment is increasingly regarded as not merely interesting, but essential. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the construction industry accounts for 40% of the world's C02 emissions, 40% of U.S. landfill and has been uniquely resistant to change. Concrete, bricks and cement have remained the dominant materials since the industrial revolution in the early 19th century, and as pressure mounts on resources and climate, scientists and architects are looking to the natural world for solutions. Building bacteria . Bacteria have been at the center of alternative methods. North Carolina start-up Biomason is growing bricks on an industrial scale, cultivated from sand by microorganisms. The company has won major prizes and funding for the bricks, which will be used in a structure for the first time this year in a pedestrian walkway, ahead of building projects across the world. Similar processes are being developed to build in the most challenging environments. British architects see an opportunity to cultivate new life in deserts, while NASA believe bacteria could allow the construction of bases on other planets without the headache of ferrying the material there. While bacterial processes save heavily on carbon, there are concerns that by-products could be poisonous. But another living brick -- made from mushrooms -- has no such problems. Functional fungus . New York firm Ecovative are producing materials that combine agricultural waste products such as corn stock with mushroom mycelium -- the roots of the vegetable. Over five days the mycelium binds the waste to create a block with a stronger compressive strength than concrete, with none of the heat or energy required by regular bricks. The product is in commercial use for packaging, producing thousands of units a month, and the company is expanding into construction. Ecovative believe that in addition to being renewable and decomposable, natural properties give them a performance advantage. ""It has great insulation properties"", says Sam Harrington, Ecovative Director of Sustainability. ""A key benefit is flame resistance -- without adding any chemicals we were able to achieve a Class A fire rating"". There is scope for development. Mycelium effectively dies once its growth is complete, but Harrington is looking ahead to material that does not. ""We are exploring ideas of living materials, perhaps that are self-healing or respond to leaks with indicators."" Ecovative are in dialogue with major construction companies, and the material will soon be tested on a historic scale. A collaboration with architects The Living won the prestigious MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) PS-1 competition, and their creation will be installed in the museum courtyard this summer. Growing for gold . ""Hy-Fi"" will be the largest ever grown structure, and first large building to claim zero carbon emissions. It will be formed of three 40-foot spiral towers constructed from the mushroom material, with varying properties of brick to maximise light and ventilation. The material's versatility offers unique design opportunities, says David Benjamin, lead architect of the project. ""You can dial in almost any performance you want. You can mix and match a variety of properties such as water resistance or UV resistance, lightness or durability. You can grow the bricks in almost any shape"" Benjamin says the bio-bricks could be made to last as long as traditional materials, but believes architecture must embrace temporary structures. ""It's essential to recognize that not all materials should last for centuries. A lot of the steel in our buildings will last longer than we need. Our idea is a building that be made locally and quickly, and then have a plan for when the life of the building is over."" Future applications would include pop-up stores, festival ""tents"" and emergency shelters, says Benjamin, but there are greater hopes for the material within the industry. Stronger than concrete . ""I could imagine every structure you would built out of bricks"", says Dirk Hebel, Assistant Professor of Architecture and Construction at the Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore. ""No high-rises, but smaller scale structures and houses. The material is stronger than concrete, with better insulation capacities"". The challenge will come in commercializing the products, Hebel feels. ""There is huge demand for alternative materials. The question is how easy it is to penetrate the existing market. This needs time and a couple of buildings to show the possibilities"". Stealing from nature . Another, more radical approach takes the material from nature but also allows it to build the structure. Michael Pawlyn, director of Exploration Architecture, is a leading figure in biomimicry, having previously applied natural processes to create man-made forests in England and the Sahara Desert. His latest project to grow a ""small venue for spoken word performances"" from undersea biorock was recently unveiled at the Architecture Foundation in London. ""In biology, complex structures achieve resource efficiency by putting things in exactly the right place, which is very difficult with made materials"", says Pawlyn. ""Our ways should deliver significant resource savings."" Drawing on the natural accumulation of coral reefs, his team would install a steel frame in the deep ocean and leave it to attract material. Growth would be focused on specific areas of need using an electrical current. ""We're interested in looking at its structural growth patterns. We have stress gauges on the structure to measure force in particular areas. If one is highly stressed, we can input more current so the rate of deposition matches the force."" Pawlyn believes the structure could be built within two years, for consideration at scale. As with Ecovative, a key challenge ahead is to integrate still-living material to allow intelligent biosensors that respond to the building occupants. Innovators in this space acknowledge the ongoing barriers presented in an industry that has resisted modernization. But from rock to fungus, sand to space dust, the use of materials and processes designed by nature herself offer both a solution to the sustainability crisis, and a glimpse of our new built environment: clean, efficient, and alive.

"(CNN) -- Just 12 years after the arrival of the 6 billionth individual on the planet in 1999, humanity will greet the 7 billionth arrival this month. The world population continues its rapid ascent, with roughly 75 million more births than deaths each year. The consequences of a world crowded with 7 billion people are enormous. And unless the world population stabilizes during the 21st century, the consequences for humanity could be grim. A rising population puts enormous pressures on a planet already plunging into environmental catastrophe. Providing food, clothing, shelter, and energy for 7 billion people is a task of startling complexity. The world's agricultural systems are already dangerously overstretched. Rainforests are being cut down to make way for new farms; groundwater used for irrigation is being depleted; greenhouse gases emitted from agricultural activities are a major factor in global climate change; fertilizers are poisoning estuaries; and countless species are threatened with extinction as we grab their land and water and destroy their habitats. The economic challenges are equally huge. Population is growing most rapidly in the world's poorest countries -- often the places with the most fragile ecological conditions. Poor people tend to have many more children, for several reasons. Many live on farms, where children can be engaged in farm chores. Poor societies generally suffer from high rates of child mortality, leading parents to have more children as ""insurance"" against the possible deaths of children. Girls rarely make it to high school, and are often married at a very young age, leading to early childbearing. And modern methods of contraception may be unavailable or unaffordable. When poor families have six or eight children, many or most of them are virtually condemned to a lifetime of poverty. Too often, parents lack the wherewithal to provide decent nutrition, health care and education to most of them. Illiteracy and ill health end up being passed from generation to generation. Governments in poor countries are unable to keep up, their budgets overmatched by the need for new schools, roads and other infrastructure. So the arrival of the 7 billionth person is cause for profound global concern. It carries a challenge: What will it take to maintain a planet in which each person has a chance for a full, productive and prosperous life, and in which the planet's resources are sustained for future generations? How, in short, can we enjoy ""sustainable development"" on a very crowded planet? The answer has two parts, and each portends a difficult journey over several decades. The first part requires a change of technologies -- in farming, energy, industry, transport and building -- so that each of us on average is putting less environmental stress on the planet. We will have to make a worldwide transition, for example, from today's fossil-fuel era, dependent on coal, oil and gas, to an era powered by low-carbon energies such as the sun and wind. That will require an unprecedented degree of global cooperation. The second key to sustainable development is the stabilization of the global population. This is already occurring in high-income and even some middle-income countries, as families choose to have one or two children on average. The reduction of fertility rates should be encouraged in the poorer countries as well. Rapid and wholly voluntary reductions of fertility have been and can be achieved in poor countries. Success at reducing high fertility rates depends on keeping girls in school, ensuring that children survive, and providing access to modern family planning and contraceptives. Two centuries ago, the British thinker Thomas Robert Malthus famously warned that excessive population growth would cut short economic progress. That is a threat still with us today, but it is a warning, not an inevitable outcome. We face an urgent task: to adopt more sustainable technologies and lifestyles, and work harder to achieve a stable population of some 8 billion or so by mid-century, rather than the current path, which could easily carry the world to more than 10 billion people by 2100. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Sachs.","Jeffrey Sachs: Earth's population will hit 7 billion this month; milestone, huge challenge .

"(CNN) -- During the 1970s and '80s it was said that what happened in Gdansk moved the world. The shipyard in the Polish port city employed around 20,000 workers building container ships and vessels for the navies of many East European communist countries. It was also the birthplace of the anti-communist Solidarity trade union movement started by shipyard electrician Lech Walesa, and the spark that would help lead to further civil resistance against communism across Eastern Europe. Now 30 years on, the shipyards are a very different place. Only around 2,000 people are employed in the yards and construction halls and work is sporadic. Occasionally cruise ships will be refurbished here, but aside from ferries, there are very few large ships being built. But there is one operation helping to keep a small portion of the struggling shipyard afloat and is as far from its origins as can be. Sunreef Yachts is a French company that has been building its high-end catamarans in Gdansk since 2002. ""We are building history as well, because it started with big container ships and we are continuing with pleasure boats for millionaires from all over the world,"" says Sunreef's Rafat Lenartowski. Poland's economy grew by around 4% last year and large-scale luxury goods companies have been relatively untouched by the global economic downturn. That is good news for Sunreef's local employees, many of whom are highly-skilled shipwrights or specialists, and are second or third generation workers of the shipyards. ""This is important for me,"" says Adam Muczynski, a 32-year-old employee of Sunreef, whose father was an electrician during the 1980s. ""All people talk about the shipyard in Gdansk. This factory is really important for all Polish people, really."" The construction halls have produced over 60 luxury vessels and many in the city and within the company hope that Gdansk's best days don't have to be in its past. ""We have still a lot of offers that are coming into our shipyard, especially from the emerging markets,"" says Lenartowski.","Gdansk was birthplace of Poland's Solidarity trade union movement in 1980s .

"(CNN) -- Journalism sometimes has a bit of a short-term memory problem. If something didn't happen, or wasn't written, this day, this hour, this minute, then it's easy for us Internet writers to pretend it didn't happen. Or to forget about it and move on to the next post. The problem with this myopia, of course, is that history is a wise teacher, and all good reporting should build on a thoughtful understanding of the past and the present. That's why I'm asking for your help in creating a list of ""must-reads"" on the subject of income inequality. That topic, which you voted for me to cover as part of the Change the List project, has been examined thoughtfully by countless writers, philosophers, historians, politicians, journalists, Web designers and documentarians. As I embark on a series about inequality in the United States, it makes sense to survey the smart, exciting works already out there. Why not make the creation of this must-read list a collective, public experiment? Hopefully, we all can benefit from the process, and the list will be public so others can learn from it, too. Submit your top picks via these Facebook or Google+ posts -- and make the case for why your favorite book, doc or website should be included. You can also leave a comment at the bottom of the page here if you prefer. My plan is to compile a list of 99 (or so) must-reads from your submissions.* I'm using the term ""must-read"" loosely. I think the list should include books and articles as well as thoughtful websites, charts, videos or documentaries. To get things started, here are 10 of my picks, in no particular order: . 1. ""Inequality.Is"" - This website from the Economic Policy Institute is the best online primer I've found. It explains why inequality is a problem, how it was created and what might fix it. 2. ""A Theory of Justice"" - The 1971 book by the late John Rawls is often cited as the philosophical basis for opposing income inequality. It's a dense book, but thought-provoking. 3. ""Park Avenue"" - A documentary by Oscar winner Alex Gibney. It uses the famous New York avenue as a metaphor for American inequality; Park Avenue is home to both extreme wealth, in Manhattan, and extreme poverty, in the Bronx. 4. ""The Great Divergence"" - Journalist Timothy Noah argues, as his book's description says, that growing inequality ""may be the most important change in this country during our lifetimes -- a drastic, elemental change in the character of American society, and not at all for the better."" 5. ""Wealth Inequality in America"" - Chances are you're one of the 6.8 million people who has viewed this YouTube video. It's based on the work of Harvard's Mike Norton. 6. ""Inequality and New York's Subway"" - A New Yorker interactive, which maps median income levels by subway stops in New York. The power is in its minimalism. Take a look at the 2 train map. It passes through neighborhoods with median incomes of $205,192 and $13,750. 7. ""Nickel and Dimed"" - A first-person journey by writer Barbara Ehrenreich, who agreed to try to make a living doing jobs that required no higher education or specialized skills. 8. ""Born Rich"" - Jamie Johnson, from the wealthy Johnson & Johnson family, directed this documentary about his own life and the lives of his super-rich friends and acquaintances. It reveals a fascinating and complicated picture of wealth in modern America. 9. [Untitled letter] - In March 2013, 90 ""economists, academics and development experts"" sent a letter to a panel tasked by the United Nations with creating a post-2015 development agenda. The experts argue income inequality should be a global priority, in part, because ""inequalities threaten our ability to pursue fair and sustainable development as much as they threaten eradication of extreme poverty."" 10. ""The Spirit Level"" - Written by two epidemiologists, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, this book makes a strong, statistics-based argument that ugly social problems -- from obesity to incarceration rates -- are associated with unequal societies. Better health and well-being would follow, they argue, if our societies were made to be more equal. This quickly thrown-together list has plenty of limitations. It focuses almost entirely on the United States, particularly New York. All these works were published in 1971 or later, which is a huge weakness of my list. Most of them presuppose inequality is a problem, or set out to prove that it is. So, conservatives, skeptics, historians, literary types and international readers: Help me get some diversity going here! I look forward to your submissions, and thanks in advance for the help with this project. *Readers of The Atlantic may notice that this concept of a crowdsourced must-read list is based on Alexis Madrigal's ""Tech Canon,"" which he compiled in a similar manner in 2010.

"(CNN) -- Steve Jobs wasn't eager to disclose details of his health issues over the years. That the Apple co-founder contracted a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003 wasn't disclosed until after his return from surgery more than nine months later. Another health problem, which was innocuously described at first as a ""hormone imbalance,"" turned into a six-month leave during which Jobs underwent a liver transplant. Yet Jobs' views on existence, as he increasingly faced his own mortality, became ever more poetic and less concealed toward the end. These could be seen in the rare interviews he'd grant but also in e-mail correspondences with acquaintances and strangers, which he often took the time to partake in. ""I don't think of my life as a career,"" he told Time in 2010. ""I do stuff. I respond to stuff. That's not a career -- it's a life!"" Jobs also shared his condolences and personal revelations with others facing similar pressures. A man named James told the news site Business Insider that he e-mailed Jobs on April 20, 2010, to thank him for supporting an organ donor program. James mentioned that his girlfriend had died of melanoma two years before. Jobs replied: ""Your [sic] most welcome, James. I'm sorry about your girlfriend. Life is fragile."" The rare moments when Jobs publicly waxed philosophical were among his most memorable. Perhaps the most widely quoted is his 2005 commencement address to Stanford University's graduating class: ""Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important,"" he said. ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."" He continued: ""No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life's change agent."" People often looked to Jobs for advice on dealing with the inevitable, and he seemed eager to offer his guidance. One of the first calls Bob Longo, a former sales chief for the failed computer company Jobs founded called NeXT Computer, made after getting diagnosed with cancer was to Jobs. (They shared the same oncologist and radiologist.) The pair kept in touch, Longo recalled to the Pittsburgh Business Times, and Longo received an exuberant e-mail from Jobs after telling him the news that Longo's surgery was successful. Longo told the Business Times: ""Messages from him were generally laconic. This one had 20 exclamation points. I have a cousin who's a pretty well regarded cancer research doctor and told him the doctor Steve referred me to; he said, 'Don't even ask for a second opinion. Start your treatment.'"" Even in 1995, Jobs seemed undeterred in the face of death. He said in an interview with the Computerworld Honors Program: ""We're all going to be dead soon; that's my point of view. Somebody once told me, they said, 'Live each day as if it would be your last, and oneÂ day you'll certainly be right.' I do that. You never know when you're going to go, butÂ you are going to go pretty soon. If you're going to leave anything behind, it's going toÂ be your kids, a few friends and your work.

"London (CNN) -- It's not just any old talent show, it's an institution -- an annual event that attracts an estimated global audience of 125 million. But to the uninitiated, the Eurovision Song Contest can seem a mystifying cultural anomaly. Each year, this relic of the post-war era inspires scores of camped-up performers to perform even camper songs in a self-conscious display of continental unity. But don't let that put you off. From Sweden to Spain, Portugal to Poland, the show gathers an ever more devoted following each year -- and 125 million people can't all be wrong, can they? So, if you haven't seen it -- and don't know the first thing about what you're missing -- keep reading. Forgettable song, memorable outfit: The crazy clothes of Eurovision . Who competes? Forget the ""Euro-"" prefix. Contestants can come from any member country of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) which includes numerous non-European nations. Bizarrely enough, the boundaries of the EBU are determined by the catchment area of telegraphy cables built in the 19th and 20th centuries, extending to Israel, Armenia, Morocco and, let's not forget, Azerbaijan. Melodifestivalen: Sweden's not-so-guilty Eurovision pleasure . Why? Contrary to popular belief, the Eurovision Song Contest was not forged in the flames of international unity. According to Dr Karen Fricker, co-director of the Eurovision Research Network, the contest was set up for the practical purpose of testing the scope of new broadcast technology in the 1950s. ""The whole gloss we put on it that it's about uniting Europe is actually a misrepresentation,"" she said. ""Eurovision was set up not to unite Europe in song, but to test the latest broadcast technology,"" she said. ""The EBU needed content so thought, 'Let's create a song contest,'"" she said. The contest caught on, and has endured as a reliable ratings hit for the broadcasters of participating nations. So who chooses the acts? The EBU is made up of broadcasters, not governments, and each year it is up to the participating broadcaster from each country to submit one act chosen through their own selection process. The prospect of a ready-made domestic audience and a studio full of premium-rate phone lines often proves an irresistible draw to broadcasters, many of whom conduct their selection through a national public telephone voting contest. In fact, some countries' national finals produce a greater public frenzy than Eurovision itself. In Sweden, Melodifestivalen (literally, Melody Festival) is the biggest entertainment event of the year, with 32 songs competing in stadia around the country to become the nation's Eurovision entry. Then what? Since the early 1990s there have been more countries eager to compete in the contest than would be sensible to include on one already marathon TV show. This prompted a wave of convoluted screening processes -- most of them short-lived -- until the EBU began broadcasting semi-finals in 2008. The semi-finals are conducted along the same lines as the final (more on that later), except there's two of them. Each country performs their song and is judged by all the other countries in their semi-final group. Unlike the final, however, the tally of votes won is kept under wraps, with the successful qualifiers simply announced while the losers are sent packing. The process applies to everyone except the previous year's winner (who earns the automatic right to host and compete in the next contest) as well as the Big Five of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom -- all of whom qualify automatically. That doesn't sound fair. It isn't, but you get what you pay for. The Big Five are the biggest financial contributors to the contest, and without them the high production costs simply wouldn't be met. So what happens on the big night? One by one, the performers from each nation get on stage and sing their hearts out, often wearing a flamboyant outfit and performing a dance routine. Until 1999, each entry was obliged to sing along with a live orchestra, but since a rule change scrapped the requirement, no one ever does. Live instrumentation is not permitted. This rule exists because there isn't enough time to wire the instruments during the short break between the songs. On the other hand, the backing tape can't have any vocals as live singing is (for the time being) what it's all about. After the performances, there's an intermission. Convention dictates that this is an opportunity for the host nation to launch a long musical advertisement for itself. Then the moment that everyone's been waiting for (and, it is said, the moment that most people tune in): The voting. Finally! So, how does that work? Countries award a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs. They can't vote for themselves and, for a much needed dose of sophistication, they must announce the score in both English and French. Until the late 1990s, a mysterious jury of music industry experts -- sequestered somewhere in the capital city of each participating nation -- were the contest's soul arbiters. But since 1997, when a handful of nations experimented with televoting -- giving people in those countries the opportunity to vote for their favorite songs over the phone -- the public choice has counted for half the final vote. In a surprisingly straightforward conclusion, the winner is quite simply the country with the most points. Which countries have the strongest track record? The notorious luck of the Irish seems to have turned on its head when it comes to Eurovision. Ireland is head and shoulders above the field with seven wins to its name, including a run of three consecutive victories in 1992, 1993 and 1994. France, the UK and Luxembourg each have five wins to their credit. Sweden now has five wins, and the Netherlands have four, while Israel and Norway have a respectable three wins each. Do all the winners go on to fame and fortune? No. One of the few ""rules"" that has remained consistent since the contest's inception in 1956 is that winners are rarely heard from again. Among the few notable exceptions are ABBA, who won in 1974 with ""Waterloo,"" and Celine Dion, who was imported from Quebec to represent Switzerland in the 1988 contest.","The Eurovision Song Contest is one of the most watched non-sporting events in the world .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A landscape restoration of a rubbish dump has won the Energy, Waste and Recycling category at the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, Spain. Spanish architects Batlle and Roig have returned a 150 hectare rubbish dump back to nature. ""La Vall d'en Joan"" (The Valley of Joan) project, designed by Spanish architects Batlle and Roig, has transformed a 150 hectare site in the Garraf Natural Park, south-west of Barcelona into a green terraced agricultural landscape. In awarding the prize, judges Luis Mansilla -- Mansilla + Tunon architects -- and Martin Keiding -- editor-in-chief of Arkitektur DK -- described the scheme as: ""a perfect example of bringing dead nature back to life by converting rubbish into a beautiful piece of landscape architecture...using few and humble means"". Joan Roig of Batlle and Roig Architects told CNN: ""The idea was to create a system of hills and banks in a way that would avoid erosion from water and to give the rubbish dump back to nature with a natural design."" Work to transform the site -- the largest landfill in Spain -- began in 2000 and was completed earlier this year. It is a striking redrawing of a previously scarred and polluted landscape. The landfill has been servicing Barcelona's metropolitan area for over 30 years. More than 20 million tons of rubbish was spread around the valley before the site was closed in 2006. In some places, you would have to dig down over 100 meters before you found soil again. But this isn't just a cosmetic makeover. There is an underground drainage system on site which filters contaminated waste fluids. Part of this recycled water is then used to irrigate the park. ""The whole project is very sustainable,"" Roig said. Furthermore, the dump is also utilizing the bio gas that is emitted to provide electricity. Some of the rubbish has remained above ground. Housed in large steel cages which flank the entrance to the site, Roig says they serve as a permanent reminder to visitors of the site's previous life. Judge, Martin Keiding told CNN: ""It's a very beautiful and simple design. It is landscape architecture that is inspiring. It is a very good example that everyone could look at and say: 'We could do the same.' This competition is about pointing out good examples that could inspire architects."" Batlle and Roig's winning design was one of eight short-listed projects in the Energy, Waste and Recycling category, which was notable for the variety of entries. They range from state of the art, hi-tech plans such as the Digital Beijing designed by Studio Pei Zhu and Urbanus, right down to low-cost, primitive ventures like the Community Cooker devised by Kenyan company, Planning Systems Services. The communal cooker is turning rubbish into fuel to feed residents of one of Africa's biggest slums -- Kibera -- on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya. The project was highly commended by the judges. ""Sustainability is a very important issue and so are the questions about rubbish, especially in Third World countries,"" Keiding said. ""The community cooker is a way of introducing a solution directly into the society."" Keiding, himself a trained architect, believes that Energy, Waste and Recycling is the most important category at the inaugural World Architecture Festival. ""We are facing big problems, so it is a great opportunity for architects to work seriously with this problem on many different levels. ""I think flashy executive buildings are interesting in one sense but they are not interesting if they are not dealing seriously with this matter. In my opinion you can throw them out. We have to be far more serious about integrating aspects of sustainability into architecture."" Both Mansilla and Keiding noted that engineering and architecture had to combine to deal with issues concerning waste and recycling. They said that achieving sustainability was a difficult task but it also represented a great opportunity for architects to contribute to the sphere.","Spanish architects win prestigious category award at World Architecture Festival .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan police officer fatally shot an American contractor at Kabul police headquarters early on Monday, authorities said. The killing occurred a day after five policemen were killed by their commander in Jawzjan province, in the north. The incidents added to a number of insider attacks by Afghan soldiers and police officers -- or attackers dressed like them. More than 50 people have been killed in Afghanistan in similar attacks this year, which the Afghan government calls acts of terrorism.

Monday's incident marked the first such an attack involving a female suspect, said Hagen Messer, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Afghan Interior Ministry, said the woman, around 40, has been a member of the police force for two years. She was arrested and was questioned, he said. The victim was identified as Joseph Griffin, 49, of Mansfield, Georgia, according to DynCorp International, which describes itself as ""a global government services provider in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives, delivering support solutions for defense, diplomacy, and international development."" The civilian contractor for the security assistance force was working as an adviser to Afghan police, said Maj. Martyn Crighton, another ISAF spokesman. DynCorp said Griffin had been supporting the Afghan Ministry of Interior and Afghan National Police Development Program. Griffin, a veteran of the U.S. military who had served in American-based law enforcement positions, had supported several of the company's global training and mentoring programs since November 2000. He began his most recent assignment in July 2011, DynCorp said. ""Joe spent his career helping people all over the world, most recently working to help the Afghan people secure a better future,"" said Steve Gaffney, chairman and chief executive of DynCorp International. ""The loss of any team member is tragic, but to have this happen over the holidays makes it seem all the more unfair."" A woman who answered the phone at Griffin's home said she had no comment.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The threat from terrorists using chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons is growing, Britain said Tuesday, warning advances in technology will enable extremists to conduct more lethal attacks in the future. Muslim extremists killed 52 people in bomb attacks in London in July 2005. The predictions came as Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government's laid out its anti-terrorism policies and strategy in a document containing previously-classified information. In it the government also warned that although the al Qaeda organization of Osama bin Laden, was likely to fragment in coming years, the group's ideology will live on. Under the strategy Britain, where 52 people were killed by home-grown Muslim extremists in July 2005 bomb attacks on London's transit network, says it needs to focus on longer-term causes of terrorism. It says the current threat to Britain and its interests comes primarily from four interrelated sources: . It says some of the factors that sustain terrorism today are likely to persist in the future -- such as conflicts exploited by terrorist groups that show no signs of abating, and evolving technology that enables terrorist acts. Other trends, however, will constrain terrorist groups, such as being short of money and funding and having their ideology rejected by Muslims across the Islamic world, the government said. As part of its strategy to prevent terrorism, the government will openly challenge views that could encourage violence, may ""undermine our shared values"" and ""jeopardize community cohesion,"" the government said. ""We have no intention of outlawing these views or criminalizing those who hold them,"" the report says. ""Freedom of thought and speech are rights which are fundamental to our society. But we will not hear these views in silence. We should all stand up for our shared values and not concede the floor to those who dismiss them."" The report says everyone -- government, citizens, and communities -- must challenge those who ""dismiss our shared values."" British government officials plan to work alongside Muslim scholars, faith groups and influential people to challenge the ideologies that support extremism, the report said. The government even plans to sponsor the wider teaching of Islam and religious education, and develop citizenship education in mosque schools. Those who are vulnerable to radicalism are also a target of the government's plan. There will be programs for mentoring, diversionary activities and leadership training as well as more intensive intervention for those who have already been drawn into violent extremist networks, the government said.","New strategy says al Qaeda will fragment but ideology will live on .
Terrorists more likely to take advantage of new technology in future .
Financial constraints likely to restrain some terrorists ."
"(CNN) -- The conversion therapy center being sued by gay men who paid the counselors to make them straight vowed it would continue to ""assist those with unwanted same-sex attractions."" ""The lawsuit is without merit, and is designed to create a chilling effect upon speech and programs that assist people in overcoming unwanted same-sex attractions,"" a statement from JONAH -- Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing -- said Thursday. Four former JONAH clients, who were teens when they signed up for help, filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against JONAH and two of its counselors Tuesday, saying they were defrauded by JONAH's claim that ""being gay is a mental disorder"" that could be reversed by conversion therapy -- ""a position rejected by the American Psychiatric Association four decades ago,"" the lawsuit said. ""This is the first time that plaintiffs have sought to hold conversion therapists liable in a court of law,"" said Samuel Wolfe, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center. The SPLC, an Alabama-based civil rights group, is providing legal aid to the plaintiffs. Their lawsuit should put all conversion therapists on notice that they can be held accountable, Wolfe said. The SPLC has identified 70 conversion therapy providers across the United States. A California law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown last month made it illegal for licensed counselors to use the therapy with clients under 18. JONAH co-director Arthur Goldberg said the position that people's sexual orientation can be changed by therapy is not contradicted by the latest statements from the American Psychiatric Association, but he did not give any examples. ""We remain steadfast in our commitment to assist those with unwanted same-sex attractions,"" Goldberg said in a statement to CNN Thursday. ""There are thousands of people who have shed their unwanted same-sex attractions, not only through our programs, but also through other similar programs."" In an interview Thursday with the Family Research Council's Washington Watch Radio, Goldberg said he was optimistic that JONAH has ""a very strong case and we should be able to emerge victorious."" The lawsuit, filed in Hudson County, New Jersey, Superior Court, said conversion therapy, which can cost up to $10,000 a year, can put patients at risk of ""depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior,"" while giving them no benefits. Plaintiff Sheldon Bruck was 17 when he sought Goldberg's help in 2009. He wanted to assure his orthodox Jewish parents there was a way out of homosexuality when he told them he was gay. Goldberg promised Bruck that ""JONAH could help him change his orientation from gay to straight,"" the suit said. Jo Bruck, Sheldon's mother, and Bella Levin, the mother of plaintiff Chaim Levin, are also plaintiffs because they paid for their sons' conversion therapy and the counseling the suit said they needed to recover from it. The conversion therapy techniques described in the suit included having them strip naked in group sessions, cuddling and intimate holding of others of the same sex, violently beating an effigy of their mothers with a tennis racket, visiting bath houses ""in order to be nude with father figures,"" and being ""subjected to ridicule as 'faggots' and 'homos' in mock locker room scenarios."" ""As long as you put in the effort, you're going to change,"" Goldberg told Bruck, the lawsuit said. JONAH counselor Thaddeus Heffner blamed Bruck's gay orientation ""on Bruck for not working hard enough to change, on his father for being too distant, and on his mother for being too close to him,"" the suit said. Bruck quit after five sessions, delivered through an online video link, because he ""experienced deepening depression and anxiety leading to suicidal ideation and feelings of hopelessness about his life,"" the suit said. Heffner angrily warned Bruck that he was ""making a big mistake"" and ""throwing (his) life away"" by ""giving into (his) desires"" and that he would ""never lead a happy life,"" but would ""lead a life of unhappiness in that unhealthy lifestyle,"" the suit said. Chaim Levin, also an orthodox Jew, was about to turn 17 in 2007 when he talked to his parents about his sexual orientation and sexual abuse when he was younger. A rabbi in his Brooklyn, New York, community suggested to his parents that they enroll him in JONAH's program. ""You can change if you just try hard enough,"" the suit said Goldberg told him. ""You just need to work really hard, we are experts at this. We have helped so many people."" Levin attended weekly sessions for 18 months at JONAH's Jersey City, New Jersey, headquarters conducted by Alan Downing, an unlicensed JONAH counselor who calls himself a ""life coach,"" the suit said. Downing is named as a defendant in the case. ""I was manipulated into believing that I could change my sexual orientation, but instead I was subjected to terrible abuse that mirrored the traumatic assault that I experienced as a young person,"" Levin said at a news conference Tuesday. ""What I can tell you is that conversion therapy does not work. My family and I have wasted thousands of dollars and many hours on this scam."" The lawsuit described what happened in one of those sessions in October 2008 with Levin, who was 18 at the time. ""Downing initiated a discussion about Levin's body and instructed Levin to stand in front of a full-length mirror and hold a staff,"" the suit said. ""Downing directed Levin to say one negative thing about himself, remove an article of clothing, then repeat the process. Although Levin protested and expressed discomfort, at Downing's insistence, Levin submitted and continued until he was fully naked. Downing then instructed Levin to touch his penis and then his buttocks. Levin, unsure what to do but trusting in and relying on Downing, followed the instructions, upon which Downing said 'good' and the session ended."" Two other plaintiffs -- Benjamin Unger and Michael Ferguson -- described similar incidents in the suit. ""On one occasion, Downing instructed Unger to beat an effigy of his mother with a tennis racket, as though killing her, and encouraged Unger to scream at his mother while beating her effigy,"" the suit said. ""Conversion therapy was, in Unger's experience, 'psychological abuse,'"" it said. ""By the time he terminated sessions with JONAH, he was deeply depressed and had commenced taking antidepressant medications."" Downing ""picked apart every human emotion and childhood disappointment"" of Unger, to present them as treatable origins of Unger's orientation, the suit said. ""I watched as grown men were frenzied into fits of emotional rage against their mothers and encouraged to act out physical violence against their parents in order to access their so-called true manhood and become more heterosexual,"" Ferguson told reporters Tuesday. Unger's ability to have physical and emotional relationships with men was impaired and he was unable to work for a year, the suit said. Bruck, Levin, Unger and Ferguson are ""adjusting well"" four years after their last conversion therapy treatments, according to Wolfe. ""They have had time to get on with their lives,"" he said.","Thousands ""have shed their unwanted same-sex attractions,"" JONAH director says .

"(CNN) -- Top International Atomic Energy Agency officials arrived in Iran Sunday, state media reported, after the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog expressed fresh concerns that the Islamic republic was trying to develop nuclear weapons. The six-member delegation, including chief inspector Herman Nackaerts, arrived at Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport, Press TV reported. ""We are trying... to resolve all the outstanding issues with Iran,"" Nackaerts told reporters earlier, as he was about to leave Vienna, Austria, according to Press TV. ""We are looking forward to the start of a dialogue, a dialogue that is overdue."" A mission to Iran by such a senior team -- which also includes the agency's second-in-command, Rafael Grossi -- is unusual, the agency said when it announced the visit on Monday. The team is due to be in Iran through Tuesday, the IAEA says. The announcement of the mission came shortly after the European Union imposed a tough round of new sanctions on Iran, aimed at cutting off funding to the country's nuclear program. The United States and Australia have also ramped up sanctions on Iran in the past week. The United States and its allies think Tehran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran denies it. Speaking Friday at the Davos Forum in Switzerland, energy agency Director General Yukiya Amano told reporters the visit is intended ""to clarify the issues with possible military dimensions. ""We are not very sure whether Iran has declared everything and, therefore, we are not very sure that everything stays in peaceful purpose,"" he said. ""In addition, we have information that Iran has engaged in activities related to the development of nuclear weapons. Therefore, we need to clarify."" ""The preparations have gone well, but we need to see what actually happens when the mission arrives,"" he said. Inspectors are in and out of the country regularly, an agency spokeswoman said Monday, but a high-level visit of the kind taking place at the end of the month is more unusual. Iran's envoy to the energy agency said Saturday he was hopeful the trip will ""resolve any ambiguity and show (our) transparency and cooperation with the agency."" ""This trip is aimed at neutralizing enemy plots ... and baseless allegations, and proving the peaceful nature of our nuclear activities,"" Ali Asghar Soltanieh told state-run Islamic Republican News Agency. Amano said that the energy agency proposed the mission, and Iranian authorities ""agreed to accept"" it. But the Islamic news agency reported Nackaerts is traveling at Tehran's invitation. Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said he was ready to discuss the program with a group of world powers that have been having on-and-off negotiations with the country over its nuclear ambitions -- including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. The energy agency reported in November that it can no longer verify that the Iranian nuclear program remains peaceful, and Iran is under increasing international pressure to halt its nuclear fuel work. Western sanctions have targeted its currency, the rial, driving up prices for goods within Iran, and the European Union announced Monday that it would stop importing Iranian oil as of July 1 in an effort to starve the country's nuclear program of funding. In response, an Iranian official said Sunday that Tehran would stop oil exports to ""certain countries,"" soon, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Oil Minister Rostam Qassemi made the statement after a cabinet meeting Sunday, as Iranian lawmakers are debating whether to halt oil exports to European countries, IRNA reported.","A six-member International Atomic Energy Agency arrives in Tehran, Iranian media says .

"(CNN) -- When Tiger Woods invoked his religious faith during his public apology on Friday, he readily acknowledged that a lot of people would be surprised. ""People probably don't realize it,"" he said, ""but I was raised a Buddhist, and I actively practiced my faith from childhood until I drifted away from it in recent years."" But Woods said his Buddhist faith would be a key part of his quest to put his life back together after revelations of his marital infidelity, which he admitted for the first time. Buddhist experts said Woods' summation of the tradition's beliefs was accurate -- and that his remarks likely will bring more attention to the faith in a week when its highest profile leader, the Dalai Lama, is visiting the United States. ""I have a lot of work to do, and I intend to dedicate myself to doing it,"" Woods said, reading a statement from Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ""Part of following this path for me is Buddhism, which my mother taught me at a young age."" ""Buddhism teaches that a craving of things outside ourselves causes an unhappy and pointless search for security,"" he continued. ""It teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously, I lost track of what I was taught."" A handful of Buddhist scholars said Woods' description of Buddhist teaching was spot on. ""Woods was quite accurate,"" said Janet Gyatso, a professor of Buddhist studies at Harvard University. ""Craving causes unhappiness. That's a fundamental Buddhist idea."" A 1996 Sports Illustrated profile suggested that Woods -- then in his early 20s -- took his faith seriously. He visited a Buddhist temple with his mother each year around his birthday, slept near a mother-of-pearl Buddha from his Thai grandfather, and wore a gold Buddha around his neck, according to the profile. Woods' mother, Kultilda, is a Thai-born Buddhist. ""I like Buddhism because it's a whole way of being and living,"" Tiger Woods told Sports Illustrated. ""It's based on discipline and respect and personal responsibility. I like Asian culture better than ours because of that."" When allegations of Woods' infidelity began emerging after a November 27 car accident, Fox News Channel host Brit Hume stirred controversy by publicly advising the golf pro to become a Christian. ""He's said to be a Buddhist -- I don't think that faith offers the kind of forgiveness and redemption that is offered by the Christian faith,"" Hume said. ""So my message to Tiger would be: Tiger, turn to the Christian faith and you can make a total recovery and be a great example to the world."" But Buddhist scholars say that forgiveness and redemption are core components of the faith. ""You're always beginning again in the Buddhist tradition,"" said John Kornfield, a prominent Buddhist teacher based in California. ""You see that you're causing harm, you repent and ask forgiveness in some formal or informal way, and you start again."" Some Buddhism experts said that's what Woods appeared to be trying to do today. Many Buddhists applauded Woods' statement. ""The fact that people could see this kind of behavior causes suffering is an incredibly important message for all kinds of people who respect Woods,"" said Kornfield. Buddhism was in the spotlight this week before Woods' remarks, with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama -- a Buddhist -- meeting with President Obama in Washington on Thursday. Buddhism is among the world's largest religions, with about 350 million adherents, including about 1.2 million in the United States, according to a 2009 report by Trinity College. The faith began in India about 2,500 years ago.","Woods: ""People probably don't realize it, but I was raised a Buddhist""

"(CNN) -- Dozens of international correspondents came together Monday to demand that Egypt release three journalists they say have been detained arbitrarily for two weeks. Peter Greste, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed from Al Jazeera English were arrested by Egyptian authorities on December 29 and have been held since. Egyptian authorities say the journalists held illegal meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was declared a terrorist group last month. There has been a crackdown on the Islamist movement, and ensuing political turmoil, since the army ousted Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected President, in July. In a show of solidarity, nearly 40 correspondents and editors representing 29 international media organizations sent a letter to the Egyptian authorities to demand the journalists' immediate release. The letter was signed by Christiane Amanpour, CNN chief international correspondent and a member of the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists; BBC chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet; and reporters and editors for NPR, The Washington Post, Le Monde, France 24 and The Economist, among other news outlets. ""We are deeply concerned to learn that our colleagues, all three of whom are well respected journalists, may face charges that include belonging to a terrorist organization and spreading false news that could endanger national security,"" the journalists say in the letter. They also call for the release of other journalists who have been detained in Egypt, some of whom they say have been arbitrarily imprisoned for more than five months. ""The arrest of these journalists has cast a cloud over press and media freedom in Egypt,"" the letter reads. ""We strongly believe that upholding the rights of journalists and permitting the free flow of information is vital to bringing about greater understanding and serves the best interests of all Egyptians and the world."" Egyptian army chief hints at run for higher office . Highly charged environment . Originally, four Al Jazeera journalists were detained last month, but the Egyptian government released cameraman Mohamed Fawzy on December 31. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said on its Facebook page that security forces arrested a Muslim Brotherhood member and an Australian journalist at a Cairo hotel. Greste, an Australian, previously worked for CNN, Reuters and the BBC. Fahmy worked for CNN and The New York Times before joining the Qatar-based network; Mohamed is a Cairo-based producer for the network. The ministry said the Muslim Brotherhood member used the hotel to meet with other members and as a media center to broadcast damaging news about the government for Al Jazeera. Calling the arrests arbitrary, Al Jazeera has said the network ""has been subject to harassment by Egyptian security forces,"" including having its equipment confiscated and offices raided, despite the network not being banned from working in Egypt. Observers say Egypt's media environment has been highly charged since Morsy's overthrow. Several Islamist channels were closed down immediately after the military intervention in the summer. Political turmoil . The arrests occurred the day before the Committee to Protect Journalists issued a report saying Egypt, Syria and Iraq have become the deadliest countries for journalists. Seventy journalists were killed in 2013, with six of those deaths in Egypt, the CPJ said. Since Morsy's ouster, the Arab world's most populous nation has seen months of political turmoil as an interim military-backed government has taken charge. Hundreds died in clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsy supporters in the weeks that followed his ouster. Detractors say Morsy was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values, but his supporters say the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Egypt is now preparing to hold a referendum Tuesday and Wednesday on a new constitution that would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military.

"(CNN) -- Microsoft's Bing search engine will not follow Google out of China. Executives have made that clear. But will they take the high road or the low road in their quest to win a bigger piece of a China's fast-growing Internet market? On Monday Google stopped censoring its Chinese search engine and moved the service to Hong Kong, where the Internet isn't censored. Before this week Google had a 35 percent share of the Chinese search engine market, a nontrivial number in a country of 400 million Internet users. It's unlikely that many of those 140 million Google.cn users will stick with the new service at Google.com.hk, because many of its results are now blocked by the Chinese government's own network-level censorship system, known as the ""Great Firewall of China."" With the loyalty of millions of Chinese Internet searchers up for grabs, Baidu, the home-grown search engine with dominant market share in China, is expected to be the biggest winner. But Microsoft's chief research and strategy officer, Craig Mundie, confirmed in an interview with the state-controlled China Daily last week that Bing, which now has less than 1 percent of Chinese market share, ""is committed to stay."" He chided Google for its lack of experience in China compared with Microsoft's 20-year presence, implying that one day it, too, will grow up to the world's realities. But is Microsoft being ethically responsible? The answer to that question is not simply about whether Bing stays in China. It's also a question of how Bing stays. Will Microsoft manage its legal obligations to the Chinese government in a way that helps legitimize and prolong current censorship practices, or in a way that helps reduce censorship over time -- or at the very least increases transparency and accountability to Chinese citizens? In January, the Chinese media gave prominent play to comments by Microsoft's founder Bill Gates and CEO Steve Ballmer. Ballmer called Google's move to stop censoring in China an irrational business decision. ""You've got to decide,"" said Gates, ""do you want to obey the laws of the countries you're in, or not?"" In a blog post, Ballmer attempted to clarify Microsoft's position. While Microsoft intends to stay engaged in the China market, he said it does try to push back quietly against efforts to restrict peaceful political expression. ""We have conversations with governments to make our views known,"" he wrote. ""In every country in which we operate, including China, Microsoft requires proper legal authority before we remove any Internet content; and if we remove content, we give users notice."" Needless to say, those words were not quoted in the Chinese media. As it happens, the way Microsoft handles censorship in China has changed since it launched a Chinese version of its search engine and rolled out a Chinese-language blog-hosting service in 2005. Chinese Internet companies -- including Baidu -- routinely delete content in response to casual phone calls and instant chat messages made by authorities who don't find it necessary to prove that their request has any legal basis. When Microsoft started in China, its approach to compliance could best be described as ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do."" That year, their employees deleted a popular blog in response to a phone call made by a government official to Microsoft's Chinese business partner. Microsoft employees didn't just block the blog, which had called for a boycott of a newspaper after its editor was fired; they took it off the Internet completely. It was no longer visible to anybody in the world. In February 2006, executives from Cisco, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google were summoned to a congressional hearing in Washington. Google had announced its decision to enter China with a censored search engine, Google.cn. Cisco was under fire for selling technology to China that helped authorities censor the Internet. Yahoo! was in the doghouse for having helped authorities convict pro-democracy journalist Shi Tao and three other activists by handing over the contents of their e-mail to Chinese police. ""Your abhorrent activities in China are a disgrace,"" thundered the late California Democratic Rep. Tom Lantos. Executives justified their companies' behavior by saying they are bound to abide by the local laws where they do business. Then why, human rights activists and legal experts asked, were they responding to requests made by Chinese authorities using no pretense of legal process? Microsoft began to change the way it handles censorship. It says it has stopped taking down content every time Chinese authorities object. It claims to have instituted procedures stipulating that only legally binding requests made in writing would be honored. When carrying out requests to censor entries on MSN Spaces (later renamed MSN Live Spaces), Microsoft's blogging and social networking platform, it would block pages from users on the Chinese network, but leave them visible to people viewing the page from all other countries. Tests I've conducted have shown that MSN Live's Chinese service censors substantially less than its domestic Chinese competitors. Bing seems to censor a bit less than the Chinese Baidu but a bit more than Google.cn did. The criteria the company uses for deciding what to censor and what not to censor, however, are not clear. We have to take it at its word that it's only responding to censorship requests made through a legally binding procedure. But an effort is under way to hold Microsoft publicly accountable to its promises. In 2008, Microsoft, along with Google and Yahoo, joined the Global Network Initiative (GNI, at globalnetworkinitiative.org), a group that has established a code of conduct for free expression and privacy. The goal of the initiative, whose members include human rights groups, investors and academics (including myself) is to help companies do the right thing under difficult circumstances. Figuring out the right thing to do can be particularly tough in countries like China, where people have so much to gain from greater access to global Internet platforms and tools, and the government works hard to co-opt companies to serve their purposes . As a member, Microsoft has signed on to a document that states: ""The right to freedom of expression should not be restricted by governments, except in narrowly defined circumstances based on internationally recognized laws or standards."" While the initiative does not expect companies to make their local employees conduct civil disobedience or pull out of markets at the first sign of difficulty, the GNI does expect that companies will not comply with arbitrary requests and will seek to protect users from the kinds of surveillance that could lead to human rights violations. Member companies have agreed to submit to an independent evaluation process to determine whether their claims match the reality. Earlier this month, Chinese Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong told the international press that foreign Internet companies must obey Chinese laws. Now the question is: Will Microsoft take him at his word? Will Bing comply only with those censorship requests that have a clear basis in Chinese law and which are made through a legally binding, documented and accountable process? Will it challenge them? Will it do everything it can to avoid storing personally identifiable user data that can be shared with local authorities, and will it clearly inform its users about what information is kept about them and with whom it will be shared? When we know the answers to those questions, we'll know which road Bing has taken in China.

"(CNN) -- One hundred years after firing the shot that set off World War I, Gavrilo Princip was toasted by some Saturday in Sarajevo -- whether they wore T-shirts emblazoned with his face or admired a statue recently unveiled in his honor. Today, opinions on Princip are mixed. Some in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- of which Sarajevo is the capital -- think he was a terrorist, reported CNN affiliate N1 in Yugoslavia.

"(CNN) -- When President Obama proposed his stimulus in January 2009, the economy was in a freefall, losing more than 700,000 jobs a month. The immediate cause of the plunge was the freezing up of the financial system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but the deeper cause was the loss of demand after the collapse of the housing bubble. The bubble had been driving the economy both directly and indirectly. The unprecedented run-up in house prices led to a record rate of construction, with about 2 million homes built at the peak in 2005. In addition, the $8 trillion in housing equity created by the bubble led to an enormous consumption boom. People saw little reason to save for retirement when their home was doing it for them. The banks also made it very easy to borrow against bubble-generated equity, which many people did. As a result, the personal saving rate fell to 3% in the years 2002-07. The bubble also indirectly enriched state and local governments with higher tax revenue. And there was a mini-bubble in nonresidential real estate, but that came to an end in 2008 as well. The economy had already been in recession for nine months before the collapse of Lehman because the bubble was deflating, but the Lehman bankruptcy hugely accelerated the pace of decline. This was the context in which Obama planned his stimulus package before he even entered the White House. At that point, most economists still did not recognize the severity of the downturn, just as they had not seen the dangers of the housing bubble that had been building over the previous six years. The Congressional Budget Office projections, which were very much in the mainstream of the economics profession, showed a combined drop in GDP for 2008 and 2009 of 1%, before the economy resumed growth again in 2010. This is with no stimulus. By contrast, the economy actually shrank by 3.1% in those years, even with the stimulus beginning to kick in by the spring of 2009. Given this background, it was easy to see that the stimulus was far too small. It was designed to create about 3 million jobs, which might have been adequate given the Budget Office projections. Since the package Congress approved was considerably smaller than the one requested, the final version probably created about 2 million jobs. This was a very important boost to the economy at the time, but we needed 10 million to 12 million jobs to make up for jobs lost to the collapse of the bubble. The arithmetic on this is straightforward. With the collapse of the bubble, we suddenly had a huge glut of unsold homes. As a result, housing construction plunged from record highs to 50-year lows. The loss in annual construction demand was more than $600 billion. Similarly, the loss of $8 trillion in housing equity sent consumption plunging. People no longer had equity in their homes against which to borrow, and even the people who did would face considerably tougher lending conditions. The drop in annual consumption was on the order of $500 billion. The collapse of the bubble in nonresidential real estate cost the economy another $150 billion in annual demand, as did the cutbacks in state and local government spending as a result of lost tax revenue. This brings the loss in annual demand as a result of the collapse of the bubble to $1.4 trillion. Compared with this loss of private sector demand, the stimulus was about $700 billion, excluding some technical tax fixes that are done every year and have nothing to do with stimulus. Roughly $300 billion of this was for 2009 and another $300 billion for 2010, with the rest of the spending spread over later years. In other words, we were trying offset a loss of $1.4 trillion in annual demand with a stimulus package of $300 billion a year. Surprise! This was not enough. That is not 20/20 hindsight; some of us were yelling this as loudly as we could at the time. It was easy to see that the stimulus package was not large enough to make up for the massive shortfall in private sector demand. It was going to leave millions unemployed and an economy still operating far below its potential level of output. We are still facing the consequences of an inadequate stimulus. The reality is that we have no simple formula for getting the private sector to replace the demand lost from the collapse of the bubble. Contrary to what Republican politicians tell us, private businesses don't run out and create jobs just because we throw tax breaks at them and profess our love. If the government doesn't create demand, then we will be doomed to a long period of high unemployment -- just as we saw in the Great Depression. The government could fill the demand gap by spending on infrastructure, education and other areas, but in a political world where higher spending is strictly verboten, that doesn't seem likely. The one alternative, which has been successfully pursued by Germany, is to reduce the supply of labor through work sharing. Companies reduce all their employees' hours and pay so everyone keeps their jobs. The government then pays the workers part-time unemployment benefits -- cheaper than paying someone full-time unemployment. Germans have used this route to lower their unemployment rate to 5.2%, even though their nation's growth has been slower than ours. Some bipartisan baby steps have been taken in this direction; we will need much more if we are to get back to near full employment any time soon. In a world where politics makes further stimulus impossible, work sharing is our best hope. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Baker.","Dean Baker: When stimulus began five years ago, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month .

"(CNN) -- Since Apple released iOS 7, its completely revamped operating system for the iPhone, reviews have been mixed but mostly positive. However, a glitch that has quietly plagued iPhone users â€” the ""white/black screen of death,"" a bug that abruptly soft reboots the smartphone â€” will finally be addressed in a future iOS 7 update. ""We have a fix in an upcoming software update for a bug that can occasionally cause a home screen crash,"" Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller told Mashable. SEE ALSO: iOS 7: Here's What's New . Some of the first reports of the glitch began to crop up as early as September on Apple's discussion forums, and subsequently appeared on various social media channels like Twitter. Based on various reports, the color of the boot-up screen depends on the color of your iPhone's face. A white iPhone face produces a white boot up screen with a black Apple logo, while a device with a black face produces a black screen with a white Apple logo. The glitch appears to affect any iPhone running iOS 7, with some users reporting that the sudden shutting off occurs once the iPhone's battery dips down into the 30% level. The update is rumored to land alongside iOS 7.1, which is currently in its fourth beta with developers.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- When a team of Indian surgeons opened up the stomach of a patient complaining of abdominal pain, they had no idea they'd extract a fortune. The patient, whose name was not released, was hiding 12 gold bars in his belly. He apparently smuggled them into India to evade import duty, police and doctors said Tuesday. Each bar weighed 33 grams, said C.S. Ramachandran, who conducted the surgery at a hospital in New Delhi on April 9. The 63-year-old patient, an Indian citizen, visited the hospital a day before with severe stomach pain and nausea. ""He told us he had accidentally swallowed the cap of a plastic bottle,"" Ramachandran said. Investigations could not confirm his claim. ""We couldn't (either) make out they were gold bars,"" the doctor said. ""But yes, X-Rays showed there was intestinal blockage, which required surgery."" On the day of surgery, stunned doctors pulled out the yellow metal from his stomach. ""It was unexpected,"" Ramachandran said. The hospital handed over the precious extraction to local police. The bars have since been sent to customs, which is conducting a probe, said Alok Kumar, a deputy commissioner of police. He didn't disclose the name of the patient. Nor did he reveal which country he smuggled the gold from. The patient was discharged after the surgery, and is doing fine. India is the world's second-largest gold market after China, according to the World Gold Council. Indian investment in gold bars recorded an increase of 16% in 2013, the WGC says. A tax of 10% is levied on gold imports in India.","The 63-year-old man was hospitalized with severe stomach pain and nausea .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama's vice presidential search team on Tuesday shared with a Democratic senator the names of about 20 people under consideration to be the presumptive Democratic nominee's running mate. Sen. Barack Obama has a broad spectrum of candidates as potential running mates. Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, said that some of those considered are ""top officials now,"" others are ""former lawmakers"" and others are ""former top military leaders."" He said many of the names already have been ""bandied about"" in the media, but others were ""outside the box."" He declined to give examples. Conrad said the team wanted his impressions about the people considered, the ""respect"" others hold for them and their ""standing with their colleagues."" The list may not have included everyone under consideration. Two of the three members of the search team, Jim Johnson and Eric Holder, came to Conrad's Capitol Hill office Tuesday morning for a ""wide-ranging"" and ""free-form"" meeting that lasted about 40 minutes, Conrad said. The third member of the team, Caroline Kennedy, was not there. Johnson and Holder arrived on Capitol Hill on Monday for several days of meetings with top Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  Watch panelists weigh in on possible VP picks » . They spent about 30 minutes with Reid on Monday before heading over to speak with House leaders, a senior Democratic aide said. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he had a ""good, long discussion"" with Johnson and Holder and added, ""They mentioned a lot of names."" Obama brushed aside the notion Tuesday that Johnson, who heads the vice presidential search committee, contradicts the campaign's message because he has received favorable loans from Countrywide Financial, one of the companies at the center of the nation's mortgage crisis. ""I am not vetting my VP search committees for their mortgages,"" Obama said in St. Louis, Missouri. ""This is a game that can be played -- everybody, you know, who is anybody who is tangentially related to our campaign, I think, is going to have a whole host of relationships."" The comments come two days after The Wall Street Journal reported that Johnson was the recipient of more than $7 million worth of home loans from Countrywide, made available through a program for friends of the company's chief executive officer. Ticker: Obama beats back criticism over head of VP search . Obama said last week that he would not respond to pressure from others about his choice of a running mate. ""We have a committee that's made up of wonderful people. They are going to go through the procedure and vet and get recommendations. I will meet with a range of a people, and I will ultimately make a decision. iReport.com: Who should Obama, McCain pick? ""I am a big believer in making decisions well, not making them fast and not responding to pressure,"" he said. Although Obama's campaign has not released the names of any front-runners for the VP spot, there's been a lot of speculation about who he will pick. Sen. Hillary Clinton, whose tenacious refusal to surrender the nomination contest turned the Democratic race into one of the most nail-biting in modern U.S. political history, has indicated that she would be willing to sign up on a joint ticket. Other possible front-runners include former presidential hopefuls Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, Bill Richardson and John Edwards. Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, who has often been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick, said Tuesday that if asked, he would ""absolutely not"" join the party's presidential ticket this fall. Strickland, who backed Clinton during the primary season, told National Public Radio's Michele Norris that he was taking himself out of the running. ""Absolutely not. If drafted, I will not run; nominated, I will not accept; and if elected, I will not serve,"" he said in an interview scheduled to air Tuesday night. ""So, I don't know how more crystal clear I can be."" Obama lost the Ohio primary to Clinton. The swing state governor, who has endorsed Obama, dismissed the idea that all potential running mates deny interest in the job. ""No, I don't think they all say that. I've heard people say, 'you know, if I was asked, it would certainly be something I would have to consider.' That does not mean that I am any less committed to helping Barack Obama become the next president."" Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, who has served on both armed services and intelligence committees in the Senate, has been mentioned as a possible contender. And ever since New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ruled out his own independent bid for the presidency, he's been seen as a potential running mate for both Obama and John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. Wesley Clark, a former NATO commander who failed in his bid for the 2004 presidential nomination, could be in the running, along with a slew of current politicians including Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia.

"(CNN) -- Dressed in a white cowboy hat and shirt in the merciless sun, 63-year-old Juan Leana Malpica proudly pulls a branch down in his lime grove and cups a fruit. His limes, he says, set themselves apart by their juiciness. He has been growing the fruit for the last 12 years and has never experienced a time of such upheaval. Officially, lime prices are in a spiral of hyperinflation, the national average jumping at a monthly average of around 50% this year. Leana Malpica says he is receiving an even wider margin for his produce in the state of Morelos. He pinpoints a variety of factors in Mexico for the soaring prices. ""There's the devastation caused by a citrus disease,"" he says. ""Then there is climate change. With the arrival of winter there has been a cold snap in nearby states. And what I feel is most devastating are the price speculators."" Another factor is the continuing violence in the state of Michoacan, a top lime producer. Vigilante groups there are battling drug cartels, with the federal government caught in the middle. Many growers can't -- or won't -- put trucks on the road. Those hardest hit are inevitably working class Mexicans, who rely on the staple for drinks, garnishes and ingredients for most dishes. ""I normally buy two kilos,"" one shopper at a market in Mexico City tells me. ""But now I buy a half and only use them for absolute essentials."" Mexico is the world's largest lime producer and export markets have also felt the brunt of rising costs. Some U.S. airlines have announced they are restricting the service of limes on flights and Mexican restaurants are absorbing greater costs. U.S.-based Rosa Mexicano is a high-end chain with 19 locations around the world. They buy more than one million limes a year. ""I can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $36 a case,"" says manager Jay Holmes. ""The first delivery this morning was $110 a case. We've not passed that onto the guest and don't plan to."" So while you may not be paying more for your margarita right now, profits are being squeezed. If lime prices stay the same, Rosa Mexicano estimates it will have to pay an additional $650,000 this year. For Mexican producers like Juan Leana Malpica who have not been hit by shortages, all this represents a big payday. He plans to use the profits to expand, upgrading his fertilizer and irrigation systems. The Mexican government, too, is trying to boost supply. Although the scale of the lime crisis is unique this year, the early months traditionally see a shortfall. ""We have just generated a technology in Morelos which will launch in September,"" says Agriculture Ministry official Rafael Ambriz Cervantes. ""We will trim the branches of lime trees and immediately apply nitrogen to induce flowering. And this flowering in the month of October will produce limes in February, March and April."" Consumers and businesses will have to wait until 2015 to see how effective the program is. The hope is that the brand of a key Mexican crop has not been tarnished.

"(CNN) -- A man serving eight years for vehicular homicide because of a fatal crash involving his Toyota Camry is hoping for exoneration amid concerns over unintended acceleration in some of Toyota's vehicles. Koua Fong Lee has always maintained his innocence in the 2006 crash. Then 29 years old, he was driving home from Sunday services with his pregnant wife, father, daughter, brother and niece in his 1996 Toyota Camry. Lee told investigators that he pumped the brakes as he exited I-94 in St. Paul, Minnesota, and approached an intersection, his lawyer, Brent Schaefer, said. But Ramsey County prosecutors claimed Lee had his foot on the gas as he approached cars waiting at a red light. The car was moving at between 70 and 90 mph when it struck two other vehicles. Javis Adams, 33, and his 10-year-old son, Javis Adams Jr., were killed instantly. Another passenger, 6-year-old Devyn Bolton, was left paraplegic. She testified in a wheelchair at Lee's trial and later died from her injuries. Two mechanical engineers examined the car before trial on behalf of the state and the defense, Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner said. Both concluded the brakes were operating and there were no problems with the acceleration, she said. Although the throttle was found set open at 15 percent, which is unusual, the abnormality was attributed at the time to damage from the crash, she said. ""Bottom line, two experts -- one for each side -- said there was nothing wrong with the car,"" she said. A jury convicted Lee of criminal vehicular homicide and he was sentenced to eight years in prison. But he continues to maintain his innocence. ""I know that lives were lost that day, but I did everything within my power to try to stop that vehicle,"" Lee said in a recent prison interview with CNN affiliate KARE. ""I never intended for this to happen."" The 1996 Camry is not a part of Toyota's recall. Relatives of the victims, who asked the judge to give him the maximum sentence, now support him, said Bob Hilliard, a Texas lawyer who is preparing a lawsuit against Toyota on the family's behalf. ""I am passionate about getting him out and suing Toyota,"" Hilliard told CNN. He said the family feels ""betrayed"" by the evidence that led to Lee's conviction. ""It was all smoke and mirrors,"" Hilliard said. ""I hope to get to the bottom of it and find the truth,"" Quincy Adams, who survived the crash but lost his son, told KARE. ""I feel that the boy [Koua Fong Lee] is innocent."" Lee's accident is among the first of a growing number of cases getting a second look since Toyota announced a recall, acknowledging that problems with sudden acceleration were more extensive than originally thought. In testimony last week before Congress, company executives apologized for underestimating the problem. Complete coverage of the Toyota recall . A search of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's online complaint database revealed 526 incidents listed for the 1996 Toyota Camry. Among the complaints concerning air bags, tires, steering and visibility were at least two dozen related to ""vehicle speed control,"" some dating back to 1997. ""The contact states that while driving at 65 mph when placing her foot on the brake and slowing down, the vehicle accelerated on its own,"" an October 17, 2009, report states. ""By putting extreme pressure on the brake, she was able to pull over and turned off vehicle."" In a July 26, 2003, incident, a 1996 Camry waiting at a red light lurched forward into oncoming traffic, where it was struck by a car and a motorcycle. The complaint states that the motorcyclist died five years later of injuries caused by the accident. ""With Toyota in the news, found reports of other 1996 Camry's [sic] with sudden acceleration so filed this complaint,"" the incident summary states. Not all the entries for ""vehicle speed control"" complain of sudden acceleration. ""On several occasions the vehicle failed to respond when the accelerator was depressed,"" a February 25, 1998 complaint says. Toyota recalled more than 8 million vehicles, prompting Lee's attorney to seek a re-examination of the vehicle in the 2006 accident. ""This never seemed right. A man with his family in the car -- his pregnant wife -- goes on a suicide mission? Then, the recalls started, and the complaints sounded just like what happened to Mr. Lee,"" lawyer Brent Schaefer said. ""It sounds just like a case of unintended acceleration."" Schaefer says he has filed paperwork with the court stating his intention to retest the car, which remains in a vehicle impound. ""We plan to employ experts familiar with the '96 Camry and the components that make up car to show that rapid acceleration is to blame for the accident, not Mr. Lee accidentally stepping on the accelerator,"" he said. Gaertner said her office is willing to cooperate with the examination and see where the results lead. ""We have no interest in an innocent man being behind bars. Accordingly, we are very open to considering evidence that might show that in fact he wasn't guilty,"" Gaertner said. ""If we're going to disturb a conviction we need evidence.""

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Supporters of slain teen Trayvon Martin and his acknowledged killer continued Tuesday to battle over the significance of evidence in the case. A Martin family attorney insisted Tuesday that the former prosecutor in the case met with the now sidelined police chief to discuss the case hours after Martin died, overruling a police detective who the family says prepared an affidavit urging that neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman be arrested. Meanwhile, a friend of Zimmerman's told CNN that video of the neighborhood watch volunteer in police custody does seem to show injuries consistent with Zimmerman's report that Martin slammed his head to the concrete after the two exchanged words. FBI agents were in Sanford on Tuesday, continuing their interviews in a civil rights investigation of the case, which Martin family supporters say is a clear-cut case of racial profiling leading to an unjust killing. One of the people they met with Tuesday is Frank Taaffe, Zimmerman's neighbor and friend. On Monday, agents interviewed Martin's girlfriend, the 16-year-old girl who, phone records show, was on the line with him shortly before the fatal confrontation, Martin family attorney Daryl Parks confirmed Tuesday. Special prosecutor Angela Corey's investigation also continued. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, profiled Martin, who was black, as ""suspicious"" and ignored a police dispatcher's request that he not follow him. Martin had a bag of Skittles and an iced tea at the time of his death. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer has said he killed the unarmed 17-year-old in self-defense, saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting, according to family members and police. Rallies nationwide have called for Zimmerman's arrest, decrying the Sanford Police Department's handling of the case. Zimmerman's legal adviser, Craig Sonner, said on Tuesday that criminal defense lawyer Hal Uhrig would represent Zimmerman and that Sonner would serve as co-counsel if the case were to proceed. Uhrig spent more than six years with the Gainesville Police Department in Florida before graduating from law school in 1974. In an interview with WOFL-TV in Orlando, both lawyers said they had communicated with Zimmerman only by telephone. Sonner said Zimmerman, who has not appeared publicly since the shooting, was concerned about ""people who will do him harm."" On Tuesday, Martin family attorney Jasmine Rand insisted again that the former prosecutor in the case, State Attorney Norm Wolfinger, met with the now sidelined Sanford police chief on the night of the killing and overruled a police detective urging that Zimmerman be arrested. In a letter delivered Monday to the U.S. Justice Department, the Martin family said the Sanford police detective ""filed an affidavit stating that he did not find Zimmerman's statements credible in light of the circumstances and facts surrounding the shooting."" The Martin family said Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and State Attorney Norm Wolfinger met the night of the shooting and disregarded the detective's advice, allowing Zimmerman to remain free. ABC News has reported that the lead homicide investigator, Chris Serino, filed an affidavit pushing for charges the night of the killing, but was overruled by the state attorney's office. Neither Sanford police nor prosecutors have confirmed the existence of such an affidavit. Sanford officials and special prosecutor Corey's office declined to comment. On Tuesday, Rand said she had not seen a copy of the affidavit, but said she believed several news organizations had. But Wolfinger, who stepped aside in the case last month, vehemently denied that any ""such meeting or communication occurred"" between him and Lee. ""I am outraged by the outright lies contained in the letter by Benjamin Crump,"" a Martin family attorney, Wolfinger said in a statement Monday. ""I have been encouraging those spreading the irresponsible rhetoric to stop and allow State Attorney Angela Corey to complete her work,"" he said. ""Another falsehood distributed to the media does nothing to forward that process."" Rand said the family's legal team has multiple, credible sources who say Wolfinger and Lee met that night. She declined to elaborate. The two sides also argued Tuesday over surveillance video showing Zimmerman in police custody after the shooting. An enhanced copy of the video appears to show a bump, mark or injury on Zimmerman's head more clearly than does another copy of the video previously reviewed by CNN. That video had a grainy quality. While the video does not appear to show major wounds, Taaffe, Zimmerman's neighbor and friend, said Seminole County paramedics cared for Zimmerman before they released him to police. ""That's why you don't see him like he came out of a 12-round fight like Rocky Balboa against Apollo Creed,"" Taaffe said. But Rand, the Martin family attorney, said Tuesday that it doesn't matter what the videotape shows. ""That does not change our position,"" she said. ""Once again, George Zimmerman was the aggressor. He pursued Trayvon in this instance. If he did have any medical injuries, that did not give him the right to use deadly force and shoot and kill Trayvon."" Also Tuesday, Taaffe told CNN that the neighborhood had experienced a spate of burglaries over 15 months, which he said were committed by black men. But Taaffe said Zimmerman was not a racist. ""Young black men were never the topic of discussion,"" he said. It was that neighborhood homes had been repeatedly burglarized, he said. Police records didn't appear to support Taaffe's assertion, describing four incidents involving black men. Taaffe declined further comment to CNN. The continued discussion over recorded evidence carried over from Monday, when a major point of debate was a 911 call placed on the night Martin was killed. Zimmerman has said he was yelling for help, according to his family members and his account to authorities, as first reported by the Orlando Sentinel and later confirmed by Sanford police. But Martin's relatives, including his cousin Ronquavis Fulton, have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is Trayvon Martin's. Audio experts Tom Owen and Ed Primeau, who analyzed the recordings for the Sentinel using different techniques, said they don't believe it is Zimmerman who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call. They compared the screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a ""suspicious"" black male. ""There's a huge chance that this is not Zimmerman's voice,"" said Primeau, a longtime audio engineer who is listed as an expert in recorded evidence by the American College of Forensic Examiners International. ""After 28 years of doing this, I would put my reputation on the line and say this is not George Zimmerman screaming."" What witnesses say . Owen, a forensic audio analyst and chairman emeritus of the American Board of Recorded Evidence, also said he does not believe the screams came from Zimmerman. He cited software that is widely used in Europe and has become recently accepted in the United States that examines characteristics like pitch and the space between spoken words to analyze voices. Using it, he found a 48% likelihood the voice is Zimmerman's. At least 60% is necessary to feel confident two samples are from the same source, he told CNN on Monday -- meaning it's unlikely it was Zimmerman who can be heard yelling. The experts, both of whom said they have testified in cases involving audio analysis, stressed they cannot say who was screaming. But CNN and HLN legal analysts Beth Karas and Sonny Hostin raised questions about what the public should consider regarding the conclusions reached. Hostin said several questions and variables must be considered, including the fact the tests did not analyze similar speech. That is, the analysis was based on screams heard from a distance in a 911 call, compared with a direct phone conversation Zimmerman had with a 911 operator. ""Ideally, you want (Zimmerman or Martin's) voice saying the same exact thing, screaming 'Help!' in order to analyze it,"" she said. Would these tests be admissible in court and considered evidence? ""It really depends on the individual judge,"" Hostin said. ""In Florida, they are going to conduct a Frye test, the legal test, which asks if the science is generally accepted in the community."" Karas questioned whether the test stood up to the voice-comparison standards of the American Board of Recorded Evidence. The standards indicate that, when analyzing speech, there should be a minimum of at least 10 words to be compared with each other in order to say you can have a ""possible elimination"" conclusion. But in this case, the cries for help don't have nearly that number of words. Owen said the published American Board of Recorded Evidence standards apply only partially to the kind of test he conducted. ""These standards apply to the older aural-spectrographic analysis and software,"" Owen said. ""This only partially applies to the biometric software."" Both Karas and Hostin urged caution in reaching any conclusions about the findings of Primeau and Owen. ""I do think we need to take a step back, as with most of the facts in this case, and look at it the way the court would,"" Hostin said. ""And that is by asking if the circumstances of how, and if, the test was done, OK, and wait to determine whether it's reliable."" The ongoing friction from the incident has continued to divide Sanford and the country. But Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett said Tuesday he senses that people in his community are ready to start trying to move on. ""I think there's a big portion of the city that are trying to get to the healing mode,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Justice Department civil rights prosecutors have concluded there was no wrongdoing in an FBI agent's shooting of Ibragim Todashev, an associate of the alleged mastermind of the Boston Marathon bombing who was killed in a scuffle with agents during questioning, U.S. law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said. The finding concurs with an FBI internal review of the shooting, which supported the agent's account. It also matches what the Florida state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties has found in his investigation. Evidence reviewed includes photos of the agent showing his injuries, the officials said. The federal review is expected to be released next week, alongside the review by the state investigators. The Justice Department's civil rights division routinely does ""color of law"" reviews of such shootings to look into whether there are any civil rights violations by federal agents. The shooting occurred on May 22, 2013, as Massachusetts state troopers, accompanied by FBI agents, questioned Todashev, 27, in his apartment in an Orlando suburb, according to U.S. law enforcement officials. Massachusetts investigators were pursuing information about a grisly 2011 triple murder that they thought could have been tied to Todashev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who allegedly carried out the deadly bombing last April with his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed as he and his brother confronted police in the days after the bombing. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later arrested and jailed. He's awaiting trial. Todashev's shooting has raised questions about the FBI's handling of the matter, because any evidence he could have provided is now lost. Todashev's family has disputed that he posed any threat to the law enforcement officers and agents in his apartment. ""My son was definitely unarmed, because he never had a gun,"" his father, Abdulbaki Todashev, told CNN in Moscow in a June 2013 interview. ""He couldn't attack them or fight them; he couldn't do anything because even two men could easily handle him."" U.S. law enforcement officials said Todashev made statements implicating himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the murders. The FBI had interviewed Todashev before about the Marathon bombing because he was a friend who, like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, trained in martial arts, and the two were friends. He was cooperative, and the FBI didn't consider him to be involved. The subsequent questioning came at the request of Massachusetts investigators who had begun taking a new look at the killings outside of Boston in Waltham, Massachusetts. After several hours of questioning, U.S. law enforcement officials said he lunged at the agent.","Ibragim Todashev knew the alleged Boston Marathon bombings mastermind .

"(CNN) -- He may have fallen at the first hurdle at the All England Club last year, but Rafael Nadal managed to avoid another shock first-round defeat 12 months on. The Spaniard crashed out to Steve Darcis in 2013 -- his first ever opening-round loss at a grand slam -- yet was able to see off Slovakia's Martin Klizan 4-6 6-3 6-3 6-3 this time around, despite an early scare on Centre Court. The World No. 1 came into the competition in good form having claimed a ninth French Open championship just a few weeks ago, yet the Spaniard found himself one set down after Klizan, ranked 51st in the world, managed to break to take a 5-4 lead in the opener. That early sting, however, seemed to awaken Nadal from his slumber as the tournament's second seed began to find his rhythm and went on to claim three straight sets to wrap up the victory. ""For me, always emotions are so high when I'm able to play on this Centre Court,"" Nadal told reporters afterwards. ""It's a magic place and unbelievable memories from this court so I'm very happy to be able to play on it again and for sure go out with a victory."" The win for Nadal, who is now just three Grand Slam titles off Roger Federer's record haul of 17 after his latest success at Roland Garros, sets up a second-round tie against Lukas Rosol. Nadal will need no reminding that the Czech player dumped him out of the tournament at the same stage two years ago. ""Rosol is a very dangerous player, very strong, very powerful shots from the baseline and I know I have to play very well if I want to have chances to win,"" Nadal said. ""The important thing is to fight, play with the right tactic and wait for the luck."" Seven-time champion Roger Federer began his 2014 campaign with a straight-sets victory over Paolo Lorenzi on Court No. 1. The World No. 4, whose last grand slam win was at Wimbledon in 2012, raced to a 6-1 6-1 6-3 win and was always in control of a match that lasted one hour and 33 minutes. Fifth seed Stanislas Wawrinka booked his spot in the second round with a victory over Joao Sousa. The Australian Open champion looked comfortable as he saw off his Portuguese opponent in straight sets with a 6-3 6-4 6-3 win and will next face Yen-Hsun Lu. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, meanwhile, wrapped things up in extremely quick fashion against Jurgen Melzer after their match was suspended on Monday evening due to bad light. Needing to claim just a game to advance to the second round with the scores at 6-1 3-6 3-6 6-2, the 14th seed racked up four straight points off his serve to win the final set 6-4. Jerzy Janowicz, last year's Wimbledon semifinalist, set up a second-round clash with Leyton Hewitt after beating Somdev Devvarman in a five-set thriller. After losing the first set, the 15th seed hit back and was eventually taken into a decider by Devvarman, to which he held his nerve to run out a 4-6 6-3 6-3 3-6 6-3 winner. Former champion Hewitt advanced after defeating Michal Przysiezny 6-2 6-7 6-1 6-4. Japan's Kei Nishikori overcame his first hurdle of the competition in Kenny De Schepper of France with a straight-sets victory. The 10th seed was made to work, however, and had to edge a tiebreak 7-5 in the second set en route to a 6-4 7-6 7-5 win. His reward is a second-round tie against American Denis Kudla. Sharapova and Serena advance . The women's competition also resumed Tuesday as Maria Sharapova, fresh from success at the French Open earlier this month, took just 58 minutes to book her place in the second round. The fifth seed dropped just one game as she saw off Samantha Murray of Great Britain 6-1 6-0 to set up a tie against Timea Bacsinszky for a place in round three. Serena Williams also made untroubled progress into the second round coasting past compatriot Anna Tatishvili in straight sets 6-1 6-2. Top seed Williams is seeking a sixth Wimbledon singles crown and an 18th grand slam singles title overall. ""The reaction from the crowd has been great,"" Williams told reporters after the match. ""I love playing at Wimbledon. You dream of playing here when you're really young. ""To still be playing here is a great honor for me. Every time I step out on that court, it makes me want to keep coming back for years and years."" Sabine Lisicki, who beat Williams in the fourth round last year, also got her campaign off to a winning start as she saw off Israel's Julia Glushko winning 6-2 6-1. The 19th seed will be hoping to go one better at Wimbledon this time around after losing to France's Marion Bartoli in the 2013 final, will next play Karolina Pliskova. Agnieszka Radwanska was equally efficient in her dispensing of Andreea Mitu as she also dropped only three games on the way to a first-round win. The fourth seed raced to a 6-2 6-1 defeat of Romanian Mitu to set up a second-round tie against Casey Dellacqua. Radwanska's younger sister Urszula won't be taking any further part though after going down in straight sets 6-2 6-4 to ninth seed Angelique Kerber from Germany. Caroline Wozniacki is also safely through to the next round after knocking out Shahar Peer. The 16th seed, who has never made it past the fourth round of the competition, will meet Naomi Broady of Great Britain in the next stage after defeating Peer 6-3 6-0. There was disappointment for Sara Errani, however, as the 14th seed was forced to pack her bags early after suffering a three-set defeat at the hands of Caroline Garcia. Despite losing the first set, Garcia fought back with a 2-6 7-6 7-5 win to set up a meet with Varvara Lepchenko next time out.","Rafael Nadal begins his 2014 Wimbledon campaign with a win .

"MURRAYVILLE, Georgia (CNN)  -- A few weeks before 13-year-old Jonathan King killed himself, he told his parents that his teachers had put him in ""time-out."" The room where Jonathan King hanged himself is shown after his death. It is no longer used, a school official said. ""We thought that meant go sit in the corner and be quiet for a few minutes,"" Tina King said, tears washing her face as she remembered the child she called ""our baby ... a good kid."" But time-out in the boy's north Georgia special education school was spent in something akin to a prison cell -- a concrete room latched from the outside, its tiny window obscured by a piece of paper. Called a seclusion room, it's where in November 2004, Jonathan hanged himself with a cord a teacher gave him to hold up his pants.  Watch Jonathan's parents on their son's death » . An attorney representing the school has denied any wrongdoing. Seclusion rooms, sometimes called time-out rooms, are used across the nation, generally for special needs children. Critics say that along with the death of Jonathan, many mentally disabled and autistic children have been injured or traumatized. Few states have laws on using seclusion rooms, though 24 states have written guidelines, according to a 2007 study conducted by a Clemson University researcher. Texas, which was included in that study, has stopped using seclusion and restraint. Georgia has just begun to draft guidelines, four years after Jonathan's death. Based on conversations with officials in 22 states with written guidelines, seclusion is intended as a last resort when other attempts to calm a child have failed or when a student is hurting himself or others. Michigan requires that a child held in seclusion have constant supervision from an instructor trained specifically in special education, and that confinement not exceed 15 minutes. Connecticut education spokesman Tom Murphy said ""time-out rooms"" were used sparingly and were ""usually small rooms with padding on the walls."" Only Vermont tracks how many children are kept in seclusion from year to year, though two other states, Minnesota and New Mexico, say they have been using the rooms less frequently in recent years. Dr. Veronica Garcia, New Mexico's education secretary, said her state had found more sophisticated and better ways to solve behavior problems. Garcia, whose brother is autistic, said, ""The idea of confining a child in a room repeatedly and as punishment, that's an ethics violation I would never tolerate."" But researchers say that the rooms, in some cases, are being misused and that children are suffering. Public schools in the United States are now educating more than half a million more students with disabilities than they did a decade ago, according to the National Education Association. ""Teachers aren't trained to handle that,"" said Dr. Roger Pierangelo, executive director of the National Association of Special Education Teachers. ""When you have an out-of-control student threatening your class -- it's not right and it can be very damaging -- but seclusion is used as a 'quick fix' in many cases."" Former Rhode Island special education superintendent Leslie Ryan told CNN that she thought she was helping a disabled fifth-grader by keeping him in a ""chill room"" in the basement of a public elementary school that was later deemed a fire hazard. ""All I know is I tried to help this boy, and I had very few options,"" Ryan said. After the public learned of the room, she resigned from her post with the department but remains with the school. School records do not indicate why Jonathan King was repeatedly confined to the concrete room or what, if any, positive outcome was expected. His parents say they don't recognize the boy described in records as one who liked to kick and punch his classmates. They have launched a wrongful death lawsuit against the school -- the Alpine Program in Gainesville -- which has denied any wrongdoing. A Georgia judge is expected to rule soon on whether the case can be brought before a jury. Jonathan's parents say the boy had been diagnosed since kindergarten with severe depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But his father remembers him as a boy who was happy when he sang in the church choir. ""He was a hugger, liked to go fishing with me and run after me saying, 'Daddy, when are we going to the lake?' "" Don King said. King said that he wanted to know if there were similar situations in other schools and that critics of seclusion rooms fear there could be. ""Jonathan's case is the worst of the worst, but it should be a warning. It's reasonable to think that it could happen in all the other schools that use seclusion on disabled children -- largely because the use of seclusion goes so unchecked,"" said Jane Hudson, an attorney with the National Disability Rights Network. ""This is one of those most unregulated, unresearched areas I've come across,"" said Joseph Ryan, a Clemson University special education researcher who has worked in schools for disabled kids and co-authored a study on the use of seclusion. ""You have very little oversight in schools of these rooms -- first because the general public doesn't really even know they exist,"" he said. There is no national database tracking seclusion incidents in schools, though many have been described in media reports, lawsuits, disability advocacy groups' investigations and on blogs catering to parents who say their child had been held in seclusion. Disability Rights California, a federally funded watchdog group, found that teachers dragged children into seclusion rooms they could not leave. In one case, they found a retarded 8-year-old had been locked alone in a seclusion room in a northeast California elementary school for at least 31 days in a year. ""What we found outrageous was that we went to the schools and asked to see the rooms and were denied,"" said Leslie Morrison, a psychiatric nurse and attorney who led the 2007 investigation that substantiated at least six cases of abuse involving seclusion in public schools. ""It took a lot of fighting to eventually get in to see where these children were held."" CNN asked every school official interviewed if a reporter could visit a seclusion room and was denied every time. In other instances of alleged abuse: . • A Tennessee mother alleged in a federal suit against the Learn Center in Clinton that her 51-pound 9-year-old autistic son was bruised when school instructors used their body weight on his legs and torso to hold him down before putting him in a ""quiet room"" for four hours. Principal Gary Houck of the Learn Center, which serves disabled children, said lawyers have advised him not to discuss the case. • Eight-year-old Isabel Loeffler, who has autism, was held down by her teachers and confined in a storage closet where she pulled out her hair and wet her pants at her Dallas County, Iowa, elementary school. Last year, a judge found that the school had violated the girl's rights. ""What we're talking about is trauma,"" said her father, Doug Loeffler. ""She spent hours in wet clothes, crying to be let out."" Waukee school district attorney Matt Novak told CNN that the school has denied any wrongdoing. • A mentally retarded 14-year-old in Killeen, Texas, died from his teachers pressing on his chest in an effort to restrain him in 2001. Texas passed a law to limit both restraint and seclusion in schools because the two methods are often used together. Federal law requires that schools develop behavioral plans for students with disabilities. These plans are supposed to explicitly explain behavior problems and methods the teacher is allowed to use to stop it, including using music to calm a child or allowing a student to take a break from schoolwork. A behavioral plan for Jonathan King, provided to CNN by the Kings' attorney, shows that Jonathan was confined in the seclusion room on 15 separate days for infractions ranging from cursing and threatening other students to physically striking classmates. Howard ""Sandy"" Addis, the director of the Pioneer education agency which oversees Alpine, said that the room where Jonathan died is no longer in use. Citing the ongoing litigation, he declined to answer questions about the King case but defended the use of seclusion for ""an emergency safety situation."" The Alpine Program's attorney, Phil Hartley, said Jonathan's actions leading up to his suicide did not suggest the boy was ""serious"" about killing himself. Jonathan's actions were an ""effort to get attention,"" Hartley said. ""This is a program designed for students with severe emotional disabilities and problems,"" he said. ""It is a program which frequently deals with students who use various methods of getting attention, avoiding work."" A substitute employee placed in charge of watching the room on the day Jonathan died said in an affidavit that he had no training in the use of seclusion, and didn't know Jonathan had threatened suicide weeks earlier. The Kings say they would have removed their son from the school if they knew he was being held in seclusion, or that he had expressed a desire to hurt himself. ""We would have home schooled him or taken him to another psychologist,"" said Don King. ""If we would have known, our boy would have never been in that room. He would still be alive.""","Mentally disabled, autistic kids injured, traumatized in school seclusion rooms .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has gone to Mexico, the apparent epicenter of the swine flu outbreak where more than 100 people have died in suspected cases. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, reporting outside a Mexico City hospital, says people can't get swine flu by eating pork. With governments scrambling to prevent further outbreak, Gupta appeared Monday on CNN to address people's concerns. CNN: We got a question that comes to us over Twitter. This question, ""I heard that you can't contract swine flu from eating pork. Is that true? If so, why? Does cooking or curing pork destroy the virus?"" Gupta: It is true. You cannot catch it from eating the pork. And it is true that cooking it to a certain temperature, around 160 degrees, also inactivates most of the pathogens in the pork as well.  Follow Gupta on Twitter for swine flu updates . Also keep in mind, this is mainly an airborne thing or something that lives on inanimate objects, so people touch the virus, then they touch their mouth, they touch their nose, they touch their eyes. That seems to be the most common mode of transmission. CNN: Another question that we have we haven't gotten to, actually, which is an important question, also on Twitter. ""If a person has had the flu shot this year, is he or she protected? Does this person have a better chance of getting it, or would it just be a milder case?"" Thank you. That's from John Martin in Rome, New York. So what's the answer, doc?  Watch Gupta on the outbreak in Mexico » . Gupta: Well, it doesn't appear that the flu shot really offers much in the way of protection, although it may offer some, and here's why. This particular virus seems to be a combination of several different strains: two strains of swine flu, one strain of bird flu and one strain of human flu. It's the human flu that that flu shot may protect slightly against. So you're protecting against a part of the virus if that makes any sense. But it's a very good idea to get your flu shot, for sure. Always think about that. But in terms of protecting for swine flu, it's not going to be enough. CNN: We've got another question ... via Twitter this morning. And this is a question, of course, everybody is wanting to know the answer to: ""Could this strain get out of control and mutate into something similar to the 1918 pandemic?"" iReport: Are you worried about swine flu? Gupta: Well, when you look at pandemics, they have several different qualities. They're usually a virus or some sort of pathogen the world has never seen before. They cause a lot of death, and they're sustainable in populations. We know that this is a new virus. It is very hard to figure out just how deadly this is yet. We know that over 100 people have died here in Mexico, but we don't know out of how many people who got sick. There are about 1,300 people who had serious illness, but there may be thousands more who had mild illness who never went to the hospital. So it's hard to tell how lethal this is.  See scenes from Mexico » . So, you know, on one hand, in 1918, you didn't have global air travel. Nowadays, you do. So this virus can move around the world a lot faster. But right now, it doesn't seem like it's as lethal. You know, it's just early in this whole process to be able to tell.  Learn more about swine flu » . CNN: Sanjay, one question that we haven't gotten to ... most of the people who died from swine flu in Mexico were in the prime of their lives really, and this usually hits infants or the elderly. What does that say to you as a doctor? Gupta: This is interesting. And the same thing happened in sort of a nonintuitive way when we were talking about SARS and when we were talking about avian flu. Think about it like this: Typically, you think of someone who has a weakened immune system, who's going to be most adversely affected by an infection. Their immune system simply can't fight it. But in these cases, it's the immune system itself that reacts robustly, and it's the immune system in that reaction to the virus that is causing death in these patients. So the virus starts that cascade, but all that fluid builds up in the lungs, and all those inflammatory cells throughout the body -- that's what's causing the problem. We saw the same thing with SARS and with avian flu as well. Which is why exactly as you said ... [people in their] 20s and 30s and 40s, this hospital behind me, they say that's been the bulk of their patients with regard to swine flu. CNN: You know, Sanjay, everybody knows that you're the sort of doctor that gets out there in the thick of things whenever something happens around the world -- any kind of public health emergency or disaster. And you're there in Mexico City, and a lot of people at home might be thinking, why the heck would Dr. Gupta want to go to a place where there's disease outbreak. What are you doing to protect yourself? Gupta: Well, we are trying to -- you know, we're clearly being very cautious here. We're not taking any chances. These masks can be helpful. But, you know, this is going to sound simple, but simply washing our hands. This is a virus that lives on keyboards, lives on money. We don't shake hands with people. That's the way it's probably being spread, and that's what we're trying to avoid. But this is where it started. If we figure out what happened here, we may figure out what happened in the rest of the world.

"(HLN) -- The discovery of a blond-haired, blue-eyed young girl in a Roma camp in Greece last week immediately caught the attention of several families in the United States. Could this disheveled girl with mysterious origins, known as Maria, be one of America's missing? Could she even be ""Baby Lisa"" Irwin, the girl who disappeared two years ago from her Missouri home? Though the apparent age difference makes this a stretch -- Baby Lisa, though not a baby anymore, would only be about 3 now, and Maria is estimated to be about 5 or 6 -- the mystery of the girl's identity seems to have provided a tantalizing bit of hope to the Irwin family, and to other families who hold vigil for their missing children. The FBI says it has gotten thousands of calls from people claiming to have clues as to who Maria is and where she belongs. The Greek children's rights group Smile of the Child says it is looking into about 10 missing children cases in connection with Maria, and several of the cases are in the United States. That's 10 families whose hope will be reignited, and 10 families whose pain may be made fresh once again if the lead doesn't pan out. Few know the fleeting moments of hope -- and anguish -- associated with the search for a missing child like Dave Holloway, the father of Natalee Holloway, the Alabama teen who went missing on a trip to Aruba in 2005. The Holloway case captivated the country, and even now from time to time, a new lead in the case will make headlines. 'A never-ending story' In an interview with HLN, Holloway said he is currently interested in one such lead. There is a Dutch man in Aruba, he said, who claims to know where Natalee's body was hidden. Holloway is a bit skeptical, but if the information seems promising, he'll follow through. This is the life of a parent who has seen every side of his child's tragedy laid bare for the public: The panic, the hope, the feelings of resignation and the never-ending quest for answers. Holloway says he doesn't mind the media attention. If anything, he appreciates it. He wants it. Any coverage gets the family closer to finding out the truth. ""If the media is not attacking it, the [Aruban] authorities aren't interested,"" he said. ""Of all of the thousands of cases involving missing children, the parents have always yearned for media attention."" Over the years, Holloway has worked with numerous families and support groups for parents with missing children. In addition to all of the grief he has felt and witnessed, another emotion surfaces, as well: Guilt. When a child is lost, it at first seems as if the options are inexhaustible. As time passes, the leads become fewer, the attention dies down and Holloway said, some parents he has met are left grasping at straws. ""There's a lot of guilt,"" he said. ""I ran into individuals that felt like they maybe could have done more, keep pushing and pushing, and maybe something will get done."" Natalee Holloway was declared dead in 2012. It was her father who filed the petition. It wasn't, he said, for emotional closure. ""At some point in time, you've got to take care of some legal issues. She was still listed as a beneficiary -- there's insurance, savings accounts."" Dave Holloway had started a college fund for Natalee that had to be used by the time she turned 21. Her 21st birthday came and went in 2007, and she wasn't there to collect it. ""Time eventually takes care of the healing process,"" Holloway said. ""But for us, it's like a never-ending story."" The Holloways are certain they know who can tell them about their daughter's disappearance. Unfortunately, that man is languishing in a Peruvian prison. Dutch national Joran Van Der Sloot was a prime suspect in Holloway's disappearance, and his ever-changing claims regarding his involvement kept the media, and the Holloways, on a tight leash. He was indicted by the United States for fraud and extortion in connection with the case. However, in 2012, he pleaded guilty to the murder of a young woman in Lima, and is currently serving a 28-year sentence. For the Holloways, that means their quest for justice has been put on an excruciating, lengthy hold. ""Somebody knows the answers, and someone is withholding,"" Holloway said of Van Der Sloot. Holloway said he and his family had been frustrated by the authorities in Aruba, and now, they must abide by the Peruvian justice system as well. ""It's never going to end for us, as far as justice is concerned."" 'I feel like she's OK' Just two weeks ago, the parents of Lisa Irwin observed the second anniversary of their daughter's disappearance. Lisa, just an infant at the time of her disappearance, was reported by her parents as having been kidnapped during a home invasion. During a recent vigil in front of their St. Louis home, Lisa's mother, Deborah Bradley, clutched a time-lapse portrait of her daughter and said, through tears, that she still had hope that Lisa was alive. ""My mother's intuition ... is that, I feel like she's OK,"" Bradley said. Bradley and Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, still keep Lisa's bedroom intact, as if she will come home at any minute. It is filled with outfits and gifts the couple has bought their child for milestones she has not been present to observe. When Bradley speaks of her daughter, it is in the present tense. When news of the Roma girl Maria began to surface, the Irwin family reached out to the FBI, and despite the doubts as to the connection between the cases, is working with the agency to determine whether the girl is their lost daughter. And even if she isn't, the family's faith seemingly remains stalwart. ""I have no doubt"" that she is going to come home, Bradley said. 'It consumes you' Dave Holloway doesn't wait by the phone anymore, hoping for news of his daughter's safe return. Too much has happened, too much time has passed. At some point, he said, you have to set your highest hopes aside. ""In the beginning, it all consumes you. Everything in your life takes second place, goes on the back burner,"" he said. ""It consumes you, but you can't let it after a time. There are other things in life, family members. We lost so much time with our other children searching for Natalee."" He likened it to losing sight of a young child; that instinctual, paralyzing moment of fear. Except the moment doesn't stop. And you can't stay paralyzed forever. ""You exhaust all your leads, and finally, you're at the point where there's nothing else to do,"" he said. ""I feel for those families who are totally clueless. At least we know who is responsible for our daughter's disappearance. They have no idea. At least we know."" 'We are not alone' For the families of missing children, there is always a hope, no matter how small. For the Irwin family, their hope is kept alive by newfound worldwide attention. In an interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Deborah Bradley said she has received an outpouring of support from friends and strangers around the world. ""It has really shown us that we are not alone in our search for Lisa,"" she said in the interview. ""We're in awe at the amount of compassion and care, and the fact that there are so many people that are looking for her right along with us.""","Discovery of 'Maria' has reignited hope for families of missing children .

"(CNN) -- It was barely floating, perhaps minutes from sinking, a small skiff, washed up against an unforgiving cement breakwater. The flat-bottomed boat was homemade, cobbled together with no evident craftsmanship, from scarce and salvaged materials. It was about 14 feet long and 4 feet wide, with a hand-hewn pole for a mast and fallen sails that looked like burlap. As waves and a relentless tide drove it into the concrete wall, the boat was going under, surrendering to the ocean that had brought it to Key Largo, Florida. A small crowd had gathered. Some were taking pictures. My wife and I asked what was happening. One in the group told us that some men came over from Cuba in this boat the previous night. They had given themselves to the ocean and whatever fate their desperate journey might bring them. They had traveled nearly 200 miles, day and night, through rough and open waters, sailing this pitiful craft on pitiless seas. Local security had found them, walking around, lost. They had no destination beyond America. They were picked up and turned over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We asked how many there were. Someone in the group told us, ""Nine men risked their lives to come to the United States on this."" What is exceptional about this story is that it is not exceptional. Immigrants constantly risk not only their own lives, but also their children's, for the economic opportunity we enjoy with indifference. While these men apparently were from Cuba, covered by the decades-old ""wet-foot-dry-foot"" Cuban immigration policy, a trickle of immigrants from Central America has suddenly become a flood of women and children, swamping our border security offices. Tens of thousands of Guatemalans and Ecuadorians have been drawn by the luster of an American economy we find tarnished. Unlike those nine Cuban men, however, these immigrants have an additional reason for coming: President Barack Obama invited them here. As Byron York explained in the Washington Examiner, ""President Obama's DACA decree -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which allowed thousands of illegal immigrants to stay in this country if they came at a young age -- created, in effect, a magnet for young people to try to enter the U.S. illegally."" This degree, announced in June 2012, allows immigrant children to stay if they had been in the United States continuously from June 2007 to June 2012. Some say, however, the decree has swept through Central America. According to The Washington Post, a recent leaked memo by Border Patrol agents spoke of this wave of new immigrants, saying they were motivated to come now, in this surge, because they had heard of the change in U.S. policy that would allow them to remain in America. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals must have sounded like popular politics to this President, yet it was cruelty disguised as kindness. Our President's incompetence has created a humanitarian crisis: He has lured an endless stream of children and mothers to risk everything to travel here. We are a country divided today. The prevailing debate is what is wrong with America and who among us should be blamed for it. Yesterday's newcomers blame today's arrivals. Those who have already walked through the golden door of opportunity would ungenerously close it behind them. We confront each other over what we lack, forgetting the greatness we have built together and how much better we could still be. Democrats demand too much of immigration reform. Republicans demand too little. The stalemate serves both their political ambitions. And as we watch men risking their lives on what can barely be called a boat and children desperately throwing themselves across our borders, we harbor a shame: No immigration reform will pass Congress this year. Perhaps both Democrats and Republicans should remember: Once, many of our families, in either this or a previous incarnation, came here as immigrants, seeking a better life and freedom. Imagine that you are one of the nine men on that boat. Or a muddied child in the Rio Grande. We may never be called upon to make those journeys, but what would each of us risk to live in the greatest country in human history? Much more, it appears, than our leaders would risk so we can keep living there.

"(CNN) -- A judge will determine this week whether there's enough evidence to keep in jail a Georgia man whose son died in a hot SUV. Justin Ross Harris, who is charged with murder and second-degree child cruelty, will go before a judge Thursday for a probable cause hearing. Police say Harris left his 22-month-old son, Cooper, strapped into a car seat under a baking sun for seven hours while he went to work. The boy died, and Harris sits in jail without bail. He has pleaded not guilty. At a probable cause hearing, the prosecution tries to convince the judge that a crime has been committed and the defendant committed it. Internet searches . Among the tidbits police have released about the case is that Harris and his wife, Leanna, told them that they conducted Internet searches on how hot a car needed to get to kill a child. ""During an interview with Justin, he stated that he recently researched, through the Internet, child deaths inside vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for that to occur,"" police said. ""Justin stated that he was fearful that this could happen."" During questioning, Leanna Harris ""made similar statements regarding researching in car deaths and how it occurs,"" police said. The time frame for when this alleged research took place remains unclear. Wife stands by Harris . Cooper, who died June 18, was buried Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. At his funeral, Leanna Harris said she loves her husband and stands by him. ""Am I angry with Ross?"" Leanna Harris told a crowd at the funeral. ""Absolutely not. It has never crossed my mind. Ross is and was and will be, if we have more children, a wonderful father. Ross is a wonderful daddy and leader for our household. Cooper meant the world to him."" Harris calls in . Though Harris wasn't allowed out of the Cobb County Jail to attend the funeral, he called in and spoke to the entire auditorium on speakerphone. ""Thank you for everything you've done for my boy,"" he said. ""Good life. (Inaudible) No words to say. Just horrible. (Inaudible) I'm just sorry I can't be there."" "" He told everyone he loved them and started crying again. Carol Brown, a longtime family friend, was one of those in attendance. ""I mean he could have gone to the car and not seen the little boy, if the boy was sleeping, or you know ... it could happen,"" she said. ""He could have been distracted. But I do have questions about it."" Timeline of events . Initially, police described the death of the toddler as the result of tragic absent-mindedness. They said the dad had apparently forgotten the boy was in the back seat of his Hyundai Tucson; he didn't remember until he was done with his workday, drove a couple of miles and pulled into a shopping center parking lot. But suspicions grew as police investigated. On the day Cooper died, his father stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said. He drove to his workplace, a Home Depot corporate office, about a half-mile away. He works as a Web designer there. Usually, he would take his son to an on-site day care. But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat. During his lunch break, he returned to his car, opening the driver's side door to put something inside, police said. After work, around 4:16 p.m., the 33-year-old father got in his car and drove away. A few miles away, he stopped the car at a shopping center and called for help. When it became clear Cooper was dead, Harris was so inconsolable police had to restrain him. ""What have I done?"" he wailed as he tried to resuscitate the boy. The Cobb County medical examiner's office found the child's cause of death ""consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide,"" according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety statement issued last week. Temperatures hit 92 degrees Fahrenheit on the day of Cooper's death. The medical examiner's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler's death.

"(CNN) -- Mario Colao jolted out of bed at 3 in the morning. He was covered in sweat, his left arm was completely numb and his heart was pounding violently. He started crying because he was terrified of what was happening to him. That night in January 2010 was the third time in two weeks his sleep had been interrupted by heart attack-like symptoms, and he thought he knew why. ""It's sad to say, but I felt like I deserved this because I never took care of myself,"" Colao says. He was 28, weighed 460 pounds and wore size 6X clothing. He knew his habits of binge drinking, smoking two packs of cigarettes a day and overindulging in food were slowly killing him. ""I asked God to give me another chance,"" Colao says, ""and I passed out."" The Chicago native had been overweight since childhood. He was born into an Italian family where food was at the center of everything. His parents worked long hours, so his grandfather played a large role in raising him. In school, Colao was bullied because of his weight, and his grandfather was his only friend. But when Colao was 9, his grandfather died. He turned to food to comfort the loneliness he felt. ""Food became a total escape,"" he says. ""I always considered it my drug."" The weight kept piling on through adolescence and beyond. At 18, he started smoking. He began to drink heavily when he was 22. All the while he continued to eat unhealthy foods day and night. On his blog, I've Said It All Before, Colao gives examples of some of his regular meals at the time. One included two burgers, a large soda, large French fries and chicken nuggets, totaling more than 2,400 calories. By 2010, Colao was drinking up to 10 drinks in one night and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. But after those scary symptoms kept waking him up, he made a pact with himself to change. ""I quit smoking and stopped eating everything that was bad,"" he says. Colao's parents bought him a treadmill because he was uncomfortable exercising in a gym. ""That's what really helped me the most -- being able to gain the physical and mental stability and work out on my own,"" he recalls. He started by walking and slowly worked his way up to jogging and weightlifting. Colao overhauled his diet as well. He stopped eating fast food, fried food and red meat and drinking soda. He forced himself to get accustomed to healthy alternatives while allowing himself to indulge in small things so he wouldn't feel overwhelmed. He was motivated to change his eating habits by realizing how much time he would have to exercise to burn off the foods he was consuming. Over the first couple of months, Colao dropped 50 pounds. The loss drove him to continue, and he set a goal of losing 200 pounds. When he had lost down to 305 pounds, Colao went through a difficult breakup and eased up on his calorie counting and exercising habits. Six months later, he had gained back 40 pounds. Scared he would continue gaining weight, he got back on the wagon. ""I ended up being so angry at how bad I had gotten again, that I forced myself to get back on track,"" he remembers. He began monitoring his caloric intake again and started exercising two hours a day, five days a week. As a reward for reaching his goal of a 200-pound weight loss, Colao booked a trip to Philadelphia to run up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and re-create a famous scene from the movie ""Rocky."" He was on course to hit his goal when a foot fracture sidelined him for a few weeks. When the trip to Philadelphia approached, Colao had lost 185 pounds and was just shy of his goal. Regardless, he decided to go and run up those stairs. Colao finally hit his goal weight of 260 pounds in October. He still wants to lose another 20 to 30 pounds, but his focus has moved toward challenging himself with new exercises. He's also weightlifting to tone up some loose skin that has developed around his arms and stomach. Through his journey, Colao has found support and motivation in his parents and girlfriend, Julia Gonzalez. He says he still struggles to see himself in his slimmer body, and Gonzalez pushes him to look on the bright side. ""I'm always going to be a positive voice for him to remember what a great thing he's accomplished,"" she says. ""He inspires so many people. People see him, and they realize that they can do it, too."" Colao is using his experience to become a certified personal trainer. ""My main desire is to help people like me -- people that are obese and feel hopeless about the situation,"" he says. Four years ago, Colao could not tie his shoes without losing his breath. A few weeks ago, he did a push-up for the first time. In two months, he hopes to be a certified personal trainer and well on his way to helping others reach their weight-loss goals.","Mario Colao has lost 200 pounds in just under four years .

"(CNN) -- The Italian navy rescued 730 migrants from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily, it said Wednesday. The migrants, who departed in two boats from North Africa, are being taken to a port in Sicily's Agrigento province, the navy said in a statement. Those rescued include 124 women and 29 children, it said. The overcrowded boats were losing buoyancy and the migrants were not equipped with life jackets, the navy added. Italy is a major gateway into Europe for migrants who come by sea from North Africa in hope of reaching EU soil. Shipwrecks off the shores of its Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Lampedusa are common, thanks to the frequent use of overcrowded and barely seaworthy vessels. But despite the dangers, migrants keep coming. Some of the migrants are from African nations, particularly Eritrea and Somalia, while others have fled war-torn Syria, officials say. According to the European border agency Frontex, more than 12,000 illegal migrants were detected off Sicily and 8,000 off Lampedusa in the third quarter of last year. Many of those arriving on Italy's shores have set sail from Libya, the agency said. The deaths of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off Lampedusa last October shocked Italy and the world, and led to calls for EU lawmakers to review their migration policies. International organizations such as the U.N. refugee agency have called on European and other leaders to try to address the root causes of migration and to create legal alternatives to dangerous sea crossings. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report .","Rescued migrants, who set sail from North Africa, are being taken to a Sicilian port .

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book, ""Late Edition: A Love Story,"" will be published next month. Bob Greene recalls Farrah Fawcett's cheerful greetings to the crew every morning on a movie set. (CNN) -- She would come walking across the lawn just after sunrise. The days and nights had been long; everyone else, as darkness turned into dawn, looked wrung out and worn down and weary. She just glowed. ""Morning!"" she would say, flashing that zillion-watt smile, greeting each of us by name. ""Morning, Farrah,"" we would say back, feeling gray and dull in her presence. This was at the La Quinta resort near Palm Springs, California, almost 20 years ago. The only piece of writing of mine that was ever turned into a feature film was being shot there. Farrah was one of the female leads. At least she, and we, thought she was. More on that later. She seemed to be an awfully nice person. That much I can tell you, from my limited time with her as she made that movie. She did her best to try to make the people around her forget just how all-reaching her fame was. There is a stratum of renown that is separate from the variety that accrues to most performers; Michael Jackson, who died on the same day as she, knew that type of renown, and so did she. Regardless of the role, she was always destined to be, in the eyes of the public, Farrah. That had to have been both a blessing and an encumbrance. Most people in show business would do just about anything to possess that level of connection with the people out in the seats -- to move through life having everyone in the world feel they know you. It must be difficult, though, to bury yourself in a fictional part when, inside, you are resigned to the idea that, to the unseen ticket buyers in the darkness, you are, now and always, Farrah. Any person with whom she had contact, however brief, would remember it for years. She understood that. She was golden, literally; it was her calling card. At breakfast, on the mornings she would join the crew, we would sit around long wooden catering tables, and there was a what's-wrong-with-this-picture aspect to the scene. These were mundane meals, and she was anything but. Or that's what we thought. Farrah? She was just getting ready to put in a day's work. The movie itself -- it was called ""Funny About Love""-- turned out to be quite forgettable. The male lead was played by Gene Wilder; the three women in his life were played, as the script was written, by Christine Lahti, Mary Stuart Masterson and Farrah. Everyone on the set seemed to get along, but what do I know? I'd never been on another set. After a lifetime of grunted hellos from assistant city editors, this was quite a change. Those dawns on the desert, those cast-and-crew breakfasts, those ""Morning!""s from Farrah as she strolled across the grass. Steve Allen, a luminary in the early days of television and a cogent observer of the world around him, said that when people see a person who is regularly on TV, it is as if the television performer emits a glow. The glow is invisible, yet it's there. And when a person who once was constantly on television suddenly isn't on television anymore, Allen said, it is as if the glow evaporates. It's gone. Maybe he was right -- but with Farrah, the glow endured. It never went away. Another accomplished television performer -- Phil Donahue -- argued that there was no essential difference between Frank Sinatra's fame and the fame of a local TV weathercaster. Donahue's point was that you're either famous or you're not; there's no in-between. If you deliver the weather news on your town's most popular station, then everyone within the county line knows you. You're Sinatra. The theory made a certain sense, but there was that qualitative difference to Farrah's fame. She could not have gotten rid of it if she had wanted to. Yet no one always wins. The most blessed among us are subject to hurt. Here is what happened with that movie that was filmed on the desert: . Months after the final scenes were shot, I received a phone call from one of the producers. Opening weekend was approaching. ""Farrah's not in the movie,"" he said. I didn't process the words. ""She asked for her name to be taken off the credits?"" I said. ""No,"" he said. ""She has been cut out of the final film."" The powers that be with the authority to make such decisions, the story went, after some screenings in front of test audiences had decided that the movie didn't work well with Farrah in it. So every single one of her scenes had been excised. The movie had been recut as if she had never existed. Even when you're golden, it seems, life can blindside you and try to make you feel small. Even when, to those on the outside, it appears that you have everything, it can vanish. Somewhere, in metal film cans on some shelf or other, there are colorful motion images of a beautiful woman doing her job, images the world has never seen. ""Morning!"" she would call on her way to breakfast. She carried the sunrise with her. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Actress Farrah Fawcett worked on the film version of an article I wrote .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine a more powerful indictment of a government's behavior than the one just handed down by a U.N. panel tasked with investigating human rights in North Korea. In a 372-page report, the Commission of Inquiry on Democratic People's Republic of Korea outlined harrowing claims of ""extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape ... and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation."" After years of flouting international pressure over its nuclear program, it's unclear whether these latest allegations are any more likely to alter Pyongyang's behavior. And while there has already been speculation over how things might play out differently this time, many analysts remain skeptical about the prospects for change. Will China please stand up? China is widely seen as having more leverage over North Korea than any other country, not least because it is a vital source of resources. China supplies its neighbor with virtually all of its fuel needs and some 80 percent of all its imports. ""China holds the very survival of the Kim (Jong Un) regime in its hands,"" argues Stephen Yates, deputy assistant to the vice president for national security affairs in the George W. Bush administration. ""North Korea's access to energy, food, and finance is heavily dependent on China,"" says Yates, now CEO of the consultancy firm DC International Advisory. ""Beijing also has decades of relatively close party-to-party and military-to-military relations with Pyongyang, which should be a great advantage in terms of understanding and influencing North Korea's leadership. And of course China is home to hundreds of thousands of North Korean migrants (perhaps more) who earn a living in China while bringing currency and goods back to North Korea."" But as John S. Park, a Northeast Asia specialist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, argues, Beijing is unlikely to back a push for more sanctions anytime soon. ""The Chinese government has already contested the key findings of the Commission's report,"" Park says. ""It's highly unlikely that Beijing will support targeted sanctions"" aimed at members of the regime. ""It would be nice to see the five members of the Six Party talks express support for the report, though there's little chance of China doing this,"" agrees Victor Cha, author of ""Impossible State: North Korea, Past and Future"" and a former director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. So what's behind China's reticence? As the Council on Foreign Relations notes, China has generally resisted the imposition of tough international sanctions on its neighbor in hopes of ""avoiding regime collapse and an influx of refugees across their shared 800-mile border."" And China's Foreign Ministry was certainly quick to dismiss the possibility of taking action over the commission's findings. ""Of course we cannot accept this unreasonable criticism,"" Reuters quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying as saying. ""We believe that politicizing human-rights issues is not conducive towards improving a country's human rights."" Anyone else, then? Park says that individual countries can -- and have -- applied their own targeted sanctions against Pyongyang. But he adds that such measures have had a limited impact because of what he describes as the growing trend of the North Korean regime toward conducting more of its commercial activities inside of China with private companies as partners. ""Chinese authorities deem these commercial activities to be benign economic, development-related interactions,"" Park says, noting that under prior U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions, U.N. member states aren't prohibited from engaging in economic development and humanitarian assistance activities with North Korea. ""This clause constitutes a loophole that directly benefits the regime through its current configuration of commercial activities with private Chinese companies."" What about the United States? So, if China is unwilling to press North Korea more, could the United States act? ""The United States should double down on a strategy of supporting defectors and refugees, barring access to the global financial system for officials complicit in crimes against humanity, and presenting a clear moral choice for the regime -- immediately cease these atrocities or face the consequences,"" says Adrian Hong, managing director of Pegasus Strategies and co-founder and former executive director of U.S.-based Liberty in North Korea, a non-governmental organization. In practical terms, Yates adds that a crucial step for the United States would be doing more -- directly, with allies, or in support of allies -- to get more truthful information into and out of North Korea. ""This may sound overly simple or inconsequential, but it isn't,"" Yates says. ""North Korea may have the most manipulated and politically pulverized population in history. We need to increase access to the truth within North Korea and also raise the international profile of the crimes against humanity within North Korea."" And if nothing else, the U.N. report may have done just that, according to David Kang, director of the Korean Studies Institute at the University of Southern California. ""Everybody who studies North Korea already knew this,"" Kang says. ""But simply having this cataloged by the United Nations makes it difficult to ignore. In that sense, I think the report is important."" Could Kim be prosecuted? In addition to issuing a scathing report, the commission said it would refer its findings to the International Criminal Court or possible prosecution, adding that it had also sent a letter warning Kim that he could face prosecution for crimes against humanity. Other options it said were on the table included the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal by the United Nations. However, prosecution by the ICC requires the support of the permanent members of the Security Council, and China has already effectively ruled this out. ""We believe that taking human rights issues to the International Criminal Court is not helpful to improving a country's human-rights situation,"" China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Yates suggests this should not come as a surprise. ""When it comes to issues like those contained in the latest United National human rights report, it's extremely unlikely that China would expend any effort to influence North Korean behavior. To the contrary, Beijing is most likely to thwart any effort to expose and punish human rights abuses."" Don't expect an Arab Spring here . The last possibility is arguably the least likely to occur. Tunisia, Egypt and Libya may all have experienced some form of the Arab Spring, but Kang says that North Korea is unlikely to witness anything similar. ""People are too atomized,"" he says. ""There's no way for people to organize -- there is no institution other than the government or leadership."" This point was underscored by the commission's report, which dedicated a section to violations of freedom of thought and expression. ""State surveillance permeates the private lives of all citizens to ensure that virtually no expression critical of the political system or of its leadership goes undetected,"" the report said. ""Citizens are punished for any 'anti-State' activities or expressions of dissent."" Kim showed his regime's capacity for ruthlessness in quashing perceived opposition with the execution of his uncle late last year. Jang Song Thaek was seen by many as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea. But Kim turned on him, claiming that Jang tried to overthrow the government. ""As our Party detected and purged the anti-Party, counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision, the Party and revolutionary ranks were further consolidated and our single-hearted unity was solidified to the maximum,"" Kim was quoted as saying in his New Year's address. Kang says the highly public nature of Jang's execution was likely in part prompted by a desire by Kim to consolidate his position. ""He wanted to make clear he isn't going to be pushed around."" The question now is whether this mindset will inform North Korea's response to this week's U.N. report. ""They've already condemned it as a conspiracy,"" Cha says. ""North Korea could use this and the upcoming U.S.-South Korea exercises as a pretext for some sort of provocation."" ""That wouldn't be surprising. Of course, the provocations would already have been intended,"" he says. ""But this gives them a way to blame others.""","The United Nations report on harrowing conditions in North Korea is unlikely to change much .

"(CNN) -- The United States will phase out its stockpiles of landmines designed to target people, moving closer to joining a global ban on a weapon that kills more than 15,000 people a year -- most of them civilians. U.S. officials made the declaration at an anti-mine conference in Maputo, Mozambique, according to a statement issued by National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Activists have long pressured the United States to join the international treaty banning the production, stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines -- the kind meant to kill or maim when someone steps on them. Such mines are easily triggered when stepped on, unlike anti-vehicle mines. Those weapons can still kill, but only go off when heavy vehicles pass over them. Anti-personnel mines, many of them placed during earlier conflicts dating back years, kill more than 15,000 people a year, according to the United Nations. Thousands more are maimed. As of last year, 161 nations were parties to the treaty, commonly known as the Ottawa Convention, but major powers including the United States, China and Russia are not, according to the Arms Control Association. In a statement, Hayden said, ""Our delegation in Maputo made clear that we are diligently pursuing solutions that would be compliant with and ultimately allow the United States to accede to the Ottawa Convention."" She said other aspects of U.S. landmine policy remain under review. The White House later issued a statement saying ""the United States shares the humanitarian goals of the Ottawa Convention."" Activists welcomed the U.S. statement. ""The message to the international community is clear -- the Mine Ban Treaty is the only solution to eliminate the suffering caused by landmines,"" said the head of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines delegation to the Maputo conference. But some criticized the United States for failing to commit to a ban on the use of its current stockpiles of mines, and chastised the Obama administration for failing to set a date to join the treaty. ""By not setting a firm date to complete this task, the U.S. runs the risk of allowing its landmine policy review to drift beyond President Obama's term in office as president,"" said Elizabeth MacNairn, executive director of Handicap International U.S. More than 100 million mines are believed to be in stockpiles around the world, with millions already in the ground in 59 countries, according to the Arms Control Association. In 1997, the Clinton administration made a goal of joining the treaty by 2006, but President George W. Bush reversed the decision in 2004, according to Human Rights Watch. In a policy announced that year, the United States said it would no longer use mines made to be invisible to metal detectors and those that don't self-destruct after a set time. In 2009, the United States announced a comprehensive landmine policy review. Anti-landmine activists had been pressuring the Obama administration to announce the results of that review before the Maputo conference. Despite not being part of the treaty, the United States is the largest donor worldwide to efforts to combat landmines and help victims, providing more than $2 billion in aid since 1993, according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama will answer questions about the economy and jobs Wednesday during his first Twitter town hall meeting. But the president, known for his oft- lengthy responses to the shortest of questions, will not be confined to Twitter's 140-character limit. He is verbally answering questions from Twitter users, who were urged to use the hashtag #AskObama. With the exception of questions coming from Twitter users -- known as tweeps -- the East Room town hall event will be like many the president has done before: fielding select questions conveyed via new media technologies while giving ""old-fashioned"" answers with a microphone. ""He's just answering the questions. He's not typing and tweeting,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said last week. White House officials have said the so-called ""Tweetup"" is a fresh opportunity for the president to engage with Americans beyond the Beltway. The event will feature an audience of about 140 individuals who follow the White House Twitter feed and signed up for a chance to attend. The 140 is not a coincidence -- it's the number of characters allowed in a tweet. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey will monitor the expected flood streaming in through the official #AskObama hashtag. ""Questions addressed during the town hall will be selected both in advance and in real-time during the event,"" Twitter said in a statement. Obama held a similar town hall at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, in April and a YouTube town hall at the White House in February. At both events, the White House was criticized for ignoring the subject that drew by far the most queries: whether he supports legalizing marijuana. Though the president rarely tweets himself, the administration has increasingly used social media to bypass traditional media outlets and convey information directly to supporters. Several senior administration officials tweet regularly, including Carney.","Obama will not be confined to Twitter's 140-character limit .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Soldiers who just returned from Iraq are among several thousand being ordered to Afghanistan in six months as part of a mission designed to beef up Afghan forces ahead of a planned 2014 U.S. military withdrawal, officials said. News of the pending Afghanistan deployments came as families at bases across the country were celebrating the return in recent days of troops who turned off the lights at a number of U.S. bases ahead of an end-of-the-year deadline to leave Iraq. U.S. general brings Baghdad standard home . ""We are glad that we have brought all soldiers back home in time for Christmas to spend with loved ones. We do have to put information out about an upcoming mission, though,"" the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, said Tuesday on its Facebook Page. In the posting, the brigade said it was one of four selected to ""support a Security Force Assistance Mission to Afghanistan in early summer."" ""We just received initial planning orders so lots of details are unknown,"" it said. ""...The mission is part of the transition from combat operations to advisory mission as we did in Iraq and is a sign of progress."" Analysts: Questions remain as U.S. troops leave Iraq . Maj. Carla Thomas, a brigade spokeswoman, confirmed the validity of the Facebook announcement. The new mission is part of an overall U.S. military exit strategy from Afghanistan that moves troops from a combat role to advise-and-assist positions that commanders and analysts say will significantly scale back operations ahead of President Barack Obama's self-imposed deadline to leave the country. Earlier this year, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops, beginning by pulling 33,000 ""surge"" troops deployed to help quell the violence by the end of 2012. The remaining 68,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014. News of the deployments comes as the Obama administration pushes to accelerate the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, a plan that many military commanders have said is unreasonable in a country still trying to gain its security footing. ""I don't think we are going to turn around guys who spent time in Iraq and put them on planes to Afghanistan ... without there being a clear indication that the Obama administration wants to continue the acceleration of the withdrawal,"" said Bill Roggio, Editor of The Long War Journal & Senior Fellow at The Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""U.S. commanders want to stop with the withdrawal of the 33,000 (surge troops.) They want to halt it."" Marine Corps Gen. John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force, has said he would like to keep a U.S. ""military presence"" in Afghanistan beyond 2014 when NATO is scheduled to withdraw its forces. Allen suggested the presence could last as long as 2016 when the Afghan Air Force is completed. Allen told reporters last week there is ""no daylight"" between him and the White House on this idea. Allen said he wants to shift the U.S. presence to an advisory capacity in the coming months and then continue to do that mission after 2014. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has asked Allen to review the counterinsurgency strategy and determine what changes are needed. Allen said he has to complete the review before he can decide on the rate of drawdown of current U.S. force levels. The new mission in Afghanistan somewhat mirrors the U.S. exit strategy in Iraq, which used advise and assist teams to improve counterterrorism operations and train security forces. Just like in Iraq, small teams of American troops will work and live among security forces, and will help coordinate military operations, according to comments Allen made to reporters last week. In its Facebook posting, the 4th Brigade Combat Team said those who would be deployed in advise-and-assist roles would be senior enlisted personnel, ranging from master sergeants to colonels. The deployment was expected to last nine months, though it was unclear how many members of the brigade will deploy. Also being deployed are troops from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division from Fort Stewart, Georgia; the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division from Fort Carson, Colorado; and the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The brigade deployments were first reported this week by Stars and Stripes, a newspaper that caters to military personnel. Under an Army policy, troops are given one month of dwell time for every month they are deployed. In the case of 1st Armored Division's brigade, which returned in December after less than six months in Iraq, its soldiers could be sent to Afghanistan as early as May. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Messages left early Wednesday by CNN at public affairs offices at the 3rd Infantry Division, the 4th Infantry Division and the 101st Airborne Division were not immediately returned. Reactions at Fort Bliss were mixed with some soldiers and families telling CNN by telephone that they were resigned to the specter of an Afghanistan deployment, while others said they were surprised elements of the brigade would be deployed so soon after returning from Iraq. None of the soldiers or their family members were willing to be quoted, citing possible repercussions over speaking to the media without prior approval. Responses to the brigade's Facebook post, though, revealed the feelings of spouses and family members. ""All we can do is enjoy the time we have with them,"" one person wrote. Another wrote: ""Not even home a week. How sad."" Questions remain about the stability of Afghan forces, with some questioning whether an Iraq-style exit strategy can work in Afghanistan. ""Given that we are 10 years into this, my confidence level is pretty low that we can turn the Afghan forces around,"" Roggio said. Taliban must have clear representative for peace talks, Karzai says . The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan began October 7, 2001, with an air campaign that was followed within weeks by a ground invasion. President Barack Obama has called it ""the longest-running war in the nation's history"". As the United States turned its attention toward Iraq, insurgent violence in Afghanistan flared against Afghan civilians and security forces as well as the U.S. and its coalition partners. In 2009, President Obama authorized a surge of 33,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan to combat the violence. Earlier this year, the president announced a plan to withdraw its troops. The move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the NATO nations.

"(CNN) -- ""When I visit Malawi, I visit my family at the graveyard,"" says Marie Da Silva, who knows the impact of AIDS all too well. Marie da Silva says the name for her school comes from the Jacaranda tree, which symbolizes hope. Born and bred in Malawi, in southern Africa, Da Silva lost 14 family members, including her father and two brothers, to the disease. ""AIDS is like The Plague in Malawi,"" says Da Silva. According to UNAIDS, 14 percent of the country's adult population is infected with HIV and more than half a million children have been orphaned by the disease. ""Orphans [in Malawi] are very underprivileged -- the grandparents are trying to raise them, with no money, no food, no clothes,"" she says. ""Just poverty."" But from halfway around the world, as a nanny in Los Angeles, California, Da Silva provides a place where the orphans can get away from that -- The Jacaranda School.  Watch Da Silva talk about her school » . In 2002, Da Silva learned that the school in her southern Africa home town was going to close. Consumed with concern for the students, she urged her mother to let them gather and learn in their family home, with her financial support. ""All the while I was doing my best for the kids here -- making sure they're doing their homework, eating well,"" she remembers. ""I couldn't sleep just thinking about the children that need the same thing back in Malawi,"" says Da Silva. Thanks to Da Silva's passion, the school is now thriving in her childhood home and more than 200 children, most of whom are AIDS orphans, receive porridge every morning and education, free of charge. It is an effort that Da Silva funds almost entirely herself, sending $1,000, about one-third of her monthly paycheck, to pay the salaries of 12 teachers and the headmaster, and purchase whatever supplies she can afford. Several of her fellow nannies have even gotten involved, donating $10 a month to her foundation. Get involved: Jacaranda Foundation . While the classes are crowded and resources are few (there are only 15 books in the library, according to Da Silva), her efforts are working. ""We have kids studying in our family living room, kitchen, gazebo, you name it. They're so hungry to learn,"" Da Silva explains. ""This is their sanctuary.""  Watch two teachers -- in different continents -- read a story from a young student » . Da Silva named both the school and its supporting foundation after the Jacaranda tree. Not only does the tree grow both in Malawi and Los Angeles, but when her father was dying, she found solace in a blossoming Jacaranda tree that she could see from his hospital window. ""For me, the Jacaranda tree symbolizes hope, and that's what I want to give to the children at the Jacaranda School,"" she says. ""After the deaths of my family members and...seeing how everything else is suffering, the only way around this was if kids have a future."" She dreams of building a new school with lab facilities and a real library one day. ""I just feel that if you give them the tools, they can be somebody. And that's my mission.""","Marie Da Silva is a nanny in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- Japan was hit by record snowfall again this weekend as several prefectures in the eastern part of the country reported deaths as well as severe transport delays and disruptions. The Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency has confirmed at least 19 deaths caused by the snowstorm across northeast Japan. At least 365 are reported to be injured from incidents caused directly by the heavy snow. Elderly residents in Oyama in Shizuoka Prefecture were stranded in their homes following a snow dump of more than three feet (1 meter) on Friday. Other isolated communities were also cut off, with more than 5,000 households inaccessible due to blocked roads in some mountainous areas of Yamanashi, Nagano, Saitama and Gunma prefectures as well as western Tokyo, according to the Cabinet Office. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set up emergency disaster task force to deal with the damage caused by the snow fall, according to his office. On Tuesday morning he ordered the relevant government departments to take all possible measures to avoid ""anybody freez[ing] to the death due to the isolation"" and to make the utmost effort ""to restore lifelines and clear the roads"" in those areas which are cut off. Tokyo experienced just under a foot (27cm) of snow over the weekend, days after the capital had experienced its heaviest snowfall in decades. A highway connecting Gunma and Nagano prefectures was closed, stranding hundreds of drivers, and the national broadcaster NHK said over 600 flights, mostly domestic, across the country were also canceled. Police said building collapses accounted for several fatalities, while in Yamanashi prefecture two men froze to death in separate incidents while trying to walk home from stranded cars. A commuter train collision at a station on the outskirts of Tokyo was also attributed to the snow by railway operator Tokyu Corp. Around 20 passengers were left with minor injuries in the incident. The Japan Meteorological Agency has raised advisories for much of the country, and with the storm heading northwards, sections of northern island of Hokkaido have been placed under warning of heavy snowfall and avalanches.

"(CNN) -- The evolution of Tamerlan Tsarnaev from aspiring Olympic boxer to apparent radical jihadist may have been influenced by a friend in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""This person just took his brain. He just brainwashed him completely,"" Tsarnaev's uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, told CNN from his home in Maryland, describing the friend as an Armenian convert to Islam. While Tsarni did not give the friend's name, The Associated Press reported that other members of Tsarnaev's family said the friend goes by the name ""Misha."" Asked about those reports, Elmirza Khozhgov, a former brother-in-law of Tsarnaev, told CNN Tsarnaev once introduced him to someone by that name who was an Armenian convert. He said he was not told Misha's full name. ""It seemed to me that Misha had influence on Tamerlan,"" apparently encouraging him to give up boxing because it ""is violent,"" Khozhgov told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Tamerlan told me that he quit boxing and music because Misha was teaching that it's not good in Islam to do those things."" ""Misha"" taught Tsarnaev ""things that would make Tamerlan go away from the people and go more into the religion,"" Khozhgov said, but ""I didn't witness him making him radical."" Khozhgov added that he has not spoken with Tsarnaev or with the younger suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, since 2010. And even then, ""We didn't talk for a long time."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev ""seemed normal"" at the time, he added. ""He only told me he goes to the mosque often and he's doing community work at the mosque."" Officials have not responded to requests for comment on someone named ""Misha."" Lawmakers briefed Tuesday on the investigation told CNN they had not heard of anyone by that name. The Islamic Society of Boston told CNN Wednesday that so far no one in its network reported knowing a ""Misha"" who fit that description. ""We are looking for him,"" said spokeswoman Nichole Mossalam. Uncle called a friend to investigate . Tsarni, Tsarnaev's uncle, told CNN he was so concerned about someone brainwashing his nephew that he called a family friend in the Cambridge area to investigate. ""I said, 'Listen, do you know what is going on with that family? With my brother's family?' Then he says ... there is a person, some new convert into Islam of Armenian descent,"" Tsarni told CNN's Shannon Travis. ""Armenians, I have no intention to say anything about Armenians. It's a neighboring region with North Caucasus,"" the same area where the Tsarnaev family also hails from. ""It started (in) 2009. And it started right there, in Cambridge,"" Tsarni said of the friendship. Aunt reveals clue to older brother's trip to Russia . Tsarnaev's mindset leading up to the bombings at the Boston Marathon may never be fully known. He was killed after a shootout with police last week. His brother, Dzhokhar, remains hospitalized with an array of gunshot wounds. He has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been communicating with investigators in a limited fashion. He has indicated that his older brother, not any international terrorist group, conceived the deadly attack, a U.S. government source said. The preliminary interviews with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suggest the two brothers fit the classification of self-radicalized jihadists, the source said. But the official noted that information from the preliminary interviews needed to be scrutinized. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has also cited the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as motivating factors behind last week's blasts that killed three and wounded hundreds more, a U.S. government official said. Suspect's widow is distraught . The suspects' uncle said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was clearly the leader between the two brothers. ""Dzhokhar is being used by his older brother. (Tamerlan) used him as his -- not even accomplice -- as some kind of instrument,"" Tsarni said. At 26, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was seven years older than Dzhokhar. Friends say Dzhokhar followed his big brother around like a puppy. And as their father is in Russia, the older brother may have become a father figure to the 19-year-old these past few months. At 6-foot-3, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was, by many accounts, an intimidating presence with increasingly strong convictions about society and religion in recent years. Tsarni said he was shocked by the explosions and how his nephews may be involved. ""Tamerlan is off now,"" the uncle said. ""There is no obedience and respect to his own father. That concerns me big time."" CNN's Shannon Travis, Jake Tapper, Brian Todd and Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","NEW: Islamic Society of Boston has not found a ""Misha"" by that description so far .

"(CNN) -- They're the generation that came of age in the 1950s and 1960s, that remembers Beatlemania and the Vietnam War, the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., transistor radios and the novelty of the first color TV sets. Or ... they experienced their formative years in the 1970s, forced to choose between punk and disco as the Watergate scandal unfolded, hard drug use exploded, and television sitcoms introduced untraditional households such as ""The Brady Bunch,"" ""Three's Company,"" and ""Sanford and Son."" Numerous books, films and academic papers have been devoted to defining the impact of the 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964, known as baby boomers, boomies or the bulge. Their sheer volume in the United States fueled an unprecedented population boom, from 141 million in 1946 to 311 million in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The first wave of baby boomers is turning 65 this year, but the youngest are 47. Defining the entire group is a risky endeavor, given its almost 20-year spread. But there's one thing historians, economists and pop culture junkies agree on: Baby boomers' numbers have allowed them to leave an imprint in each phase of life they passed through, a vast departure from their parents' generation. Next, the boomer generation will change the way we think about retirement and aging, experts and analysts say, just as they transformed notions of relationships -- with delayed marriages, fewer children, more divorces -- and ideas about careers, with more women in the workplace and adult learning. American generations through the years . ""Boomers are all about exploration and transformation. Many of them reject the idea of retirement that they saw firsthand with their parents, where you stop changing and growing and become a fixed entity,"" said Ann Clurman of The Futures Company, which tracks consumer attitudes that forecast lifestyle and behaviors, and author of ""Generation Ageless: How Baby Boomers Are Changing the Way We Live Today."" ""Boomers have a hard time giving up control. For them, control is a fundamental right born out of basic entitlement -- they grew up in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity and a basic feeling that the struggle for survival was over. Many have never been in love with the idea of retirement, but at least they felt like it was an option they could control. But now because of the economy and the hit their portfolios took, they're revamping their plans, and I don't think most boomers know what they're going to end up doing."" But the day is fast approaching for many. The boomers are the main reason for projections that the number of Americans 65 and older will reach 88.5 million by 2050, more than double the estimated 40.2 million in that group in 2010, according to a 2010 U.S. Census Report, ""The Next Four Decades."" By 2030, when all of the boomers will be 65 or older, they will make up 19% of the population, up from 13% today. The aging of the baby boom will have wide-ranging implications for the country, raising challenges for policymakers and programs such as Social Security and Medicare, said Ron Lee, director of the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging at the University of California, Berkeley. Baby boomers crowded classrooms and later, the labor force, boosting the economy and consumer spending while their taxes funded Social Security benefits and Medicare for the elderly. In 2010, 60% of the U.S. population was between 20 and 64 years old. By 2030, as baby boomers age, the proportion in those working ages will drop to 55%, according to ""The Next Four Decades."" Boomers are leaving the labor force at a time when health care costs are growing at a rate faster than productivity and per capita income growth, leaving a big gap, Lee said. The average annual expenditure on health care in 2004 for people ages 45 to 54 was $2,695. When budgeting medical expenses, baby boomers should expect increased health care spending as they age; for instance, those ages 55 to 64 spent $3,262 and those 65 and over spent $3,899, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ""There's already a clear sense of what the situation is. We know that our social programs are not sustainable the way they're currently structured, and benefits are going to have to be cut or taxes increased. But that doesn't mean the public has absorbed that fact or believe it, so it's difficult for politicians to do anything serious to come to grips with the problems,"" Lee said. But that doesn't necessarily mean the blame should be placed on the boomers, he said. Population aging is universal and inevitable -- the baby boomers merely postponed the day of reckoning. ""The problems we're going to have are problems we would have had without the baby boomers. They just happen to be the generation that's initiating them. The problem is real and serious but by no means catastrophic,"" he said. The baby boomers will continue steering American culture as they age, too. They were the first generation of children and teenagers with significant spending power, economist Diane Macunovich of the University of Redlands said. That, combined with their numbers, fueled massive marketing campaigns and the introduction of new products targeted at their current stage of life, whether they were young families or looking toward retirement. ""Station wagons became the vogue in the 1950s in response to the needs of boomers' parents. Those mutated into 'vans' to accommodate 'Yuppie' boomers in their thirties and forties and then into 'SUVs' for boomers as empty nesters, many going through 'mid-life crisis,'"" Macunovich wrote in a 2000 paper, ""The Baby Boomers."" In this way, boomers essentially created the idea of pop culture and fed its symbiotic relationship with mass marketing and consumerism, said Gary West, a consultant who runs the website mrpopculture.com, a digest of the weekly zeitgeist back to 1950. ""The buying power of that generation set pop culture in motion. If you look back into the '50s, you can see where teen buying power got bigger and bigger and created pop culture: younger-skewing movies and television, rock and roll, pop rock, what we call soul music,"" he said. ""The baby boomers really started the pop culture trend and it had to do with buying power, and as we've grown into the work force, we've kept creating those trends. Who were the first to buy records, then CDs, then computers?"" Despite Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, the boomers can't take all the credit for the advent of the Internet age, but they've been fast learners of how to leverage its benefits. University of Oklahoma history professor and History Channel resident historian Steve Gillon, who wrote the book ""Boomer Nation,"" said technology will continue to play a big role in boomers' retirement years. ""People with specific skills will use the Internet to take advantage of the breakup of hierarchies in the economy and remain involved in their fields, be it through consulting or using social media to find professional communities or networking groups,"" Gillon said. ""Many boomers have a desire to stay involved and connected; they're not going to give in to the dictates of age and accept the older model. They're going to find ways to stay socially, intellectually and physically active.""","Boomers are the reason for projections of 88.5 million Americans 65 and older by 2050 .
They've redefined each stage of life; retirement and aging will be no different .
Boomers will still affect pop culture as they age, too ."
"(CNN) -- There are moments when reality television can highlight a country's sensitivities.

Whether the brew comes to you (a pop-up champagne bar) or you go to the source (a ski-in distillery with tours and spirits geeks to answer all your questions), après ski is becoming more engaging and cerebral. Take your ski vacation this year with a side of spirits knowledge at the following spots. Pop-up champagne bar in Aspen . Veuve Clicquot takes the concept of the pop-up bar even further this year in Aspen. Each Friday, Saturday, and Sunday through the end of ski season, the Oasis 3.0 Veuve Clicquot Bar will change locations on Aspen Mountain. Clues leading thirsty skiers to tall flutes of champagne can be found on Twitter. Stationed at approximately 11,000 feet, this ski-in, ski-out pop-up is serving Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label, Rose and La Grande Dame in addition to small bites.

The Aprés Ski Cocktail Classic . Cocktail lovers will have another excuse to travel to Aspen this year with the Aprés Ski Cocktail Classic scheduled for March 13 to 16. This winter spirit festival will feature a range of tasting events, such as an Irish coffee pop-up bar sponsored by Tullamore Dew. This ski-in, ski-out bar will serve up classic Irish coffees in the style of San Francisco's Buena Vista Café. Other events on the calendar include an advanced session to learn about agave and mezcal, a tasting village full of premium spirits and upscale dinners with cocktail pairings. Some events are complimentary and open to the public, while others have limited seating and require tickets purchased in advance. Bloody Mary drinking in the valley . Skiers can savor a taste of Utah at the St. Regis Deer Valley with the 7452 Bloody Mary. The in-house Bloody Mary at the St. Regis Bar (each St. Regis creates its own signature Bloody Mary) features oat-distilled vodka from the local High West Distillery. Named after the resort's altitude of 7,452 feet , this après ski cocktail has a local flair and is finished with a touch of salt on the rim and a celery/wasabi foam.

"(CNN) -- For as long as eight hours, the small girl hid, unnoticed, in a car with the bodies of two British women and a man shot dead in foothills of the Alps in eastern France. Probably paralyzed by fear, the 4-year-old remained among the corpses as investigators waited for crime scene technicians to arrive so the car could be opened. She is now under police protection, as is an older girl, thought to be 7 or 8 years old, who was found injured near the car. She suffered a fractured skull and an apparent bullet wound to the shoulder. Prosecutor Eric Maillaud told reporters Thursday that investigators failed to notice the younger girl because she didn't move for hours as they waited for the forensic experts. She was hidden under baggage and the legs of one of the dead women in the car's back seat. A thermal imaging camera failed to pick up her presence, Maillaud said. The child was ""probably terrorized, completely concealed, completely immobile amid the corpses,"" he said. Authorities have not identified the three Britons found dead on Wednesday in the car near Lake Annecy, a popular tourist spot in the Haute-Savoie area of eastern France. A fourth victim, a French cyclist found shot in the head near the car, has been named as Sylvain Mollier. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he and French President Francois Hollande discussed the ""terrible killings of ... the British family"" during a meeting Thursday in London. He promised British authorities will cooperate ""very closely with the French authorities"" to ""help those poor children"" and ""get to the bottom of what happened in this clearly very tragic and awful case."" ""Both a French and a British family have been impacted by this terrible event, and we will do our utmost to identify the perpetrators,"" added Hollande in a joint press conference after the two leaders' meeting. Maillaud, the French prosecutor, has called the shootings an act of ""extreme savagery"" but has declined to speculate on a motive. ""The scene is dramatic, it's unusual -- it goes well beyond TV fiction,"" he said. Multiple bullet casings had surrounded the BMW when authorities came upon it, with bullet holes peppering its windows but none in the body of the car, according to the prosecutor. The driver and an older woman found dead in the car had been shot in the head, Maillaud said, ""and it was obvious that (whoever) did this wanted to kill."" Autopsies are scheduled Friday and should reveal how the other passenger, a younger woman, died. The car was registered to a man with an Iraqi passport who was a naturalized British citizen and had lived in Britain since at least 2002, he said. The passport was used when the visitors checked in to the campsite where they were staying, Maillaud said, but police can't yet confirm whether it belonged to the man who was found dead in the car. The man named in the passport was born in 1962, the French prosecutor said. A Swedish passport found by investigators may belong to the older woman, he added. The victims are believed to be British nationals but may have held dual citizenship. Swedish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson described ""the French information about the Swedish national (as) reliable,"" adding that authorities there were awaiting a ""final confirmation of the identity."" DNA tests are being carried out to formally identify the victims. French and British news reports have identified one victim as Saad al-Hilli, an Iraqi-born engineer who lived in Claygate in Surrey, south of London, with his wife and two daughters. While CNN couldn't independently confirm the identities of the victims, Surrey Police have said they are helping police in Annecy with their investigation into the killings, though they haven't given further details. Officers from Surrey Police were stationed Thursday outside the house identified by neighbors as that of Saad al-Hilli. Neighbor Jack Saltman, whose home backs onto the family's garden, said al-Hill and his wife had come from Iraq ""many years"" ago and both spoke ""perfect English."" ""They were a delightful family,"" Saltman said. The neighbor said al-Hilli's wife, Iqbal, was a dentist and that the two daughters were ""absolutely beautiful."" He had been asked to keep an eye on the house while his neighbors were away in France, Saltman said. An accountant for Saad al-Hilli, Julian Stedman, said the engineer had at least one business registered locally. Maillaud said the two children, who are British, are being kept under police protection in case of possible threats to their safety. ""You can imagine in an inquiry all possible scenarios can be investigated, including that someone wanted to get rid of additional witnesses,"" he said. The 4-year-old has only been able to tell police that she heard noise and screams and was afraid, he said. The older girl, who has head injuries, was hit ""extremely violently,"" he said. She has been placed in a medically induced coma and will have to undergo additional surgery, Maillaud said. The British ambassador to France, Peter Ricketts, told reporters in Annecy, ""I think it's our joint conviction that we have got to do everything possible to find the perpetrators of this terrible crime."" Asked about police's failure to find the 4-year-old girl sooner, he said French authorities were doing a professional job. Maillaud recounted how the gruesome scene was discovered just before 4 p.m. Wednesday by another British man, a cyclist who was a Royal Air Force veteran with a holiday home in the area. The British man, who had been passed a short while earlier by the French cyclist found dead at the scene, discovered the BMW, its engine still running, in a parking lot in a forest used by people going on short walks. It is not regarded as a dangerous area or a common site of drug deals, according to the prosecutor. The injured girl was approaching the car and was about to pass out in front of the man, Maillaud said. He placed her in a safe position on the ground and called emergency services. The man then discovered the cyclist who had passed him earlier, dead on the ground in a corner of the parking lot. After walking round the car, the British man broke the driver's side window and saw three people inside it, all also dead. Are you there? Share your story . The girl who was wounded in the shooting was taken to a hospital in Grenoble. There was only one child car seat in the vehicle, which led officials to believe she was the only child present, Maillaud said. Authorities were alerted to the likely presence of a second child several hours later when they spoke to people at the campsite where the victims had been staying, Maillaud said. When they searched the car again, by then late at night, they found the 4-year-old girl under the younger woman's legs. After being checked over for injuries, she was taken to a children's psychiatric unit, where a nurse remained with her overnight, he said. The girl, who was not physically harmed, will be questioned only with British consular officials present, Maillaud said. ""Her life is not in danger, but she has experienced something awful,"" he said. Mollier, the French cyclist, had lived in the region for 20 years and was on paternity leave, BFM-TV reported. Maillaud said the man's wife had gone to the police when he failed to return as expected from his bike ride. He was then identified as the slain cyclist. The British Foreign Office said it was looking into the shooting. ""We are aware of this tragic incident near Lake Annecy. We are working with the French authorities to confirm that British nationals were involved,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said. ""Thoughts are with the friends and family. There are currently consular officials on the ground and providing consular assistance."" More from CNN Justice: . Turkish woman awaits trial after beheading her alleged rapist .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri calls on Afghans to rise up against Western troops -- especially American forces -- in their country and back the Taliban, according to a recent audio message posted on jihadist web forums Wednesday. The message, running more than 11 minutes in length, condemns the values of ""crusader secular Western civilization"" and follows a series of acts by American soldiers in Afghanistan that have been heavily publicized, including U.S. Marines urinating on the bodies of slain insurgents. ""This act represents their values,"" al-Zawahiri says,""and this is their view toward other people in general and the Muslims in particular, and this is their way of treating us."" Other events inflaming Muslim passions included the accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. troops and a shooting spree by an American soldier that left 16 Afghan civilians dead. The United States has apologized for the acts. ""Honorable Afghans, the way is clear! It is either to stand by the banner of Islam to fight and support the Mujahideen using your hand, tongue, money and heart,"" the al Qaeda leader says. ""Or you will be humiliated in this life and be punished in the hereafter."" The message is the second in a week's time from al-Zawahiri. In a video released Friday, he called on Pakistanis to join the Arab Spring uprisings and revolt against their government, saying the country's leaders are ""slaves of America."" The comments refer to the Arab Spring, the pro-democracy movement that swept through North Africa and the Middle East in 2011, toppling longtime rulers in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and threatening President Bashar al-Assad's rule in Syria. Al-Zawahiri, 60, was appointed the leader of al Qaeda in June, less than two months after a U.S. raid killed Osama bin Laden in his compound in Pakistan.","The message is the second in a week from the al Qaeda leader .

"(CNN) -- I would love to say my dog is intellectually qualified to be a service animal. But he's not. There's barely enough brainpower there to be a lamp. In fact, Mikey's only apparent skills appear to be power napping and somehow reaching unspeakable parts of his body with his tongue. Which, to be fair, is definitely a skill, though not one that easily lends itself to helping humans. ""There's a little boy stuck in the well! Quick, Mikey, molest yourself for 20 minutes!"" Alas, being a true service animal requires something special. And even some of the very brightest dogs, those with the best training in the world, never quite live up to their potential. And that's exactly what happened to Taxi, a golden retriever/Labrador who was supposed to become a guide dog. If it wasn't for those damn cats. That was Taxi's weakness. Just couldn't lay off the cats. Thus, Taxi never graduated to calmly lead blind people across the street, for fear that he might actually lead blind people across a tree. But it turns out he had another calling. Taxi became a seizure alert dog, for 14-year-old Rachel Benke of San Antonio, Texas. When Rachel was born, she had an abnormality on the right side of her brain that caused epileptic seizures. For the first several years of her life she was mostly nonverbal and couldn't eat solid food. When she turned 6, however, two corrective surgeries greatly reduced the frequency of her seizures and allowed her to start developing new skills. Then, four years ago, Taxi came into her life. Ever since, they've been inseparable; he even joins her at school. And this year, Taxi finally got his own picture in the yearbook. That was a big talker all over the Web this week. Because it's adorable. When Rachel takes Taxi with her to school, he's there to warn of oncoming seizures and to also assist her in the event of one actually happening. But mostly he just lays around, not participating in anything remotely educational. So, in a lot of ways, his accomplishments in school are slightly more impressive than mine. Unless you count occupying space and disrupting others. But there was just something about that photo. When Taxi's big, serious face appeared in the Hector Garcia Middle School yearbook and hit the Web, people just couldn't resist. There he was. Taxi Benke. Just to the right of Rachel Benke. And just to the left of: Hayden Berry. (Hayden, welcome to Internet fame by association. Now's a good time to drop your new rap LP.) Anyway, it's a well-deserved addition. Rachel's mom had joked about Taxi's exclusion the previous year, so this time they got it right. And, if nothing else, Taxi's newfound Internet fame has added an interesting bit of education about seizure alert dogs. Rachel's family can share several incidents where, somehow, Taxi just knew. He could smell it. Conversely, sometimes I drop food on the kitchen floor and Mikey literally has no idea. He'll be just steps away. And nothing. ""Mikey, there is literally free food on the floor. That you can eat. It's bacon, stupid."" Taxi would be all over that. Different dogs. Different skills. Now, it's worth noting that the Epilepsy Foundation isn't fully convinced that seizure-predicting dogs do exactly as some people believe. They believe the bulk of this evidence is mostly anecdotal. So, they warn people to exercise caution when considering this type of canine service. Either way, there's something special about Taxi. Multiple times he's warned others about oncoming seizures. He just knows. He's always right there on Rachel's left side because that's the direction she falls. And Taxi knows to position himself there so he can protect her from slamming into the ground. Again, just for comparison, I could be on fire and Mikey would be completely preoccupied, lording over his Poop Kingdom in the backyard where he's waged a full-scale yet poorly strategized border war with Noodle, the wiener dog next door. So, clearly, Taxi is special and has earned his place in the yearbook. Right next to Rachel. And just left of MC Hayden B. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri has apparently released a new message to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, in which he praises the Arab Spring as a ""devastating blow"" to the United States. The hour-long video, posted Monday on websites run by supporters of the terror network, includes an audio broadcast purportedly from al-Zawahiri and a video message from Osama bin Laden, recorded before his death in May. Al-Zawahiri's speech lauds the Arab Spring as having ""liberated thousands of the members of the Islamic movement's prisoners, who were imprisoned by direct orders from America."" The uprising in a number of Arab nations, including Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, has also ""liberated the Arab people from handcuffs of fear and terror,"" the message says. The bin Laden video is apparently the same footage that was released by the U.S. government after bin Laden was killed in a raid by U.S. forces in Pakistan, but this one includes the audio of the former al Qaeda leader speaking. The version issued by the Pentagon, after it was found in bin Laden's Abbottabad compound, was silent. The SITE Intelligence Group cites bin Laden's message as warning Americans against ""falling as slaves"" to the control of major corporations and ""Jewish money capital."" In his message, bin Laden also recommends that Americans read the book ""Obama's Wars"" by Bob Woodward, saying that they should realize that Obama's government has not lived up to his campaign slogan, ""Yes we can."" At the time they released it, U.S. officials said they believed the video, which was entitled ""A Message to the American People"" and had not been broadcast by al Qaeda, was recorded in October or November last year. CNN's Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Ayman al-Zawahiri, the new al Qaeda leader, praises the Arab Spring in an audio address .

"New York (CNN) -- In light of recent findings that al Qaeda was mulling targeting railroad lines to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, a senator from New York is calling for tighter rail security. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer proposed an increase in rail security and an Amtrak version of the Secure Flight ""no-fly"" list. The proposal stems from material taken from Osama bin Laden's Pakistani compound showing al Qaeda was in the early stages of planning an attack to derail trains on September 11 of this year. Schumer proposed the creation of a ""no-ride"" list that would check passengers against a list of suspected terrorists to prevent would-be terrorists from boarding trains. The list would be used like the government ""no-fly"" list that screens air travelers. ""Obviously there are certain things that would have to be done, but Amtrak, unlike our commuter rails or subways, does have a (manifest) of everyone that rides Amtrak,"" he said. ""They check your name as you walk down so it doesn't seem like it's that difficult to do."" He added that he had ""discussed it with (Transportation) Secretary (Ray) LaHood and others, and Amtrak, and we're going to work as hard as we can to get this done as quickly as possible."" ""While taking Osama bin Laden out last week has been a major victory in fighting terrorism, the war is not over,"" Schumer said. ""We must remain vigilant in protecting ourselves from future terror attacks, and when intelligence emerges that provides insight into potential vulnerabilities, we must act with speed."" He also proposed increased spending on rail security, despite last month's $50 million of cuts to the rail and port security grant program. The program provides rail operators with funding for protection against explosive devices in tunnels, deterrence, and training for rail personnel. ""Let me just say, look, we are much safer on the rails than we were on 9/10/01,"" he said. ""And safety keeps getting better, better and better. When it comes to safety you can never rest.""","Schumer wants suspected terrorists banned from passenger trains .

"(CNN) -- For the second time in two weeks, a US Airways flight had to change course after crew members fell ill. Flight 715 from Venice, Italy, to Philadelphia was diverted to Ireland on Monday after five flight attendants and a passenger reportedly had medical issues, US Airways said in a statement. The Airbus A330-200 had 238 passengers and 12 crew members on board. The airline said it was booking passengers on other flights to Philadelphia. It was not clear what kinds of medical issues the flight attendants and passenger had. If the incident sounds familiar, it's because another US Airways flight taking the same route was diverted to the same airport for the same reason nine days earlier. On May 10, A US Airways flight en route from Venice to Philadelphia was diverted to Dublin Airport after nine flight attendants became ill, officials said. The nine flight attendants on that flight complained of nausea, watery eyes and dizziness, Irish health officials said. The pilots switched gears over the Atlantic Ocean to make the emergency landing in Ireland. The flight attendants were evaluated, released and then returned to Philadelphia, US Airways spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said.

"(CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri emerged from a privileged upbringing in Egypt to become one of the world's most wanted terrorists and now, the leader of the most notorious terror group: al Qaeda. The bespectacled 59-year-old surgeon formally merged his group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, with al Qaeda in 1998, becoming then-leader Osama bin Laden's personal physician and closest confidant. A month and a half after bin Laden's death in a U.S. raid on his compound in Pakistan, al-Zawahiri has been appointed the new leader of al Qaeda, according to a statement posted on several jihadist websites Thursday. Al-Zawahiri and al Qaeda has been blamed for numerous terrorist attacks worldwide, mainly on Western targets, including the attacks of September 11, 2001, on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people. After the attacks, the U.S. State Department offered a $25 million award for information leading to al-Zawahiri's apprehension. An Islamic fundamentalist, al-Zawahiri joined the outlawed Egyptian Islamic Jihad group as a teenager, being jailed twice for helping plot assassinations of two Egyptian leaders. He eventually became the group's leader, which was dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state in Egypt, and in the 1980s he joined Mujahedeen fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan. There he befriended and joined forces with bin Laden. Before and after 9/11, al-Zawahiri appeared on numerous video and audiotapes calling for attacks against Western targets and urging Muslims to support his cause. At that time he was thought of as second-in-charge to bin Laden, analyst have said. From a prominent Egyptian family . Born on June 19, 1951, al-Zawahiri grew up in an upper-class neighborhood in Cairo, the son of a prominent physician and grandson of renowned scholars. ""He used to write poetry to his mother,"" said Mahfouz Azzam, al-Zawahiri's uncle, calling his nephew quiet, studious and deeply religious. ""He was known as a good Muslim, keen to pray at the mosque and to read and to think and to have his own positions."" As a 16-year-old medical student in the 1960s, al-Zawahiri became involved in the Islamic fundamentalist movement rolling through Egypt. Authorities arrested and charged him with being part of a Muslim Brotherhood plot to overthrow President Gamal Abdel Nasser. After Anwar Sadat's election as Egyptian president, al-Zawahiri worked to overthrow Sadat, said Dia'a Rashwan, a specialist in Islamic movements. After Sadat made peace with Israel, members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad assassinated him. Zawahiri was arrested shortly after in a security sweep of Islamic militants. In a 1981 trial, as defendant No. 113, he was convicted on weapons charges, but not for being part of the assassination plot, and sentenced to three years in prison. He spent three years in prison, where by his own and other accounts he was tortured severely. When President Hosni Mubarak assumed power after Sadat's assassination, al-Zawahiri sought his overthrow as well. Rise to power . Egyptian officials linked Egyptian Islamic Jihad to the 1995 bombing of the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan. Due to his charisma and fluent English, al-Zawahiri emerged as a sort of international spokesman for the imprisoned Islamic activists. ""We want to speak to the whole world,"" he said in 1983. ""We are Muslims who believe in our religion. ... We are here, the real Islamic front and the real Islamic opposition."" By the time al-Zawahiri got out of prison, he had moved into the top ranks of the militants. He left Egypt in 1985 and made his way to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he worked as a surgeon treating the fighters who were waging holy war against Soviet troops in Afghanistan. That is where al-Zawahiri met bin Laden, a prominent Mujahedeen leader and who also had left behind a privileged upbringing to join the fight in Afghanistan. The two became close, linked by their common bond as ""Afghan Arabs."" After the war against the Soviets ended, al-Zawahiri was unable to return to Egypt. Instead, he joined bin Laden in Sudan, where he planned terror activities, including an attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan. He was also linked to assassination attempts on several Egyptian politicians. Ali Mohammed, a fellow Egyptian and Islamic Jihad member living in the United States, testified al-Zawahiri actually visited the United States twice on fund-raising trips in the early 1990s, including to a mosque in Santa Clara, California. The group, meanwhile, stepped up its violent campaign against the Egyptian government, blowing up its embassy in Pakistan in 1995 and trying to assassinate several top Egyptian politicians. A new al Qaeda emerges . After reuniting in Afghanistan, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri appeared together in early 1998 announcing the formation of the World Islamic Front for the Jihad Against the Jews and the Crusaders -- formally merging the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda, bin Laden's group. The two issued a fatwa, or decree, that said, ""The judgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilians or military, is an obligation for every Muslim."" Some Egyptians traced al-Zawahiri's anger toward the United States to what many Afghan Arabs felt was the CIA's betrayal to support their cause after the Soviets left Afghanistan and the country slipped into tribal anarchy. Others date al-Zawahiri's wrath to 1998, when U.S. officials pushed for the extradition of a number of Egyptian Islamic Jihad members from Albania to stand trial in Egypt for terrorism. In early August of that year, the al Hayat newspaper office in Cairo received a fax from Egyptian Islamic Jihad stating: ""We should like to inform the Americans that, in short, their message has been received and that they should read carefully the reply that will, with God's help, be written in the language that they understand."" On August 7, suicide bombers destroyed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people. U.S. authorities later indicted both al-Zawahiri and bin Laden on charges they masterminded the terror bombings. An hour later, U.S. forces launched cruise missiles in retaliation for the embassy bombings, but al-Zawahiri and bin Laden escaped. A few days later, al-Zawahiri defiantly called a reporter and warned there would be more attacks. There were, including the attack on the USS Cole in October 2000 and a year later the attacks on New York and Washington. Levels of terror . In 1999, Egypt tried the Islamic Jihad members extradited from Albania. It also convicted and sentenced al-Zawahiri and his brothers Mohammed to death in absentia. Back in Afghanistan, al-Zawahiri continued to work with bin Laden and al Qaeda. Weeks after the 9/11 attacks, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for al-Zawahiri, alleging he ""masterminded several terrorist operations in Egypt"" and accusing him of ""criminal complicity and management for the purpose of committing premeditated murder."" Since then, al-Zawahiri has raised his public profile, appearing on numerous video and audiotapes to urge Muslims to join the jihad against the United States and its allies. Some of his tapes have been followed closely by terrorist attacks. In May 2003, for instance, almost simultaneous suicide bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, killed 23 people, including nine Americans, days after a tape thought to contain al-Zawahiri's voice was released. On an October 2002 tape, a voice thought to be al-Zawahiri's said, ""America and its deputies should know that their crimes will not go unpunished. ... The settlement of this overburdened account will indeed be heavy. We will also aim to continue, by permission of Allah, the destruction of the American economy."" In a tape in 2005, he threatened the French government for passing a law banning Muslim students in that country from wearing head scarves at school.","Al-Zawahiri is the son of a physician .

"(CNN) -- A week ago, 10-year-old Braydon Nichols started to think about his dad and how much he missed him. Army Chief Warrant Officer Bryan Nichols, a helicopter pilot, had been deployed for two months in Afghanistan. The little boy, in the car with his mother running errands, brushed back his dirty-blond hair and ran his hand over his cheek. Jessica Nichols looked over when she heard sniffles. Her son was crying. ""When is Dad coming back so we go camping?"" he asked her. Soon, she assured him. ""Your dad is off fighting for this country."" The boy replied, ""As soon as he gets home, we're going to go on a camping trip, just me and him."" Jessica Nichols cannot stop replaying that scene in her mind. That's because only a few days later, on Saturday night, she was cradling her boy who was crying once again. Except this time she could not tell him that his father was coming home. She had just received a call informing her that Bryan Nichols was one of the 30 Americans who died that afternoon when their Chinook helicopter was shot down in Wardak province in east-central Afghanistan. ""It was just so devastating that a week ago or so Braydon had that worried look on his face, thinking about his dad,"" she said. ""Braydon and Bryan were so connected. Braydon was like a little version of his dad."" Bryan Nichols and Jessica Nichols met in sixth grade. Bryan was a born military buff. His father was a soldier and served in Vietnam. Bryan enlisted in the military before high school graduation. A few years later, he and Jessica married and had Braydon. Bryan worked his way up through the military ranks. ""He always wanted to be in the Army,"" she said. ""He came across the Chinook and was so fascinated. His father flew Chinooks."" Bryan Nichols did three deployments during their marriage. It proved to be too much for their relationship, she said. They divorced when Braydon was 3, but remained close to raise Braydon. Bryan remarried, and his new wife and Jessica all got along. They all loved and cared for Braydon, she said. It was Bryan's wife, Mary, who contacted Jessica Saturday night to say that Bryan had died. ""She was screaming,"" Jessica said. ""She was screaming that Bryan was dead."" Jessica couldn't believe what she was hearing. She hung up. Her heart was beating hard. Braydon was in his room, still awake and playing. Jessica walked toward the room, and stood by his door for a moment, overcome with grief. ""I went to my room and tried to figure out what was going on,"" she said. Jessica pulled herself together as best she could and phoned her brother who lives nearby. He came to her house to support her. Together, they called Braydon downstairs. In his pajamas, Braydon stood in front of his mother and uncle. ""I said, 'Braydon, do you know much your dad loves you? Do you know how proud of you he is?"" Before she could say anything more, the boy wilted in her arms, sobbing. ""I said, 'I'm sorry ... your ... dad died."" The mother and son held each other and cried. An hour, maybe, went by. At one point Braydon got off the couch and ambled over to a Shih Tzu puppy, Lucy, that his mother bought him when his father got deployed. He held the dog for awhile. Then he fell asleep for a bit, and she went out to their porch. The night gave way to day. On Sunday morning, Jessica and Braydon Nichols watched the national news broadcast the first reports about the downing of a Chinook helicopter. They listened to reporters say that 38 U.S. and Afghan service personnel were killed, including 22 Navy SEALs. It was the single deadliest loss for American troops since the war in Afghanistan began in late 2001. ""Braydon asked me why they weren't showing his dad's picture like they were showing some of the other guys,"" Jessica Nichols told CNN.com. ""I told him it was because people had gone online and were posting photos."" That gave the boy an idea. The two went to the family computer. She pulled up CNN.com. Braydon started saying, ""iReport! iReport!"" Like his father, Braydon is an information sponge. He's always on the hunt for facts, his loves the computer, and he likes watching the news, his mother said. Braydon knew that he could post something about his dad on CNN.com's iReport. So Jessica Nichols went to the iReport home page. Her son told her what to write. ""My father was one of the 30 US Soldiers killed in Afghanistan yesterday with the Seals rescue mission,"" she typed. ""My father was the pilot of the chinook. I have seen other pictures of victims from this deadly mission and wish you would include a picture of my father. He is the farthest to the left."" See the iReport Braydon posted . He told her to sign his name. Within hours, the iReport had become viral. Local news outlets across the country reported on it. More than 10,000 people on Facebook re-posted it. Twitter was abuzz about it. Many people left comments, expressing their sorrow for Braydon and telling him to be strong and that his father is a hero. CNN.com began trying to get in touch with the person who posted the iReport to verify it, first reaching the boy's aunt. Sue Keller of Palco, Kansas, told CNN late Monday night that the boy wanted the country to remember his father not just as a soldier but as a dad. Home and Away: Share your tributes to Chief Warrant Officer Nichols . On Monday night, Braydon's mother told him that a lot of people were talking about his iReport. ""He didn't say anything,"" she said. ""He's been reading it over and over. He doesn't understand the people can post comments so I'm telling him that people are trying to talk to him. He just looks at the comments and then he walks away. ""He says, 'Mom, can we go watch a movie?'"" Late Monday night, Jessica Nichols said she couldn't find her son for a moment. He had disappeared in the house. She was yelling for him. She found him in a closet, curled up on the floor, crying, going through a box of photo albums. The boy said he wanted to take one of the photos and put it in his wallet. He asked her, ""'Can we go to be with Dad?'"" She replied that they would go to his father's funeral and they would be there for anything and everything the boy wanted. ""He said, 'Yeah, I'd like to go be with him when he comes home, and I said, 'OK, we will be.'""

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 15 people were killed Tuesday in a suicide blast in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, which has been bedeviled by the deadly Boko Haram insurgency, a witness and a paramedic said. The explosion occurred when a homemade bomb, concealed in a van loaded with charcoal, went off at an ever-busy traffic circle outside the city's main market, according to a Twitter account by the Nigerian Defense Ministry. Witnesses said the blast happened at about 8:00 a.m., when traffic was beginning to build at the roundabout, causing a major fire that engulfed vehicles and shops lining the streets. Local vigilantes called Civilian JTF, after the special military unit battling Boko Haram, evacuated the victims of the morning blast to the State Specialist Hospital in the city. ""We have so far taken 15 dead bodies to the hospital from the blast scene, most of them women and boys,"" said a local vigilante Adam Kolo. A journalist who was at the hospital confirmed seeing 15 bodies brought in by the rescue team. A ""rescue operation is still ongoing, which means the toll may change. We have also evacuated several people with injuries from the explosion,"" Kolo said. ""I saw several people lying lifeless on the street with six cars and three motorized rickshaws burning,"" said resident Ibrahim Mustapha. Most of the victims were elderly women selling peanuts and kola nuts by the roadside and poor boys, Kolo said. It is a custom in Maiduguri for residents to buy peanuts every morning and give them out as alms to poor boys begging on the streets. The women vendors come out early in the morning and line the streets with their wares, waiting for residents leaving for work, while the child beggars mill around waiting for a generous buyer, Mustapha said. Restive mobs besieged the area around the blast scene, barring reporters from taking photos of the carnage, and manhandled a photographer who wanted to take shots. The mobs attacked and slightly injured four firefighters trying to quench the inferno at the scene, accusing them of not deploying fast enough to battle the fire. ""The youth were quite agitated and prevented us from taking photos of the scene and even descended on the firemen working to douse the fire,"" one of the reporters at the scene said. Maiduguri has witnessed relative calm since last year, when local vigilantes sprang up and chased out Boko Haram insurgents into the bush, ending near-daily deadly bombing and shooting attacks. The city has however witnessed isolated bombings and deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram.","The incident occurred in Maiduguri, the capital of restive Borno state .

"(CNN) -- Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner's executions are back on the schedule for next week after Oklahoma's high court lifted their stays, saying they had no right to know the source of the drugs that will be used to kill them. The inmates, who are being held at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, where they are slated to be executed by lethal injection Tuesday, had challenged the state's so-called secrecy provision, which forbids disclosing the identities of anyone involved in the execution process or suppliers of any drugs or medical equipment. Lockett and Warner also challenged the state Department of Corrections' failure to divulge which drugs would be used, but the department disclosed what drugs it intended to use before the high court's decision: midazolam, which causes unconsciousness, along with pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride, which shut down breathing and the heart. The Oklahoma Supreme Court said the only remaining issue, then, is whether the state's failure to disclose its source for the drugs prevents the prisoners from challenging their executions using the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The court decided it did not. ""This court holds that the secrecy provision ... does not violate the inmates' constitutional right of access to the courts,"" the Wednesday ruling said. Attorney Seth Day, who represents both men, called the ruling unacceptable and told CNN affiliate KFOR that there was no way to know if the prisoners' executions ""would be carried out in a constitutional and humane manner."" ""It's not even known whether the lethal injection drugs to be used were obtained legally, and nothing is known about their source, purity, or efficacy, among other questions,"" he told the station. ""Oklahoma's extreme secrecy surrounding lethal injection undermines our courts and democracy."" Attorney General Scott Pruitt applauded the decision, saying the state had a longstanding precedent of keeping the drug sources secret to avoid ""schemes and intimidation used by defense counsel and other anti-death-penalty groups."" ""These death row inmates have not contested their guilt for murdering two innocent victims nor have they contested their sentences of death. The legal wrangling of the attorneys for Lockett and Warner has served only to delay their punishment for the heinous crimes they committed,"" he told KFOR. Lockett was convicted in 2000 of a bevy of crimes, including first-degree murder, first-degree rape, kidnapping and robbery in a 1999 home invasion and crime spree that left Stephanie Nieman dead and two people injured. In 2003, Warner was convicted for the 1997 first-degree rape and murder of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter, Adrianna Waller. The constitutionality of lethal injection drugs and drug cocktails has made headlines since last year, when European manufacturers -- including Denmark-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Thirty-two states were left to find new drug protocols. ""The states are scrambling to find the drugs,"" Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, said in November. ""They want to carry out these executions that they have scheduled, but they don't have the drugs and they're changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of executions."" If Lockett and Warner are executed next week, they would be the 194th and 195th inmates Oklahoma has executed since 1915.","Inmates had challenged state clause keeping source of lethal injection drugs secret .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two ex-Blackwater Worldwide employees allege the company charged the government for a prostitute and strippers and kept incompetent personnel for financial reasons, part of what they call a systematic pattern to defraud authorities. The accusations come in a lawsuit filed by Brad and Melan Davis -- who said the fraudulent activity, such as double billing and submitting false invoices, occurred while the security firm, now known as Xe, carried out its work in Iraq, Afghanistan and in Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina's aftermath. Melan Davis, who was involved in record-keeping, said Blackwater billed the government for prostitution services in Afghanistan from a Filipino female, whose name was on Blackwater's payroll roster under a category called ""Morale Welfare Recreation."" She said Blackwater billed the woman's plane tickets and monthly salary to the United States. The lawsuit also said a vendor being paid for ""cleaning services"" in Louisiana was providing strippers. Another accusation in the suit was that Melan Davis was wrongfully dismissed after raising the issue of ""fraud and abuse."" Xe on Friday responded to the suit. ""The allegations are without merit and the company will vigorously defend against this lawsuit. It is noteworthy that the government has declined to intervene in this action,"" Xe said in a statement to CNN. The married couple filed suit in December 2008 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia under the False Claims Act. It was unsealed this month. Blackwater became the target of widespread Iraqi outrage after its contractors were involved in the September 2007 shooting in Baghdad's Nisoor Square that left 17 civilians dead. That outrage was renewed in December when a U.S. judge dismissed manslaughter charges against five guards involved in the shootings on constitutional grounds. In the fraud suit, Brad Davis, an ex-Marine who worked as a security guard for Blackwater, said he ""personally observed"" three instances where personnel ""intentionally used excessive and unjustified deadly force"" and the suit said Blackwater refused to fire such ""unqualified people."" Blackwater would continue to retain ""wholly incompetent"" personnel so they could pay their tuition bills to the company's private training facility, the suit said. In Louisiana, where Blackwater was contracted to supply security services after Katrina, employees there ""submitted a variety of bogus receipts,"" the suit said. ""For example, Blackwater employees, when filling up Blackwater vehicles at commercial gas stations, would simply pick up the receipts that were left behind by other customers. They would then submit these receipts and be paid in cash by Blackwater."" At the same time, the suit said, Blackwater failed to provide the services set down under its contract with Louisiana and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It said Blackwater didn't monitor the ""deadly weapons"" it provided employees and ""lost track of countless weapons."" The suit said Blackwater overbilled for travel expenses and ""created phone invoices to obscure the fact that Blackwater had failed to keep any of the necessary contemporaneous documentation on travel."" The suit said Melan Davis attempted ""to blow the whistle on the fraud and abuse occurring in New Orleans"" and was told in 2006 she ""needed to back off."" The suit said she was fired in 2008 when ""she was on leave battling cancer."" Blackwater had about 1,000 contractors working in Iraq at the height of its involvement, guarding diplomatic convoys and supply vehicles after the U.S. invasion in 2003. At least 10 of its employees were killed, including four whose burned and mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets of Falluja after an ambush in 2004.","Two ex-Blackwater Worldwide employees sue, allege pattern of fraud, abuse against firm .

"(CNN) -- One out of three Americans under 65 were without health insurance at some point during 2007 and 2008, according to a report released Wednesday. With respect to health care reform, ""the cost of doing nothing is too high,"" says Families USA. The study, commissioned by the consumer health advocacy group Families USA, found 86.7 million Americans were uninsured at one point during the past two years. Among the report's key findings: . • Nearly three out of four uninsured Americans were without health insurance for at least six months. • Almost two-thirds were uninsured for nine months or more. • Four out of five of the uninsured were in working families. • People without health insurance are less likely to have a usual doctor and often go without screenings or preventative care. ""The huge number of people without health coverage is worse than an epidemic,"" Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said in a press release. ""Inaction on health care reform in 2009 cannot be an option for the tens of millions of people who lack or lose health coverage each year ... the cost of doing nothing is too high."" The study came out the day before President Obama plans to hold a health care summit at the White House. The President says reforming health care is one of his top priorities. The number of Americans without health insurance reported by Families USA is much higher than those reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the census numbers, in 2007 there were 45.7 million uninsured Americans. Families USA says those numbers tell only part of the story. The Census bureau counts only people who were uninsured for the full calendar year. For its own study, Families USA commissioned The Lewin Group to analyze data from the Census Bureau and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Its study includes people who did not have health insurance for all or for part of the past two years. Critics say the number of uninsured Americans cited in the Families USA report is misleading. ""No one disagrees we have a problem with the uninsured,"" says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who advised Sen. John McCain on domestic and economic policy during the 2008 election. But Holtz-Eakin thinks Families USA is exaggerating the numbers to make a political point the day before the White House summit. ""They are simply choosing to report over a two-year window a measure that always gives you a larger number.""","Study: One out of three Americans without health insurance at some point in 2007-08 .

"(CNN) -- A statement from al Qaeda on Friday marking the death of Osama bin Laden included renewed warnings of terrorist attacks against U.S. interests around the world and suggested that a process to choose his successor is under way. ""Sheikh Osama didn't build an organization to die when he dies,"" the message said. It was posted on several jihadist forums known for carrying al Qaeda statements. The man taking over will most likely be Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian who was al Qaeda's No. 2 under bin Laden. The bylaws of al Qaeda, recovered by the U.S. military in Afghanistan after September 11, set out clear guidelines on the replacement of bin Laden, requiring the Command, or Shura, Council of al Qaeda to ""pledge allegiance to the deputy emir and elect him as emir in the event that the emir dies or is captured and there is no hope for his liberation."" It would be risky for al Qaeda's on-the-run leadership to assemble a meeting of its Shura Council. They may therefore choose to shortcut some of the required proceedings. Bin Laden killing caps decade-long manhunt . Analysts expect that al Qaeda may choose to announce the elevation of al-Zawahiri through a written statement to avoid having him take the security risk of recording a statement. But they also expect that at some point, al Qaeda's media arm, As-Sahab, will release a video to mark bin Laden's death for maximum propaganda impact, one that could feature a ""martyrdom"" video recorded by bin Laden to encourage followers. The As-Sahab videotape would probably include a message from al Qaeda's new leader. It might take several weeks for al Qaeda to put together such a video; recent audio messages recorded by al-Zawahiri on the democracy movement sweeping the Middle East have been several weeks out of date. But according to IntelCenter, which monitors jihadist propaganda, it would be feasible for al Qaeda to compile and distribute such a video within a week. The clear guidelines for succession will, however, be little consolation to al Qaeda's rank and file members. Bin Laden was the charismatic icon of the terrorist organization and may have continued to play a greater operational role than thought. The seizure by American Navy SEALs of multiple thumb drives, storage devices and hard drives full of data raise questions about whether bin Laden was continuing to receive information about al Qaeda operations and whether he was in turn passing on instructions through couriers. The discovery of information in bin Laden's files on what appears to be a small-scale aspirational plot to derail U.S. commuter trains on the 10th anniversary of September 11 indicates that bin Laden was being briefed even on the minutiae of some of al Qaeda's operations. Western intelligence officials had believed that bin Laden signed off on only al Qaeda's most significant plots after 9/11, including the 2006 plot to bomb seven trans-Atlantic airliners leaving London's Heathrow Airport and the ""Mumbai-style"" plot to attack European cities last fall. While bin Laden's charisma inspired a generation of recruits, al-Zawahiri is a self-styled intellectual whose long-winded video and audiotapes must be tedious to even the most committed of al Qaeda members and whose arrogance has alienated many in al Qaeda ranks over the years. Bin Laden was the key unifying force within al Qaeda, but al-Zawahiri has always been a deeply polarizing figure within the organization, obsessing over minor theological differences with others and prioritizing jihad in Egypt over other causes. Like al Qaeda's deceased leader, al-Zawahiri possesses no formal religious training giving him authority to make fatwas (religious judgments). But unlike bin Laden, the Egyptian did not make up for this by earning jihadist fame on the front lines of the Afghan jihad against the Soviets. During the 1990s, many within al Qaeda resented al-Zawahiri for persuading bin Laden to channel significant funds into his Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization that otherwise would have been given to them. That was a symptom of the rivalry and tension that existed since al Qaeda's founding between the group's Egyptian faction and other nationalities within the organization, especially those from Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the Gulf states. Mixed emotions about bin Laden's death: How should we feel? Those who follow al Qaeda say it was only bin Laden's charismatic aloofness, epitomized by his habit of listening to his top lieutenants bicker over strategy before deciding a course of action, that kept al Qaeda's strong centrifugal forces in check over the years. The challenge that al-Zawahiri now faces in keeping al Qaeda from fracturing were demonstrated the last time al Qaeda fighters feared their leader may have been killed. According to Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist and now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation, a UK counterterrorism think tank, about 150 Arab fighters, including a strong al Qaeda contingent, fled to Gardez in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan around the time bin Laden's Tora Bora refuge was being carpet-bombed by American B-52s in December 2001. Benotman, who was in touch at the time with Libyan fighters in Gardez, said that no sooner had the group reached the safety of the town than infighting broke out among Egyptians, Saudis, Uzbeks and Libyans, and between al Qaeda members and fighters from other groups, over who should assume command. The fact that under al Qaeda's bylaws, members of the terrorist organization will now have to swear a personal ""bayat,"" or oath of allegiance, to al-Zawahiri just like they did in the past to bin Laden may be too much to stomach for some of the group's Saudi and Yemeni members. Al Qaeda's internal constitution provides near-total authority to the organization's emir, giving him alone the powers to appoint a deputy and members of the Shura Council, though in the last resort it states that the Shura Council can depose the emir if he ""deviates from adhering to the Islamic laws, or when he loses his competence."" It would be wrong, however, to underestimate al-Zawahiri. Although the Egyptian may not be as charismatic or unifying a leader as bin Laden, he is one of the few al Qaeda leaders with a reputation for strategic cunning and vision. During the Iraqi insurgency, for example, al-Zawahiri tried in vain to persuade Abu Musab al-Zarqawi to tone down his barbaric violence, realizing that it would create a backlash against al Qaeda in Iraq. One of al-Zawahiri's most important immediate decisions as leader would be whom to choose as the new deputy leader of al Qaeda. In terms of seniority, one of the strongest contenders for this position would be Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian army lieutenant and long-time member of al-Zawahiri's Egyptian Islamic Jihad group. He is believed to have returned to the tribal areas of Pakistan last year after a period of house arrest in Iran. According to a former jihadist, Adel is believed to currently occupy the ""chief of staff"" position within al Qaeda, managing insurgent paramilitary operations in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, with a special remit to manage the group's relations with other Jihadist groups and affiliates. However, appointing a fellow Egyptian might only increase factionalism within al Qaeda. According to Benotman, who met al-Adel in 2000 in Kandahar, a dispute flared up between al-Adel and Saudi members of al Qaeda while the organization was based in Taliban-run Afghanistan, forcing bin Laden to transfer al-Adel from leadership of al Qaeda's military committee to its security committee. Also, the loss of al Qaeda's Saudi leader may already have had a chilling effect on the group's fundraising efforts in the Gulf region. Al-Zawahiri may, therefore, appoint a non-Egyptian to the deputy leadership position. One contender would be Abu Yahya al-Libi, a Libyan jihadist who made his name by escaping from Bagram Air Base in 2005. In recent yeas, al-Libi has emerged as one of al Qaeda's lead ideologues and propagandists, releasing a series of videos calling for new recruits. According to former jihadists, al-Libi's charismatic Arab-language speeches are particularly popular among a younger generation of militants across the Arab world. However, Benotman -- the former Libyan Jihadist commander whose group included al-Libi as a junior member -- does not believe that al-Libi yet has the stature or track record as a fighter needed for promotion to a top leadership position. A dark horse for the deputy leadership position may be Ilyas Kashmiri, a veteran Pakistani jihadist who recently became part of al Qaeda's top leadership. Kashmiri is currently the head al Qaeda's 313 brigade, a group based in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He has threatened attacks overseas similar to the Mumbai hotel attacks at the end of 2009, in which more than 200 people were killed. That operation was carried out by the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. The elevation of Kashmiri would have the advantage of further strengthening ties between al Qaeda and Pakistani jihadist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban, Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. Underlining the close ties between Pakistani jihadist groups and al Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban have vowed to launch an attack in the United States to avenge bin Laden's death. The Pakistan Taliban have already been involved in one attempted attack in the United States. Faisal Shahzad, one of the group's recruits, attempted to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square on May 1, 2010, exactly a year before Osama bin Laden's death. What makes a promotion for Kashmiri unlikely is that many of al Qaeda's rank and file will balk at a non-Arab being one step away from the top leadership position. Despite its many relocations and affiliations, al Qaeda has remained an Arab-centric group. U.S. military drone targets Al-Awlaki in Yemen . American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is unlikely to be promoted to a leadership position within al Qaeda ""Central"" as he is based in Yemen rather than Pakistan. Though al-Awlaki has emerged as a powerful charismatic preacher for bin Laden's cause and an important figure within al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, he possesses none of the combat track record that al Qaeda members over the years have so prized in their leaders. Moreover, al-Zawahiri is very unlikely to reward somebody he has never met with a key leader or entertain the risk of being upstaged by the American. In the end, al-Zawahiri's accession may be short-lived. The ""treasure trove"" of documents, thumb drives and computer discs found in bin Laden's compound may provide American intelligence with crucial clues about his whereabouts. According to Western officials, intelligence has suggested bin Laden and al-Zawahiri continued to communicate in recent years and were possibly in relatively close geographic proximity.","Ayman al-Zawahiri is the most likely successor to bin Laden, but he lacks his charisma .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A tour bus crash with a big rig and two vehicles in California early Wednesday killed four people and injured nearly two dozen others near the Arizona border, according to the California Highway Patrol. All four fatalities were passengers on the tour bus, which was carrying 25 people, CNN affiliate KCBS-TV said. A truck carrying metal pipes jackknifed around 2 a.m. Wednesday on Interstate 10 near Blythe, sending the load across the highway and apparently into the opposite lane of traffic, where the tour bus was traveling, the station reported. ""The pipes subsequently caused some of the vehicles to crash into them in the eastbound lanes and it appears they could have rolled into westbound traffic which is where the bus was traveling,"" Terri Kasinga of Caltrans told the TV station. The bus struck the pipes and then ran off the freeway by 40 to 50 feet, KCBS reported. It then fell down an embankment and landed on its side, the station said. No further details were available on the two vehicles involved in the crash. The tour bus was traveling westbound on I-10 from El Paso, Texas, to Los Angeles and had just made a stop in Phoenix, the highway patrol told the affiliate.

"(CNN) -- The commander of a military base has broad jurisdiction over the facility, including public roads and a special protest zone located on it, the Supreme Court decided Wednesday. The justices unanimously ruled against Dennis Apel, a longtime critic of U.S. military policy who for 17 years has protested around Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The court's reading of federal law ""reaches all property within the defined boundaries of a military place that is under the command of a military officer,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. The power to secure portions of the base more tightly than others does ""not change when the commander invites the public to use a portion of the base for a road, a school, a bus stop, or a protest area, especially when the commander reserves authority to protect military property by, among other things, excluding vandals and trespassers."" Apel's message of peace and the conflict it has created with Obama administration officials was at the heart of this free speech and boundary dispute. At issue was whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for later ""peacefully protesting"" on a public road easement along the enclosed high-security facility. The appeal presented a fact-specific inquiry into such issues as ""concurrent"" government jurisdiction, public forums, and the limits of ""exclusive control"" asserted by the military. While the court's ruling was a temporary setback for Apel, it did not address his larger contention that the federal law in question was unconstitutional. That issue will continue to percolate in the lower federal courts, and may yet give the 63-year-old man a right to return to Vandenberg, where location is integral to his message. Apel and wife, Tensie Hernandez-Apel, founded Beatitude Catholic Worker House in Guadalupe, California, about a half-hour away from the base, which is along the Pacific Ocean, northwest of Santa Barbara. The Vandenberg high-tech facility launches military satellites, operates aeronautical and space surveillance missions, and tests a variety of sophisticated weapons systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles. Running through its eastern boundary are state Highways 1 and 246, open to the traveling public. The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a ""use easement"" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads. Concurrent jurisdiction gives a measure of control of the narrow strip of land to all three entities. The Apels and their supporters from Pacific Life Community, a group that opposes nuclear weapons, had conducted monthly peace vigils in a special open ""protest zone"" created along the Pacific Coast Highway bisecting the base. A special green line is designed to mark an off-limits area. Vandenberg's commanding officer in 2003 issued a ""barment order"" against Dennis Apel after he was arrested for trespassing and vandalism, including throwing blood on a base sign. A second ""bar letter"" was given four years later, after another trespassing incident. In 2010, with the ban still in effect, Apel again entered the protest zone on repeated occasions, was told to leave, and was then escorted off the property. He says he has been arrested about 15 times. He sought to block the misdemeanor counts on free speech and other legal grounds. A federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor, saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military's ""exclusive right of possession."" The Justice Department then asked the Supreme Court to intervene, which has now ruled in the government's favor. At the December oral argument and in its subsequent written ruling, the court rebuffed efforts by Apel and his attorneys to make this a predominately First Amendment case, and in effect limit a military commander's discretion. ""We decline Apel's invitation to require civilian judges to examine U. S. military sites around the world, parcel by parcel, to determine which have roads, which have fences, and which have a sufficiently important, persistent military purpose,"" said Roberts. ""The use-it-or-lose-it rule that Apel proposes would frustrate the administration of military facilities and raise difficult questions for judges, who are not expert in military operations. And it would discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for the convenience of the public,"" he said. But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while agreeing the base commander had authority to control any portion of the base within its borders, nevertheless suggested Apel's broader constitutional claims over his removal order may have merit. ""It is questionable whether Apel's ouster from the protest area can withstand constitutional review,"" she said. ""The court has properly reserved that issue for consideration on remand,"" meaning Apel may yet get another opportunity before the nation's highest court someday. As for Apel, he told CNN his fight will continue. ""They're denying my right to dissent on their base,"" he said. ""They're systematically trying to keep me out there, but I'm not going away."" The case is U.S. v. Apel (12-1038).","Supreme Court rules military has broad jurisdiction over public spaces on bases .
The justices unanimously rule against a critic of U.S. military policy .
That issue will continue to percolate in the lower federal courts ."
"(CNN) -- The story of a biblical miracle that saved a man's life from blazing bullets has turned out to be a myth, police in Ohio said. The account by a public transit bus driver who said a devotional Bible carried in his chest pocket stopped two shots fired at his heart isn't true, said Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl on Wednesday. ""Based on the evidence, this crime did not occur as reported,"" he told CNN affiliate WDTN. The incident took place in February. On Wednesday, the driver, Rickey Wagoner, stuck by his narrative. ""I didn't make this up in any way, shape or form,"" Wagoner said. ""And because things happen that they can't explain, they think that I am lying. They're not offering any proof that I am lying."" Gang initiation? Wagoner said that three young men assailed him possibly as part of a gang initiation in February. At the time, he said he heard one of them tell another to ""kill the polar bear"" in order to be ""all the way in the club."" (Wagoner is white. The attackers, he said, were black.) Police Chief Biehl cast a wrench into that part of the story on Wednesday, doubting the attack even happened. ""We do not have three armed male offenders stalking members of our community and assaulting them without provocation,"" he said. Casting doubts . Wagoner said he sprang into action, pulling an aluminum pen from his pocket and stabbing one of the teenage boys in the leg. The suspects dropped the gun and fled. Wagoner said he picked it up and fired after them. Whatever transpired, he came away from it with a bullet wound to the leg and a slashed arm, which were treated at a local hospital. Police didn't say in February what condition the Bible was in, but they believed Wagoner's miracle story back then. They said that without some kind of intervention, he wouldn't have survived. But after months of examining DNA evidence and doing ballistics tests on the gun, police say they have demystified the story. Biehl said that Wagoner may lose his job with the public transit authority, which also accuses him of making the story up.

"(CNN) -- For more than a year and a half, Lakhdar Brahimi was at the front lines of talks between the two sides of Syria's civil war. As the U.N.-Arab League special envoy to Syria, he doggedly pursued a political solution to the crisis, with little to show for it. And now, Brahimi is resigning from his post, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday. Ban accepted the envoy's resignation ""with great regret,"" he said, standing by Brahimi's side at U.N. Headquarters in New York. The resignation is effective May 31. The announcement came as a truce between Syrian rebels and the government showed signs of faltering. Rebels in Aleppo on Tuesday fired upon pro-government enclaves in that town in retaliation for Syrian troops earlier firing upon the opposition in Homs, according to the rebels and an opposition group. Brahimi had been apologetic before for the failure of peace talks but remained a highly regarded mediator. ""The resignation of Lakhdar Brahimi is further proof of the failure of international efforts to end the horrific bloodshed in Syria,"" said Andy Baker, region program manager for Oxfam on the Syrian crisis. ""Perhaps it's no coincidence that the peace envoy to Syria should step down when the prospect for a peaceful resolution seems as distant as ever."" The truce began last Wednesday in the strategic and symbolic city of Homs, where opposition fighters and their families underwent an evacuation, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in London said. Those 600 fighters and their families were evacuated to Addar al-Kabira. But government forces shelled Addar al-Kabira this week, according to the opposition. ""The regime's shelling of the town of Addar al-Kabira north of Homs, to where rebels of Homs retreated in line with a deal organized by the U.N., makes evident the falsity of the truces that the Assad regime seeks to promote,"" Nasser al-Hariri, a member of the Syrian Coalition, said in a statement Tuesday. He was referring to President Bashar al-Assad's regime. On Monday, Syrian troops opened fire on al Waer, the last known opposition stronghold in Homs, killing at least one person, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""We consider the shelling of Waer a violation of the agreement, and it shows the government is not abiding by the truce on the ground,"" a statement from the Ahl al Sham rebel command center said. ""We will respond to this violation by shelling Nubul and Zahraa,"" two government enclaves in Aleppo, the statement said. The rebel Ahl al Sham fighting coalition in Aleppo posted video of fighters firing rockets into the two Aleppo neighborhoods, known to be sympathetic to the government. Originally, the opposition had agreed to allow aid into these pro-government neighborhoods, both Shiite enclaves, in exchange for the safe passage of fighters out of Homs.","NEW: U.N. secretary-general accepts the U.N.-Arab League envoy's resignation .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain has revoked the citizenship of 31 Shiite activists, the latest clampdown on the opposition amid continued unrest in the Persian Gulf kingdom. The state-run Bahrain TV announced the move Tuesday evening, citing an Interior Ministry statement. The television anchor read out the names of the 31 activists, which included Jawad Fairouz, a former member of parliament for the Shiite opposition group Al-Wefaq, and his brother, Jalal. Among the other prominent opposition figures who were stripped of their citizenship were Said al-Shihabi, the head of the Freemen of Bahrain movement, and Ali Hassan Mushaima, the son of the leader of Al-Haq group. Also on the list were three Shiite clerics: Hussein Mirza, Khaled Mansour Sanad and Alawi Sharaf. The Interior Ministry statement Tuesday said the country's Citizenship Act ""allows the kingdom the right to revoke the citizenship of anyone who is charged with being a threat to the state's security,"" Bahrain TV reported. Those who object to the decision have the right to challenge it in court, it added. Two prominent Bahraini groups, the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights and Bahrain Center for Human Rights, decried the move. The groups said they had ""grave concern over the systematic targeting of prominent political activists, former members of parliament, clerics and others. The Bahraini authorities did not provide substantial evidence as to why these individuals' citizenships have been revoked."" Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch similarly condemned the move. ""The authorities have provided the vaguest of reasons for the deprivation of nationality, which appears to have been taken on the basis of the victims' political views,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""Most worryingly, the authorities are making some in the group stateless. This, as well as any arbitrary deprivation of nationality, is prohibited under international law,"" he said. ""We urgently call on the Bahraini authorities to rescind this frightening and chilling decision."" The government decision ""seems to completely disregard their basic rights,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""There is no justification for equating political dissent with damaging Bahrain's security."" Bahraini authorities imposed a ban late last month on public protests, saying it was necessary to rein in violence. But Amnesty International said the move breached people's right to free speech. Violent clashes have broken out between security forces and opposition protesters on numerous occasions since protests began in the island nation in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Bahrain's ruling Khalifa family is Sunni Muslim, but about two-thirds of the country's people are Shiite. The country is strategically important for the United States in the region and it is home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.

"Near Flagstaff, Arizona (CNN) -- As one of hundreds of evacuees in Arizona's raging wildfire, Serena Chesmore valued family over home. She ensured the safety of the most precious things in the world: her family and pets. Her house in Kachina Village, after all, is replaceable, Chesmore said Friday. ""The kids, the pets, the photos -- they can't be replaced,"" Chesmore said. But Chesmore said she is hoping that firefighters will be able to save her house and 300 other homes and businesses from an Arizona forest fire roaring through park land. She made an early jump on a pre-evacuation notice given to about 3,200 residents in Coconino County. The online Incident Information System reported Friday night that much of the fire burned with lower intensity throughout the day, allowing firefighters to make some progress. However, despite that progress, the total area scorched climbed to 8,500 acres, and the containment level held steady at 5%. Weather conditions ""will likely worsen"" during the Memorial Day weekend, which could cause problems containing the fire, CNN meteorologist Matt Daniel said. He said temperatures are expected to warm up, humidity will decrease during the day, and winds are expected to go up. Firefighters face rough conditions . The equivalent of a battalion of 960 firefighters, including 15 hotshot crews and three air tankers, have been fighting the fire between Flagstaff and Sedona -- a tourist and retirement destination famed for its red rock formations -- since Tuesday afternoon. Tony Sciacca, a fire incident commander, said it's been an uphill battle for the firefighters battling the blaze. ""They're engaged in tough terrain, cutting vegetation, applying fire to the landscape as they need to in burnout operations,"" Sciacca said. Area residents took to Facebook on Friday to thank firefighters. ""Thank you again for your tireless work on this monster,"" Mavis Kimball posted to the Slide Fire Information Facebook page. ""We who call this place home so appreciate you."" ""So thankful the best of the best are here on the Slide Fire,"" wrote Terry Schneider. Dust-dry pine needles, high winds and steep slopes have made for ideal conditions for the fire to spread rapidly, fire officials say. And it has. The flames that investigators fear were ignited by human hands appear to have consumed hundreds of acres in a few hours' time, according to officials.

"(CNN) -- Corrections officers looking inside Ariel Castro's cell found him with a sheet tied around his neck, his knees bent, his shorts around his ankles, 27 minutes after their last look. They also found that the convicted kidnapper had apparently done more than kill himself that day, according to a report on Castro's death from the Ohio State Highway Patrol. He wrote a note -- dated that same day, September 3 -- invoking scripture and saying that those who confessed with their heart ""will be saved."" ""God loves you,"" Castro wrote in all capital letters, ""for all are sinners, we all fall short of the glory of God. Christ is my saviour and yours!!"" Did this constitute a suicide note? That's subject to interpretation; the only person who would know it, Castro, isn't alive to answer. But the report released Wednesday indicates that he did indeed kill himself. In the process, it also refuted a theory he died accidentally while engaged in auto-erotic asphyxiation, with state patrol spokeswoman Lt. Anne Ralston saying no evidence was found to support this claim. One fact that some said pointed to this possibility was the fact that Castro was found with his pants pulled to his ankles and without underwear in his cell at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio. But, based partly on conversations with several inmates, the report found that Castro ""frequently struggled to hold his pants up"" after losing weight in prison. Moreover, an official indicated that Castro ""frequently did not wear underwear,"" so the fact he didn't have any on at the time of his death wasn't surprising. Beyond that, the report also provides fresh detail into the final day of Castro, who just five months earlier was holding three women -- as well as one of their young daughters, whom he'd fathered while in captivity -- in his Cleveland home. The document details nine times, between 2:14 p.m. and when his hanging body was found at 9:18 p.m., that corrections officers had looked into his cell or went near or past it. He got a tray of food at 5:29 p.m., for instance, and a ""supervisor, an officer and a nurse (stood) in front of"" Castro's cell one hour and 10 minutes later, according to surveillance video. The next time anyone went by was 8:51 p.m., when the report indicated ""an officer looked into Inmate Castro's cell."" ""During the entirety of the video, no one is observed entering or exiting inmate Castro's cell prior to the emergency call by the officers,"" the report notes. It added that ""possible inaccurate and/or questionable entries"" on the log book detailing what inmates were visited, and when, were found, but ""no discrepancies were directly related to the death of Inmate Castro."" This comes after a report released in October found that two prison guards responsible for checking on Castro ""did not timely perform"" their required rounds. Inside, they found the handwritten letter quoting Romans 8:39, a small Bible and another note that had ""love"" -- inscribed in a heart -- ""my kids and grandkids."" Also appearing all around that paper were the names of family members, interspersed with symbols such as hearts, flowers and musical notes. At the time of his death, Castro had been sentenced to life plus more than 1,000 years for kidnapping and repeatedly raping three young women: Michelle Knight, Georgina DeJesus and Amanda Berry. The former school bus driver lured the women -- some of whom he knew through his own children -- at different times into his home, where he variably tied them up, sexually assaulted them and prevented from having any contact with the outside world. With the help of people nearby, Berry (then with her young daughter) escaped May 6 and called 911. The other two women, still inside the Seymour Avenue home, were rescued by authorities a short time later.

"(CNN) -- Up until Sunday, Matt Kuchar had been the PGA Tour's ""nearly man"" this season. But the American golfer ended his run of final-round disappointments in spectacular style at the RBC Heritage tournament in South Carolina, holing a bunker shot at the last to clinch a one-shot victory. The birdie, coming after dropping a shot with a three-putt at the previous hole, earned him the $1 million first prize ahead of former world No. 1 Luke Donald, who finished with three pars. For Kuchar, it was redemption -- and relief -- after tying fifth at the Masters, losing a playoff in Houston and placing equal fourth in Texas.

"(CNN) -- NASCAR's Hall of Fame class for 2015 includes Bill Elliott, one of its most popular drivers ever, and Wendell Scott, the only African-American to win a top-level race, the auto racing sanctioning body announced Wednesday. Three other drivers -- Fred Lorenzen, Joe Weatherly and Rex White -- will be inducted at a ceremony on January 30 at the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, North Carolina. Elliott won one Winston Cup title and 44 races in his 37-year career, including two victories at the Daytona 500. Known as ""Awesome Bill from Dawsonville"", a reference to his Georgia hometown, Elliott won the series top circuit championship in 1988. He was voted NASCAR's most popular driver a record 16 times. In 1963, Scott became the only African-American to win a race at NASCAR's highest level, taking a 100-mile feature at Jacksonville, Florida, on December 1. He also was the first African-American to race full time in NASCAR's premier series, called the Grand National Series at the time. Scott made the top 10 in 30% of the races in his 13-year Grand National career. He was portrayed in the 1977 movie ""Greased Lightning"" by Richard Pryor. He died in 1990. Lorenzen was considered one of the sport's first superstars and won 26 races while running a part-time schedule in the 1960s and early 1970s. Weatherly was a two-time champion, in 1962 and in 1963, when he raced for nine different teams. White was a short-track specialist in the early days of NASCAR. And since there were few super speedways, White finished in the top five about half the time. He won the 1960 championship and 28 races in his career (only twice at tracks longer than a mile). Racing great Darrell Waltrip tweeted Wednesday: ""I totally agree with the new members of the HoF, this is a great group and I love that Wendell Scott was selected!"" The late wife of NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., Anne Bledsoe France, will be honored with a Landmark Award.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- She checked herself into a hospital weeks ago for a bladder infection. But nobody could have predicted it would end like this. When Lynne Spalding went missing from San Francisco General Hospital, her friends frantically searched and left messages on a Facebook page to keep each other hopeful. On Tuesday, the messages on the ""Find Lynne"" Facebook page turned from hope to anger. A body was found in an exterior stairwell of the hospital, and the San Francisco medical examiner confirmed Thursday that it is Spalding, also known as Lynne Ford. How could this be? Spalding's friends had searched throughout San Francisco, in alleys and shelters, handing out hundreds of fliers. They wondered whether the woman, dazed by powerful medication, was wandering around somewhere. ""So we have a lot of questions as her family and friends,"" said David Perry, a Spalding family spokesman. ""Did anyone see her leave the room? Did she leave alone? Is there videotape of Lynne leaving the hospital or wandering the halls?"" All who looked for Spalding, 57, who has two adult children, assumed the hospital had been searched thoroughly. ""Dumbfounded that they didn't find her for two weeks?! Where the hell were they looking?!"" Liz Kennedy wrote on the ""Find Lynne"" website. ""I honestly believe there should be an investigation into how the hospital areas were not thoroughly checked by the staff,"" another poster named Sunil Raj wrote. Hospital officials and police say they are investigating. The hospital says it has no idea how the body ended up in the rarely-used staircase. ""We're distressed,"" Rachael Kagan, a spokeswoman for San Francisco General Hospital, told CNN affiliate KTVU. ""We don't know what happened. That's our top priority, is to find that out."" Spalding was admitted to the hospital on September 19, and her condition was improving when she disappeared two days later, according to the joint statement released by the hospital and sheriff's department. ""She was in fair condition when she left her hospital room shortly after being checked on by a nurse at 10:15 a.m. Fifteen minutes later, the nurse checked on her again, and upon finding her room empty, initiated a search of the hospital,"" the statement said. Thirty minutes later after she disappeared, two of her friends and her boyfriend arrived at the hospital to visit, Perry said. They were told that Spalding had been missing for 30 minutes, Perry said. ""Someone has died in a mysterious fashion at San Francisco General Hospital, an institution which is known for healing,"" Perry said. ""And tonight I'm sure the staff of SF General is horrified and confused, certainly the family is horrified and confused."" According to the joint statement, when the patient was not found, the hospital staff notified the family and sheriff's department officials on site. Deputies searched the campus, and did not find her. Corpse found in L.A. hotel's water tank . Spalding's body was discovered in the stairwell by a member of the hospital's engineering staff who was conducting a routine quarterly check, according to the statement. ""The exterior stairwell is a fire exit that is not routinely used by staff, patients or the public.

"(CNN) -- Instead of getting away from it all, go underneath it, and escape to some of the world's unique underwater restaurants and hotels. You'll have to wear scuba gear and a bathing suit or use a boat to get to some of these undersea retreats. Jules' Undersea Lodge . Feel like a superstar at this resort. Celebrities such as Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Jon Fishman of Phish and former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau have visited this underwater lodge in Key Largo, Florida. To reach Jules' Undersea Lodge, you must scuba dive 21 feet down. You'll enter through a 5-foot-by-7-foot opening at the bottom of the lodge, where you'll be greeted with amenities you'd find at an above-ground hotel: a cozy bed, a telephone, books and a VCR/DVD for movies. You'll breathe easy inside this air-conditioned lodge, which is filled with compressed air to prevent water from flooding the rooms. The living quarters include two private bedrooms, a wet room where divers leave their gear and take a shower, and an 8-foot-by-20-foot multipurpose room for dining and entertaining. One couple named their baby Jules after discovering that their recently conceived child had accompanied them to the underwater hotel. Another couple's visit inspired them to change careers and open a dive shop, according to the owners. A night's stay costs $400 to $500 per person, depending on the package. Ithaa Undersea Restaurant . Watch sea life swim around you as you dine in this underwater getaway. Set in a picturesque corner of the Maldive Islands, Ithaa Undersea Restaurant claims to be the world's first all-glass underwater dining establishment. This luxury restaurant, which has welcomed thousands of diners since 2005, sits 16 feet deep in the Indian Ocean and is surrounded by sea life and a coral reef. The six-course dinner menu often features French dishes from executive chef Nicolas Boutin and is priced at $320 a person. A lighter three-course lunch menu is available for $195 a person. Both meals include one glass of bubbly champagne. If you're dining at lunch, don't forget to bring your sunglasses. The sun's rays illuminate the water and make the restaurant so bright inside that diners and the wait staff need eye protection. Utter Inn . If you're looking for a simpler underwater experience, consider the Utter Inn in Västerås, Sweden, which is a single-room hotel containing just two twin beds and a table. This underwater spot, which looks like a small red house above the water, lies nearly 10 feet below the surface of Lake Mälaren and can be accessed only by boat. Panoramic windows in all directions allow guests to watch fish and other aquatic life swim by. During your stay, hang out on the above-water deck to sunbathe, read or fish. Guests are also invited to use an inflatable canoe to explore a nearby uninhabited island. No cooking is required at this getaway. Instead, order dinner and have it delivered. A typical night's stay at the Utter Inn costs $212 per person. Poseidon Undersea Resort . Sleep next to exotic sea life at Poseidon. This underwater five-star luxury hotel in Fiji, set to open in late 2012, has been marketed as the ""world's first sea floor resort."" The 24-room Poseidon Undersea Resort will sit 40 feet below the crystal clear waters of a Fijian lagoon, next to a coral reef.

"Harlem, New York (CNN) -- At the heart of West Harlem, West Africa is buzzing. Nestled inside one of the world's most diverse cities, over the years the thriving neighborhood of Harlem has become the hub of New York's African American community. At the start of the 20th century, throngs of African Americans migrated from the southern United States into the big city, lured by the jobs and opportunities of urban life. But in the last 30 years or so, another group of people decided to call Harlem home. Scores of immigrants from several francophone West African countries moved to the borough to start a new life. At the center of it all, a vibrant Senegalese community has created a new home away from home, adding their culture, fashion and tastes to Harlem's diverse mix. Known as Little Senegal, or Le Petit Senegal, the strip of blocks around West 116th Street is packed with inviting restaurants and colorful shops, powerful reminders of life back in the homeland. ""We're the ones who built Harlem,"" says El Hadji Fey, vice president of the Senegalese Association of America. ""When we got here, all the stores you see over here, it was absolutely nothing. We bought a lot of stores here, a lot of Senegalese businesses right here. ""We were scared in the beginning -- you know how Harlem was 20, 30 years ago. We're the ones who really made Harlem grow up. That's why a lot of people call here Little Senegal because we started making the community grow, we started making people grow."" Along this stretch of blocks, the taste of Senegal is everywhere -- from the tantalizing scents of fish and rice stews emanating from the traditional restaurants dotting the neighborhood, through to the lively Malcolm Shabazz Market, where stall vendors hawk their wares, to the numerous Senegalese-named clothes and haircare shops. At ""Africa Kine,"" which was one of the first Senegalese restaurants to open in Harlem, some two decades ago, homesick customers find comfort in flavors conjuring up memories of home. Others come here looking for fellow countrymen who can make their new city feel less strange. Waitress Maritou Djigal says that ""thiebou dienn,"" Senegal's national dish made of Jolof rice with fish, is the meal of choice in the Harlem eatery. ""Most of the time they [diners] say 'it reminds me of Senegal, it reminds me of my family,'"" she explains. Not far from Africa Kine, at the Red Rooster restaurant, chef Marcus Samuelson is busy checking orders. Samuelson, known for introducing African spices to Western dishes, is using the continent's culinary traditions to expose Africa to a wider audience. ""I look at Africa as a great source of information and inspiration,"" says Samuelson. ""And that's how I come up with some of the great dishes here,"" he adds. ""Harlem is a very special and unique community and it always reminds me of Africa and I feel the most at home here. I love it, it's a real community."" Although called Little Senegal, landmarks with great historical significance for native Africans and African Americans stretch along the Harlem neighborhood. Neal Shoemaker, the energetic president of the Harlem Heritage Tours and Cultural Center, says that some of the most famous African American activists calling for civil rights in the mid-1950s and 1960s were active in the area. ""As you walk through this area here, it's like taking a cultural bath,"" says Shoemaker, who's been leading tours through Little Senegal for over a decade . ""Malcolm X's presence is everywhere in this area,"" he adds, as he walks through the neighborhood. ""That corner right there, on 115th street where the housing project exists, where I was born and raised, is one of the corners where he'd minister to the people and he would offer what he felt was the diagnosis to many of the social problems of the area. ""So when you walk through this area here, you're walking in the steps of many great civil rights leaders.""","New York's Harlem is home to a vibrant Senegalese community .

"(CNN) -- When David Letterman made the surprise announcement on Thursday's ""Late Show with David Letterman"" that he planned to retire in 2015, his stated reasons were that he was just about to turn 67, had been doing the job for more than three decades and wanted to spend more time with his son and family. Hard to argue with any of that. An unstated reason is probably that the younger new wave of late-night TV hosts is not only nipping at his heels but pulling ahead of him. Most important of all, however, is that in the age of the Internet, the way viewers take in late-night TV is not what it was when Letterman was honing his style. The battle for viewers is now fought more with four-minute viral videos the next morning than complete shows with monologues and conversations as integral ingredients. Today's late-night TV is about bite-size bits. Letterman liked to serve multicourse meals. Indeed, his mastery of the form has kept him behind a talk-show desk for 33 years. Start with four months as the host of daytime's ""The David Letterman Show"" in 1980. Add the 1982-93 run of ""Late Night with David Letterman"" on NBC, followed by the ""Late Show with David Letterman"" run that's 21 years now and counting. By the time Letterman walks out of the Ed Sullivan Theater for the last time, he'll have clocked a third of a century as a late-night TV host and monologist. That's longer than Johnny Carson, who was the former late-night king at 30 years. Longer than Jay Leno, who managed 20 in two different shifts. Longer than anyone at that very rarified, high-pressure job. Like Steve Allen, Jack Paar and Dick Cavett before him, Letterman brought enough to the party to rank him as one of the very best. Even though Leno's ""Tonight Show,"" a direct time-slot rival to Letterman's program on CBS, drew more viewers for most of its run, Letterman produced more memorable programs, more classic bits and -- as when he was the first New York talk-show host to return after, and react to, the terrorist attacks of September 11 -- more instances of truly classic television moments. The speculation tying the timing of Letterman's departure to the introduction of Jimmy Fallon in February as the newest host of ""The Tonight Show"" probably has some validity. It's no secret that Letterman wanted to be Carson's successor and long saw NBC's ""Tonight"" as the crown jewel of late-night TV, which it had been throughout the reigns of Allen, Paar and Carson. After being passed over for Leno, Letterman subsequently saw the NBC job go to Conan O'Brien, to Leno again and then to Fallon. Certainly, by the time Fallon started at ""Tonight,"" Letterman was used to being beaten in the ratings by NBC, and that trend has only intensified. Since the latest late-night talent shifts, Fallon's ""Tonight Show"" has drawn about twice as many viewers as Letterman (5.2 million to Letterman's 2.7, with ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" just behind Letterman at 2.6). In the coveted 18-49 demographic, Letterman comes in third, behind Kimmel as well as Fallon. But the real shift isn't in who's watching but in who's not watching. ""The Tonight Show"" of the Carson era, so revered by Letterman (and by older viewers and TV critics like myself), was must-see TV before that term was invented. Millions of people didn't think of going to bed before hearing Carson's monologue, to get his take on what happened that day. In 2014, though, that's simply not happening. Every term, I ask my college students at Rowan University how many of them watch any of the late-night shows as they're first televised. This includes even Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" and ""The Colbert Report,"" for which they're the ideal target audience. And every term, fewer hands go up. They are waiting for those pieces of the previous night's talk shows spoon-fed to them, either as morning-show highlights or as viral videos on news sites or shared by Facebook friends. Perhaps, had the Internet come along many decades earlier, Carson's Ed Ames tomahawk throw would have gone viral -- but that's the only part viewers would have seen. The nightly monologues, as comedic currency, have been devalued, and the popularity of a show -- and a host -- can be measured as much today by quick hits of brilliant comedy business rather than a solid hour of entertainment. Fallon, of course, is superb at this game; his musical bits alone are guaranteed to feed a steady course of streaming videos. Kimmel is good at it too, and even the host following Letterman on CBS, Craig Ferguson of ""The Late Late Show,"" has attracted many millions of YouTube hits with snippets of his antics. Letterman, like British counterpart Graham Norton on BBC America's ""The Graham Norton Show"" import, sees his show as a one-hour complete entity. That fewer members of his audience are seeing it that way may be the biggest reason he's leaving. If no one is watching TV in real time any more, then what does being a ""late-night"" host even mean?","David Letterman, who's retiring in 2015, has been a talk show host for 33 years .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Masao Yoshida, the man in charge of Japan's stricken nuclear plant in the wake of the catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, has died of cancer in a Tokyo hospital aged 58. Yoshida led the ""Fukushima 50,"" the group of men who risked their lives to contain the fallout from the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which affects the throat, in late 2011 months after the tsunami struck, Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the operator of the nuclear facility, said. The company added it was unlikely his cancer was a result of radiation exposure. They said that the condition usually takes five to 10 years to develop if radiation is to blame. ""Mr. Yoshida united staff and courageously handled the accident,"" said Naomi Hirose, TEPCO's chief executive. Yoshida was at the Fukushima nuclear complex when the tsunami engulfed the cooling system and saw three reactors go into meltdown. In an interview in November 2011, he said he thought several times that he would die. Defying orders from his bosses, Yoshida made the decision to pump seawater into the No. 1 reactor in a move that may have averted a catastrophic nuclear explosion. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Tuesday that Yoshida ""made a great effort in the middle of the accident. I wish his soul will rest in peace."" The authorities' handling of the nuclear disaster was widely criticized, with an independent investigation calling it a ""man-made disaster"" that unfolded as a result of collusion between TEPCO, regulators and the government. The Fukushima plant remains hazardous more than two years after the earthquake and tsunami. On Tuesday, TEPCO reported an increase in radiation levels at the plant after a ground water sample collected from an observation well located close to the ocean was found to be contaminated with a radioactive material. TEPCO said it had started using cement to seal the ground facing the ocean to prevent the contaminated water from reaching the sea. People we've lost in 2013: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie has beaten some of Tinseltown's best-known starlets to reclaim the top spot in Forbes' annual list of highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. Despite her absence from the big screen since starring alongside Johnny Depp in 2010's ""The Tourist"", Forbes estimates Jolie earned a staggering $33 million over the last 12 months. Since taking a break from the big screen, Jolie has turned her efforts to writing, producing and directing her first film ""In the Land of Blood and Honey."" along with the upcoming film ""Unbroken."" In 2011, she voiced the character of Tigress in ""Kung Fu Panda 2,"" a box office hit generating $165.2 million worldwide, according to boxofficemojo.com. Box office glory . Unsurprisingly, thanks to her Academy Award success in ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" Hollywood's latest ""It Girl"" Jennifer Lawrence comes in second with $26 million. This year the 22-year-old will return to the very roles that thrust her into the spotlight as Katniss Everdeen in the second installment of the popular ""Hunger Games"" film adaptations and the ""X-Men"" prequels. The CGI-filled blockbuster franchises continue to be a proven money maker. Kristen Stewart, who earned $22 million with the year ending June 2013, is known to teenagers across the globe as Bella Swan from the highly lucrative ""Twilight Saga."" But with the vampire love story now complete, Stewart has moved on to another female-led franchise and is set to reprise the titular role in ""Snow White and the Huntsman 2"" due for release in 2015. Leading ladies . The ""Snow White"" effect also gave America's original sweetheart Julia Roberts a boost as she earned $10 million after starring in ""Mirror Mirror,"" another adapted version of the classic German tale. Meanwhile, new entry Emma Stone gave comic book inspired films a whirl by starring in the ""Spiderman"" reboot, which mostly accounted for her $16 million earnings over the last 12 months. Other familiar stars to grace the top 10 list again include Jennifer Aniston, Sandra Bullock, Natalie Portman and Charlize Theron who were joined by the latest new addition Mila Kunis who snagged the ninth spot with $11 million thanks to her blockbuster comedy ""Ted"" and hit fantasy prequel ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Hollywood's gender pay gap . While Hollywood's leading ladies may earn an impressive salary at first glance, those figures are still far off from what their male counterparts take home. Forbes recently announced ""Iron Man"" himself, Robert Downey Jr. earned more than double the amount of Jolie as the top-earning actor in Hollywood after raking in a whopping $75 million. Downey was always going to have a good year after starring in Joss Whedon's comic book character compilation ""The Avengers"" -- the third highest-grossing film ever. Since ""Iron Man 3"" opened in May, the film grossed $1.2 billion globally making it one of the biggest box office hits of all-time. Compare the highest-paid actresses of Hollywood to Forbes world's most powerful celebrities list, of which there are six women in the top 10, Jolie moves much further down to number 41.

"(CNN) -- Egypt will hold parliamentary elections in several stages beginning April 27, a member of President Mohamed Morsy's presidential team announced Thursday. Pakinam el-Sharkawy made the announcement on state television. These will be the first elections since Egypt's highest court dissolved the lower house of parliament last June, and it will be the first full parliament in Morsy's presidency. The upper house, the Shura Council, has continued to meet. The election process will take place in four stages: April 27-28, May 15-16 and June 2-3 and 19-20, according to the official decree released by the president's spokesman, Yassir Ali. Runoffs will be held one week after each stage. The House of Representatives, the lower house in Egypt's bicameral system, will hold its first session July 6, the decree said. Previous elections have had three stages, not four. More stages raises the possibility of more politically charged violence, particularly in the province of Port Said. In the past year, violent clashes in the coastal province along the Suez Canal have highlighted the longstanding resentment residents there feel toward Cairo. Both Port Said and Cairo are included in the first round of voting. Several stages of elections also means the Muslim Brotherhood, the group that backs Morsy, has more time to rebuild its waning support.","Elections will be held in four stages .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced that 300 companies -- including Apple, Wal-Mart and others -- have signed a pledge to help the long-term unemployed by making sure they don't have barriers in their hiring practices. This is good news, but it won't solve the problem. The best we can hope for is that the companies now will make special efforts to seek out and employ those who have suffered long-term joblessness. That's a nice start, but feel-good gestures won't cut it when there are almost 4 million Americans who have been out of work for more than six months. That's a big number. What's disconcerting is that the current long-term unemployment is more serious than in previous economic downturns. Data from previous business cycles show people suffering from long-run joblessness at worst accounted for about 20% to 25% of the unemployed. In recent months, that percentage has jumped to nearly 40% -- an all-time record! Indeed, America is beginning to look like Europe. It used to be that long-term unemployment in the U.S. was only a fraction of Europe's, but the latest data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that the United States has caught up to many of Europe's welfare states. That's not a race we want to be part of, much less win. So what's the solution? There's no silver bullet, but economic growth is the single most important key. All forms of unemployment get worse when the economy is weak. But when the economy is booming, the job market gets better for everybody -- including those who have been unemployed for long periods. Unfortunately, economic growth hasn't proven easy. The recession may have ended officially in the summer of 2009, but we're still suffering through a sluggish economic cycle. Recent improvements in the overall employment rate are in large part the result of people dropping out of the labor force, and the problem of long-run unemployment has barely budged. To boost employment, we need the kind of strong growth America enjoyed during the Reagan and Clinton years, when millions of new jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell dramatically. To get there, we need a return to the types of free-market policies we got under Reagan and Clinton: a lower burden of government spending and less intervention from Washington. Unfortunately, we've been moving in the exact opposite direction. Under both Presidents Bush and Obama, the size and scope of government has expanded, and the United States -- which had the world's third-most free-market economy when Bill Clinton left office -- has now dropped to 17th in the Economic Freedom of the World rankings. We also need to make sure the unemployed don't get lured into long-term dependency. One glaring example of misguided big-government policy is the argument to endlessly extend unemployment benefits. That sounds compassionate, but according to economists such policies discourage the unemployed from aggressively seeking new jobs. There is also persuasive evidence that employers are reluctant to hire people (regardless of any ""pledges"" they may sign) who have been out of work for lengthy periods, which makes the President's preferred approach of more unemployment benefits akin to an overprotective parent who hinders a child's development. Moreover, Obama's proposed hike in the minimum wage would actually counteract any good his pledge would do. Why? Increasing the minimum wage is the equivalent of sawing off the bottom rungs on the economic ladder. Simply stated, businesses create jobs when they think a new employee will help the bottom line. Artificially raising the cost of workers -- particularly those with marginal skills -- is a recipe for creating more unemployment. The president's effort to get companies on board with hiring the long-term unemployed should be applauded, but he shouldn't for one second think that it will solve the problem. In fact, too many of his other proposals would serve only to exacerbate the problem the long-term unemployed are facing. Instead, Obama should take a page out of the Reagan and Clinton presidencies and take action to get to the root of unemployment: economic growth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel J. Mitchell.","300 companies pledged to aid Obama initiative to help the long-term unemployed .
Daniel Mitchell: This is a nice gesture, but nearly 4 million Americans need jobs .
He says economic growth is key and free-market polices are what we need .

"(CNN) -- An Indonesian fisherman has been killed by Komodo dragons after he was attacked while trespassing on a remote island in search of fruit, officials said Tuesday. Komodo dragons kill their prey with an extremely toxic bite. Muhamad Anwar, 32, bled to death on his way to hospital after being mauled by the reptiles at Loh Sriaya, in eastern Indonesia's Komodo National Park, the park's general manager Fransiskus Harum told CNN. ""The fisherman was inside the park when he went looking for sugar-apples. The area was forbidden for people to enter as there are a lot of wild dragons,"" Harum said. Other fisherman took Anwar to a clinic on nearby Flores Island, east of Bali, but he was declared dead on arrival, he added. Komodo dragons, the world's heaviest lizards, can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length and have a toxic bite that they use to kill prey such as buffalo, returning to feast when the animal succumbs to the poison. Despite their ungainly appearance, the carnivorous reptiles can run as fast as a dog in short bursts, jump up on their hind legs, and kill animals with a blow of their powerful tails. Attacks on humans are rare, but Monday's incident is the latest in a series in which the monster lizards -- which have forked tongues and fearsome claws --have killed or injured people. Last month a park ranger survived after a Komodo dragon climbed the ladder into his hut and savaged his hand and foot. In 2007 an eight-year-old boy died after being mauled. In June last year, a group of divers who were stranded on an island in the national park -- the dragons' only natural habitat -- had to fend off several attacks from the reptiles before they were rescued. Park rangers also tell the cautionary tale of a Swiss tourist who vanished leaving nothing but a pair of spectacles and a camera after an encounter with the dragons several years ago. An endangered species, Komodo are believed to number less than 4,000 in the wild. Access to their habitat is restricted, but tourists can get permits to see them in the wild within the National Park. All visitors are accompanied by rangers, about 70 of whom are deployed across the park's 60,000 hectares of vegetation and 120,000 hectares of ocean. Despite a threat of poachers, Komodo dragon numbers are believed to have stabilized in recent years, bolstered by successful breeding campaigns in captivity. On Monday, a zoo in Surabaya on the Indonesian island of Java reported the arrival of 32 newborn Komodos after the babies all hatched in the past two weeks, the Jakarta Post reported.","Fisherman was trespassing on island when dragons attacked .

"(CNN) -- When I think of Gloria Steinem approaching 80, I think about the women of my generation, growing up at the end of the Baby Boom. We internalized a lot of stereotypes of what it meant to be a woman in those days. Until Gloria changed the rules. My earliest memories of gender inequity involve ""I Love Lucy."" I was 7 years old when I asked my mother, ""Why does Ricky act like Lucy's boss?"" My mother laughed and said it was ""just a joke."" I didn't get it. The unspoken rules were evident in grade school, when teachers signaled their high expectations for boys but not girls. And when I looked at the larger world, I found that men were the leaders of countries, companies, churches, schools -- although the teachers were mostly women. I felt different, really different, but mostly I kept quiet about it until I was 17. In the summer of 1972 I bought the first issue of Ms. magazine, a vivid image of Wonder Woman bursting from its cover. Steinem, a founding editor, examined the myth that ""Women Voters Can't Be Trusted."" Letty Cottin Pogrebin wrote about the insidious ways that women compete with other women. A piece titled ""Populist Mechanics"" helped women demystify the workings of their car, complete with a detailed diagram of an auto engine. An etiquette column headlined ""Manners for Humans"" counseled, ""Anyone can hold doors for anyone else. It is only decent to see that it doesn't slam behind you."" I used my babysitting money to subscribe. I was hooked. Gloria's words rang in my head when I challenged the status quo for girls in high school. A faculty advisor for the National Honor Society announced that the boys could run for president and treasurer and the girls for vice-president and secretary. Like Gloria, I came from a working-class family where you didn't question authority. My heart pounded as I argued for gender equality. I found my voice through Gloria's. Opinion: Feminism is no longer a dirty word . By the time I was in college, I was taking courses on sex roles and dressing like Gloria for Halloween: I streaked my straight blonde hair and topped off my outfit with aviator glasses. After college, life got more real. And so did the pressures to conform. ""Gender roles are policed,"" Gloria taught us. I went on to study psychology and learned the academic term for this policing: ""coercion to the bio-social mean."" Stray from the behavioral norms of your social group, and people -- men and women alike -- will conspire to push you back to the middle. In the workplace, such policing is clear when it involves discrimination. Other times it is subtle, but it can be just as effective. Be good, but not too good; be strong, but not too strong; be competent, but not too competent. Cross those subtle lines and you'll be branded with the ""B"" word: ""bossy."" A recent article in the European Business Review put it this way: ""Women must live up to collective expectations of what makes a leader, while at the same time remaining true to gender expectations."" A year ago I led an executive education workshop for school principals aspiring to become superintendents. I asked how many of them had been accused of being bossy. Nearly every woman raised her hand. I talked about society's gendered perceptions of leadership. Some participants welled with tears as they began to understand that sexism often masquerades as a hurtful personality attack. 5 reasons why we love Gloria Steinem . In a 1995 speech to graduating seniors at her alma mater, Smith College, Steinem analyzed this phenomenon with her typical anthropological incisiveness: ""Some of us women have been successfully socialized to feel that women can't be leaders, and vice versa."" When we have children, people double down on the pressure for women to conform. Often this comes in the form of never-ending questions about balancing work and family. Wouldn't you rather be at home with your baby? Don't you worry about the effects of child care? Why are you working so hard? Once again, Gloria had the answer. In 1984, she observed, ""I have yet to hear a man ask for advice on how to combine marriage and a career."" Women pressure other women about work and family, a phenomenon that has continued well past the ""mommy wars"" of the 1980s. I am still troubled by Anne-Marie Slaughter's 2012 Atlantic Monthly essay, ""Why Women Still Can't Have It All."" In the most widely cited Atlantic piece of all time, Slaughter wrote about the challenges of balancing a demanding career and raising children. If Gloria had been her editor, we might have seen a different headline: ""Why Parents Still Can't Have It All ... and How to Raise Everyone's Consciousness About It."" One of my favorite expressions of Gloria's is, ""The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off."" The truth is that we need to continue the work of identifying how gender biases operate in our everyday lives. We are not living in a post-gendered world or a post-feminist world. Leaders of countries, companies, churches and schools are still mostly men. ""A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men,"" Gloria taught us. The work of feminism goes on because Gloria's voice continues to resonate across the world. The woman whose words changed the trajectory of my life at 17 continues to speak to me and millions more. ""Whatever the question,"" Gloria said recently, ""women are part of the answer."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen McCartney.","Kathleen McCartney: Gloria Steinem changed rules on what it mean to be a woman .

"(CNN) -- A 35-year-old cold case in Texas came to an end this week when the skeletal remains of a body found in a drought-affected lake were determined to be that of a woman who went missing in 1979. A forensic anthropologist used dental records to determine the remains found last week in a pickup in Lake Granbury were those of Helen Holladay, the Hood County Sheriff's Office said in a news release. The vehicle identification number on the truck matched that of Holladay's vehicle. CNN affiliate WFAA reported the truck was just feet from the shoreline. Holladay was 45 when she went missing. WFAA said she disappeared after a fight with her husband, who is now dead. No one was charged in the case. Lt. Johnny Rose of the Sheriff's Office told CNN on Monday that authorities searched the lake for about one month in 1996. On Thursday, a Granbury city employee saw part of the truck sticking out of the water and called authorities. Hood County is just southwest of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area.

"(CNN) -- When high schoolers tour the world's largest nuclear research facility from their desks, or teachers have a chance to see the classroom through students' eyes, that's the power of Google Glass. But even as Google's much buzzed-about wearable computer makes its way into the hands of technophiles, law enforcement and firefighters, it might be a while before it comes to a school near you. Slowly, Google Glass is starting to turn up in schools. A handful of educators are beta testers in Google's Glass Explorer Program. They're capturing videos and images of classroom activities through a small camera built into Glass' frame, and sharing them online. They use Glass to teach lessons from their perspective to share with others, or for their own reference. They're propping the glasses on students, and using the footage and images from young people to understand what they see and how they learn. Even with limited applications and functionality in these early versions of Google Glass, some teachers and technology enthusiasts see huge potential. ""The possibilities are endless as more applications are developed for the device and as Glass gets into the hands of more teachers and students,"" said Kathy Schrock, a former librarian and technology consultant who serves on the board of International Society for Technology in Education. ""Having a single pair of Google Glass in the classroom reminds me of the days of the one-computer classroom. Everyone had to wait for a turn to use the device,"" Schrock, a Google Certified Teacher, said in an e-mail. ""I think once we see a K-12 school pilot with a classroom set of Glass, there will be many more practical and creative uses showcased."" The virtual field trip is often touted as a use for Glass, and there are apps in development expected to display information about locations the Glass wearer sees. Google sent online educator Andrew Vanden Heuvel to Switzerland in 2013 so he could lead students on a virtual tour of the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research known as CERN. Through a Google+ hangout, students from South Christian High School in Michigan watched Vanden Heuvel walk through the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, taking their questions and pointing out features. Even more common, educators broadcast from inside the classroom, leading science labs, group discussions or even performing surgery for remote audiences. They show it in real time through Google+ hangouts and as videos shared later through YouTube, personal blogs and other forms of social media. After his field trip, Vanden Heuvel continued using Glass by making a series of instructional science and math videos called STEMBites. When a New Jersey high school student had to miss school for medical reasons, chemistry teacher Marc Seigel asked the student's friend to wear Glass during science labs and broadcast them to her in a Google+ hangout. An online group for Glass Explorers in Education lets users share similar stories and pose questions to the group of 612 members. But Google Glass in every classroom could be a long way off. There's a long list of reasons why the most intriguing device in tech just isn't ready for school: Glass is expected to be more widely available toward the end of 2014, but the $1,500 price tag is a significant barrier for schools and teachers. So far, there's no educational discount, teachers said, and Google hasn't announced plans to partner with educational institutions. Its short battery life needs to be resolved before broader implementation is possible, teachers said, and Glass is mired in privacy concerns, especially when children are involved. ""To me, the greatest value of Glass so far isn't what it's able to do, but the conversation being had nationally about how we interact with technology and how we want it to be part of society,"" said Vanden Heuvel, who teaches online math and science classes. Vanden Heuvel views Glass as another tool in his arsenal, but it's ""not necessarily the best for every situation,"" he said. ""I think the $1,500 would be better spent on three Chromebooks,"" he said. Still, early adopters in education are looking for ways to make it work. Margaret Powers, lower school technology coordinator at the Episcopal Academy in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, has been documenting her experiences using Glass in class on on her blog, 365 Days of Glass. She saw potential in Glass as a tool to capture moments of discovery and learning through her students' eyes, in line with the Reggio Emilia philosophy she embraces as an educator. Since April 2013, she's used Glass to document the day's activities and post video highlights online. Glass gives her the benefit of doing it hands-free, so she can maintain eye contact and interact with students while gathering information, she said. Periodically, she puts together video clips around specific topics, like teaching students about coding, as presentations for parents. She lets students use the device to document their experience making Native crafts or playing in the snow to share with partner classrooms around the country. Among its greatest benefits so far? Powers said she can finally see the classroom through the eyes of her students, who range from pre-K to second grade. It shows which details catch their attention, and sometimes reveals simple problems, like when Powers realized she was posting some information too high for her young students to see. ""It has been really interesting to try it because their perspective is so unique and different from ours, which is why I think (Glass) has a lot of potential with these age ranges,"" she said. ""To get just a few moments to see how they learn to do a math problem, or to get a sense of their vantage point is so great for teachers.""

"(CNN) -- For the first time in months, the ever-worsening Ukraine crisis seemed to have taken a surprising turn for the better. A snap meeting in Geneva brought together the foreign ministers of Ukraine, the European Union and the United States with their Russian counterpart, despite earlier threats by the Kremlin not to participate. Even more unexpectedly for the many observers who had placed little hope in the talks, a one-page agreement emerged that outlines steps to de-escalate the situation and to prevent it from turning into open war. However, neither the very contents of the accord nor the obvious skepticism among its signatories suggest that it will effectively ease the internal and international tensions around Ukraine. Instead, this declaration is set to be an important tactical victory for Russia, the key driver of the conflict. At first glance, the Geneva agreement appears to contain the pre-requisites for a peaceful political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. All sides are called upon to refrain from violence, provocation and extremism. Armed groups are to lay down their weapons, and occupied public spaces and buildings are to be vacated. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is to monitor agreed de-escalation measures centrally. A constitutional process is to begin and include broad national dialogue across all Ukrainian regions and constituencies. And in parallel to these political steps, economic and financial support is to be discussed by the international community. Promising, one might think, if it was not for the fine print. The ink under the accord had barely dried when the signatory parties offered widely differing interpretations of its contents. Where Ukraine and the West directed their demands at Russian-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine, Russia was quick to point out that pro-European protesters were to surrender, too, including the EuroMaidan. If Kiev, Brussels and Washington envisage constitutional changes strengthening de-centralization, regional and local self-government, and minority languages, Moscow renewed its call for a federalization of Ukraine, including the right of regions to their own foreign and economic policies. The financial stabilization of Ukraine, although unspecified, was clearly included to pre-empt the country's political implosion, while Russia insisted that aid be conditional on the implementation of the de-escalation plan, and on the fulfillment of its own demands. In short, the Geneva talks have not delivered consensus, but have served, first and foremost, as a platform for Russia to reiterate its own positions. No less revealing is the fact that several key aspects of the Ukraine crisis are absent from the declaration. The Russian annexation of Crimea went unmentioned, and while merely intended by Ukraine and the West to facilitate talks, the Kremlin was quick to read this silence as an effective acknowledgement of its rule over the peninsula. Presidential elections in Ukraine, scheduled for 25 May 2014, were not included as a crucial element of any political solution to the crisis, thus opening an avenue for Moscow to question their legitimacy. The massive concentration of Russian troops across Ukraine's eastern borders was not addressed, which perpetuates Moscow's military intimidation of Kiev and the threat of war. Finally, the Geneva talks failed to produce a clear timeline for the de-escalation, fundamental for Western governments to determine their own actions, including sanctions. In all these respects, the Geneva agreement has expanded Russia's room for maneuver in Ukraine rather than limiting it. Most of all, the accord affords Russia with much-needed time. Given its failure so far to elicit strong support and momentum for separatist ambitions in Eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin has won breathing space and can now ratchet up its efforts. Faced with serious political isolation on the international stage, Moscow will likely reach out to potential, if reluctant allies, whether they be Belarus and Kazakhstan in the run-up to signature of the treaty founding the Eurasian Union, or China ahead of a visit by Putin, both scheduled for May. In turn, the threat of further Western economic sanctions has been averted, at least for the time being. With the door to negotiations seemingly remaining open, the EU will find it particularly difficult to muster political will for leveraging considerable economic pressure on Russia. Geneva has thus handed Moscow a desperately needed reprieve on a plate. This week's four-party meeting is nothing short of a diplomatic coup for Russia. While his foreign minister was in Geneva, the Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual ""Direct Line"" to clarify his designs for Ukraine. For Putin, the East and South of Ukraine are clearly Novorossiya, or New Russia, the Tsarist term for these territories. With this narrative, Russia lays the same claim to vast parts of mainland Ukraine as it did to Crimea. And Moscow may just have made a giant leap towards expansion.","The declaration is set to be an important tactical victory for Russia, writes Forbrig .

"(CNN) -- Monday I did an interview in the Election Center with Sen. John McCain's campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds. The interview was about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's experience and readiness to be commander in chief. The interview became a bit of a lightning rod. CNN's Campbell Brown interviews McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds. Over the last few days, I have received thousands of e-mails. For those who didn't see the interview, you can read it or view it below. McCain's campaign got upset about that interview. McCain officials told CNN I had crossed a line and they canceled a scheduled appearance by McCain on ""Larry King Live."" I don't think the interview was over the line. Neither does CNN. And neither do most of you who e-mailed me this week. Thank you, all of you who e-mailed me, including those who disagree. We're always interested in getting past talking points and exploring the issues in any political interview. You have a right to know the people you are voting for. Our pledge to you on this program is to ask the tough but fair questions and to try to get answers. REAL answers. Here is a transcript of the interview:  Watch Brown interview Bounds » . BROWN: We have Tucker Bounds joining us who is a spokesman for the McCain campaign. We want to have an opportunity to talk to him a little bit about this. And, Tucker, you there? BOUNDS: Yeah, Campbell. Can you hear me? BROWN: Good. Yeah. We got you in the chair. I'm glad you're with us. Thanks so much for taking time and joining us tonight. I want to begin by asking, you know, what we've been discussing before you sat in the chair, Gov. Palin sharing a difficult personal story today, the news her unmarried teenage daughter is pregnant. She plans to have the baby, to marry the father. Explain to us when John McCain first learned about this. BOUNDS: He learned about it during the vetting process before his selection. He did not consider it a disqualifier. Gov. Palin has a long record of reforming Alaska, taking on the establishment for 13 years. She started out as a civic activist in the PTA, went to the city counsel, on to the mayor of her small town, took on big oil in the oil and gas commission in Alaska then to the governor's office where she's made serious bipartisan reforms. That's the reason she was selected. Certainly her personal family matters never disqualified her from serving public office, serving a higher office in a cause greater than herself. That's John McCain's message. She fits it perfectly and we're happy to have her. BROWN: Tucker, though, this obviously putting this young woman, Bristol Palin, smack in the media spotlight at what's already got to be a very challenging time in her life, I mean, how do you respond to people who wonder why her mother would have subjected her to this kind of scrutiny by accepting this high-profile position? BOUNDS: I think Gov. Palin understands that these are serious times. We have serious challenges and it's time to shake up Washington. It was the reason she was happy to take John McCain's invitation to go to Washington, make the changes that Americans needs and Americans depend on. She's an expert on energy. She understands we need an all of the above energy approach that includes the alternatives and the renewable fuels. This is an important decision. I think it's dangerous to confuse her civic decision to get involved and make a difference in the country with a family matter -- . BROWN: I understand that. I recognize that. In an ideal world, it would be private. You know, this is a presidential campaign. Nothing is private. The world is watching. And if we, you know, as much as everyone might want to give this young woman her privacy, you know that's not going to happen. And so you do risk putting her through an incredibly difficult process by accepting this job if you're her mother. You can't deny that, right? BOUNDS: The Palin family made clear in their statement that they were hoping and continue to hope that this will be a private family matter. That was their intention from the very beginning. Media inquiries and attention are going to happen in the campaign. They understand that. It's important for us as we have a conversation with voters of how we can change Washington, how we can move forward and take on the big challenges that Americans expect of their public officials that we keep a private matter private among their family. Certainly all of us, certainly the members of the media would expect that from Americans. That's the way we're proceeding. BROWN: Tucker, foreign policy experience has been a huge issue in this campaign because you guys made it a big issue, pointing out John McCain has far more experience than Barack Obama and nothing in your view is more important than the campaign. I don't have to tell you there's a feeling out there by some that you're not holding your VP pick to your own standard, the standard you define. So explain to us why you think Gov. Palin is ready to be commander in chief. BOUNDS: Gov. Palin has the good fortune of being on ticket with John McCain who there is no question is the most experienced and shown proven judgment on the international stage. He understands foreign affairs. BROWN: We know all that about John McCain, Tucker. I asked you about her. We all know the role of the VP as John McCain defined it is to be able to step into the job of the presidency on day one. I'm asking you about her foreign policy experience. BOUNDS: Yeah, Campbell, there are a number of people supporting Barack Obama's candidacy and feel he's experienced enough to take on the Oval Office. Our feeling is -- . BROWN: You're not answering my question -- . BOUNDS: Just as much experience as Barack Obama. BROWN: OK. So does she -- you -- what I'm saying is that you set a different standard by arguing how important it was with John McCain. No one's arguing with you he has much more experience than Barack Obama, so I'm trying to get someone from the campaign to explain to me what foreign policy experience or qualifications she has that would allow her to be ready to be commander in chief if something should happen to Sen. McCain. BOUNDS: Well, Campbell, let me be clear. I don't think there should be problem explaining her experience. She has executive state level experience. She's been in public office reforming Washington. She's been in executive office longer and in a more effective sense than Barack Obama's been in the United States Senate. She's been the commander of the National Guard of the Alaska National Guard that's been deployed overseas. That's foreign policy experience. BROWN: If I can interrupt for one second because I've heard you guys say this a lot. Can you tell me one decision that she made as commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard, just one? BOUNDS: Yeah. She's made -- any decision she has made as the commander of the National Guard that's deployed overseas is more of a decision Barack Obama's been making as he's been running for the president for the last two years. BROWN: So tell me. Tell me. Give me an example of one of those decisions. I'm curious, just one decision she made in her capacity as commander in chief of the National Guard. BOUNDS: Campbell, certainly you don't mean to belittle, every experience, every judgment she makes as commander -- . BROWN: I'm belittling nothing. I want to know one judgment or one decision. I want to know what one decision was. I'm not belittling anything, I am curious. BOUNDS: As she makes a decision how to equip or how to command the national guard in Alaska, that is more -- . BROWN: But Tucker, those are the Pentagon's decision, that's Gen. Petraeus, that's the White House. BOUNDS: Pardon me? BROWN: No governor makes decisions how to equip or deploy the National Guard. When they go to Iraq, those are decisions made by the Pentagon. BOUNDS: Campbell, on factual basis, they certainly do. In Alaska, if I have an emergency in your state, the National Guard is under the command of the governor. That is more of a command role than Barack Obama has ever had. I would argue John McCain and Gov. Palin between the two of them have far more command experience in military than either of the candidates on the Democratic side. I do want to argue this is about the top of the ticket. Ultimately when people go into the ballot box and decide between Barack Obama and John McCain, they will decide between John McCain's record of reforming Washington and Barack Obama's rhetoric on the campaign trail, doesn't have a lot of experience, certainly has no command or military experience, which both our candidates have. That's an important distinction I think voters will make the right call in November. BROWN: All right. Tucker, I'm just going to give it to you, baby. We'll end it there. BOUNDS: Appreciate it. BROWN: I appreciate you coming on and taking the time to have this debate. I think it's important. People don't know a lot about her. They want to understand her qualifications as much as possible. We're not beating you up here. We're not trying to. We're just trying to educate ourselves and educate our viewers. So I really do appreciate your time and thank you for your time coming on.","Brown asks McCain spokesman about Sarah Palin's experience .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. (CareerBuilder.com) -- Finding a career that allows you to travel is not always an easy task, but if you're a college grad looking to make an adventure of your gap year, a professional looking for a change of pace or anyone looking for cultural exposure, a job abroad may be the right choice for you. A tourist gets a traditional massage in Thailand. Not all jobs are translatable to international positions without a little extra learning or language proficiency -- and you will need to acquire working permits and other legal documentation -- but here are some jobs that can take you away if you're up for the move: . 1. Teacher  It's not news that teachers aren't highly paid, but if you're an instructor in South Dakota, you're among the lowest-paid in the nation, with an average salary of $33,236, according to a 2003-04 survey by the American Federation of Teachers. Try taking your skills abroad. Learning English is in high demand internationally, and Germany, Switzerland and South Korea are among the countries that pay the largest teacher salaries. South Korea's median teacher salaries range between $25,000 and $60,000, and the country has a positive reputation for providing high income to educators. Salaries in Switzerland range from $65,000 to $80,000. An added perk to employment in Germany is that state employees are regarded as permanent workers, meaning that they are paid necessary social insurances. Requirements: A four-year degree in education or a related field, teaching experience and a TESL/TEFL certificate. You will also need an international work visa and work permits, which can be obtained personally or through the school that employs you. 2. Chef If you are an established chef, international hotels and restaurants may offer the opportunity to build on your career overseas while, in many cases, offering you room and board for a minimum costs. In the United States, the median annual income of a head chef/chef is $40,000, and $43,000 if you work as a chef for a hotel. Kingsbrook USA Inc. is one company that works to place chefs in international regions. They reported England's hotel chef positions as offering £14000, or roughly $26,730 U.S. dollars per year for Chef deParties. Kingsbrook also reported between $32,458 and $38,186 per year for Sous Chefs and between $38,186 and $47,732 per year for Head Chef. Requirements: An associate degree and at least three years of culinary experience. Letters of Reference, transcripts and health records and exams will also be required. 3. Massage therapist Massage therapists in the United States make a median annual salary of $30,000. But take your expertise to the seas, and you could earn between $33,600 and $45,600, according to Cruise Job Line. In addition to changing stationary surroundings, working on cruise lines offers the opportunity to see new people and network beyond the limitations that can be created in a spa environment. The living accommodations may be small, but they save money on housing costs, and cruise lines usually offer full health coverage onboard the ship and within United States territory. Requirements: You'll need a high school diploma or associate degree, and a certification in massage therapy. Requirements for accreditation vary by state. U.S. citizens pursuing massage therapy for cruise lines also need a passport that is valid for at least three months after the end of the contract. A physical examination, and in some cases, immunization may be required. 4. Au Pair/Nanny In exchange for caring for your boss' children and caring out light housekeeping or cooking duties, au pair positions offer a chance to travel abroad with room and board and a living stipend. The job will enable access that tourists are not privy to, but the work shouldn't be taken lightly. The median annual income for company-employed nannies is $29,500 in the United States. An au pair in France can expect to earn between 240 and 250 euro, or an estimated $309 to $322 per month for a 33-hour week. The pay varies internationally, but the overall perk is the opportunity to afford to see another part of the world. Requirements: A passport, work visa and an international driver's license. You will also need to acquire medical insurance and undergo health screenings. Agency placement is a better choice for acquiring an au pair position for both safety reasons and to aid with acquiring your work permit. While au pair experience is not necessary, most au pairs have held related positions. 5. Caterer Catering managers make an average median salary of $35,590 in the United States, and while other countries offer this position, the commute from national to international can literally be a matter of taste. Caterers who create a name for themselves in the U.S. industry can earn a trusted reputation and follow clients to overseas events. Rock stars and celebrities may have a variety of different catering companies working for them throughout the United States, but larger acts and A-listers like to have a trusted source to make sure their diet is in line with their requests. Working for one of these companies may put you on tour with the band, and if national gigs go well, you could find yourself overseas for the next tour. Requirements: Chefs and management have culinary training, but staff servers may have little or no experience. To garner a spot on a worldwide tour, a caterer will generally have a lot of experience.

"(CNN) -- The show must go on. Four days after an accident sent nine performers to the hospital, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus carried on with its ""Greatest Show on Earth"" in Hartford, Connecticut. Sparkling in the spotlight, Ring Master Jonathan Lee Iverson greeted the Thursday night crowd with his usual flourish and flair, but also assured them that the injured were on the mend. ""Our young ladies are recovering and they're in great spirits,"" Jonathan Lee Iverson said. ""They want us to let you know, and I quote, 'They feel your prayers, they feel your thoughts, they feel your concerns, they are so grateful to you.'"" The show's producer expressed her gratitude for the outpouring of love. ""The amount of outreach and support, and thoughts and prayers that have come in, not only from the local cities here in the United States but all over the world, has just been tremendous,"" Nicole Feld told reporters ahead of the performance. The horrific incident occurred Sunday, during a show in Providence, Rhode Island. Eight performers plummeted to the ground when an apparatus holding them by their hair about 30 feet in the air failed. Another performer was injured on the ground. A first responder shared chilling details of what he saw when he arrived. ""One of the girls looked up at me and very calmly but sadly said, I can't feel my legs,"" Sgt. Sean Carroll of the Providence, Rhode Island, Police Department told reporters this week. The accident was caused by a 5-inch D-ring that snapped, according to the lead investigator for the city's fire department. Steve Payne, circus spokesman, said that an investigation is ongoing and that all the carabiners linked to the incident were replaced as a precaution. Thursday's show did not include the hair-hanging display, also known as the human chandelier.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal may be most at home on a clay tennis court, but he has always found comfort on the sea. The ""King of Clay"" has racked up countless titles on his favored surface, but hailing from the island of Majorca, the Balearic Sea has also been the scene for much personal enjoyment. There was no better way, then, for Nadal to gear up for this week's ATP Monte-Carlo Masters than to sail around Monaco's harbor while being treated to spectacular views of the Cote d'Azur coastline. The world No. 1 -- who is looking to reclaim his title in the Principality after Novak Djokovic ended his eight-year reign in 2013 -- jumped on board the Tuiga, manning the rudder and learning the ropes of how to sail the Yacht Club de Monaco's flagship. ""It was a wonderful way to enjoy an afternoon,"" Nadal told the ATP World Tour's official website. ""It was a special experience for me. I am from an island, so the sea, the sails and everything involved means a lot to me."" Nadal, who will also be looking to avenge last month's Miami Masters final defeat to Djokovic, still lives in the Majorcan town of Manacor where he was born. But while the 27-year-old is more likely to be found on a motor boat than a sailing ship in the waters outside his house, his experience in Monte Carlo has left a lasting impression on him. ""I spend a lot of time on the sea when I'm at home, especially in the summer. I live in front of the sea and the port is three minutes from my home,"" he said. ""I don't go sailing very often. I go more often on a motor boat. I don't have much time at the moment for sailing, maybe in the future. ""The way that the crew are working together to make the boat perfect and go faster is amazing. Everybody works for one goal. It's a special thing."" Nadal is due to open his bid for a ninth Monte-Carlo Masters title Wednesday and he will be hoping to add to this season's previous wins at the Qatar Open and Rio Open. Djokovic, meanwhile, started the defense of his crown Tuesday with a straight-sets win over Spanish qualifier Albert Montanes, winning 6-1 6-0 in the second-round match after receiving an opening bye. The world No. 2 comes into the tournament on a 10-match winning streak, having won back-to-back Masters titles at the U.S. hard-court events in Indian Wells and Miami. He is aiming to become only the fifth player to successfully defend his title in Monte-Carlo, following Bjorn Borg, Thomas Muster, Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nadal. French ninth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga also won his second-round match, beating Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-4 1-6 6-4. Tsonga's compatriot Gilles Simon crashed out, losing his first-round tie 4-6 6-4 6-4 to Russian qualifier Teimuraz Gabashvili. Another Frenchman to taste defeat on Tuesday was Jeremy Chardy. The world No. 48 was comfortably beaten 6-3 6-0 by sixth seed David Ferrer. Tomas Berdych is another seed safely through after the no. 5 battled from a break down in both sets to defeat Russia's Dmitry Tursunov 7-5 6-4 in one hour and 40 minutes. The Czech has reached at least the semifinals in four of his six tournaments in 2014.","Rafael Nadal helps sail the Tuiga around the Monte-Carlo harbor .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Mickey Rooney's wife has agreed to drop a legal claim over her husband's remains, according to Rooney conservator Michael Augustine. Rooney will be buried at Hollywood Forever cemetery following a private family service, Augustine said, instead of another cemetery plot he bought years ago before splitting with his wife. Hollywood Forever is the final resting place of Rudolph Valentino, Cecil B. DeMille and a long list of show biz A-listers. A date for the funeral will be decided next week, Augustine said. Augustine said he'll approach studio leaders about holding another memorial service the public can attend. The agreement between Jan Rooney and Augustine, reached just before a court hearing on the dispute Friday, also bans Rooney's estranged stepson Chris Aber from attending the service. Rooney died Sunday of natural causes at age 93. While Rooney disinherited his children, his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death, court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over. His personal property is valued at just $18,000 despite an unmatched 90-year film career. Augustine had said in a court filing that he believed Rooney's estranged wife, Jan Rooney, and her son, Christopher Aber, would attempt to remove Rooney's body from Forest Lawn Memorial Park's mortuary. A Los Angeles judge signed a handwritten order Tuesday preventing anyone from removing Rooney's remains until Friday's hearing. Augustine, who is named as estate executor in the will, asked for that authority. Jan Rooney signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband's estate after the couple separated in June 2012 after 34 years of marriage, according to a court filing. She will benefit from Rooney's Social Security and other pensions totaling $8,400 a month, Augustine said. Rooney: A spokesman against elder abuse . The will signed by Rooney on March 11, 2014, left the entire estate to stepson Mark Rooney, one of Jan Rooney's sons, who was the actor's caretaker the last two years of his life. Rooney had no negative feelings toward his surviving children, but they were all financially better off than he was, Augustine said. He believed what little he had to leave should go to Mark Rooney and his wife, because they had been taking good care of him in the final two years, Augustine said. Augustine acknowledged hearing ""grumbling"" from Rooney's family members about being left out of the estate but said none of the others ""ever changed one of Mickey's Depends (adult undergarments)."" A probate hearing is scheduled for May 12 to start the process of probating the actor's will.","Rooney will be buried at Hollywood Forever, resting place of many stars .

"(EW.com) -- Stomachs weren't the only thing full over Thanksgiving weekend — so were movie theaters showing The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. The film pulled in a terrific $110.1 million over the Wednesday-to-Sunday period — $74.5 million of that during the traditional weekend frame — which gives the sequel a stunning $296.5 million domestic total after only 10 days. (The film has already pulled in a total of $573 million worldwide.) Catching Fire set a new record for both the 3-day and 5-day Thanksgiving weekend, surpassing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which grossed $57.5 million/$82.4 million in 2001. Lionsgate's $130 million sequel is now on track to easily outgross The Hunger Games' $408 million domestic total. And if it maintains this pace, it could climb above $450 million. Amazingly, Disney's animated musical Frozen also broke Harry Potter's records during its opening weekend, though it wasn't quite as gigantic as Catching Fire. Frozen grossed $93 million over five days and $66.7 million from Friday to Sunday. That number easily trumped Disney's last animated princess film, Tangled, which grossed $68.1 million over its five-day Thanksgiving debut. Frozen scored with audiences, earning an ""A+"" CinemaScore, which will help it earn back its $150 million budget (and much, much more) in no time. It's not common that two films ever play as well simultaneously as Frozen and Catching Fire did this weekend. Who said women aren't box office draws? Thor: The Dark World held onto third place with $15.5 million over the extended frame and $11.1 million for the weekend. Marvel's $170 million superhero film has now earned $186.7 million, putting it just ahead of the original Thor's $181 million domestic cume. Worldwide, The Dark World has already hammered up $591 million. In fourth, The Best Man Holiday grossed another $11.1 million over five days ($8.5 million for the traditional weekend frame). Universal's $17 million comedy has now earned $63.4 million total, and unsurprisingly, another sequel is already in the works. Jason Statham's latest vehicle Homefront nabbed the fifth place slot with a $9.8 million five-day start. The film pulled in just $7 million over the typical weekend, and it joins Statham's long list of middling box office performers. Still, Homefront, distributed by open Road Films, only cost $22 million to produce and it fared much better than fellow newcomer Black Nativity, which finished outside the Top 5 with just $5 million since Wednesday. The $17.5 million film stars Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, and Jennifer Hudson, but audiences weren't inspired to check it out. Weekend Box Office for Nov. 27-Dec. 1 . 1.

Two other new new arrivals in the Top 10 fell more on the side of Homefront and Black Nativity than Frozen or Catching Fire. Fox's The Book Thief grossed a middling $6.4 million in five days after expanding into 1,234 theaters. Meanwhile, The Weinstein Co.'s Philomena found just $4.6 million in the same period of time from 835 theaters . Of course, no film fared as badly as Spike Lee's remake Oldboy, which grossed just $1.3 million from 583 theaters between Wednesday until Sunday ($850,000 between Friday and Sunday).

"(CNN) -- At least 22 people have drowned and 10 more are missing after two boats carrying migrants capsized off the Greek island of Samos, a coast guard official said Monday. Thirty-six survivors have been rescued from the Aegean Sea, and the search is continuing, Katherine Tenta of the Greek coast guard told CNN by phone. The two vessels foundered about 4 nautical miles off Samos, Tenta said, adding that authorities did not yet know their nationalities. Thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East pack into often unsafe boats to get into the European Union through Greece, Italy, Malta and other coastal states. The numbers have increased since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings triggered unrest across North Africa and civil war in Syria. ""A 3-year-old child, in a bad condition, has been transferred to a hospital in Athens,"" Tenta said. Two search and rescue helicopters -- with help from two coast guard vessels, a navy warship and a cruise liner -- were searching for the missing. Tenta said the coast guard towed the vessels -- a 10-meter long boat and a smaller vessel -- to Samos. She said 18 bodies were on one: 10 women, five men and three children. It is not yet clear what caused the boats to capsize, she said. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","At least 22 people drown, 10 others are missing off the Greek island of Samos .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk dug in Friday despite an international deal aimed at being a key first step in resolving a crisis that has threatened to devolve into civil war. The separatists' self-declared leader, Denis Pushilin, said it is those aligned with the Kiev-based national government who should vacate all public buildings, not the militants in Donetsk. Pushilin, the head of a group called the Donetsk People's Republic, addressed reporters on the heels of an agreement Thursday between officials from Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and Russia. Among other things, that deal calls for amnesty for anti-Kiev factions provided they give up their weapons and leave government buildings. But separatists in eastern Ukraine have not signed on nor indicated they intend to, unless the pro-Western government in Kiev steps down. ""Lavrov did not sign anything for us, he signed on behalf of the Russian Federation,"" Pushilin said Friday, referring to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Instead of any such agreement, Pushilin has pushed for a referendum by May 11 to ask residents whether they want sovereignty from Ukraine. This step may be popular with those who view Ukraine's interim authorities -- who took power in February after the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, who some saw as too closely aligned with Russia -- as illegitimate. Ukraine President Olexander Turchynov on Friday criticized the ""factions of communists (who have) refused to sign or even vote on the document"" agreed to in Geneva, Switzerland. He and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk urged them to do so, saying in a joint statement, ""We have to do everything possible not to take this treasure of (Ukrainian unity) from our children."" ""We are calling on our compatriots to (reach out) to each other and give up actions aimed at hatred, and come back to (work toward) rebuilding a united Ukraine,"" the two leaders said. In addition to groups disarming and returning seized buildings to their legitimate owners, Yatsenyuk and Turchynov spoke of plans to change the constitution, provide ""more powers"" and ""necessary financial resources"" to the regions and allow for Russian and other languages in addition to Ukrainian. ""We are all different, but we all have one thing in common: We are all citizens of a sovereign and independent Ukraine,"" the leaders said. But the key to the Geneva agreement is whether Russia can and does use its influence to persuade protesters to comply. Acting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia told reporters Friday in Kiev that Russia still must prove its intentions in Ukraine are sincere. ""I don't know the Russian intentions, but Minister Lavrov did promise that they want to de-escalate, so we will see in a few days if it was (a) sincere promise and sincere participation,"" he said. Deshchytsia said the Ukraine government's ""anti-terrorist operation"" against the pro-Russian protesters who have taken control of key sites will continue, but its intensity will ""depend on the practical implementation"" of the pact. So far the show of force has done little to bring the eastern region back under Kiev's control. Monitoring mission . All sides agreed on Thursday to ask for monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has a mission in Ukraine, to help implement the measures aimed at easing the crisis. Deshchytsia said there would be a meeting later Friday at the Foreign Ministry with leaders of the mission to discuss the process by which occupied buildings will be handed over. He noted OSCE had ""over 100 monitors"" in the country. The European organization released a statement Friday describing the situation in western and central Ukraine as calm, whereas the Lukansk and Donetsk districts were ""tense due to the activity of armed opponents of the central government and Ukrainian special forces conducting a 'counterterrorist operation.'"" The OSCE noted, for example, that the state security service building in Luhansk was occupied. Observers saw evidence of blood, gunfire and Molotov cocktails at a military base in Mariupol. A hospital official indicated five people had been treated for gunshot wounds, and local government officials reported three dead, according to OSCE. This unsettled situation speaks to the drama, tension and challenges for those hoping for a speedy, peaceful resolution. Even as he announced the pact Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stressed that the proof of the agreement would be in its swift implementation on the ground. ""The job will not be done until these principles are implemented and are followed up on,"" he said. Kerry warned Russia could face ""further costs"" if the situation does not de-escalate in line with the concrete steps set out in the statement. Ukraine's leaders must also play their part in calming the situation, he said. Caution, skepticism greet deal . His boss, U.S. President Barack Obama, said the hope is that ""diplomacy may de-escalate the situation,"" but admitted that is not a given. ""I don't think we can be sure of anything at this point,"" he said at a news conference Thursday. The President added the United States and its allies ""have to be prepared -- potentially -- to respond"" to continued efforts by Russia to interfere in southern and eastern Ukraine. Already, he signed off on more nonlethal aid to Ukraine's military and state border guard service. At the same time, Obama said U.S. military options are still not on the table ""because this is not a situation that would be amendable to a clear military solution."" Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told CNN's ""New Day"" that the focus now was ""appropriately on diplomatic and economic pressure"" rather than military might. ""We're hopeful about the agreement. Now it's time for Russia to meet the obligations under that agreement and to help disarm, and to remove from those buildings, those armed militants,"" he said. Anti-Semitic fliers in eastern Ukraine denounced . Putin: Intervention still an option . The emergency talks in Geneva were called amid the spiraling crisis in Ukraine that has seen East-West relations at their most strained since the end of the Cold War. Even as the negotiations in Geneva were under way, Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear in his annual televised call-in session with the Russian people that military intervention in Ukraine remains an option. Moscow denies it has any intention of invading but says it reserves the right to protect Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. It has warned in the past week that Ukraine is ""on the brink of a civil war."" NATO says Russia has about 40,000 troops assembled near Ukraine's eastern border. In a story posted Friday on the website of Russia's state-owned Rossiya 1, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged additional Russian troops were moved close to the Ukraine border ""due to the instability of the political situation."" ""It is a country where they just had a coup,"" he said, referring to Yanukovych's ouster, ""and any country would take measures to provide security. And also we should remember that Russia is an absolutely free country and has a right to move their military."" Putin recently ceded that Russian forces had been active in Ukraine's Crimea region to support local defense forces, the first time he has acknowledged the deployment of Russian troops on the Black Sea peninsula. Peskov explained that Putin made this decision only after citizens in the majority Russian-speaking peninsula voted last month to align with Russia. ""Crimea was an act of protection of Russian people and their right to have a referendum,"" he said. The spokesman defended Moscow and sharply criticized the United States and European Union for their ""hypocrisy"" for siding with ""illegal, armed groups (who) won a so-called revolution."" Putin won't back down in the face of Western demands and under the threat of sanctions, he said. ""Russia should not be addressed or treated like a schoolgirl with a checklist of things to do,"" Peskov said. Ukraine military push appears to lose momentum in the east .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Change a few circumstances in her life and Sakie Fukushima says she would have been a housewife. She was raised to be a good Japanese wife and homemaker, after all. That's what was expected of women of her generation -- to sit behind their men, make their bentos, iron their shirts and watch them rise to lead Japan's economy. Life did not go as Fukushima expected. 60-year-old Fukushima is one of Japan's most powerful executives, sitting on the board of both U.S. and Japanese-based multi-national companies. The fact that she is a female in one of the most male-dominated business cultures is a stunning backstory in one woman's remarkable ascent through the so-called ""bamboo ceiling."" Bamboo bends, and unlike glass, never breaks. But Fukushima managed to crack through, by working for a U.S. company. ""I was lucky to be in a place where the hard work was appreciated,"" said Fukushima, of her corporate beginnings at Korn-Ferry International. The American company saw her sales output, the highest in the Asia-Pacific region, as the reason for promotion. An American mentor and her supportive husband urged Fukushima to push beyond her Japanese cultural expectations. ""If I was to work for a Japanese company, a large Japanese company, I don't think I would have come this far."" The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index ranks Japan 101 out of 134 countries. Part of the reason for the low ranking is that just 1.4 percent of Japanese executives are women. What that has meant for women in the workplace is they are pushed to traditionally female roles: secretary and store clerk. It is a dismal reality for the world's second-largest economy, said Beth Brooke, Ernst and Young's Global vice chairwoman and a Forbes Magazine 100 most powerful woman. ""Japan is a very homogeneous society. So on the spectrum of diversity, not just gender; it is more difficult to embrace diversity because it's not a terribly diverse culture to begin with."" Ironically, Brooke believes the global economic slowdown and Japan's aging population is a chance to rediscover the people under-utilized in the workforce. ""I think we have an opportunity to change the conversation here. Whether you're a country or a company, you need growth. Japan has an enormous opportunity, frankly, to see the opportunity to spark innovation through a gender lens of diversity. I think gender diversity is a big part of the solution."" Fukushima agreed, as she celebrates her recent appointment to the Bridgestone Corporation board. She is the first female to be elected to the Japanese company's boardroom. ""Experimenting is the best way to say it,"" said Fukushima, describing Japan's corporate sentiment toward women. ""They know they have to have diversity but they don't know how to do it and how to use it effectively. As a result of increasing competition outside of Japan from China and Korea, the Japanese business community has realized it has to change. They can't rely on the past successful model of the 1970s and '80s. They will have to increase diversity, change the way of doing business in order to compete."" Fukushima's new colleague, Bridgestone Americas, Inc. CEO and President Gary Garfield, said he is encouraged that his company in Japan is catching up to other global companies. He calls having a female on the board a no-brainer. His advice to Japanese companies: ""Just branch out and do it. They'll be stronger for it. I think they'll be better companies for it.""","1.4 percent of Japanese executives are women .

"(CNN) -- Newspaper publishers no doubt long for the days of black-and-white packages on most doorsteps and corporate earnings ""in the black,"" as they say. On Monday, Amazon.com -- a new king of black and white with its market-leading Kindle e-reader -- presented them with a chance to earn more profits in the digital world. Starting December 1, Amazon will give newspapers a 70 percent cut of revenue from digital versions of their editions sold in the site's Kindle Store. That's in line with what Apple and Google give developers selling apps in their digital markets. Amazon announced the changes to reporters Monday. Amazon was previously giving newspaper and magazine companies about 30 percent, according to a New York Times report last year. The online retail giant also is providing publishers with a new tool called Kindle Publishing for Periodicals. The program is designed to speed up the process of producing a version of the newspaper for the many platforms where Kindle software can be downloaded. ""A publisher would just need to send one feed, and Amazon customizes the experience for reading across different apps,"" Amazon spokeswoman Sarah Gelman said. If this program is successful, Amazon could become the leading newsstand of the digital world. And if news organizations bite, it could cause a shift in their digital strategies. Tapping the growing mobile audience has obvious appeal for traditional publishers. For example, Apple has sold more than 125 million gadgets -- iPhones, iPods and the iPad -- that run its mobile operating system. But finding developers capable of coding software for the system can be difficult and expensive. Amazon won't disclose how many Kindles it has sold, saying only ""millions."" (Amazon Chief Jeff Bezos says hiding that number gives the company a strategic advantage on competitors.) Sure, the Kindle e-reader still lacks a color display, but its software is available for an array of full-color devices, including the iPhone, iPad and those that run on Android systems. The idea is you'd have access to your newspaper subscription on every Kindle-enabled device you own. It's certainly been popular among bookworms, but that feature is not yet a reality with newspapers and magazines. This same ubiquity strategy has helped Zinio, a mobile reading application, dominate the digital magazine market, said Jeanniey Mullen, the company's chief marketing officer. That 10-year-old business has relationships with 3,000 magazine publishers -- some of which Amazon is no doubt eyeing for its renewed push into periodicals.","Amazon will give newspapers a 70 percent cut of digital sales for its Kindle e-reader .

"(CNN) -- Former world number one Tiger Woods insists he will not rush his recovery from a knee injury, casting doubt over the 14-time major champion's participation in next month's British Open. Woods has not played since he withdrew from the Players Championship in May, and is a doubt for golf's oldest major -- which is due to start at Royal St. George's in England on July 14. The American has been hampered by injuries since he returned to the sport following problems in his personal life and a self-imposed exile from the sport in early 2010. ""I'm setting no timetable, which is very different for me,"" the 35-year-old told the PGA Tour's official web site. ""I've played hurt before. I've played through injuries, I've played in pain. Unfortunately I pushed it too hard and hurt myself, and this time around I'm not going to do that again."" Now ranked 17th, he has not claimed one of golf's four major championships since the 2008 U.S. Open, when he played on despite breaking his leg, and last won a tournament at the 2009 Australian Masters. ""All the years of playing when my knee wasn't very good and playing through it, unfortunately I broke my leg and still played,"" said Woods. Despite his loss of form and slide down the world rankings, Woods is still confident in his ability to beat Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major wins. ""He won when he was 46, right? I've still got some time. I'm 35, I'm not 65. I've still got some years ahead of me. Golf is unlike any other sport,"" Woods said. He cited Tom Watson's performance at the 2009 British Open, where the veteran American lost out in a playoff for the Claret Jug to compatriot Stewart Cink, as an example of how age is not necessarily a barrier to success. ""I mean, Watson was, what, 59 years old when he almost won? We can play for a very long time."" Woods has won the British Open three times -- at Scotland's St. Andrews in 2000 and 2005, then at Hoylake in 2006. The tournament is returning to Sandwich in south-east England for the first time since 2003, when American Ben Curtis was a shock victor in his debut appearance at a major event.","Tiger Woods is unsure whether he will play in July's British Open tournament .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it is looking into allegations that passengers onboard singer Justin Bieber's charter flight last week interfered with the flight crew. Under FAA regulations, ""No person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crew member in the performance of the crew member's duties aboard an aircraft."" According to a law enforcement sources, Bieber and his father were ""extremely abusive verbally"" to a flight attendant during a flight on the chartered Gulfstream IV aircraft from Ontario, Canada, to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey last Friday in advance of the Super Bowl. Justin Bieber and his father refused a pilot's repeated warnings to stop smoking pot on the flight, according to a report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which was read to CNN. The pilots asked the flight attendant to remain in the cockpit to protect her from the alleged abusive behavior, the report says. Law enforcement sources told CNN that the pilots donned oxygen masks to keep them from inhaling the pot smoke. The pilots were concerned the smoke would result in them failing drug tests, law enforcement sources told CNN. After the jet landed at Teterboro, federal agents from CBP, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement said they detected the odor of marijuana, which prompted a search by drug-sniffing dogs, the source said. No drugs were found, a law enforcement source told CNN. Bieber, 19, a citizen of Canada living in the United States on a work visa, was detained by border agents for several hours of questioning to determine if he was admissible to the United States. Bieber and his entourage of 10 were granted re-entry. Authorities said both civil and criminal statutes prohibit passengers from interfering with the a flight crew in the performance of their duties. Under a civil statute, violators face penalties of $11,000 to $27,500, the FAA said. Under a criminal statute, violators face a maximum of 20 years in prison and fines up to $250,000. It is not clear how the case came to the FAA's attention. The agency declined to say whether they were alerted by complaints from the pilots, by media reports, or by the investigating CBP officers or others. In a statement to CNN on Friday, the FAA said it is ""looking into allegations"" that passengers on the plane interfered with the flight crew, but it did not identify specific passengers. A representative for the pop star had no comment Friday night. Bieber has had several encounters with law enforcement authorities in recent months. He was recently arrested in Toronto, accused of assaulting his limousine driver in December. He also faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving on an expired license after being stopped by police in Miami Beach, Florida, last month. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering whether to charge Bieber with felony vandalism in the egging of his neighbor's house on January 9, 2014. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Sources say Bieber and his father were ""extremely abusive verbally"" to flight attendant .

"(CNN) -- The 10th anniversary this month of the invasion of Iraq will remind most people of a divisive and dubious war that toppled Saddam Hussein but claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 Americans and more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians. What it conjures up for me is the media's greatest failure in modern times. Major news organizations aided and abetted the Bush administration's march to war on what turned out to be faulty premises. All too often, skepticism was checked at the door, and the shaky claims of top officials and unnamed sources were trumpeted as fact. By the time U.S. soldiers discovered there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the media establishment was left with apologies and explanations. The Bush-Cheney administration helped whip up an atmosphere in the wake of 9/11 in which media criticism of national security efforts seemed almost unpatriotic. Watch: Did Roger Ailes cross a line in calling Obama lazy? As the war, once sold as a cakewalk, went sour in 2004, the New York Times said in an editor's note that its editors were ""perhaps too intent on rushing scoops into the paper,"" some of them erroneous stories by Judith Miller. The paper said its reporting on what turned out to be nonexistent WMDs was ""not as rigorous as it should have been"" and that the Times overplayed stories with ""dire claims about Iraq."" I was working at The Washington Post at the time, and I took it upon myself to examine the paper's performance in the run-up to war. It was not a pretty picture. From August 2002 through the March 19, 2003, launch of the war, I found more than 140 front-page stories that focused heavily on administration rhetoric against Iraq: ""Cheney Says Iraqi Strike Is Justified""; ""War Cabinet Argues for Iraq Attack""; ""Bush Tells United Nations It Must Stand Up to Hussein or U.S. Will""; ""Bush Cites Urgent Iraqi Threat""; ""Bush Tells Troops: Prepare for War."" By contrast, pieces questioning the evidence or rationale for war were frequently buried, minimized or spiked. Watch: Bill Clinton uses op-ed to flip-flop on gay marriage . Len Downie, then the executive editor, told me that in retrospect, ""we were so focused on trying to figure out what the administration was doing that we were not giving the same play to people who said it wouldn't be a good idea to go to war and were questioning the administration's rationale. Not enough of those stories were put on the front page. That was a mistake on my part.""

There was a ""groupthink"" among intelligence officials, he said, and ""I think I was part of the groupthink."" Watch: Should ESPN give Keith Olbermann another at-bat? Tom Ricks, who was the paper's top military reporter, turned in a piece in the fall of 2002 that he titled ""Doubts,"" saying that senior Pentagon officials were resigned to an invasion but were reluctant and worried that the risks were being underestimated. An editor killed the story, saying it relied too heavily on retired military officials and outside experts -- in other words, those with sufficient independence to question the rationale for war. ""There was an attitude among editors: Look, we're going to war, why do we even worry about all this contrary stuff?"" Ricks said. Watch: White House bullying against the press . I actually think the Post did a better job than most. And there is no minimizing the difficulties that even the most intrepid journalists faced: They couldn't go to Iraq to investigate for themselves, and most government sources were echoing the administration's line about WMDs. But that system's failure casts a dark shadow on the news business that has not entirely lifted. The press needs to challenge what government officials say, whether it is about war or weapons or Wall Street, or whether the impact of federal budget cuts is being exaggerated. The low level of public confidence in the media has many causes, but one of them stems from what happened back in 2003. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: News reporting before war in Iraq was media's greatest failure in recent times .

"(CNN) -- ""Something there is that doesn't love a wall,"" wrote Robert Frost. This something is someone now: Pope Francis. In a strong, apparently unscripted move on his recent visit to Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, on Sunday the pontiff suddenly waved to the driver of his Popemobile, asking to get out. Surrounded by guards and by children waving Palestinian flags, he got out, walked over to the wall that separates Israel from its Palestinian neighbors, and he did something remarkably simple but with astonishing power: He prayed. This symbolic gesture occurred at a well-known portion of the wall, a segment covered with graffiti. Somebody had spray-painted a message in black: ""Pope we need some 1 to speak about justice Bethlehem look like Warsaw ghetto."" In bold red letters the Pope could read: ""Free Palestine."" While Israeli guards looked anxiously down from a nearby tower, wondering what on Earth was going on, Francis touched the wall with his right hand, bent his head, and prayed for several minutes. Afterward, he kissed the wall, then walked slowly back to his vehicle. I've myself experienced several times the haunting power of Bethlehem for Christians. My father was a Baptist minister, and once -- in 1989 -- I took him to the Church of the Nativity, the spot where (by tradition) Jesus was thought to have been born. This is a place of pilgrimage for those devoted to the Christian path, and it's also an important city on the West Bank for Palestinians (among them a mix of Muslims and Christians, with Muslims the vast majority). This holy city, described in the Hebrew scriptures as the City of David, was under Ottoman and Egyptian rule for centuries. The British controlled much of Palestine from 1920-1948 during the period known as the Mandate. The United Nations partitioned Palestine after the war, but Jordan took possession of Bethlehem after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It became a refuge for Palestinians at this time, largely under the control of Jordan until the Six Day War in 1967. The Israelis kept control until 1995, when an agreement was reached with the Palestinian National Authority, although it has been a place of unease, especially during the 2000-2005 era known as the Second Intifada, when for a period (in 2002) the Church of the Nativity itself became a battle zone for 39 days. Some 150 people then (mostly Palestinian civilians, with numerous Catholic and Orthodox monks and nuns) took refuge in the Church of the Nativity from an Israeli siege known as Operation Defensive Shield. A tense stalemate occurred, with the Franciscan Order asking the Israeli government to let everyone inside the church go free on the 10th day. There was no response, although an Armenian monk was shot and wounded that day. Ultimately, Israeli snipers shot dead eight people in or around the church; they wounded at least 22, all of them designated as terrorists by the Israeli army. Against this history, this pope exercised his unerring sense of symbolism. It's not for nothing that he took the name of Francis of Assisi, in memory of a saint who, in the 12th century, was regarded as the person who most embodied the life and teachings of Jesus. Although born into a rich merchant family, he humbled himself, trying his best to conform to the pattern of life established by Jesus, with a dedication to peace, to bringing down barriers, to expressing love in whatever ways he could. Pope Francis invites Israeli, Palestinian leaders to Vatican peace talks . Francis of Assisi lived without pretense. He understood symbolic gestures like Jesus himself, who washed the feet of those around him, who sought out those -- such as prostitutes, lepers and beggars -- on the margins of society. Through the Middle Ages, that earlier Francis was commonly known as alter Christus -- ""the second Christ."" One could say that Pope Francis, in turn, follows him as a man who lives without pretense, who understands symbolic gestures. In stopping to pray by this wall of separation, he implicitly cries: Tear down this wall! He has pointedly asked Mahmoud Abbas and Shimon Peres -- the Palestinian and Israeli presidents -- to join him for a time of prayer and reconciliation in Rome. He has called the conflict in Israel ""increasingly unacceptable,"" which is a marvel of understatement. (In a gesture of reconciliation, the pope did â€” on Monday â€” accede to an Israeli request to pray before a memorial to Israeli victims of the conflict as well. As ever, he understands that it will be necessary to listen carefully to both sides in this tragic dispute.) As the pope's unexpected pause by the wall near Bethlehem makes terribly clear, this ugly partition that weaves through the West Bank has become a potent symbol of the Israeli occupation, and it's an affront to all reasonable Christians, Muslims, and Jews. Good fences do not, in this case, make good neighbors. It's time to pull down this barrier to freedom.","Jay Parini: On Bethlehem trip, Pope makes significant gesture by praying at separation wall .

"(CNN) -- Penny Marshall, most famous as the Pepsi- and milk-swigging half of ""Laverne & Shirley,"" reveals in her new memoir, ""My Mother Was Nuts,"" that her life off-camera has been just as crazy as anything that viewers saw on the screen. Marshall's book reads like a Who's Who of pop culture's major players in the last half of the 20th century. There are stories of Calvin Klein tearing up the dance floor at high school parties and of Marshall hanging out with John Belushi and smelling pillows for Steven Spielberg. CNN recently sat down with the actress-director as she opened up about her incredible life: . On her unconventional appeal . In her pre-fame days, Marshall quickly learned she didn't fit the Hollywood stereotype when she co-starred in a Head & Shoulders shampoo commercial with a then-unknown blonde named Farrah Fawcett. Marshall's on-set stand-in wore a placard that read ""Homely Girl,"" while the stand-in for Fawcett had one reading ""Pretty Girl."" Fawcett kindly decided to cross out the word ""Homely"" and wrote ""Plain"" instead. In an episode of ""Love, American Style,"" Marshall was cast as the ""Homely Girl at Bar."" After becoming a big TV star with her own series, she handled her fame with aplomb, though once at a party she and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman's"" Louise Lasser cordially congratulated one another on their success, then slipped into a nearby bathroom, giddily jumping up and down and squealing, ""We're famous! We're famous!"" On her marriage to Rob Reiner . Before either one of them was well-known, Marshall ended up dating and marrying Rob Reiner, who grew up across the street from Marshall in the Bronx, though the pair had never met. ""It was a very wide street,"" Marshall explained. At one point, both auditioned for a new sitcom, but while Reiner was cast as Mike Stivic, Sally Struthers ended up playing his wife, Gloria, on ""All in the Family."" On the ups and downs of 'Laverne & Shirley' The actress' brother, director Garry Marshall, was a successful TV writer and producer when Jack Klugman convinced him to cast his sister as Oscar's secretary, Myrna, in ""The Odd Couple."" Later her brother ended up casting his sibling and her old pal Cindy Williams in a guest stint on another hit series, ""Happy Days."" The two played Laverne and Shirley, ""fast girls"" Fonzie recruited for a double date with Richie Cunningham. Marshall and Williams soon got their own spinoff as a slightly more wholesome version of that duo. ""Laverne & Shirley"" was an immediate hit, debuting as the No. 1-rated show, which was, according to Marshall, ""great for my career, not so great for my marriage."" It happened that the show ""Laverne & Shirley"" pushed from the top spot was ... ""All in the Family."" ""Laverne & Shirley's"" success turned out to be a mixed bag in more ways than one. While the show was funny, on the set things weren't always so hilarious. Surrounded by Marshall's kin and cronies, Williams felt outnumbered and overlooked, which led to tension behind the scenes. Though an unhappy Williams ended up leaving the show before it ended, Marshall said that after two decades of silence they've finally patched things up: ""I just talked to her last night!"" On Carrie Fisher . Marshall's relationship with best friend Carrie Fisher has endured through thick and thin. ""We always got along great because we didn't like the same guys or the same drugs,"" Marshall joked. On directing . Though she'll always be Laverne De Fazio to those who grew up on her series' ""I Love Lucy""-esque shenanigans, Marshall went on to become a successful director. With her second film, ""Big,"" starring Tom Hanks, she became the first female director to have a film break the $100 million mark at the box office. Marshall went on to direct several popular films, including the Oscar-nominated ""Awakenings,"" where she coped with Robert De Niro's fear of cockroaches and Robin Williams' fear of being outacted by De Niro. On 'A League of Their Own' Marshall contended with the unique hormonal challenges of a large, mostly female cast. ""Unfortunately, everyone's cycle synced up,"" Marshall recalled. ""The mood swings -- that poor crew!"" On her mother . Throughout the book, Marshall reiterates that her most salient quality is her desire to have fun. But life didn't always make it easy. Her mother, as the title suggests, wasn't exactly June Cleaver. In fact, Marshall said that when she was a teenager her mother told her she'd been unwanted, saying, ""You were a miscarriage, but you were stubborn and held on."" On 9/11 . Marshall had many friends who were firefighters and as a native New Yorker remains very emotional when it comes to September 11. ""When I was recording for book on tape,"" Marshall said, ""I couldn't get through that part -- I just kept tearing up."" On unplanned pregnancies . Having sex with her college sweetheart to cheer him up after a football squad setback, Marshall became pregnant and embarked on a hasty teenage marriage. (At City Hall, they were handed a newlywed's ""Starter Kit"" consisting of a bar of soap, toothpaste and a small box of Tide.) The pair spent much of their honeymoon watching news about John F. Kennedy's assassination, and things didn't pick up much after that. Many years later she found herself once again pregnant and unmarried, and though close friend Joe Pesci gallantly offered to step in and act as father, she made the difficult decision to have an abortion. ""I didn't want to be tied to the kid's (biological) father,"" Marshall said. ""And that situation was one of my life's only big regrets."" In the end . Through the various heartbreaks and setbacks, Marshall said she knows how to surmount it all. Framed in her bathroom is the Waylon Jennings lyric that speaks to the secret of her success: ""I've always been crazy, but it's kept me from going insane.""

"Sapeacu, Brazil (CNN) -- Shopkeepers and school children in this remote Brazilian farming town giggle and point when Rebecca Bernardo pedals by on her rusty red bicycle. The unwanted attention started a few months ago when the Brazilian high school student posted a video on YouTube. Wearing a sleeveless pink top and standing next to a mirror showing her profile as she speaks, Bernardo announces to the camera, ""Hi, my name is Rebecca. I'm here to auction off my virginity."" Bernardo told CNN she made the offer because she was desperate to help her ailing mother. She heard about Catarina Migliorini, a Brazilian woman who reportedly sold her virginity for $780,000 on an Australian website seeking virgins. Migliorini has reportedly yet to finalize the deal and receive the money, and Brazil is reportedly investigating whether the website should be charged with human trafficking.  Nevertheless, Migliorini has received widespread publicity and modeling contracts -- including a spread in Brazil's version of Playboy magazine. ""I made up my mind right after my 18th birthday,"" Bernardo said in an interview with CNN last month in her small, one-bedroom house. ""That's when my mother suffered a stroke."" The stroke left her mother bed-ridden, unable to feed herself or go to the bathroom alone. Bernardo said she looked for jobs and tried selling cosmetics and working as a waitress, but without a high school degree, the pay was minimal. ""I would get 150 reais ($75) for working all day, which would just pay the salary of someone to stay with my mother,"" she said, after patiently feeding her mother a plate of reheated spaghetti. ""There comes a time when you have to make decisions to get what you want. You have to be strong."" About a month ago, she said she used a friend's YouTube account to post the video of her offer, which she said got 3,000 hits on the first day. YouTube has taken the post down and the account associated with it ""due to multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement,"" although it has been widely reposted on the video sharing site. There are questions surrounding the authenticity of Bernardo's altruism. A Brazilian TV network offered to pay for her mother's medical expenses if Bernardo called off the auction. While she initially accepted the offer during a television interview, she later rejected it because the network would not pay for a house in a different town where she could ""start a new life."" There are also questions about whether her offer to auction off her virginity is just a ploy to attract media attention that could lead to lucrative deals. In October, Bernardo posted a YouTube video auditioning for the next installment of the Brazilian version of ""Big Brother,"" which offers a $500,000 prize to the last housemate left on the show. In the video, she talks about her hobbies and says that if she wins, she will use the money to help her ailing mother. She later told TV Globo, which produces the Brazilian version of the show, that she hasn't registered to be a contestant. Bernardo said she has received several bids for her virginity -- the highest one for 70,000 reais, or $35,000. Prostitution is legal in Brazil. Bernardo's video initially set off a firestorm in her hometown, echoing across the country. ""When she started the auction, people in the street threw coins at her when she went by,"" said a local mechanic. ""But I never looked at her differently."" Today, attitudes in Sapeacu are shifting, thanks in part to the national attention her story is getting. Her neighbors seemed largely sympathetic, noting that Bernardo's only sister died young and that she never knew her father. ""She had no one to go to, no one to help, so this is the only solution she found,"" said one neighbor. ""Everyone has the right to decide what to do with their own body, even if that's not the choice I would make,"" said another. But her mother, speaking with difficulty from her bed with her daughter sitting beside her, said she is devastated. ""It's wrong, it's wrong!"" she said. ""She should look for work, she shouldn't prostitute herself."" Yet, as her mother's sole caregiver, Bernardo insists she has few options. ""It's a lot of responsibility to face alone,"" she said, wiping away tears. ""I'm not really prepared."" Lurid journey through Backpage.com . 2009: Virginity for sale .

"Monson, California (CNN) -- In California, water flows uphill toward money and power. That's a well-known maxim out here, especially in the Dust-Bowl-ready Central Valley -- that forgotten stretch of California that grows 40% of U.S. fruits, nuts and other table foods. Meet a few people and it's easy to see why. There's Joel Sampedro, 56, whose garden hose started spitting out sand, not water, about this time last year; or Simona MagaÃ±a, a 70-year-old former farm worker who stores water in buckets in the back of a rusty yellow pickup truck because her well is busted and there's no reliable public system for her to hook up to; she uses that nonpotable water to wash dishes, take showers and ""flush"" the toilet; or Eunice Martinez, 48, who, like many here, makes a distinction between ""water,"" which is the stuff that comes from her tap, and which is usually too polluted to drink, and ""drinking water,"" which is the stuff she buys in plastic bottles. ""We're in the United States of America. We should be able to turn on that water and drink out of it,"" Martinez told me, standing by her kitchen sink, which has a five-gallon water jug next to it for cooking. ""We can't ... It's discriminatory, racist."" This is the invisible California -- the ""other California."" A place of pickup trucks and pesticides. More West Texas than West Hollywood. It's the same California John Steinbeck chronicled in ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" the epic book about ""Okies"" who left the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl and fled to farms here. Some of them are still around. On Tuesday, I went to the town of Tooleville (nickname: ""Little Okie""); and the unincorporated town of Monson. There, I met Clarence Harms, whose family came to this supposed promised land from Kansas and Oklahoma when the dust storms made life back there unbearable. And it's the California that's going to be the subject of my next project in the Change the List series. I'm fascinated by this forgotten valley and a major river, the San Joaquin, that cuts through it. The advocacy group American Rivers recently named the San Joaquin the ""most endangered"" river in the country. To figure out why, I'm setting off on a three-week journey to try to kayak and walk along its path. I'm doing so because I want to understand the river and the people who depend on it -- beyond the screaming headlines about drought-year California politics. I want to get to know this river, at a river's pace, on a river's terms. I started the journey on Tuesday by going on a tour of the Central Valley with the Community Water Center in Visalia, California. I did that because I wanted to understand how and why water matters to people here. I found out it's everything. Yet there's not nearly enough to go around. Wells are going dry. Those who do have water have to deal with pollution from nitrate, which is linked to blue baby syndrome, kidney disease and other maladies. Some blame farmers for slurping up groundwater with virtually no regulatory oversight from the state. Farm advocates say there's not enough river water for them, in part because of regulations to protect rare fish. They say they're pulling groundwater to survive, too. I'm going to withhold judgment for now, but I plan to wade deeper into these and many other environmental and social issues on my trip down the San Joaquin. The adventure down the river starts for real on Wednesday. I'm going to hike up to the untouched headwaters, high in the Sierra Nevada. I'm hoping to end beneath the Golden Gate Bridge in early July. That's assuming I don't get lost or die of heat exhaustion. You can follow the journey on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Or, to make it easier, there's a page on CNN.com that will collect all that stuff for you. I'll be using the hashtag #endangeredriver. I could ramble on about my plans, but you'll get to hear all about them in the coming weeks. For now, let me leave you with this: Water is such a deeply personal topic out here in California that Marcelina Sampedro, the wife of the man whose hose started sputtering sand, told me she has two recurring dreams about it. Both are about a river, but they're slightly different. Version1: The water is clean and pure. Someone is struggling to swim, but Sampedro is able to grab this anonymous person and pull him or her out to safety. Version2: The river is polluted, which makes it not unlike the water that comes out of her tap. She and her husband use a $900 water filter/robot (it looks like a miniature version of Eve from WALL-E) to remove the nitrates from the water that comes out of their sink. They both work on fruit orchards, picking crops in the 100-degree heat, paid by the weight, and making about $26,000, together, per year. In that second dream, again, the person in the river is drowning. She tries to help but can't. The unnamed figure drowns. She wakes up to a life where she and her husband would have no water at home if it weren't for the generosity of Clarence, their neighbor, who gives them water from his well. They're all worried his well could go dry, too. There are potential fixes for all this, and state programs that are trying to bring safe water to more people in the Central Valley and elsewhere. But there's just not enough water to go around. So water continues to flow uphill. Toward money and power. That's the history. And, if more's not done, it's looking like the future.","John Sutter is starting a project on California's San Joaquin River and watershed .

"(CNN) -- I love cemeteries. That doesn't surprise most people. Because I'm a crime novelist, they expect me to peer into the dark, shivery corners everyone else avoids. But the reasons I love graveyards have little to do with the spooky. To me, they're beautiful green spaces and open-air art museums. While there are two famous American cemeteries that rate as tourist attractions in their own right -- Arlington and Gettysburg -- there are others that deserve to be better known. Here are my 10 favorite final resting places around the world. They should be on every traveler's list of things to see before they... you know. Green-Wood Cemetery, New York City . Close your eyes and imagine 478 acres of rolling hills, complete with several ponds, a lake, a glorious view of the Statue of Liberty and thousands of historic monuments. Throw in a chapel that's modeled on Christopher Wren's Thomas Tower at Oxford's Christ Church College, and you've got Brooklyn's spectacular Green-Wood. The cemetery took a beating from Hurricane Sandy, losing some 300 mature trees, but the grand mausoleums and monuments are still in place. This 1838 cemetery boasts National Historic Landmark status, in part because it's where the Battle of Long Island was fought in 1776. But it's just as significant to bird-watchers, and it's a member of the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary System. Green-Wood offers a variety of ticketed tours that take you around its expansive grounds by trolley or into its catacombs by flashlight, but visitors are welcome to walk the grounds daily. Granary Burying Ground, Boston . A sign at the entrance to the Granary Burying Ground claims that ""Famous, infamous and unknown Bostonians are buried here."" This small cemetery on Tremont Street, founded in 1660, holds many Revolutionary War heroes, including Paul Revere, John Hancock, Samuel Adams and James Otis. One of the grandest monuments belongs to Benjamin Franklin's family (though Ben himself rests in Philadelphia). One of the more infamous residents is Samuel Sewall, a magistrate who presided over the Salem witch trials. Almost every headstone is eye-catching in its own right, with elaborate carvings of skeletons sporting scythes, winged skulls, sly-looking cherubs, and other symbols of mourning, as well as poetic epitaphs. The towering Egyptian Revival gate that marks the entryway is a work of art in its own right. Open daily, the Granary Burying Ground has excellent signage to point out the most famous -- and infamous --graves. 9 haunted spots across America . Mount Pleasant, Toronto . If you're not used to seeing cemeteries filled with baby strollers and joggers, brace yourself before visiting Mount Pleasant. It's best to regard it as a public park that happens to have a lot of permanent residents. I'd love to say that locals' enthusiasm for the place is part of my hometown's Victorian tradition -- back in 1876, when this cemetery opened, having family picnics at gravesites was considered normal behavior. But it's also true that when you see Mount Pleasant's rolling green hills, botanical gardens, leafy trees, and elegant fountains, you know that it's the cemetery's incredible beauty that draws people in. There are grand mausoleums here, belonging to families like the Eatons and the Masseys, and famous graves, such as pianist Glenn Gould's resting place, but the real reason to visit is to enjoy glorious green space in the middle of a frenetic city. Open daily from dawn to dusk. St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, New Orleans . New Orleans never had an easy time burying people -- with its water table, they could get unburied when it rained. So they devised a city of the dead with above-ground tombs and opened St. Louis No. 1 in 1789. Its whitewashed crypts, some topped with mournful statues and surrounded by wrought-iron gates, have a ghostly beauty that has been captured on film, most famously in ""Easy Rider."" The cemetery, as racially diverse as New Orleans itself, is a stop on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail, and while it's primarily a Catholic burial place, it has a section for others, too. Tour a NOLA cemetery in pictures . One of its most famous residents may be the 19th-century voodoo priestess Marie Laveau, whose remains are believed to be in the Glapion tomb, and occult offerings are left there in her honor. Guided tours are available through Save Our Cemeteries, but visitors are welcome to wander through every day except Mardi Gras. Highgate Cemetery, London . Situated on 37 acres in North London, Highgate is as almost much a nature reserve as it is a historic resting place. Wild as a classic English garden, it features trees, shrubs and flowers growing without human intervention, and they provide cover to Highgate's many living inhabitants, which include foxes. In the midst of all this greenery are magnificent stone monuments, some dating back to 1839 and so covered in ivy that the grounds can resemble the land that time forgot. But with famous people such as George Eliot, Karl Marx and Malcolm McLaren interred here, it isn't likely that anyone will ever pass it by. Highgate is divided into East and West cemeteries, with the latter only available for viewing by tour (buy tickets in advance through the website). East Highgate charges an admission fee, but you can explore it on your own. Hogwarts fan? Follow the trail of real witches . Père-Lachaise, Paris . This is the ultimate Who's Who of graveyards. It was established by Napoleon himself in 1804, with the emperor declaring, ""Every citizen has the right to be buried regardless of race or religion."" Since then, Père-Lachaise has welcomed writers (Balzac, Proust, Richard Wright, Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas); singers (Maria Callas, Edith Piaf); artists (Delacroix, Ingres, Modigliani, Corot, Seurat); and composers (Chopin, Bizet), among others. But the most popular gravesite of all is that of rock star Jim Morrison, whose relatively small grave has been so often vandalized that it is now guarded. The cemetery is open daily and visitors are welcome to explore. There's no admission charge. Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague . It's a curious thing to stand on a city street and look up -- way up -- to spot the cemetery. Prague was, at one time, home to one of the wealthiest Jewish communities in Europe. But its inhabitants were still subject to some rather draconian rules, including one commanding that Jews could only be buried on a single city block. What's now called the Old Jewish Cemetery was that burial ground, and it was used continuously from the early 15th century until 1787. There was nowhere to go but up, and so centuries of tombs and monuments lie buried inside as more earth was brought in. There are some 12,000 tombstones at the top, though thousands more are buried here. It's a poignant thing to see so many headstones jammed together, yet each one is elaborately carved, inlaid with flora and fauna, symbols of a trade or hands reaching to heaven. Open daily, with an admission fee. La Recoleta, Buenos Aires . In Argentina's capital city, Recoleta is considered a chief attraction. Walled off from the tony neighborhood it inhabits, it's effectively a city-within-the-city, founded in 1822 and filled with elaborately carved tombs and fine Italian statuary. The most popular spot is the Duarte family tomb, which is where the country's most famous first lady, Evita Perón, is buried. (The Duartes are her father's family; because the controversial Evita's body was stolen and mutilated by her husband's enemies after her death, it's now heavily protected.) Even if the names of famous Argentine families aren't familiar to foreign visitors, their extravagant memorials leave a lasting impression. Free tours are available in a variety of languages, and visitors are welcome to explore on their own. The longest airline flight in the world . Cementerio General, Santiago . Chile and Argentina have always been great rivals, so perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that Santiago has a cemetery that aims to be even more spectacular than Buenos Aires'. Spread over 210 acres, and divided into elegant streets and boulevards, the Cementerio General has massive tombs designed to resemble Mayan temples, Venetian palazzos and other grand structures — they're so huge, you might start to wonder whether any living family members could be inside, too. But the most fascinating part of the site is the Monument to the Disappeared, a large-scale memorial to those who vanished under Augusto Pinochet's brutal regime. Undoubtedly not by coincidence, the Pinochet family tomb is a stone's-throw away. (Augusto Pinochet died in 2006, but his family, fearing vandalism, didn't place his cremated remains at the family tomb.) Open daily to visitors. Mount of Olives, Jerusalem . I'm embarrassed to admit that, when I visited the Mount of Olives, on the eastern side of Old Jerusalem, I was expecting a grove of olive trees. Instead, I found an expansive cemetery that dates back to biblical times and is still in use. One of the oldest monuments, at the foot of the mount in the Kidron Valley, is to King David's son Absalom. According to the Book of Zechariah, the Mount of Olives is where the Messiah will first appear, and so it's the first place where the dead will rise from their graves. The Jewish cemetery contains biblical kings as well as more modern Israeli leaders such as Menahem Begin, but there are also Christian and Muslim burial grounds here. Wherever you stand on the mount, it offers a uniquely beautiful view of ancient, walled Jerusalem.","The Granary Burying Ground is the final home for many Revolutionary War heroes .
