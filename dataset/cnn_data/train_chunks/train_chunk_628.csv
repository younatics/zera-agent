Police investigating the death of a teenage gymnast in a car crash have arrested her boyfriend on suspicion of dangerous driving. Former child model Claudia Ella Williams, 19, was killed as her boyfriend Rick Bromley 20, was driving them to her grandmother's house after a family dinner in a pub. Miss Willams, a gymnast for the Welsh national squad, was pronounced dead at the scene after the silver Vauxhall Corsa hit a tree in the village of Guilden Sutton, Cheshire, while Bromley escaped with minor bruising. Claudia Williams, 19, died when a car driven by her boyfriend Rick Bromley, 20, hit a tree after a family dinner . She and her boyfriend had been out for dinner at the Old Trooper pub in . Christleton, outside Chester, with her father Nigel and two younger sisters aged 17, and . 10. At 9.40pm Miss Williams, who modelled as a toddler, and Bromley were driving through the countryside east of Chester when the car veered off the . road and hit a tree on the passenger side of the vehicle. Shortly after the accident on June 24, Miss Williams' family publicly vowed to support Bromley, describing the couple as 'inseparable'. This week, however, he was detained and questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.  He has now been freed on bail pending further inquiries. Miss Williams, who lived with her mother Andrea in Hoole, Chester, was studying travel and tourism at West Cheshire College in Ellesmere Port and working as a hotel waitress in her spare time. She began dating Bromley last year, and he had been living with her and her mother for six months before she died. Miss Willams, a gymnast for the Welsh national squad, was pronounced dead at the scene after the silver Vauxhall Corsa hit a tree in the village of Guilden Sutton, Cheshire . Last week Miss Williams' parents spoke of their devastation at losing a daughter they described as a 'princess who lived life to the full'. Her mother told the Chester Chronicle: 'We are going to miss her so much - our lives will never be the same without her. 'She’ll be forever in our hearts and always live on with us in our memories. Rick lived here for six months. They were inseparable and hadn’t spent a night apart in six months.' 'We are going to miss her so much - our lives will never be the same without her.' - Miss Williams' mother Andrea . 'She loved socialising, living life to the full and having a good time. She competed for the Welsh national gymnastic squad and got to travel all over the world competing in gymnastics. 'Claudia spent all her time with her friends and Rick. She was best friends with her grandma and would spend a few nights with her gran and Rick.' Miss Williams' father, Nigel, added: 'Claudia loved history and anything to do with archaeology. 'She loved to look immaculate all the time and was just happy with life.  We’d like to give our support to Rick and his family who have always been lovely.' Her aunt Janene said: 'She was was a very, very bright child. Claudia’s ambition was to be graceful and beautiful and get married and settle down and have children. She was a lady. 'She was very family-orientated. The time she thrived the most was when all of her family were together. She would organise and plan and do shopping lists to get the family together.' A spokesman for West Cheshire College described Miss Williams as 'a delight to teach and an excellent team player', and her former headmaster at Christleton High School said she was a happy and popular student.","Claudia Ella Williams, 19, died at the scene in Guilden Sutton, Cheshire .

The first-ever sketch of children's favourites Winnie-the-Pooh and Christopher Robin by famed illustrator E.H. Shepard has come to light for the first time in 90 years. The ink drawing accompanied Pooh author A.A. Milne's poem 'Vespers' and shows Christopher Robin asleep in bed with a teddy bear lying on his back on the quilt. It is part of a set of eight original Pooh drawings from private collections around the world tipped to fetch more than £600,000 at auction. Beautiful: This ink drawing of Christopher Robin asleep with Pooh lying on his bed is among the collection . Unique: The sketches have not been seen since they were sketched by E.H. Shepard in 1924 . One other original Shepard illustration is the iconic 1926 work from Winnie-the-Pooh of Christopher Robin pulling his bear up the stairs by its leg. An almost-identical sketch showing the boy dragging Pooh down the stairs that was owned by the late film director Michael Winner sold last December for £139,250. Iconic: Another of the sketches shows poor Pooh being dragged by one leg up the stairs . The price for the reverse picture is now expected to rival that price. A preparatory sketch map of One Hundred Acre Wood, where Winnie-the-Pooh lived with Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger, Kanga and Roo, is also tipped to sell for £80,000. The map has Shephard's revised captions for locations in the wood, such as 'Eeyore's Pasture Land' which became 'Eeyore's Gloomy Place.' It went on to appear in the endpapers of the first volume of the Winnie-the-Pooh books published in 1926. 'Vespers' was the final poem of Milne's 1924 book' When We Were Very Young', the first book Shephard illustrated for the writer. The poem included the famous lines 'Hush! Hush! Whisper who dares! Christopher Robin is saying his prayers.' The 1.8ins by 4.7ins sketch, titled 'And I shut my eyes and I curl up small', was the first time young Christopher Robin and his toy bear Winnie-the-Pooh were drawn together. Shepard, who also illustrated The Wind in the Willows, sold the sketch in 1924 to a private collector who has treasured it ever since. It is now being sold with along side another drawing from 'Vespers' of Christopher Robin kneeling at his bed praying. They have a joint pre-sale estimate of £60,000. Talent: Ernest Shepard who illustrated Wind in the Willows, Winnie the Pooh and the Christopher Robin books . Dr Philip Errington, books and . manuscripts specialist at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'These are . Shepard's original Winnie-the-Pooh illustrations that were then passed . on to the publishers. 'Winnie-the-Pooh . has a place in all our hearts and is up there with Alice in Wonderland . and Peter Pan as one of the fundamental children's stories. 'There is not a child or adult who wouldn't recognise Winnie-the-Pooh and Christopher Robin - and these are the originals. 'The . drawings from Vespers are particularly fascinating because it is the . first time we are introduced to Christopher Robin and lying on the end . of his bed is a bear. Charming: This map sketches out One Hundred Acre Wood where Pooh lived with Rabbit, Eeyore, Piglet, Tigger Kanga and Roo . Inspired: The drawing of Christopher Robin praying, left, accompanied A.A.

'When . we arrived the cub was already playing with the leopard tortoise, so I . started taking photos immediately, making sure I didn't miss a thing.' The leopard tortoise is the fourth largest species of tortoise in the world so the lion was certainly taking on a mouthful. But even its ferocious fangs weren't powerful enough to pierce its victim's armour. The youngster wanted to turn playtime into a mealtime but picked the wrong creature to mess with . The lion found that even a few licks couldn't soften up the tortoises's protective shell . The cub's frustration at not being able to chow down on the leopard tortoise was written all over its face .

Trayvon Martin lived in Miami and was . in Sanford visiting family February 26 when he went to a convenience store. He was walking back carrying a bag of Skittles candy and can of iced . tea, the hood of his jacket pulled over his head because it was raining. He was approached by the 28-year-old Zimmerman, who told a police . dispatcher he thought Martin looked suspicious. Zimmerman shot Martin . following a chase and fight.

Immediately after they responded to the scene, they took George Zimmerman back to police headquarters but while there, they did not test him for alcohol or drugs. Considering he is heard slurring his words on the 911 call, that was a particularly agregious move. Not only that, but playing into to thoughts of Mr Zimmerman, the police instead tested Trayvon's dead body for alcohol and drugs. He was clean. They allowed Mr Zimmerman to leave the police station without pressing any charges. And until the very recent press buzz about the case, they proceeded to do no further investigation after that fateful night. It has taken almost a month for anything to change in the case, which has upset Trayvon's family and their supporters. Tracy Martin thanked the rally goers. 'If Trayvon were here, he would have been here tonight,' he said. 'He was a people person. Let's get justice for your son.' Familiar chants like 'No justice, no . peace' were also sung throughout the night. At least four charter buses . from Atlanta brought rally goers. Martin's parents both spoke to the . crowd just hours after they sat down with Scott who announced that the . local state attorney, Norman Wolfinger, had recused himself from the . case. In a letter to Scott, Wolfinger said that while he thought he . could fairly oversee any prosecution that develops in the case, his . recusal was aimed at 'toning down the rhetoric and preserving the . integrity of the investigation.' Scott appointed Angela B. Corey, the state attorney for the Jacksonville area, to take over the case. That announcement by the attorney for Martin's parents brought a loud cheer. 'We've still gotta hold everybody accountable until there's an arrest,' attorney Benjamin Crump beckoned the crowd. Sharpton took up an impromptu monetary . collection for Martin's parents. He started it off with a $2,500 pledge . and he was joined by Greg Mathis and Baisden who both pledged $10,000 . each. Former New York Gov. David Paterson also gave $2,000.

Buckets were also passed throughout . the crowd with Sharpton telling them 'Y'all show the world we're gonna . finance our own movement.' There was a brief moment of booing, when Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett addressed the crowd. But U.S. Representative Corrine Brown . quickly quieted it when she told them how Triplett flew to Washington, .

'Hard on the outside, soft on the inside and willing to stick your neck out.' Florida is among 21 states with a ‘Stand Your Ground Law,’ which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat during a fight. The self-defense law helps explain why a neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman has not been arrested in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager. The Florida law lets police officers on the scene decide whether they believe the self-defense claim. In many cases, the officer's defer to making the arrest, letting the courts work out whether the deadly force is justified. In this case, however, police have said they are confident they did the right thing by not charging 28-year-old Zimmerman, a white Hispanic. Martin's family questions Zimmerman's story, and believes if their races were reversed, there is no doubt a black shooter would be jailed, even if he claimed self-defense. ‘They are making it look like Zimmerman is the victim and their son is in the grave,’ said Benjamin Crump, attorney for Martin's parents. ‘It's about equal justice.’ In a statement released Wednesday, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee insisted his officers were ‘prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time,’ including physical evidence that supported Zimmerman's self-defense claim. ‘The Sanford Police Department has conducted a complete and fair investigation of this incident,’ Lee said, adding that it's now up to prosecutors to determine whether to bring charges. Late Wednesday, commissioners in Sanford, a city of 53,000 people outside Orlando that is 57 per cent white and 30 per cent black, voted 3-2 to express ‘no confidence’ in the police chief. -Associated Press .

The biological father, stepmother and paternal grandparents of an American Indian girl at the center of an ongoing custody battle have filed papers to adopt the child in an Oklahoma court. Dusten Brown signed away all custodial rights when his daughter Veronica was born in September 2009. She lived with her adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco from then until 2011, when Brown used his Native American roots to secure custody of the three-year-old. On Monday, he filed court papers to formally adopt the child, a move that could likely complicate the custody dispute. Attorneys for Mr and Mrs Capobianco and for Veronica's biological mother, Christinna Maldonado, said the action defies high court justices who asked South Carolina judges to determine where the girl should live. Bond: Biological father Dusten Brown, pictured here in April 2013, is trying to adopt his own daughter Veronica, 3 . The lawyer for Maldonado, Lori Alvino McGill, said her client hasn't agreed to anyone adopting Veronica other than the Capobianos, whom she chose through an adoption agency. She said she would fight the termination of her parental rights if the planned adoption doesn't go through. 'We believe these frivolous filings in other jurisdictions are designed to further delay the proceedings in the hope that it will make it harder for South Carolina to finalize the (Capobiancos') adoption,' McGill told The Post and Courier. Dusten Brown's Charleston attorney Shannon Jones said her client simply wanted to continue raising his daughter. 'We are just trying to follow the direction and guidance of the majority opinion and let the court decide what is in the child's best interest at this point,' Jones told The Post and Courier. Family: Veronica pictured with her biological father Dusten Brown and his wife Robin who want her to stay with them . Ducks: Veronica, her biological father Dusten Brown, and his wife Robin feed their geese and ducks . Baby Veronica had been adopted at birth by the South Carolina couple, with Matt even cutting the umbilical cord. But Brown, a member of the . Cherokee Nation, claimed the baby's mother . had given the child up without his consent. When . Brown challenged the Capobiancos' adoption, his lawyers cited  the Indian Child Welfare Act, a federal law that gives tribes and . relatives a say in decisions affecting children with Native American . heritage. It was passed in 1978 because of the high . number of Indian children being removed from their homes by public and . private agencies. A South Carolina court . favored his argument that federal law preferred the girl living with him . and growing up learning tribal traditions and the child was handed over to him after a court battle in December 2011. 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . The Supreme Court ruled late last month that the law didn't apply to the dispute the way the South Carolina judge thought it did. The justices said Brown's parental rights could have been terminated because he never had custody of the girl and never supported her. The case was thrown back to the South Carolina Supreme court with the order it be expedited so Veronica's situation could be determined. Veronica 'has been extremely well cared for and loved by her father and has thrived,' the adoption papers state, according to the Post and Courier. Since then the Capobiancos have been fighting to regain custody of their adopted . daughter Veronica and in April they took their fight to the highest court in the land. Happy family: Matt and Melanie Capobianco were in the delivery room when Veronica was born in Oklahoma in September 2009 . In the middle: Veronica Brown, pictured, is in the middle of an ongoing custody dispute . The Capobiancos appealed to the state Supreme Court last July, claiming they had bonded with Veronica and arguing that removing Veronica was detrimental to her development. But . justices sided with Brown, saying in an emotional opinion that, while . the Capobiancos were 'ideal parents,' federal law requires that . custodial preference be given to the child's Native American parent. Meanwhile, Brown claims his daughter no longer even . recognizes the family who raised her for the first two years of her . life. She was handed over to him on New Year's Eve 2011 and he says the bonding process was instantaneous. Brown claims Veronica had started to call him 'Daddy' within minutes of them meeting and a week after moving to his home in Nowata, Oklahoma, she had also started to call his wife Robin Brown 'Mommy'. Sixteen months later, Brown says that he and his wife are 'the only family she has ever known.' 'I know that I'm doing just fine raising my daughter and supporting my wife,' he told Tulsa World. 'I'm always going to be her Daddy, no matter what.' Hopeful: The adoptive parents are hoping to be reunited with the daughter they raised for two years . Brown also revealed that the Capobiancos have sent gifts to Veronica with their photos hidden inside. 'When she finds them,' he said, 'she'll always ask us, ""Who are these people?"" She doesn't remember.' In . January, the Capobiancos claimed that they have had just one phone call . with Veronica since she left in December 2011 and that they told her . they love her. 'We remain hopeful that our daughter . will finally be able to come home and to have a life where she can be . surrounded by everyone who loves her,' they said in a statement. More than a dozen states and 23 current and former members of Congress filed briefs ahead of the earlier supreme court case Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl hearing. In addition, the federal government filed an amicus brief backing the law, as did more than a dozen child welfare organizations.

Law: The Indian Child Welfare Act gives tribes and relatives a say in decisions affecting children with Native American heritage . State courts have been at odds on the law's application.

Native American children. 'Those cases clearly state that unwed fathers do not have an automatic fully protected right to participate in decisions about the child,' Seattle adoption attorney Mark Demaray said earlier this years during a conference call with reporters. Case law aside, Demaray said, the emotional aspects of the case are hard to ignore. 'We often refer to cases like this one before the Supreme Court as a tragic situation we all want to avoid,' Demaray said. 'There's no question this case is tragic for all the families and parties involved in it, particularly for this child, no matter what the outcome.'","Biological father Dusten Brown was able to gain custody of his daughter after invoking Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 .

Documents released for the first time Tuesday from the FBI file on former New York City Mayor Edward Koch detail one of the more obscure chapters of his storied political career: an unsolved plot to paint the then-congressman as a racist by circulating a forged letter, warning the city would become a 'ghost town' if voters elected a black mayor. The documents were posted on an FBI website in response to multiple Freedom of Information Act requests made since Koch died earlier this year at 88. While the letter episode may not be embedded in public memory, 'it's a window onto the period,' Koch's longtime spokesman, George Arzt, said Tuesday. An FBI file on former New York City Mayor Edward Koch (pictured in 2010) details an unsolved plot to paint the then-congressman as a racist . According to the FBI documents, the scheme unfolded in January 1977 in the lead up to a fiercely contested mayor's race that ultimately unseated Mayor Abe Beame. Besides Koch, Democratic candidates also included future Gov. Mario Cuomo, Rep. Bella Abzug, Rep. Herman Badillo and Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, who was black. Numerous local politicians got copies of what looked to be a racially inflammatory letter from Koch to Badillo. The letter claimed Beame's administration had discriminated against Hispanics while allowing 'Black Power groups in the city to run part of his administration.' 'We are now faced with a crisis should the City Administration suddenly, fall in the hands of a Black Mayor,' it said, adding that 'all of my white constituents' would leave the city, 'taking the money with them and New York City will become a ghost city.' Koch and Badillo held a press conference to disavow any connection to the letters — and Koch contacted the FBI, suggesting the missives were retaliation for his efforts to increase scrutiny of drug rehabilitation clinics, particularly a Bronx group called the Hispanic Association for a Drug Free Society, or SERA. Ceremony: Koch gives an award in 1987 to former prison guard Darrell Harris . New York Mayor Ed Koch, left, poses with Yoko Ono, widow of slain musician John Lennon, and her son Sean Lennon, 10, during a dedication ceremony in 1985 for Strawberry Fields, a memorial to Lennon, in Central Park . Koch had written letters urging city agencies to stop subsidizing the group after its director was convicted of conspiring to extort money from building contractors by putting pipe bombs at construction sites, and the city and state cut off their payments to the clinic in spring 1977, according to news reports at the time. Koch told the FBI he'd heard indirectly about death threats directed against him because of his probe of the drug clinics and had previously contacted police and then-U.S. Attorney General Edward Levi about his safety. Koch told FBI agents in late January 1977 that 'he does not have serious reservations as per his personal safety, but he is concerned,' they wrote. FBI agents interviewed a man at the Bronx drug clinic — his name is redacted — who said he didn't know who sent the letters. But he made it colorfully clear that he hated Koch, vowing that, as soon as he was off federal parole, he'd beat the congressman up in public in Washington. Koch talks to the media from his hospital gurney during a news conference at New York Hospital Monday, March 22, 1999. He was hospitalized Monday morning after his blood pressure dropped as he arrived at his health club for his daily workout . 'I hate him. Any enemy of Koch is a friend of mine, no matter what he does. I'm going to beat (him), and I don't care if I go to jail,' the interviewee said, according to FBI notes of the March 1977 interview. Meanwhile, other strange episodes ensued. Two people turned up at Koch's Manhattan congressional office in February 1977, circulating pamphlets calling for his impeachment and accusing him of bigotry and various misdeeds; the FBI approached two men leaving the building with a stack of the fliers, but they wouldn't say who provided them, the files show. The next month, a Koch aide told FBI agents he'd been followed home from Koch's office, recounting a scene that could have been in a spy movie as he sped up the FDR Drive to shake the apparent pursuer. The next day, the aide found bullets near his car, and someone had apparently tried to open its hood during the night, he told authorities.","A forged letter was circulated that made it look like Koch discriminated against blacks .

"By . David Mccormack . PUBLISHED: . 13:25 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:45 EST, 9 July 2013 . Pickup drivers should be on alert after newly released research revealed the top ten most stolen vehicles in the country is dominated by trucks. A popular misconception is that sports cars and luxury vehicles dominate such a list, but research released by the Highway Data Loss Institute shows thieves are most interested in pickups. The research, released Tuesday, covers the period 2010 to 2012 and is based on insurance claims.Pickups accounted for the first five vehicles on the list and the most stolen of all is the Ford F-250 pickup, a heavy-duty version of the top-selling F-150 that is popular with contractors. Popular model: The Ford F-250 Super Duty Power Stroke diesel pickup truck has been named the most popular vehicle to be stolen . On average, 1.2 of every 1,000 insured vehicles are reported stolen in the U.S. in a given year. However the Ford F-250 had a claim frequency of seven per 1,000 insured vehicles, almost six times the average. The F-250 replaces the Cadillac Escalade, which had been the most stolen vehicle for the past six years in a row. The Escalade fell to sixth on the list, a drop attributed partly to the SUV’s improved anti-theft features and partly due to declining sales. The top ten is also dominated by vehicles manufactured by General Motors, with the other two entries being Fords. Theft rates in general are declining, thanks in large part to the spread of ignition immobilizers, which prevent vehicles from being hot-wired and were standard in 89 percent of 2012 models. Formerly the most most stolen vehicle for the past six years, the Escalade fell to sixth on the list, a drop attributed to the SUV's improved anti-theft features and declining sales . The Ford F-250 has replaced the Cadillac Escalade as the favorite target of thieves, the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) reports . The Dodge Journey tops the list for the least-stolen vehicles, which tend to be less popular models . Fewer pickups than cars or SUVs have the feature as standard, which may help explain the higher theft rates for pickups. Pickups and large SUVs are also expensive to buy, so it reasons that thieves would want to chop them up for parts to sell them on the black market. The rankings also don’t distinguish whether or not the entire car was stolen, or if the car was simply broken into. Since it is probably easier to steal something from the bed of a truck this may also go some way to explaining the number of dominance of trucks in the top ten. The best way to defeat car thieves may be simply to buy a vehicle nobody else wants. The HDLI has also compiled a list of the least-stolen vehicles. The Chevrolet Silverado pickup is the second most stolen vehicle with 6.7 per 1,000 insured . This list is dominated by relatively unpopular products or lower-volume luxury models, such as the Audi A4. But there also are some more popular vehicles, like the Honda CR-V, ranked seventh from the bottom, that may benefit from improved anti-theft technologies. For car buyers, it might be tempting to consider a vehicle that’s least likely to be stolen, but it’s worth keeping in mind that thieves probably ignore some cars because they’re not worth much and there may simply be little demand for its parts. Lexus stopped selling the HS 250 because of poor sales. The Dodge Journey and Jeep Compass are weak sellers that will soon be discontinued as well, reports The Exchange. The Audi A4 is another car that features on the list of vehicles rarely stolen .","The five most stolen vehicles in the U.S. are all pickup trucks .

Young children should return to old-fashioned games such as hide-and-seek and hopscotch to beat worries over their body image, a leading expert has claimed. Independent psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos said her research has shown that children as young as five had anxieties over the way they look. She said a return to traditional outdoor games such as tag and rounders would give youngsters more confidence in their own bodies for the future and fulfill the so-called Olympic Legacy. Active play also gives less sporty children the confidence to beat anxieties, she said. Dr Papadopoulos' report, entitled Physical Activity and Body Image, found that play is just as important as sport in getting children to participate in physical activity. It said that children who have body confidence concerns are more likely to be anxious about taking part in formal sports. However, parents who engage their children in regular physical activity, such as active play, from an early age, help them to develop increased self-esteem and emotional resilience. She said both of these are important factors in developing a better body image and making children better able to cope with the external messages about body image - such as advertising campaigns - that they are bombarded with as they grow up. Speaking at the launch of the Make Time 2 Play campaign, organised by the British Toy & Hobby Association, Dr . Papadopoulos added that recent studies had found that a quarter of . seven-year-old girls have tried to lose weight at least once and one third of young boys aged eight to 12 are dieting.

'Youngsters who are active and having fun are more likely to develop a positive outlook on physical activity. 'For those that shy away from sport there are lots of other activities that can get children active without engaging in traditional team sports. 'Building a den, going on a nature trail or treasure hunt or even just playing tag can be great starter activities to get children active before leading on to more gentle sports style activities like rounders or playing with a ball. The key thing is to keep it fun.'

She's managed to enter Tampa's MacDill Airforce base four times since October and has at least one other previous arrest for trespassing on a base . A homeless woman has managed to sneak into a heavily guarded Florida air force base four times since October and records show she’s done it on other bases before. Suzanne M. Jensen was charged last month for trespassing in Tampa’s MacDill Air Force Base for the fourth time where, in various ways, she’s managed to live for up to days at time. Last summer, the 50-year-old was charged with entering Fort Myer in Virginia. And, in 2007, Jensen was charged with two federal trespass counts near North Carolina. This, according to a Tampa Bay Times roundup of the wannabe sergeant’s sneaking around the past few years, this time onto a base even more locked down than many other posts. Since September 11, 2001, security at . American bases has been airtight. And MacDill is an exception, if only . because it takes its security even more seriously because it is home base for . U.S. Special Operations Command and Central Command – two high level . subsets of the U.S. military command. Last . month, Jensen was charged on the four trespassing counts and for . possessing a stolen military identification. The charges stem from . incidents that began October 1, 2012. That’s when a retired Air Force officer was heading to his boat, only to find it was already in use by the homeless woman. As . it sat docked at the MacDill marina, Jensen was holding the boat’s . keys. The perplexed owner, Barney D. Morris, likely wasn’t any less . confused after Jensen’s explanations. ‘Jensen . told him she was with Intelligence Operations and had just come from . the Pentagon, which she claimed had given her permission to board all of . the boats,’ reads Jensen’s arrest affidavit, dated June 26. Jensen then leapt into the water and . swam away. A six-hour search, involving local and base authorities as . well as K9 and air units, ensued to no avail. But when a wet Jensen was spotted at a base restaurant, she was cited and told to leave the base and not return. Stealthy: Despite airtight security, Jensen has been caught on MacDill Air Force Base four times, even staying on it for days on end . Amphibious: During one MacDill break-in, Jensen was found in a retired officer's boat at the base's marina. She told him she was from the Pentagon and allowed to enter 'all the boats' before leaping into the water and swimming away . On November 18, base personnel had a less dramatic, albeit equally, encounter with the slippery Jensen, after she was discovered at the MacDill fitness center. She tried to pass off a stolen ID as her own and then showed base security how she’d gotten into the base this second time. Low tech: By dragging a trash can from a softball field (pictured) near the base's walls, Jensen said she was able to climb into MacDill when she broke in the second. The homeless woman was warned again to leave and not come back . Homeless woman Suzanne Jensen has a knack for breaking into military bases. She's made it into Tampa's MacDill Airforce Base four times, sometimes staying for days and despite airtight security, and has a history with at least one other base. 2007: Jensen was arrested in North Carolina near Fort Bragg. Records for the exact nature of the federal trespassing charges are unavailable and were later dropped. August 2012: Jensen was arrested for trespassing in Virginia's Fort Myer base. She was found guilty and sentenced to time served. October 2012: A retired officer at MacDill found Jensen on his boat in the base's marina. She claimed she was 'with Intelligence Operations' and had permission to 'board all of the boats.' She then leapt in the water and swam away. A 6-hour manhunt ensued. November 2012: Jensen was spotted in the base again and showed security how she'd scaled a wall using a trash can. December 2012: Jensen was found on the base again, hiding behind a vehincle. 'A brief foot chase' ensued. January 2013: The homeless woman was again caught inside the perimeter of the base and again showed security her knack at scaling MacDill's walls. In spite of top-level security and trained military personnel numbering over 10,000, Jensen managed to get in . simply by climbing a wall with a trash can she’d pulled from a softball . field that adjoins the base. Jensen was again warned to go away and not . to come back. Strike three came on December 17, when, according to the Tampa Bay Times, Jensen was found hiding behind a parked car and nabbed ‘after a brief foot chase.’ MacDill officials wouldn’t comment Monday, saying they were working together with federal authorities on the matter. So it is unclear how or why Jensen was again released. But she got a fourth and, it seems, final chance, in January when she was found on the base yet again. According to the arrest affidavit: . ‘For about eight days she had been living inside a boat that was on a trailer parked in the base's family Camp area.’ Jensen said she’d again scaled a wall to enter the base. Jensen has yet to be arrested on the charges. But, . amazingly, her history with stealing into military bases goes back even . further, to 2007 when she was arrested near North Carolina’s Fort Bragg . base on federal trespassing charges. It is unclear if the charges, which were later dropped, stemmed from her actually entering Fort Bragg. It . is clear, though, that in August 2012, Jensen was arrested, charged, . and found guilty of trespassing in Virginia’s Fort Myer base. She was later sentenced to time served. Old habits: Jensen was caught on Virginia's Fort Myer (pictured) earlier in 2012. She was charged, convicted, and sentenced to time-served .

A mother who was due to be released from prison after spending 22 years on death row for brutally killing her son will now face a retrial. Debra Jean Milke's guilty verdict was overturned earlier this year and it appeared in May that she would be free within weeks as prosecutors had not yet filed an appeal. However, on Monday, the State of Arizona declared its intent to retry her for the 1989 murder of four-year-old Christopher - and it plans on using testimony from an allegedly crooked ex-police officer who helped put her behind bars. Retrial: Debra Milke, pictured left, was due to be released from prison after spending 22 years on death row for brutally killing her son Christopher, right, will now face a retrial . The news came just hours after an . ultimatum from a U.S. District Court judge ordering the state to either . release her from prison or announce a retrial, according to azcentral.com. The . Maricopa County Attorney's Office will try to put Milke, 49, her back on . death row in the trial, which hasn't been scheduled. Her . conviction was thrown out earlier this year by the 9th U.S. Circuit . Court of Appeals because of a tainted confession supposedly obtained by . Phoenix police officer Armando Saldate who has a long history of lying . under oath. In the . original trial it was Milke's word against the officer's and Milke was . convicted despite there being no recording and no witness to the . confession that Milke said was never made. Milke's . lawyer said that he will attempt to secure bond for the woman after she . is transferred from state prison to the Maricopa County Jail. Known as Death Row Debbie, Milke was found guilty in . 1989 for the gruesome slaying of her young  son Christopher who was . shot three times in the back of the head and dumped in the desert. Ready for release: Debra Jean Milke, left, had her murder conviction overturned after spending more than 20 years on death row for the killing of her 4-year-old son, Christopher, right, in December 1989 . But this year US Circuit Court of Appeals judge agreed with her lawyers who ruled the conviction had been due in part because of Saldate's misconduct. Milke's conviction was overturned on . March 14th allowing prosecutors to launch an appeal to hold a retrial . within 30 days. No application had been filed until now. The case made national headlines due to the brazen and disturbing nature of the crime. Prosecutors . said in December 1989, Milke dressed up her son Christopher in his . favorite outfit and told him he was going to see Santa Claus at a . Phoenix mall during the holidays. Instead, . he was taken into a ravine in the desert by her boyfriend, Roger Scott . and another man called Styers and shot three times in the back of the . head as part of what prosecutors said was a plot by Milke and the two . other defendants to collect a $50,000 life insurance policy. Milke, . who was not present at the crime, was convicted in 1990 of murder, . conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on the strength . of testimony by Saldate, who said she confessed to the crimes. Spared: Milke would have been the first woman executed in Arizona since the 1930s had her appeals run out . The detective testified that Milke . told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with . Christopher and had complained to Styers about her son. Styers . was hardly an ideal babysitter. He had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . stemming in large part from an incident during the war when he shot and . killed a young Vietnamese boy who had climbed onto a truck transporting . Styers and other Marines in Vietnam, according to court documents. In . his 1985 personal journal, now part of court records, Styers wrote: . 'Losing sleep because of dreams in Viet-Nam [sic] Seeing kids including . my own and wondering if I'm going to do something to hurt them, and . remembering the ones I had to kill.' With Christopher in the car, Styers picked up his good friend Roger Scott. The . two men did not take Christopher to see Santa. Instead, they drove . Christopher into the desert, where Styers emptied three bullets into the . boy's head.The Phoenix police department's star . interrogator, Detective Saldate, was called in on his day off to . separately question the three. Milke was convicted in 1990 of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping in a plot to collect a $50,000 life insurance policy . In a matter of hours, Saldate had secured a speedy resolution to the horrific high-profile holiday crime.The detective said she confessed to conspiring to the murder, although she protested her innocence and denied the claim. The three suspects were tried separately, convicted, and sentenced to die. Milke would have been the first woman executed in Arizona since the 1930s had her appeals run out. The Arizona Supreme Court had gone so far to issue a death warrant for Milke in 1997, but the execution was delayed because she had yet to exhaust federal appeals. During her original trial, the prosecution failed to disclose information about a history of misconduct by Saldate. That record included multiple court rulings in four other cases that Saldate either lied under oath or violated suspects' Miranda rights during interrogations. Prosecutors are required to provide a defendant's lawyers with material that might support a not-guilty verdict, including material that could undermine the credibility of a prosecution witness. There was no other witness or recording of the purported confession by Milke, who has proclaimed her innocence. In court proceedings and press . interviews, Milke professed her innocence, claiming Saldate had a . history of lying under oath and had fabricated her confession. The . trial amounted to 'a swearing contest' in which the judge and jury . ultimately believed the detective over Milke, but they didn't know of . his record of dishonesty and misconduct. The . ruling reversed a US District Court judge's ruling and ordered the . lower court to require Arizona authorities to turn over all relevant . personnel records for the detective. In . 2009, defense attorney Michael Kimerer said his client maintains her . innocence and was a loving mother who still grieves her son's death. 'Our main concern is the fact that I have . a client that never confessed and a police detective who said she gave a . confession,' Kimerer said then. 'There was no tape recorder, no . witnesses, nothing. Just his word.' Key witness: Milke, left, was found guilty on the strength of testimony by a Phoenix police detective, who said the mother told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with Christopher, right . In March the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Milke's conviction in what Chief Judge Alex Kozinski dubbed a 'troubling case.' He called into question what he said was Saldate's possible 'misogynistic' attitude towards vulnerable civilian women over whom he had power and noted Saldate had a documented history of lying under oath. Kozinski's blistering 60-page opinion and other court records shed light on the alleged police corruption, prosecutorial overreach and judicial carelessness that fused into a miscarriage of justice that might have sentenced an innocent woman to death. Milke testified she didn't know Christopher had died until Saldate informed her of his death in an interrogation room. She said she was 'in shock' and 'reeling' but the detective moved close to her and put his hands on her knees. She told the jury she hadn't understood her Miranda rights and had asked for a lawyer, but instead Saldate continued interrogating her and twisted her words into a fake confession. 'She was one of the worst witnesses I've ever seen,' recalled Phoenix journalist Paul Rubin, who covered the trial. Although he destroyed his notes of the interview and failed to tape record it, Saldate testified that Milke confessed she worried that Christopher would grow up to be just like his father, a substance-abusing ex-con. That's why she 'wanted God to take care of Christopher,' Saldate testified. After Milke was convicted, her defense investigators spent 7,000 hours poring over court records. They discovered eight separate cases in which judges determined that Saldate either had lied under oath or violated the constitutional rights of people he interrogated. But Hendrix, the judge, still decided that Saldate was more credible than Milke . Court records indicate that neither Styers nor Scott would testify against Milke. In overturning Milke's conviction, the appellate court didn't find her innocent. 'Milke may well be guilty, even if Saldate made up her confession out of whole cloth,' Kozinski wrote. 'After all, it's hard to understand what reason Styers and Scott would have had for killing a four-year-old boy. Then again, what reason would they have to protect her if they knew she was guilty?' Milke, now 49, was jailed the day after Christopher's death. She is one of three women on death row in Arizona and has been behind bars for 25 years and on death row for 22 years. The two men convicted in the Milke's case, Roger Scott and former Milke roommate James Styers, are also both on death row. Scott confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy's body.","'Death Row Debbie's' conviction was overturned in March after it was found to be in part due to a detective lying under oath .

The Yorkshireman said: ‘On a  Friday night, in the pub, you’ll find yourself in a urinal. So try to hit the wall from 2ft. ‘If you can’t, go to the doctor. There may be no pain or discomfort. There may be no symptoms. ‘But get checked immediately.’ Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Britain with over 40,000 new cases a year.

All that concerns me now is for men around . the country to stop and take notice of any symptoms that might save . their lives. ‘I’m not a softy. If you show the . symptoms of this dreadful disease, get help. Cancer is very real. But it . is something you can only beat down if you stare it in the face.

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 16:15 EST, 7 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:28 EST, 8 July 2013 . One person has died and three others have become ill after contracting the so-called 'flesh-eating' bacteria the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. The person who died was an 83-year-old Terrebonne Parish man, who was infected when an open wound on his body came into contact with sea water while he was fishing in a boat. Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally-occurring bacteria in warm sea water that belongs to the same family of bacterium as cholera and requires salt to live. Southern waters: Water is routinely tested in Grand Isle and other areas in Louisiana to ensure safety for swimmers . According to the Center for Disease Control the bacteria can also be contracted from eating contaminated raw seafood. The effects of the bacteria can be deadly. When open wounds on otherwise healthy people are exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria, the skin can become infected, leading to a breakdown and ulceration of the skin. Immunocompromised people face a deadlier risk: they have a higher possibility of the bacteria invading the bloodstream, leading to potentially fatal complications. Contamination: Raw seafood, especially oysters, is a source of Vibrio Vulnificus . If the bacteria is ingested, healthy people can experience vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. For people with weaker immune systems, consuming Vibrio vulnificus can infect the bloodstream, leading to 'a severe and life-threatening illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions,' according to the CDC. Bloodstream infections by the bacteria are fatal about 50 per cent of the time. Patients are treated with antibiotics, and according to the CDC, infected wounds must be treated aggressively - sometimes meaning amputation of an infected limb. High bacteria area: The warm waters around the Louisiana Gulf are prime areas for Vibrio Vulcanificus . Safety: Most swimmers are not at risk from the bacteria if they exercise precaution and avoid warm, brackish waters where the bacteria thrives . The four cases this summer have prompted the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals to warn residents to be careful about swimming with open wounds or infections, and avoid certain areas around the Gulf. 'We know people are venturing into our state’s waterways to cool off this summer, so we advise them to be careful and exercise health precautions,' Department of Health and Hospitals Secretary Kathy Kliebert said in a news release. According to The Town Talk, Louisiana routinely tests its beaches' water, and posts advisories on 25 Louisiana beaches if the bacteria levels become high. These recommendations are particularly important for those with compromised immune systems: .","Vibrio vulcanificus has claimed the life of one 83-year-old man and infected three others .

The widespread closure of public toilet closures could be putting lives at risk, health experts have warned. Campaigners say being desperate to go to the toilet can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Four out of 10 public toilets have closed in the past decade and in Glasgow just eight public toilets remain open. Health experts say the closure of public toilets has increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes . Health experts say the situation is so bad it is 'leaving people prisoners in their own homes'. Dr Clare Walton, of the Stroke Association, said: 'There is no research to suggest that holding a full bladder can directly increase your risk of stroke. 'However, not being able to empty your bladder could potentially cause a temporary increase in blood pressure which could put some individuals at risk of stroke.' The Welsh Assembly was warned by . health experts that full bladders could 'cause a stroke or heart attack' for old, ill and vulnerable people. Carlisle City Council has halved its public toilets from 14 to seven in just five years, according to Freedom of Information request figures. Newcastle City Council currently maintains 11 public toilets after closing five in 2008. Renfrewshire Council have . closed five, leaving just a solitary toilet open, and in the Scottish . Borders, eight out of 50 have shut their doors. Stirling . has been left with 16 after a dozen throughout the council area were . shut in the past two years. Association managing director Raymond Martin said: 'This is a health problem, not just a financial one. 'These cuts affect the health of the nation, with the elderly and disabled really hit hard. 'It's a major worry with many people feeling they are becoming prisoners in their own home. 'Not being able to go causes all sorts of medical problems, from raised blood pressure and bladder issues to infections.' Four in 10 public toilets have closed in the past decade. (File picture of City of Westminster public toilets) Budgets for public toilet provision in some authorities have been drastically reduced. Of the Scots councils that supplied figures, the overall cut was more than 21 per cent. Tourists visiting Lancaster have also seen a dramatic fall in the number of public loos. A total of 16 toilets have been shut since January 2008. Areas of the Lake District have also seen a decline and Allerdale Borough Council, which includes the town of Keswick, has shut six toilets. Mr Martin said: 'Making savings from toilets seems like the easy option for councils. 'But there's a desperate need to have toilets that are available, clean and hygienic.' A meeting with the Older People's Commissioner for Wales was held by the BTA this week. Such is the concern, the BTA has been asked to compile an up-to-date 'toilet map' of the UK by disability organisations. Work is also being done with Age UK and Tourism for All with more 'community toilets', part-funded by locals increasingly being viewed as a way forward. Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's Charity Director General, said: 'Public toilets are vital to many older people, enabling them to get out and about to access essential services. 'Worrying about being caught short or facing the indignity of having an accident in public can have a devastating impact on people in later life, resulting in many feeling increasingly stuck at home and cut off from the rest of society.'","Four out of 10 public toilets have closed in the past 10 years, figures say .

One in five people leave it until there is something 'seriously wrong' and more than half never, or very rarely, visit their GP for a check-up. Of the 2,000 adults polled, men wait an average of 12 months and 27 days before getting apparently minor ailments checked out, and women wait 11 months and 12 days. The average Briton endures a medical complaint for a year before seeing their doctor - men wait an average of 12 months and 27 days, and women wait 11 months and 12 days . The research also showed the average Briton suffers with eight troublesome conditions a year - from stomach bugs and colds to headaches and back pain. Worryingly, the study revealed people don't start taking their health seriously until they are in their thirties. Only 14 per cent thought those aged 20 to 27 need to pay proper attention to their health and well-being. The poll, which was commissioned by the Spire . Bristol Hospital,  found that 30 per cent of us claim to have at least one problem, injury or undiagnosed source of pain at any one time. And a quarter admitted suffering with regular headaches. Four in ten said they suffer with back pain and two per cent said they experience fainting. Rob Anderson, of Spire Healthcare, said: ‘Regular headaches and fainting can be warning signs of . something serious, so anyone suffering should talk to a healthcare . professional directly. A quarter of people admit to suffering from regular headaches but few have seen their doctor about the problem . ‘Things . like back pain are extremely common, but there are simple things your . doctor can advise you about to ease and eliminate discomfort. ‘As the old saying goes, it's much better to be safe than sorry.’ He added that millions of .

You will go to the ball: Isabelle prepares for the prom at her school with her new prosthetic leg . When Isabelle Papandronicou took the agonising decision to have a leg amputated, the teenager was determined to lead a normal life. But there was one ambition that the 15-year-old’s new limb seemed destined to thwart. Isabelle had her heart set on dressing up and attending her school prom. However, her NHS prosthetic leg made dancing difficult and wearing high heels impossible. Then she heard about an artificial leg designed to fit heeled shoes – and her parents Lisa and Sotiris began a fundraising campaign to buy her one in time for the prom. The £5,600 leg meant Isabelle was able to attend the leavers’ ball at East Barnet School in North London last week wearing sparkly silver 3.5in heels and a flowing red dress – and could enjoy dancing with her friends. ‘Everyone was so surprised at how real it looked,’ she said. ‘Going to the prom was brilliant, it felt great to go all glammed up and look girlie because at parties everyone can normally wear heels but I have to wear flat shoes. ‘The whole thing was just completely new to me. I have never worn heels before. ‘Dancing was much easier with a heeled foot because with a flat  one you don’t have the right sort  of balance. ‘The only problem I had was  with my other leg, as my foot started to ache.’ Isabelle was 18 months old when she was diagnosed with a rare congenital disease that caused her right shinbone to be weak and fracture. Night on the tiles: Isabelle Papandronicou with her friends on the way to the prom at their school . Years of operations failed to cure the condition, which meant her right leg was 3in shorter than the left. Twelve months ago, she decided to have the leg amputated below the knee and was fitted with a conventional NHS prosthetic limb with a foot position that limited her to wearing flat shoes. ‘Before the amputation I was wearing a metal leg frame constantly and had to tighten pins to make [my leg] grow,’ said Isabelle. ‘I could only wear skirts or  shorts and I couldn’t even wear a pair of jeans.

Determined: Isabelle Papandronicou attaches her prosthetic leg (left) and without it (right) Experts took a cast of her left calf so they could sculpt the acrylic leg to look as natural as possible, and even colour-matched the silicone coating to her skin. Paul Neve, a prosthetist at the clinic, said: ‘It looks unbelievably real and that was one of the main things Isabelle wanted as well as having the chance to wear a heel. ‘Heeled prosthetic legs can be designed to be at a range of heights and myself and Isabelle worked out the most suitable height for her.’ Mrs Papandronicou said: ‘The high-heeled leg is absolutely amazing. Isabelle can now go shopping for the shoes she wants to wear, not what she has to wear. ‘It’s so nice that she can now wear pretty shoes, she looked absolutely stunning at her prom and it has given her a real confidence boost.’","Isabelle had her heart set on dressing up and attending her school prom .

Watching while anthropologists painstakingly work to uncover the makeshift graves of their loved ones, this is a stark reminder of the horrific genocide from which they so desperately fled almost two decades on from the country's civil war. With pain etched all over their faces, this is the first opportunity the Mayan Indians of Guatemala have had to say a proper goodbye to thousands of relatives killed 17 years after the bloodshed stopped. Forensic experts are now exhuming bodies from the cemeteries that the Ixil Mayan people created to bury loved ones who died of starvation, hypothermia and disease - as well as those directly killed by the war - while they hid from the soldiers in the mountains. Largely ignored by authorities for centuries, the Ixil have come under the spotlight in recent months after a Guatemalan court found former dictator Efrain Rios Montt guilty of genocide in May for the scorched-earth policies used against the Mayans during his 17 months in power in the 1980s. Poignant: The remains of an unidentified Ixil Mayan is unearthed from a mass grave by forensic anthropologists during an exhumation of villagers who died during the Guatemala's civil war . Makeshift resting place: Ixil Mayan women gather around a mass grave where the remains of their loved ones have been exhumed . Tragic: Jacinta Cruz sheds a tear as her mother's remains are exhumed from a clandestine grave near Ixtupil, Guatemala . Searching for loved ones: Andres Lopez Sanchez helps forensic anthropologists in the exhumation of a clandestine grave . That conviction was quashed 10 days later following a trial that did nothing to change their lives of the Ixil people. And now feels like the right time for many of the Ixil to tell their story and to help locate the bodies of their relatives. Almost 20 years on, the Ixil still live in mud-and-wood houses in the most rugged and isolated parts of northwestern Guatemala. Most of them have no drinking water, paved roads or basic services such as health and education. Byron Garcia, a social anthropologist who has worked in the area for a decade, said Ixil Mayans live in the same poverty as always. He said: 'People have been relegated to less productive places, places where you can't grow food, to the mountains made of stone. 'The young people who can, sow plots of land. And when they can't, they migrate.' Grim: A forensic anthropologist exhumes the remains of nine-year-old Ixil Mayan Diego Juanito Chavez from a mass grave . Giving guidance: Mayan women help a team of anthropologists to find a mass grave in Guatemala . Horrific history: A group of Mayan men, women and even children gather around as an extensive search is carried out for some of the thousands killed during the civil war which ended 17 years ago . Exhumation: The Mayans hid in the mountains from soldiers during the war and buried many of their dead in mass graves. Many of the dead died from starvation, hypothermia or disease . Feliciana Cobo was 8 when soldiers attacked her village. She and her family separated and ran into the mountains, where they hid for several days with nothing to eat. Cobo said her mother was killed when the army bombed the village and surrounding area, and her grandmother died later after growing sick from the cold and bad living conditions. Her family eventually lost their land and their poverty deepened. Now a single mother of three children, the 40-year-old Cobo borrows electricity from a neighbor and supports her kids by washing the clothes of neighbors and weaving garments to sell. 'I grew up during the civil war and I don't know how to read or write. I didn't go to school. All I know is to weave.' Hunt: Anthropologist Edgar Hernandez shows his left hand with the names of surrounding villages written by children, before the start of an exhumation of a clandestine grave near Ixtupil, Guatemala . Forlorn: Ixil Mayans make their way home after watching the exhumation of a clandestine grave . Forgotten culture: Ixil Mayan women perform a traditional dance called 'Sarabanda' in Nebaj, Guatemala . Cobo helped exhume her mother and said that she feels that revisiting the graves proves that they are not 'inventing the dead.' She said: 'I helped exhume my mother. I don't know if it was the smoke or the impact of the bombs planes were dropping on us but we all left running and when we got back together, my mother had already died.' She added that she doubts justice will . be done, but is glad some fellow Ixil Mayans could travel to Guatemala . City to tell their stories at the trial. Mr Garcia, who now lives in the Guatemalan capital, said that victims feel a need to tell their stories, to be heard, to be indemnified, to find the bodies of their loved ones and be able to bury them. Way of life: Ixil Mayan women take part in a procession honoring their patron saint, Virgin of the Immaculate Conception in Nebaj . Religious: A woman prays in front of a Jesus of Nazareth guardian statue, dressed as a Ixil Mayan elder, inside a church in Cotzal .

In the time-lapse video, Ms Stephens is seen dumping out crate after crate of Lego blocks and sorting through them as she builds, fits and tests her own prosthetic leg. Caring: Christina has launched a Facebook page where she shares videos, resources and healthcare information for other amputees and caregivers . The final piece: Christina attaches the foot and ankle that she has built . Feeling pleased with herself: Finally the leg is complete and Christina is surely worthy of the title of LEGO 'Masterbuilder' The moment of truth: After two days, Christina completes building her leg and gingerly tests whether it will take her weight . Whoops! The ankle and foot do have a tendency to snap off now and again! Nothing afoot here: The foot can easily be reattached with minimal effort . Passion for engineering: Christina lost her leg when she was fixing a car and it crushed it but she still loves getting her toolbox or box of LEGOs out! Near the end of video – which runs just under six minutes – she stands up on her multi-coloured prosthesis and cautiously steps on it a few times. The film which is set to music is sped up in order to condense the two day building blitz into just under six minutes. She says that it only took about two hours to fit the LEGO limb to her leg. The video has received nearly 325,000 views on YouTube. She has also launched a Facebook page where she shares videos, resources and healthcare information for other amputees and caregivers. She says although the leg is colorful and comfortable, it's not completely practical. The ankle and foot tend occasionally snap off, but all it takes is a click to put it back together. As a result, she can walk for only short distances on it. Christina warns her viewers that the Lego prosthetic is not actually meant to be used. 'Please don’t do this yourself. I don’t want you to fall and get hurt!' she said. 'Sometimes you just need to be silly.' Side by side: Christina says the LEGO leg isn't particularly practical or comfortable but is proud she accepted the challenge . Ms Stephens says she is planning 'Lego Leg 2.0,' on which the ankle and foot will be far more functional. Either way, there's no doubt her positive outlook on life ensured that her creativity prospers. 'I like having this extra space below my stump that other people don’t have that I can explore,' Stephens said. 'It makes me feel superhuman.","Time-lapse video shows how amputee builds a prosthetic leg in two days .

She has watched her friends grow into young women but Laxmi Yadev has not changed since the age of five. Now 20 years old, Laxmi is still only three feet three inches tall, weighs just three stone and wears clothes meant for six-year-old children. A rare genetic disorder meant Laxmi stopped growing 15 years ago and she is resigned to living the rest of her life as a woman trapped in a child's body. Genetic disorder: Laxmi Yadev, aged 20, stopped growing 15 years ago and weighs just 3 stone . Trapped: Laxmi, pictured right trying on adults' shoes and left with her younger sister Suman, admits thinking about the life she could have had makes her 'sad' Laxmi has endured years of bullying and stares but she says the hardest thing to come to terms with is the future she has been denied by her condition. She knows she will never have children and therefore she does not see the point in marrying. She admits she is also scared of trusting a man and fears being disowned in the marriage. Laxmi, from Gurgoan, outside of New Delhi, told The Sunday People: 'I sometimes think about the normal life I could have had and it makes me sad. 'I'd have fun and independence and enjoy a life I see other girls having.' Years of taunts and fears about being kidnapped have left Laxmi too scared to go out alone but she says she is able to cope with her disorder through the support of her family. Her mother, Parvati, 52, buys her clothes to save her the embarrassment of shopping in the children's section. Her brother Azad suffers from the same condition but her gone on to forge a career as a teacher and believes bullies have made him work . even harder to achieve his goals. Her youngster sister Suman, 15, who is normal height, chaperones Laxmi outside and helps 'motivate' her. Support: Laxmi said Suman (left) and brother Azad (front right), who suffers from the same condition, are her best friends and she is motivated by her father Bahadur Singh and mother Parvati Devi (back row) Laxmi said: 'I hate meeting new people as it hurts getting stared at and bullied every time.' But she says by following the lead of Azad and with the support of her father Bahadur and her mother, she is facing her fears and starting a job in a shop. Laxmi said: 'I'm scared but I'm tough and I'll overcome my fears to do this.' The money will be crucial for her family, who rely on the 8,000 rupees (£88) a month he earns as a security guard. The family's small income has already had tragic consequences. They could not afford the money needed for human growth hormone for Laxmi and Azad. Their condition could have been improved had they received it before the age of 16 or 17. Doctors say some treatments are still available but they are significantly more effective when given early. However, despite her difficulties, Laxmi has thrived in her studies. She graduated from high school with top marks and now wants to start a computer course at college.","Rare genetic disorder stopped Laxmi Yadev growing when she was five .

As 12 million British hayfever sufferers struggle with the worst season for years, they are turning to private clinics for a 'wonder-cure' jab the NHS no longer offers because it is too 'toxic'. Internet forums have been swamped by people fuming at not being able to get the injections from their GPs. For many years, kenalog jabs were prescribed to those with the most severe symptoms, but they were withdrawn when it was realised they left patients at greater risk from contagious illnesses. Suffering: People with hayfever are turning to private clinics who inject patients with a powerful drug which the NHS has rejected as 'toxic' The injection contains the drug . triamcinolone, a corticosteroid that suppresses the body's immune system . to prevent allergic reactions to pollen. But it leaves the body open to infections such as chicken pox and measles, for three weeks after being administered. Other potential side effects include bone . pain, easy bruising and bleeding, severe stomach and abdominal pain, . shortness of breath and irregular heartbeats. The 50mg or 100mg doses are 10 or 20 times stronger than the oral steroid tablets now offered on the NHS. In tablet form the steroid can be regulated for its effect on the body. Keeping the pollen at bay: A sufferer wears a mask in a field of rape seed. Jabs have been withdrawn by GPs . By suppressing the immune system, kenalog also leaves people unable to cope with serious illness or the trauma caused by an accident or sudden shock, for example being in a car crash. Many of those posting on the internet believe the kenalog jabs have been withdrawn as a cost-cutting measure, but doctors fear the public simply does not realise how harmful this powerful drug can be. Desperate: There are 12 million people with hayfever in Britain who are suffering in the worst season for years . Dr James Cave, who  edits the Drugs . And Therapeutic Bulletin, said: 'Let's be clear, it's incredibly . effective but just as you can light a barbecue with petrol, you can . treat hayfever with kenalog, and I seriously suggest you don't because . of the dangers associated with it. 'Kenalog does not have a place in treating hayfever, due to its significant side effects. 'For . three weeks after having the injection your immune system is . suppressed, which means you are seriously at risk of infections like . chicken pox and measles. 'Likewise . if you have a serious illness or a road traffic accident, you may not . be able to cope with the stress, with kenalog suppressing your own . stress reactions.' Dr Cave said oral steroid tablets when . needed, combined with daily antihistamine tablets, nasal sprays and eye . drops, work for most sufferers. This combination could be needed during the heatwave forecast for the rest of July. Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP from Glasgow, added: 'This is not a drug that is suitable for hayfever, because its side effects outweigh dramatically any possible benefits. 'You can get the benefits in far less toxic ways.' Beverley Adams-Groom, from the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit, warned that the pollen count will return to 'very high' for the next two weeks. She said: 'The good news is that the better the weather during the main flowering season, the shorter the season will be, as the grasses become exhausted of pollen under continuing favourable conditions. 'The bad news is that very high counts mean greater symptoms for sufferers and a higher number of people are affected. 'We are now about halfway through the main grass pollen season. 'Fine weather forecast for much of July in the South means that the season should be over before the end of the month. 'In the northern regions, the weather outlook is not so good and this will extend the season a little into August, although there will be a mixture of risk over that time period.'","Twelve million people suffering in the worst season for years .

The doctors treating Secretary of State John Kerry's wife have ruled out a brain tumor or a stroke but are still unable to determine what caused her seizure-like symptoms. Teresa Heinz, John Kerry's 74-year-old wife, was rushed to the local hospital on Sunday when she had the mysterious health incident during a vacation at their family's vacation home on Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts. After stabilizing her condition, she was flown by private jet to Boston where the experts at Massachusetts General Hospital have not yet been able to determine the root problem. By Tuesday afternoon, they have added heart attack to the list of possible explanations that they ruled out. 'As evaluations continue, she, Secretary of State John Kerry, and their family are deeply grateful that physicians have ruled out a variety of possible triggers or other ailments, including heart attack, stroke, or a brain tumor,' Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson said in a statement.

The Washington Post's gossip column, Reliable Sources, says that she has been telling friends that she is very proud of him for the work he is doing as the nation's top diplomat.

The high school teacher whose baby was allegedly fathered by one of her students has been charged with 41 counts of sex and oral copulation with a minor. Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, from Redlands, California, was arrested last week after the mother of the boy - now 17 - reported their alleged year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police. The Citrus Valley High student  is believed to have been present at the birth. She met him while acting as his adviser at the school. Since then, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst. The charges filed yesterday by the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s office reflect the alleged relationships with the three teen students. Whitehurst is charged with 30 counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, and 11 counts of oral copulation of a person under 18. If convicted, she faces up to 29 years in prison. Her bail was increased from $25,000 to $750,000 in light of the recent allegations. She told investigators she and the father of her child began having sex at her apartment after a Disneyland trip in 2012. Another victim was a 14-year-old freshman during the time of their alleged relationship. 'The victim, now 20, told police that he and Whitehurst had sex in her classroom before school, as well as at her apartment and in her car,' a police news release stated. The latest victim to come forward said . he was 16 when he had sex with Whitehurst when she was his English . teacher at Redlands High School. With child: Whitehurst, 28, gave birth to a baby last month who was allegedly fathered by a student, aged 16 . The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as . 22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about . their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of . kissing him during a school field trip. 'I didn't have anything to say . really,' he said. 'I was like, ""Oh really, that's crazy,"" and a couple . of days later, we ended up actually kissing.' He . said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and . he spent the night. They . continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as . if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they . both knew what was going to happen, he said. 'When . it happens, you're kind of like, . all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is . into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was. 'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not . scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a . good time when it was going on.' 'Former flame': Michael Cooper, now 22, said he had sex with the teacher when he was just 16. He said that she told him she had dreamed about kissing him and they later had sex at her home . 'Lovers': Images show Cooper, then 16, and Whitehurst, then 23, at the time of their 'relationship' in 2007 . But . in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and . calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They . eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said. He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship. Cooper . has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to . press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to . encourage other victims to come forward. Whitehurst said that they had a . relationship 'but not to that extent', Redlands police Detective Natasha . Crawford said during a phone interview. According to the Redlands Police . Department, Whitehurst's underage lover - with whom she had a child - was 16-years-old during their . year-long relationship, which allegedly started last summer. 'Bad teacher': Whitehurst, left in a yearbook picture, allegedly had sex with three teenage students . The . mother of the alleged victim, who is now 17, became . aware of the affair between her son and his teacher and notified the . Redlands United School District, which in turn contacted police. Whitehurst gave birth to a child June 18, and police say her former student is the father. Since her arrest last week, Whitehurst had been placed on administrative leave. ‘Nothing is as important to us as the safety of our students and the District takes this arrest very seriously. 'We are fully cooperating with police in their investigation of this matter,’ Assistant School Superintendent Sabine Robertson-Phillips said.

Wanted for amassing a collection of photos and images numbering in the hundreds and suspected in a sex attack last year, authorities had Stanley Simms in their grasp, even questioning him while searching his home.But Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL, simply walked away after cops searched his home, according to reports. Not seen since June 7, the day police seized his pornography-rich computer, he is also considered a suspect in a sexual assault investigation dating back to last year, officials said.“We want to get him off the streets,” Jim Marshall, spokesman at the FBI’s Miami division, told local media. On the run: The FBI is asking for the public's help in finding accused pedophile Stanley Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL . The computer found by law enforcement during a June 7 search of Simms’ home held over 200 child pornography files, according to the Sun-Sentinal. It was originally found sharing both movies and pictures on a file-sharing network in September, the paper reported.Simms told investigators the files were downloaded by accident during a June 7 search of his home, according to the paper, which also reported the officials declined to comment this week on why Simms was allowed to leave his home later that afternoon without being arrested – despite a federal warrant being issued for his arrest that day. Federal officials also have questions for the accused pedophile about an incident in which a south Florida woman was allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted in December, the Miami Herald reported.Known to frequent ‘adult entertainment clubs’ in south Florida, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Simms is said to drive a green/gray BMW and/or a purple pickup truck.

A family escaped being hurt after a runaway car ploughed into their sitting room seconds after they left the room to go and inspect the father's DIY in a bedroom. Dylan Harries, wife Jody, and his stepchildren Sam, 19, and Hannah, 15, had just nipped upstairs to admire Mr Harries' work when the Citroen C4 smashed into their house in Penarth, south Wales. The car took out the front wall of the house in a quiet residential street, shattering the windows and television and leaving the room littered with broken glass and splintered wood. The Harries family had left the sitting room just before a car ploughed into the house in Penarth, south Wales . Wreckage: The wall, windows, television, DVD player and ornaments were all smashed in the accident . Mr Harries, 31, a painter and decorator, said: 'I can't bear to think about what might have happened.' He said it sounded 'like a bomb exploding' when the accident happened at 11.45pm on Saturday night. The family ran outside and watched as the driver of the car attempted to reverse out of the wreckage of the house. Mr Harries said they saw a man from the back seat collapse out of the car, and a woman in the front passenger seat. A doctor eating at a restaurant over the road saw what had happened and ran over to help the man from the back seat until an ambulance arrived. Mr Harries said: 'Our whole home is a complete disaster.  Everything has been ruined and there is rubble everywhere.

The manager at disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen’s store in Savannah, Georgia has blamed the fallen star’s recent troubles after she was recently busted by the cops. Kristina Noelle Hoppe, 33, has been charged with battery after police were called to break-up a fight between her and live-in lover Dennis Maher on June 29. According to a police report, Hoppe and Maher, 38, had both been drinking when they started to argue over money. Kristina Noelle Hoppe, left, is the general manager at Paul Deen's store in Savannah and has been charged with battery after a drunken altercation with her boyfriend . A source told the National Enquirer that Hoppe, right, had been distraught over the accusations that Deen had used a racial slur which had led to her losing millions in sponsorships deals . A source told the National Enquirer that Hoppe had been distraught over accusations that Deen had used a racial slur which resulted in her losing millions in sponsorships deals with brands including Target and Walmart. ‘Kristina adores Paula, so she flipped out when her idol began losing everything due to racial slurs,’ a source told The National Enquirer. ‘She was crying and saying no one understands Paula, and they are going to ruin her life.’ In the police report Maher alleges that the incident became physical when Hoppe started hitting and he grabbed her wrist to stop her. According to the police report, Paula Deen store manager Hoppe, circled, and boyfriend Maher had both been drinking when they started to argue over money . He alleges that he then pushed her away and that she threw a flower pot at him. Maher was left with scatches on his neck and face and his shirt was ripped. Hoppe has admitted to throwing the flower pot, according to the police report. MailOnline spoke with Hoppe, but she wasn’t prepared to comment on the incident. The Paula Deen Store is located next door to the chef’s 'Lady & Sons' restaurant in Savannah and sells a wide variety of goods branded with Paula Dean’s image and catchphrases like ‘Y’all’ along with autographed cookbooks. Deen's has endured a turbulent time of it since the public disclosure of a legal deposition last month in which she admitted under oath to having used the N-word. Last week Deen announced that she has cut business ties with the agent who . had helped to make her a Food Network star and launched a media and merchandising empire . that has largely crumbled in the wake of her admission. Located next door to her 'Lady & Sons' restaurant, The Paula Deen Store sells a wide variety of goods branded with 'Y'all' along with autographed cookbooks . Deen had worked with New York agent Barry Weiner for more than a decade. She . has said he was instrumental in getting her show 'Paula's Home Cooking' on the . Food Network in 2002. She gave no reason for her parting with Weiner in a . prepared statement. 'Paula Deen has separated from her agent,' Deen's spokeswoman, Elana Weiss, . said in an email. 'She and her family thank him for the tireless effort . and dedication over the many years.' The Food Network passed on renewing Deen's contract and yanked her shows off . the air. Smithfield Foods, the pork producer that paid Deen as a celebrity . endorser, dropped her soon after. Retailers including Wal-Mart and Target said . they'll no longer sell Deen's products and publisher Ballantine scuttled plans . for her upcoming cookbook even though it was the No. 1 seller on Amazon. Even . the diabetes drug company that made the much-criticized deal to hire Deen as a . paid spokeswoman dumped her. Weiner worked to turn Deen into a comfort-food queen since she was little . more than a Savannah restaurant owner and self-publisher of cookbooks who earned . raves for her fried chicken. Better times: Paula Deen rose to stardom with her home cooking and charismatic southern personality . In her book 'Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin,' Deen recalled . meeting Weiner through TV producer Gordon Elliott, who was convinced they could . turn her into a star. 'Barry and Gordon felt like there was a show somewhere inside this Paula . character that could be very successful,' Deen wrote. 'They probably courted . Food Network for two years trying to push me at them.' Deen also noted in her book: 'Barry is affectionately known in my family as . Barry Cuda. Perfect name for an agent.' Deen's business deals began falling apart after she was questioned under oath . in May as part of a civil lawsuit filed last year by Lisa Jackson, a former . manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, which Deen co-owns with her . brother, Bubba Hiers. Jackson says she was sexually harassed and worked in an . environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo. Star: Paula Deen went from an unknown southern chef to superstar in a few short years . Ultimately it was Deen's own words that proved damaging. Asked in her . deposition if she had ever used the N-word, she replied: 'Yes, of course.' That . she also insisted 'it's been a very long time' seemed to matter little to the . companies paying to use her name and image with their products. Neither were . they swayed by Deen's apologies in online videos and in person with the 'Today' show's Matt Lauer. Forbes magazine last year ranked Deen as the fourth-highest-earning celebrity . chef last year, figuring she had hauled in $17 million. Her company Paula Deen . Enterprises generates total annual revenue of nearly $100 million, according to . Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource . Group. Deen cast no blame in her statement announcing her split with Weiner.

Stunning: The dining room inside Ware House which has gone on the market for £3million . Ware House featured in the 1981 adaptation The French Lieutenant's Woman starring Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep . Martin Lamb, of estate agents Savills, said it is the first time in 40 years Ware House had come on the open market. Mrs Churchill bought it in 1999 privately for £1.2 million. He said: 'The house sits to the west of Lyme Regis and faces the south east, which means it looks down on 26 miles of coastline. 'A French visitor to Ware House once compared the view to the Cote d'Azur to which Minnie Churchill is said to have replied that you can sea wall-to-wall villas on the hillside of the Cote d-Azor whereas you can't see a single house along the coast from the house. 'It has to be one of the best views in the country and it is a beautiful location. 'Lyme Regis was the setting for the French Lieutenant's Woman and Ware House was used as the main house in the film.' Ware House comes with four reception rooms, six bathrooms, a library and 17 acres of gardens. It also has two cottages within the grounds, a stable courtyard and croquet lawn. Minnie Churchill was married to the late Winston Churchill, the grandson of the war time Prime Minister of the same name. The couple divorced in 1997 and she moved to Ware House two years later. Ware House was built for the mayor of Lyme Regis before it was bought by the baronet Robert Bourchier Wrey. Another mayor of Lyme Regis, Alban Woodruffe, inherited the mansion in 1908 and lived there for many years. Ms Churchill now lives in Ware House with her long-time partner Simon Bird. She said: 'We have one of the most stunning views in the country here and have the most beautiful house. It's a wonderful combination. 'You look straight down this amazing World Heritage Coastline and see the wonderful beaches and headlands but you can't see one single house. 'I am sure there are houses there, it is just that you can't see them. 'We are so lucky in Britain that we have good organisations that look after our coastlines. 'We are going to miss living here enormously, not just the view but the house as well, but it is time to downsize.' Ms Churchill said she and Mr Bird plan to move to the Newbury area to be near her children and grandchildren.

Middle class squatters who turned a contaminated site near Heathrow into an organic market garden have lost their appeal against eviction. But senior judge Sir Alan Ward, who dismissed their challenge to a county court decision to evict them, said 'not all squatters were bad'. The group, known as Grow Heathrow, trespassed onto the private land, in Sipson, Middlesex, in March 2010. They cleared the former plant nursery of car fuel spillage and rubbish before restoring it with a range of glass houses, which became their homes. Grow Heathrow, squatters who turned a contaminated site near Heathrow into an organic market garden, have lost their appeal against eviction . Grow Heathrow, also known as Transition Heathrow, describes itself as a grassroots action group . Described as mature, intelligent and highly articulate individuals who has simply chosen a different way of life, they won the praise and support of the villagers. But judges at the Court . of Appeal said, they - or at least some of them - were experienced . squatters and knew precisely what they were doing when they entered the . land. Dismissing their challenge to a . county court decision, in July 2012, to make a possession order in . favour of land owner, Imran Malik, Sir Alan Ward said the idea that an . Englishman's home is his castle was firmly embedded in English folklore. 'But . what if the invaders occupy for long enough to establish their home . within the keep? Whose castle is it now? Whose home must the law now . protect?' he said. The group were described as mature, intelligent and highly articulate individuals who has simply chosen a different way of life, they won the praise and support of the villagers . He added that the castle . metaphor was quaint but outmoded and had been overtaken by human rights legislation. He said the traditional understanding of landowners’ rights should be rethought. Sir . Alan said that an owner was entitled to the return of his property . unless some exceptional circumstances militated against it. He . said the county court which had ordered the eviction was fully alive to . the fact that the group were 'good' squatters and was obviously . impressed by them and, to that extent, sympathetic towards them. Sir Alan said that an owner was entitled to the return of his property unless some exceptional circumstances militated against it - even though the group were 'good squatters' Sir Alan added that he, too, could admire the good work they had done. He said that the position should be the same for private land as it is for public authorities, meaning that applications for possession orders should be subject to a proportionality test. However, his two fellow judges, Lord Justice Lloyd and Lord Justice Toulson gave a majority decision that the traditional rule should still apply until a case that directly raises the point. They agreed that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the judge was entitled to find that immediate eviction would not be disproportionate. He said under provisions outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), squatters have a right to respect for their homes', he said. 'The castle metaphor is quaint but outmoded: the correct legal question to be asked since the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force in October 2000 is how, if at all, if squatters have established homes on the land without the leave of the landowner, does the court, faced with a claim for possession by a private landowner against the trespassers, give effect to the squatters' right to respect for their homes guaranteed to them by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights?'The judges ruled that the eviction order did not conflict with the squatters’ rights under the ECHR. Later, lawyer Jayesh Kunwardia of Hodge Jones & Allen, said: 'When Grow Heathrow moved to the land, it was being used as a dumping ground for hazardous items. The Grow Heathrow occupiers have since transformed the land into a flourishing community garden. They will now look to appeal directly to the Supreme Court and will do everything they can to protect their community from being trashed again.'","Squatters turned contaminated Heathrow site an organic market garden .

Accused: This image provided by the Irvine Police Department shows Meshael Alayban, who was arrested July 9, 2013 in Irvine, California, for allegedly holding a domestic servant against her will . Bail has been set at $5 million for a Saudi Arabian princess after she was charged with holding a servant hostage against her will on Wednesday. Meshael Alayban, 42, faces human trafficking charges and up to 12 years in prison after she allegedly held a 30-year-old Kenyan at her Orange County, California home after taking her passport from her. Alayban was arrested after the Kenyan woman carrying a suitcase flagged down a bus after escaping and tearfully told a passenger that she was a human trafficking victim. The passenger helped the lady contact police who traveled to Alayban's home where they found another four servants from the Philippines allegedly in similar conditions after serving a search warrant on the condo where the princess, her husband and her family lived. The 30-year-old woman was hired through an agency in Kenya in March 2012 and her passport was taken from her on arrival in Saudi Arabia by Alayban - who is married to a member of the ruling al-Saud family of Saudi Arabia, which has up to five thousand members. Police say Alayban's family traveled to the United States in May with the victim and four women from the Philippines. In court details released today it is . claimed that Alayban is one of the wives of Saudi Arabian Prince Abdul . Rahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud. Seriousness: Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas speaks at an informal news conference after a hearing at the Santa Ana Courthouse in Santa Ana, California today after Meshael Alayban was charged . The Saudi Arabian consulate in Los Angeles has indicated they will pay the bail and Alayban has been ordered to wear a GPS tracking device as she is considered a flight risk. 'This is not a contract dispute,' Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told the court during a bail hearing on Wednesday afternoon. 'This is holding someone captive against their will.' Alayban did not appear in court. Her attorney, Paul Meyer, said the case was a contractual dispute and argued his client shouldn't be assigned a ransom-like bail solely because she was rich. He said she had been traveling to the United States since she was a child, owned properties here and had given her word she would address the allegations. 'This is a domestic work hours dispute,' he said. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, (left), watches as Irvine Police Chief David Maggard speaks after a hearing at the Santa Ana Courthouse in Santa Ana, California, today . Rackauckas had originally asked the judge to deny bail for Alayban or set it at $20 million, saying it was unlikely any amount would guarantee a Saudi princess would show up in court. The victim was working 'around the clock' for the family cooking, cleaning and caring for children, said Irvine police chief David Maggard Jr. She had been promised wages of $1,600 a month but was paid only about $200 a month, Rackauckas said. The victims alleges that instead of her contracted work eight hours a day, five days a week, she instead was putting in 16 hour shifts, seven days a week on every conceivable household chore. The Kenyan lady also said that she was working abroad to pay for her daughter's medical bills. Alayban allegedly only gave the passports to the five women at passport control and has had them under lock and key in a bank safe box since they arrived in the United States in May. Arrest: Police in Orange County arrested Meshael Alayban at this condo in Irvine - where she has been staying with her family since May of this year . Investigations into each of the victims' circumstances are ongoing. All five women are said to be in good health. No indications of physical abuse were found and were being assisted with finding housing at a shelter. The other four women left the home voluntarily with police once authorities arrived. They told police they were interested in being free, Maggard said. No charges have been filed in connection with their circumstances. Alayban is set to be arraigned in court on Thursday. Powerful: Senior members of the Saudi royal family walk around Mecca - Meshael Alayban is married to a member of the ruling al-Saud family in the Middle Eastern nation . Distressed: The unidentified 30-year-old Kenyan woman hailed down a bus in Orange County and explained to a passenger her alleged imprisonment . 'The laws of our nation and California do not tolerate people who . deprive or violate the liberty of another and obtain forced labor or . services,' District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in the statement. 'If . any person is being enslaved, he or she should contact law enforcement. Any victim of human trafficking will receive the benefit and protection . of the laws of the United States and California.' The Orange County District Attorney's office has confirmed that she is facing up to 12 years in prison if convicted.","A Saudi princess was charged on Wednesday in California with human trafficking for allegedly holding a domestic worker against her will .

But this particular move is no ordinary downsize – and the local car boot sale might not make the grade. Because the aristocratic Cunliffe-Copeland family, who have owned  Trelissick House in Cornwall for  generations, are expected to raise  more than £3million selling off their heirlooms at auction. Sale: A few of the items being auctioned off from the Trelissick House stately home near Truro in Cornwall which are expected to raise more than three million pounds . The 18th-century property was left to the National Trust 58 years ago  provided that members of the family could carry on living in the manor. But the current incumbent, William Copeland, has decided to buy a normal-sized home for his young family and will not have enough room for hundreds of the antiques. He has decided to host a garden sale with a difference – a two-day auction of ornaments, paintings, furniture, jewellery, silverware, books, rugs and wine – which will be held in the grounds later this month. The contents of Trelissick House in Cornwall could raise around £3m at the ultimate garden sale later this month . William and Jennifer Copeland, left, are selling the treasures before they move their family to a smaller home . There is no reserve on many of the . items, which means almost everything will be sold off, even if the bids . fail to hit the expected price. For years the Cunliffe-Copelands have filled Trelissick House with treasures picked up on their travels around the globe. Leonard Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, began the collection in the late 19th century. Mr Copeland said: ‘My . great-grandfather had very fine tastes and collected many works of art . from his travels in Europe and further afield. This picture was painted by famous equine artist John Frederic Herring, a former groom to the Copeland family . Lots up for sale include the Qianlong vase, worth £100,000, left, and a pair of model lions worth £10,000, right . ‘We have been guardians of these fine . works for a number of years and now that we are moving locally it is . time to pass them on for others to enjoy.’ The most expensive item for sale is an 18th-century Chinese Imperial vase which is now worth £100,000. A mahogany desk is valued at £30,000 while a pair of 18th century walnut side tables are also tipped to make £30,000. Mr Copeland’s grandmother, Ida, was a Conservative MP and her George III mahogany writing desk is expected to bring in £15,000. Ancestral home: Treslissick House has been lived in by the same family for a century and has 25 rooms . Stunning views: The house and grounds, which are owned by the National Trust, overlook the Fal estuary . An ornate Victorian silver candelabra . has an estimated price tag of £7,000 while a ten-piece silver dessert . service from the same period is valued at £25,000. And for any wine connoisseurs there . are 11 bottles of 1990 Chateau Palmer red wine at £1,200, three bottles . of a single malt whisky from 1935 for £1,200 and two bottles of a 1906 . St Lheurine Petite Champagne Cognac priced at an eye-watering £1,500. Roger Tappin from auctioneers . Bonhams, which is organising  the sale, said: ‘It is a stunning . property with some wonderful items inside. Richard Hird from Bonhams marks up the extensive collecton of Spode and Copeland ceramics ahead of the sale . Portraits of previous Trelissick residents WFM Copeland, left, and Richard Pirie Copeland, right, are for sale . These intricately-decorated Spode beaded vases date back to 1817 and are said to be worth an estimated £4,000 . Up for sale are portraits of William Taylor Copeland, left, and Evelyn Copeland dressed as a shepherdess . ‘Although the National Trust own the house and estate, the Copeland family live in the house and own the contents. ‘William Copeland has decided that the time has come to downsize and own a more normal-sized family home in Cornwall. ‘Of course they can’t take the contents with them. ‘So they have now decided to sell it all and give other people the chance to buy a piece of their family history.’ Stacks of pictures and the Copeland family plaque are among lots up for sale on July 23 and 24 at Trelissick . Jenny and Willian Copeland are moving to a smaller house nearby - the last of five generations at Trelissick House . The heirlooms being sold have been collected by five generations of the Cunliffe-Copeland family at Trelissick . He added: ‘The items are typical of what you would expect to find in a historic country house. ‘People like to go to garden  sales . and get a glimpse into  other people’s lives. To not only  get an . insight into life inside a stately home like Trelissick  but also to . have the chance to  buy something from it is quite something.’ Mr Tappin explained that English country house sales used to be a common occurrence in the 1950s and 60s, but are now very rare. Stately home: Trelissick House has been lived in by five generations of the same family . The entire contents of the house is for sale, from furniture and paintings to the contents of the (valuable) cellar . A vast array of Spode and Copeland ceramics will be auctioned in the two-day sale later this month . The dining table and chairs are up for sale with the rest of the dining room furniture at the Cornish mansion . This 1826 dinner service has an estimated value of £12,000 - just don't put it in the dishwasher . The elegant grey sitting room at Trelissick House has oil paintings and decorative plates that are for sale . ‘You could have two or three of these sales a year per auction house back in the 1960s,’ he said. ‘After the war, a lot of these . estates fell into disrepair and the owners didn’t have the funds to do . the work. So they were sold off with everything in it. ‘Stately homes in private ownership like Trelissick are becoming scarcer and these sales now are as rare as hen’s teeth.’ The Cunliffe-Copeland family have lived at Trelissick since 1913 . Leonard Daneham Cunliffe was deputy governor of the Bank of England, co-founder of the merchant bank Cunliffe Brothers and director of the Hudson Bay Company. When he died in 1937, he bequeathed much of his antiques collection to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. But he left his country house estate - Trelissick, in Cornwall - to his stepdaughter, Ida Copeland. Ida was the daughter of Count Camillo Fenzi, a Tuscan senator, but her father died and her mother married Leonard Cunliffe and she moved to Cornwall. Ida married Ronald Copeland, the president of Copeland and Spode, a successful ceramics company in Stoke-on-Trent. In 1931, she stood successfully against Sir Oswald Mosley and became Conservative MP for Stoke. In 1955, much of the estate was donated to the National Trust in 1955 by Mrs Copeland, William Copeland's grandmother. This year, the last generation of the family will move out when William and Jennifer Copeland take their family to live in a smaller house nearby.","Treasures of Trelissick House in Cornwall were collected over generations .

Everything about this gown was custom-designed with Elizabeth Taylor's voluptuous figure in mind; a built-in corset allowed the dress to be tightly cinched in at the waist and the veil's ten yards of shimmering silk net was carefully considered and attached to a pearl-covered Juliet cap in order to float around the bride. The original waist measured 20 inches, but it has since been taken out to a slightly more generous 22. The project was so extensive and was such a priority at MGM that more than fifteen people worked full-time for between two and three months straight on it.

A California man accused of murdering his 6-week-old baby girl last year had allegedly tortured the special needs child nearly from birth, it was revealed during a Wednesday court hearing. Aaron Rowe, 23, of Visalia, has been charged with a single count of murder with a special circumstance of torture, which is punishable by the death penalty or a life sentence without parole. Rowe's 22-year-old wife, Courtney, faces a charge of failure to protect a child from abuse, with a special allegation of willful harm to a child. Parents behind bars: Aaron Rowe (left), 23, has been charged with murder in connection to his daughter's death; Courtney Rowe (right), 22, is facing a child endangerment charge for failing to protect the infant . Potential punishment: If convicted of murder, Mr Rowe could face the death penalty or life without parole . Both parents were ordered Wednesday to stand trial in connection to the November 2012 slaying of their infant daughter, Peyton, The Fresno Bee reported. On the night of November 12, 2012, police officers responded to the home of Aaron and Courtney Rowe after getting a report of a baby not breathing. Little Peyton, who was born with a genetic condition known as the Turner syndrome known to cause deformities, was taken to Kaweah Delta Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. Angel: Peyton Rowe, who was born with a genetic condition, died at 6 weeks from blunt force trauma . An autopsy performed on the child two days later showed that the cause of death was blunt force trauma, and that the 6-week-old girl had old injuries consistent with prolonged abuse, according to the TV station ABC30. The shocking revelations resulted in the arrests of Aaron and Courtney Rowe the following day. In court yesterday, doctors recounted seeing five separate bruises on the newborn's arms, legs and face. CT scans showed that the infant suffered 15 fractured ribs and several other old and new fractures to her bones. The prosecution painted the 23-year-old father as violent man who had allegedly tortured the helpless newborn baby for about two weeks by shaking and beating her. The night after Peyton's killing, Aaron Rowe reportedly went out to party with friends. Records show that in 2011, Mr Rowe was sentenced to 90 days in jail on a domestic violence charge. Mr Rowe’s attorney, Andy Rubinger, has denied allegations that his client was abusive toward his daughter, saying that on one occasion, he fell while holding Peyton in his arms, but that is was an accident. 'House of horrors': Prosecutors say Aaron Rowe had tortured the baby for weeks by shaking and beating her in their Visalia home . Heartless: Prosecutors say Aaron (right) partied with his friends the night after his daughter died . The lawyer added that the 23-year-old defendant loved Peyton as much as he loves his wife and their older daughter. Courtney Rowe was seen weeping in court during Wednesday's hearing. Prosecutors in the case have argued that the mother had to have known the abuse her child was suffering, but she had done nothing to stop it. Her attorney insisted that the young mother loved her infant daughter, dutifully taking her to the pediatrician for checkups every week of her short life.

Accusations: James Robert Jones, 42, is accused of stealing IDs of dead soldiers to get fraudulent $12,000 loan . A former Fort Campbell inspector whose job was to investigate misconduct has been accused of stealing the identities of Army personnel, including a soldier killed in combat, in a scheme to obtain thousands of dollars in bank loans. The indictment handed down Wednesday alleges James Robert Jones, 42, of Woodlawn, Tenn., used his position as an assistant inspector general at the Army post on the Kentucky-Tennessee line to obtain personal information on active-duty Army officers, some of whom were deployed to Afghanistan. Jones, whose rank is sergeant first class, is accused of using the information - including Social Security numbers and dates of birth - to apply for loans in the officers' names, the federal indictment said. He successfully obtained fraudulent loans from two financial institutions, it said. Among those targeted was an enlisted soldier who had been killed in combat in Afghanistan, the indictment said. Jones said Wednesday night he would plead not guilty to the charges. 'There's a whole lot more to the story than what meets the eye, I can tell you that much,' he said in a brief phone interview with The Associated Press. Jones said he has been in the Army for nearly 20 years and was in the inspector general's office at Fort Campbell for close to two years. A voicemail greeting on Jones' cellphone included portions of the song 'God Bless the U.S.A.' The indictment did not identify the soldiers allegedly targeted in the scheme, and it mentioned two credit unions allegedly targeted. The alleged scheme took place from February to May of this year, it said. Jones allegedly created fake email accounts in the officers' names as part of his loan applications and called the credit unions pretending to be the officers when following up on the applications, it said. Plea: The former Fort Campbell inspector said he would plead not guilty to the charges . The indictment says Jones applied for a $12,000 loan from Fort Campbell Federal Credit Union. Jones withdrew cash from loans he fraudulently obtained, the indictment said, without specifying the amount. He also purchased a cashier's check from the Navy Federal Credit Union, using funds from a loan he had obtained, it said. Jones failed to make payments on the loans he fraudulently secured, it said. When confronted by investigators, Jones tried to conceal his role by falsely accusing a deceased Army officer of planning the scheme, according to the indictment. 'This defendant abused a position of trust and used his position to specifically target those who serve our country, including certain officers who were deployed overseas, when he stole their identities,' Acting U.S. Attorney David Rivera said in announcing the indictment. Accusations: The indictment handed down Wednesday alleges Jones, used his position as an assistant inspector general at the Army post on the Kentucky-Tennessee line to obtain personal information on active-duty Army officers, some of whom were deployed to Afghanistan . Jones was indicted on charges of aggravated identity theft, bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution. He's also charged with obstructing justice and making false statements to investigators. Those charges stem from allegations that Jones asked a colleague to delete information on his work computer in an alleged effort to impede the investigation, the indictment said. Fort Campbell spokesman Bob Jenkins said the post was reviewing the indictment and would have no additional comment Wednesday. The case was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Command. 'The Secret Service remains committed to fighting this type of financial fraud by pursuing individuals who obtain fraudulent loans using stolen identities, especially when the identities belong to members of our armed services,' said Todd Hudson, special agent in charge of the Secret Service field office in Nashville. If convicted, Jones faces up to 30 years in prison for the counts of bank fraud and making a false statement to a bank, along with an additional two years for each count of aggravated identity theft. Jones also faces up to 20 years if convicted of attempting to destroy records and five years for allegedly making false statements to investigators.","The former Fort Campbell inspector's job was to investigate misconduct .

Sitting reading in a prison cell on Robben Island determined to fight at all costs for his beliefs, there was a passage in one of William Shakespeare's most famous texts that resonated with Nelson Mandela. The year was 1977 and Mandela had already served 13 years behind bars for sabotage when he signed his name beside a passage in a copy of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar - a part of the text that sees the play's protagonist facing death without fear. He had said during trial in a 1960s courtroom that he was prepared to die for his beliefs. Poignant: Nelson Mandela, former South African President, once marked his name by a passage in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar about facing death without fear . Resonance: The passage was marked by Mr Mandela while he was serving a life sentence for sabotage . But the words perhaps carry greater poignancy now that the former South African president has been gravely ill in hospital with a lung infection for more than a month. The marked passage reads in part: 'Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, it seems to me most strange that men should fear; Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come.' Caesar was replying to his wife Calpurnia's plea not to go to the Senate for fear he would be killed. The copy of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare was regarded as the 'Robben Island Bible' by inmates at the time, with each marking off a passage that held particular meaning for them. London theatre director Matthew Hahn was inspired to write a play about the prisoners' study of the book and described reports that his family is in turmoil as his health fails as 'heartbreaking'. Behind bars: Mandela initialed the passage while he served time in this prison cell in South Africa . Earlier this month Mandla Mandela lost a court battle against 16 members of his family who accused him of moving the bodies of three of the former South African president's children without their permission. Mr Hahn said: 'Nobody wants to see their heroes become human. Let the poor man die, let his ideals live.' But despite previous reports that the first South African black president was unable to breathe without assistance and his critical state for the past fortnight, Mandela was said today to be responding to treatment. Current South African president Jacob Zuma said after a visit to see Mr Mandela on Wednesday: 'We are encouraged that Madiba is responding to treatment and urge the public to continue providing support and showering him with love which gives him and the family strength.' Despite his retirement from public life almost a decade ago, the prospect of Mr Mandela's death has troubled South Africans who see him as a unifying force. Christopher Thurman from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said: 'Mandela is aware of his own symbolic presence, and if we're trying to fit that into a recognizable Shakespearian archetype, it's really the figure of the `dead king,' and we're left wondering what will follow.' He added that Mr Mandela fits more the mold of Richard III or Henry V because of the questions posed about what will happen when he dies. Mandela will turn 95 on July 18 and his foundation's Twitter feed is asking followers to take part in a volunteer initiative to mark the day.","The former South African president marked a passage in Julius Caesar .

A female bodybuilder and model has filed a lawsuit against a high-powered Wall Street executive, accusing him of viciously beating her in a drunken rage after she had refused to drive him home. Sahara Walsh, a 29-year-old self-described ‘body model’ from New York City, claims in her $100,000 suit that just before 4am on April 28, 46-year-old Quintano Downes jumped into the back of the car parked along Lenox Avenue carrying an open plate of food and demanded that she take him home. When Walsh refused, Downes allegedly 'started to punch [her] with a closed first, dragged her out of the car by her hair and continued to stomp [her.]' She said, he said: Model and bodybuilder Sahara Walsh (left), is suing Wall Street executive Quintano Downes (right) for $100,000 accusing him of attacking her in April - but he claims that he was the victim . Walsh's attorney, Edgar De Leon, told the New York Post that the woman did not know her assailant personally, but the two have a mutual friend who was present during the attack. The lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court Tuesday goes on to describe in detail how Downes, a director at the financial firm Kipling Jones & Co., then 'ripped her blouse off exposing her breast to the public and continued to drag [her] causing her to lose her shoes.' A witness told the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office that Downes was seen pummeling the face of the muscular, curvaceous beauty with a closed fist and kicked her. The night-time assault has left the model bleeding from cuts to her face, legs and arms, her lawsuit states. Family man: Downes (far right), a director at a Manhattan hedge fund and a married father of two, has been charged with assault for allegedly beating up Walsh in a drunken attack after she had refused to drive him home . 'This hedge fund guy is pretty intoxicated, when they tell him to get out of the car he just turned on Walsh, pulled her out of the car and continued hitting her until the police responded,' De Leon told the paper. Walsh, a former Equinox fitness trainer who takes part in bodybuilding contests, is suing Downes for $100,000, claiming that her physical injuries, including a clump of hair ripped from her scalp, have caused her to lose modelling jobs. Walsh's mother, Lynn Walsh, told the New York Daily News that her daughter and a female friend were sitting in a car in front of the model's apartment building in Harlem when Downes ambushed her. ‘His reaction was way over the top. It was irrational,’ she said. ‘He's an ex-Marine. She is a fitness expert but she weighs 98 pounds. He really had to take a 98-pound girl and mop the sidewalk with her?’ Power couple: Downes and his wife (pictured) had recently bought a renovated $1.95million brownstone in Harlem . Following the altercation, Mr Downes has set out towards his home, but was quickly apprehended after a witness called 911. Downes has dismissed Walsh's claims as lies. His attorney, Bruce Roistacher, told the Post that it was Walsh's friend who attacked him, and he was merely acting in self-defense. The 46-year-old executive and married father of two is due back in court in August on charges of harassment and assault.

Americans are exercising more than ever, but it isn't having the desired impact on reducing waistlines as poor diet is blamed for the nation's growing obesity crisis. Greater numbers of men and women became more physically active between 2001 and 2009, according to data published Wednesday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. The number of women getting sufficient weekly exercise increased from 46.7% to 51.3%, while for men the figure increased by a single point to 57.8%. New research has found that people are exercising more than ever, but it isn't having the desired impact on reducing waistlines . Yet over the same time period obesity rates for men or women fell in just nine counties. ‘There has been a lot of progress on physical activity,’ said Dr. Christopher Murray, lead author of the research, which was published in the journal Population Health Metrics. ‘To tackle obesity, we need to do this. But we probably also need to do more. … Just counting on physical activity is not going to be the solution.’ More than one-third of U.S. adults and approximately 17% of children are obese, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Poor diet has been identified as the number one factor contributing to America's poor health compared to other industrialized nations . Many health experts believe that changing diet may do more to bring those numbers down than increasing exercise. A separate paper by the institute published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association identified poor diet as the number one factor contributing to America’s poor health compared to other industrialized nations. It compared 20 years of health data from a vast number of surveys, published studies and death certificates in the United States with similar records in 34 high-income countries in Europe, Asia and North America.

Fake rape: Kelly Wilson, 29, pictured, was arrested on July 3 and charged with second degree falsely reporting an incident, making a false statement and misusing 911 . A Connecticut woman slashed her body with a steak knife and choked herself with a metal dog collar before falsely claiming to police that she was raped by a masked intruder - all so her military boyfriend could visit her. Kelly Wilson, 29, was arrested on July 3 and charged with second degree falsely reporting an incident, making a false statement and misusing 911 after she called the emergency line begging for help on April 14. When officers arrived at her Suffield home, they found her lying on the floor 'visibly upset and crying' with a bruised eye and 'cuts all over her body.' According to the Hartford Courant, Wilson told police a man wearing a ski mask had twice knocked on her door that evening, telling her his truck had broken down and asking for money. She said he came back a third time with a handgun and broke into the house then sexually assaulted her. In subsequent interviews she padded out the story, telling detectives the man forced her to shower for 30 minutes after the rape, presumably to explain the lack of seminal evidence. When police became suspicious, they called in an FBI profiler and a medical examiner to check out her injuries. Both believed her story didn't stack up. Shortly after, Wilson admitted it was all an elaborate lie she had concocted in an effort to have her boyfriend granted leave from the military so he could visit her in hospital. Investigation: Police quizzed motorists and searched the house for evidence after the report in April . On May 22, Wilson gave a seven page statement saying the home invasion and rape never occurred. She said she had been missing her boyfriend who was out of the state at a military training camp so she took four 'pain pills' then drank a bottle of wine. On a previous occasion, her boyfriend had been given a one-month leave when she had gallbladder surgery so she 'had to come up with something sensational and believable' to get him home again, she told police. She decided on the false rape, and cut herself all over her body with a steak knife and choked herself with a dog collar to 'make it more convincing,' according to her statement. House: Wilson claimed a masked intruder broke into her house, pictured, and raped her . High alert: Police and residents of Suffield were on high alert believing a sex predator was in the area . She then showered, hit herself in the eye with the head of the shower and messed up her home to make it look like she had tried to fight off the intruder. After her false report, local and state police issued a description of the fake intruder provided by Wilson and officers quizzed motorists near her property, asking if they'd witnessed anything. Her neighbors, frightened at the thought of sexual predator on the loose, inundated the department with calls for weeks to flag up safety concerns, police said. Wilson is free on $50,000 bond and is scheduled to be arraigned in Enfield Superior Court next week.","Connecticut woman, Kelly Wilson, 29, is charged with second degree falsely reporting an incident, making a false statement and misusing 911 .

Pressure: Child protection experts warn young girls (posed by models) are being persuaded to send explicit images of themselves to boys . Girls as young as 11 are sending out explicit photos of themselves through text messages and social networking sites - with schools dealing with the problem 'on a daily basis'. The practice of 'sexting' is getting more common with younger children involved every year, child protection experts have warned. Increasing numbers of girls are being persuaded to send boys explicit images of themselves - but the photographs can often be used to blackmail them through sharing via Facebook and Blackberry messaging. A study by the NSPCC reported up to 40 per cent of young people had been involved in sexting, mainly under pressure from other schoolchildren. The latest warnings came at a conference held in Manchester by the Safeguarding Children Board which brought together teachers, social workers and police to tackle the problem. The conference heard how many schools . are now installing forensic software to intercept explicit messages . exchanged by pupils on school computers. Experts believe increasingly . sexualised media and video games could be to blame - with one delegate . telling how a boy of just seven said he liked playing Grand Theft Auto . 'because you get to rape people'. It is also thought many parents are unaware of what sexting is or how explicit the messages have become. Jo Coleman, assistant headteacher at Westleigh High School in Leigh, said: 'Sexting is something I deal with on a regular basis - it's quite prevalent in schools now, a daily problem.' 'We have seen examples of it in children of 11 or 12 but generally it is in students from 14 onwards. A lot of it is where a teenage couple's relationship has broken down and the girl is blackmailed with the threat that the photos she sent when they were together will be shown to everyone. Distress: Many schoolchildren are unaware that any images they text can be published online (posed by model) 'However, we're also starting to see sexually violent messages specifically targeting girls of ethnic minorities. A child protection unit in Manchester . says it is currently dealing with 80 cases of sexual exploitation - many . involving girls being groomed to share explicit images of themselves. 'We deal with the problem head on, talking to pupils concerned, their parents and if necessary involving the school police officer.' Making or sharing a sexually explicit image of someone under 18 is illegal - meaning teenagers who take photos of themselves and those who share them are both breaking the law. Many teenagers are also unaware that an image they text to someone can be shared and reproduced online, remaining on the internet forever. June Edmondson, a social worker at the Manchester Protect Team based at Moss Side police station, said: 'Two years ago, the referrals coming in to us were for children around 16 years old - now they are 12 or 13, and that's a major concern.' Humiliation: Often the pictures end up being used to blackmail young girls or as a way of shaming them in front of their peers . 'A lot of the time we find they have links to older teenagers, but it can also be young people of the same age sexually exploiting each other.' 'That's a very difficult area for us - in some cases legal action can be necessary but we do not want to criminalise children so it has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. We've had young people referred to us who don't realise the risks they are taking - in extreme cases we've had to place them in secure accommodation for their own protection.' 16-year-old Tia Wood told the Safeguarding Children Board conference she was shocked by how young children have started sexting each other - and has seen first-hand the damage it can do. Tia said: 'Sexting is quite common now and people are doing things younger and younger. 'Each year it starts earlier and earlier - there are 12-year-olds doing sexual stuff now, it shocks me. 'I know a girl from my area who sent explicit pictures and voice note messages - she thought she trusted that person. 'But they got published all over Facebook and via Blackberry Messaging, he showed those pictures to everyone.'","Safeguarding Children Board heard 'each year it starts earlier and earlier'

From faded flags painted on to the side of buildings, to large ones that nearly engulf their proud bearers, the Stars and Stripes has become a regular sight in the U.S. Photographer Shannon Davis began to document how the flag has become part of the fabric of American life by taking pictures of it around her home town of Buffalo and elsewhere in the U.S. She first noticed the prevalence of flags when she returned to the U.S. after spending four years in Britain. Face of America: A boy holds the Stars and Stripes flag in North Litchfield, South Carolina . Part of the furniture: A flag pokes out the side of a chair in West Virginia . 'The more I looked, the more I saw that . people display it every single day in these casual ways, but it almost . seemed more real, personal and more in touch with what it means to be . American,' she told CNN. As she began her Random Acts of Pride project, Ms Davis started to notice Stars and Strips in unexpected places, such as the side of barns, or taped to cash registers. And the flags were on show every day, not just for holidays such as July 4. 'Don’t they realize they are trying to be patriotic, but they are doing it in kind of a disheveled way?' the photographer said she found herself thinking. Although people are usually absent in her shots, when they do appear they can often become the focus for the photograph. Street art: The American flag stands out against graffiti in New York . Token: A small flag has been taped to a cash register in a Los Angeles shop . Clinging on: A poster with an image of the flag hangs from the side of Honeymooners in West Virginia . On one occasion Ms Davis was taking a photo of a flag outside a house when a neighbor across the street came over to ask what she was doing. As she explained her project the man told her he always had a flag outside his house, but had taken it down because of the snow. He then rushed to his house to fetch the huge flag. 'It’s ironic. It’s the same flag, but he . wanted to get his flag,' Ms Davis said. 'I just love that. That’s the . connection that every single person displaying the flag seems to have: . It is very personal to them.' Shelter: A large weather-beaten flag is seen tacked to a barn in West Virginia . Hidden: You can barely see the flag for the trees in this shot taken in Atlanta . Borders: The remains of a flag hang from a fence in Buffalo, New York . Faded glory: A few stars are all that remain of this flag spotted on Highway 521 in South Carolina . The photographer, who was the creative director for the Turner Classic Movies adverts that celebrated old films, added that the placing of the flag often reflected its surroundings. 'There are some joyous, ironic and . playful moments and others that are subtle, lonely and separated. The . flag is not always this beacon, shining and looking so proud and . wonderful. Sometimes, it looks kind of lonely to me, and I wanted to . capture that loneliness,' she said. Her project, which can be seen on Visual 64 is not motivated out of a sense of patriotism, instead coming from her desire to document everyday life and overlooked moments.

A man who claims his tent, car and dog were snatched by aliens on a camping trip in Cardiff has spoken out about his harrowing experience. Keith Robins, 37, said that he looked on 'gobsmacked' as a fleet of 12 to 15 spacecrafts homed into view one evening in 1992 while on a camping trip with friends Christopher French and Sylvan Salway. Keith and his friends had asked permission from their parents to go on the trip, but the group were left disappointed when before they even had a chance to pitch their tent, they claim the alien vessels made off with the Datsun Cherry and its contents. Believer: Keith Robins says he is willing to take a lie detector test over his claims that aliens stole his car . Mr Robins from Rumney, Cardiff explained that they had parked up the car in Whitchurch and went looking for somewhere to pitch their tent. It was then that the locked car disappeared without the engine starting - with Keith’s tent and Chris’ eight-week-old pit bull Staffordshire terrier still inside. He said: 'It all happened so fast in about three to five minutes. I walked back to the car and it had just vanished off the face of the earth' Determined: Keith has written to the Ministry of Defence about the abduction of his Datsun Cherry by aliens back in 1992 . It was then that all three noticed a bright glow above the trees for just under a minute. For 'defence purposes' the MoD offered a UFO hotline for more than 50 years, investigating sightings from all around the UK. Its archives show one man 'made weapon to shoot down alien spaceships' and that UFOs were reported over as hovering over landmarks such as Stonehenge and the Houses of Parliament. One letter from a child in Cheshire demanded a reply to whether there was life 'outside our planet...I have the right to know'. There was an alarming surge in sightings after the service closed down in 2009, with more than 600 alien experiences were reported to the hotline that year. However, the eerie orange lights that many people saw in the skies were most likely to be Chinese lanterns, which were fashionable for weddings and parties. 'These lights came from behind these massive trees. About 12 to 15 of them. I thought they were pink flamingos. My other mates thought they were fire flies,' he said. 'They then just speeded up and were gone in 30 seconds. I was baffled - so confused.' The next day, Keith and his friends reported the incident to the police, leaving out the mysterious floating objects, but a search for the Datsun Cherry and its contents proved futile. Keen to find out what he saw, Keith sent a handwritten letter and diagram showing the alien space crafts to the Ministry of Defence in October 1992. To this day he still says: 'I don’t . 100 per cent know what happened but I’m going to believe it for the rest . of my life. I’m willing to have a lie detector test,' he said. Mr . Robins’ story was just one of many extraterrestrial tales revealed to . the public when the Ministry of Defence released its final cache of UFO . documents. The 25 files . contained 4,400 pages of reports received between 2007 and 2009 with . details of alien abductions, air chases between police and UFOs and . spaceship wreckages.

Buckling under the weight of these submissions, the project was recently shut down, but Nick Pope, who worked for the UFO project from 1991 to 1994 said believers should not be laughed off too quickly.

Accident: Luii Duncan, 2, suffered serious injuries after she fell on to a barbecue which had been left in a park . Injuries: Luii received burns to her face, arms, chest and hands following the horrific accident in Beddington Park, Sutton . The child's parents and their friends managed to pull the barbecue off Luii, after it became stuck to her stomach, by dousing her with water. She received burns to her face, arms chest and hands. The barbecue had been left smouldering despite the owners reportedly being asked by friends of Luii's parents to put it out before they left.

The Prime Minister and his deputy faced criticism last year after they both jetted off at the same time. Questions were raised about the point of Mr Clegg was if he did not deputise in the Prime Minister’s absence. However, Deputy PM has admitted the Cleggs and Camerons have again failed to ensure that one of them remains in Westminster during the six-week recess. It will not be the first foreign holiday this year for either man - Mr Clegg enjoyed a ski break in the exclusive Davos resort in Switzerland in April while Mr Cameron went to Ibiza with his wife Samantha in June. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘The Prime Minister and I, we try where we can. We’re pragmatic about these things to make sure that as much as possible, we don’t go away at the same time but there’s not always a perfect match.’ He revealed there would be a ‘short period of time where both the Prime Minister and I are away’ this summer. ‘We’re sort of trying to hand over the baton to each other,’ he added.

After being criticised by a caller to his LBC 97.3 show, Mr Clegg insisted: ‘That’s in a sense the approach which we’ve taken, which I hope most people will accept is a sensible and pragmatic way of dealing with this.’ Taking charge: Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) and Home Secretary Theresa May (right) will 'hold the fort' while the Prime Minister and his deputy are on holiday this summer . The caller, Diane, said: ‘As Deputy Prime Minister, that’s exactly what you should do. You should deputise in the absence of the Prime Minister. ‘There is a minimum of six weeks children’s summer holidays and if your children go to certain privileged schools, they will have eight to nine weeks. ‘Surely it could be arranged for either the Prime Minister or you as Deputy Prime Minister to remain in the country. 'When I was working, I certainly could not take the same holidays as my counterpart under any circumstances.’ Every year Mr Clegg and his family go to the same village in Spain where his wife Miriaim’s family is from.

Plans to create the world's biggest offshore wind farm off the coast of Britain have been approved. Work on the massive Triton Knoll site - 288 giant wind turbines off the Lincolnshire coast - can now begin after the £3.6bn project was given the go ahead. It will dwarf Britain's current largest offshore facility, the 175-turbine London Array in the Thames Estuary unveiled last week by David Cameron. Go-ahead: An offshore wind farm off the coast of Skegness in Lincolnshire . When complete, the new giant windfarm will generate 1.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power for 820,000 homes. But critics say it will not come without a cost, as offshore power is currently subsidised by the taxpayer at three time the wholesale price of conventionally-produced electricity. And the scheme is not without controversy. As part of the project, energy giant RWE are proposing building a substation the size of 30 football pitches connected to the offshore turbines, in the Lincolnshire countryside. The proposal was met with anger by some residents, who have accused the company of trying to turn the area into an industrial site. Others said it would drive down house prices The Government also approved a second scheme yesterday, in Wales. Energy company Vattenfall confirmed it is investing £400 million in England and Wales' largest onshore wind farm at Pen y Cymoedd, South Wales. The scheme, which will consist of 76 turbines, will begin next year, with the first power being generated for the grid in 2016. Hundreds of jobs are expected to be created in the construction phase of both projects. Plans: Map showing where the massive Triton Knoll wind farm will be built off the Lincolnshire coastline . Tensions between energy firms and residents have been growing over the past two years as applications have soared. There are currently more than 3,000 onshore wind turbines in Britain, with a further 2,500 approved or being built. Despite increasing public anger at the subsidies paid for green power, ministers have shown no sign of changing course. Last month , Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, promised guaranteed prices - fixed at up to triple the market rate - for electricity from 'green' technologies such as wind, solar and biomass until 2019, in a bid to expand the sector. Ministers say the financial incentive will make Britain an attractive place to invest and transform our energy supply, and are hoping that 30 per cent of power produced by 2020 will be from renewables. Onshore wind farms are set to be given a minimum of £100 per megawatt hour - double the current wholesale rate of £50 - while offshore wind will receive a staggering £150. The difference between the wholesale price and the agreed rate will be met by the taxpayer. In February, more than 100 Tory MPs criticised the Government's plan to introduce more wind farms. Dozens of backbenchers wrote to David Cameron to demand that the £400million in subsidies paid to the 'inefficient' industry each year is 'dramatically cut'. Director of offshore renewables at industry body RenewableUK Nick Medic said the approval for the new Triton Knoll offshore wind farm was a 'historic step' for the industry. He said: 'It is the biggest project consented so far anywhere in the world, and shows the UK's offshore sector maturing to take on new challenges of scale. 'Following world leading projects such as the London Array, opened last week, Triton Knoll will demonstrate what offshore wind can do for the UK on a grand scale. 'The planning consent today keeps the country firmly at the forefront of offshore wind development and will help secure up to 20 per cent of electricity from offshore wind per year by 2020.'","Work on the Triton Knoll site can now begin after the £3.6bn project was given the go ahead .
It will dwarf Britain's current largest offshore facility unveiled last week by David Cameron .
When complete the windfarm will generate enough power for 820,000 homes ."

In the United States, a good education comes at a price and whilst it's common knowledge  college costs are on the rise, some schools are now charging more than $60,000 a year to educate a student for just one year. A list released by the Department of Education lists the colleges and universities with the highest tuition in the country. New York University, NYU is the country's most expensive school with tuition costing $61,977 a year. Pricey: The most expensive degrees in nation cost almost $62,000 per year . Four years of hard work and fun: You'll have a degree from one of the America's finest colleges but be down more than quarter of a millions dollars . Other residential colleges often add an extra $10,000 or more for board along with other fees. The list, compiled by Business Insider lists tuition, required fees, room and board for an entire four-year undergraduate degree. Of course the numbers are solely what you would pay to the school. There would still be the costs of books, travel, and and food. An earlier analysis, by the Department . of Education, ranked NYU 64th among private four-year colleges, but . that listing just counted tuition. NYU is followed closely by Harvey Mudd College, part of California's Claremont Colleges, and Bard College in upstate New York. College education costs have been rising steadily for years, outpacing inflation. Between . 1982-1983 and 2012-2013, tuition and fees for a private four–year . college education rose 167 percent, and the price tag for a public . four–year education climbed 257 percent, according to College Board.

College Board suggested a 'moderate budget' for a school year at a public university to be $22,000, and over $43,000 for a private institution. Earlier this week the U.S. Senate failed to restore lower interest rates on student loans which means that undergraduates are likely to have to pay rates twice as high as last year. The White House-backed proposal from Democratic leaders would have left interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans at 3.4 per cent for another year while lawmakers took up a comprehensive overhaul. The one-year stopgap measure failed to . overcome a procedural hurdle as Republicans — and a handful of . Democrats — urged colleagues to consider a plan now that would link . interest rates to the financial markets and reduce Congress' role in . setting students' borrowing rates. The . rate increase does not affect many students right away as loan . documents are generally signed just before students return to campus, . and few students returned to school over the July Fourth holiday.

Killer: Imran Hussain, 27, has been found guilty of stabbing an 18-year-old gap year student to death in Manchester . A smiling assassin who stabbed a ‘caring and quiet’ teenager to death in an unprovoked attack has been found guilty of murder. Gap-year student Kieran Crump-Raiswell, 18, was handing out his CV in the hope of finding a job when he was knifed to death in broad daylight. Imran Hussain, 27, walked up to the teenager and ‘without warning’ stabbed him four times in the chest because he ‘simply wanted to see what it’s like to kill someone’, a court was told. Witnesses said engineering student Hussain appeared to be ‘laughing’ and ‘sniggering’ as he walked away. Hussain had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility following evidence that it was ‘highly likely’ he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. But a jury at Manchester Crown Court rejected his defence and found him guilty of murder yesterday after they heard that he wanted the power to choose ‘who lived and who died’. Kieran’s family described the murder as ‘senseless’ and said they felt his loss ‘all the time’. Kieran lived with his father Roland Crump, 54, mother Christine Raiswell, 45, sister Anna, 17, and brother Paddy, 14, in Chorlton, Greater Manchester. Mrs Raiswell, a public health programme manager, said: ‘It is so completely senseless. Random: Gap year student Kieran Crump-Raiswell was walking to a bus stop in Chorlton when he was attacked . ‘He was just walking along enjoying . himself and somebody has attacked him. He did not have a chance to do . anything. There was no motive. 'It was just a random, violent assault. It . has been very difficult as a family. It is very, very hard because we . feel his loss all the time, and that will continue.’ The killing was the second of two . street assaults committed by Hussain on strangers within 12 days in . January. On January 4, mature student Hussain drove from his flat in . Coventry to Nottingham where he punched probation worker Paul Kershaw in . the face before running off. On January 16, Hussain travelled to Manchester before attacking keen sportsman Kieran on the streets of Whalley Range. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said: . ‘Fortified by the apparent ease at which a stranger could be attacked, . this time he travelled to Manchester armed with a knife and intending to . kill someone.’ Victim: This CCTV footage showed Kieran Crump Raiswell taken moments before he was stabbed to death in January . Heartbreaking: The 'caring and quiet' teenager was out looking for a job when he was stabbed to death in the street . Hussain drove around Whalley Range and . Chorlton in the city for an hour in the early afternoon before spotting . Kieran walking along the road listening to music on his headphones. He began to circle him, passing him . five times in his black Ford KA before parking up and waiting for him. Kieran was carrying his rucksack containing copies of his CV that he . intended to hand to shops and businesses. The jury was shown shocking CCTV . footage of the attack, with Kieran, who was planning to read history at . Sheffield Hallam University, being stabbed before collapsing to the . ground. Random: The attack was Hussain's second street assault on total strangers in 12 days . Callous: Hussain was heard to be 'sniggering' and 'laughing' as he ran from the scene . Mr Wright added: ‘The cold stark truth . is that . . . (Hussain) decided to see if he could get away with . killing someone. He could exercise power of life and death; he could . choose who lived and who died.’ Witness Roy Rankin said: ‘He took his headphones off and fell forward to the ground. He had blood around the mouth and nostrils. ‘I started crying – the lad looked so innocent, not streetwise like the man that had run off. ‘The other man had a big snigger, a smirk, a laugh.’ Hussain walked calmly to his car . before driving back to his rented flat where he ‘hid the knife and . carried on with his studies’. Hussain will be sentenced today. Heartbreak: Kieran was about to get the bus in to Manchester city centre to look for a job - he was carrying his CV and passport in a backpack . Investigation: The police complaints watchdog is looking into Nottingham Police's response to Hussain's earlier assault - 12 days before he killed Kieran, pictured with his mother Christine . Charlotte Rimmer, District Crown Prosecutor at CPS North West, said: 'As a result of the verdict reached today, Imran Hussain has been found guilty of the senseless and brutal murder of Kieran Crump Raiswell. It was an unprovoked attack on a young man who had his whole life ahead of him. 'Throughout the investigation and the court case, Imran Hussain has refused to accept full responsibility for his actions, instead choosing to hide behind the defence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. 'Nevertheless, the CPS has been determined to bring him to justice and we have worked hard to piece together the evidence and build a strong case against him for the more serious charge of murder. 'Consequently, the jury have rejected his version of events and accepted the prosecution’s case that Imran Hussain was in fact fully in control of his actions when he travelled to Manchester and stabbed Kieran to death in full view of passing members of the public. 'At the heart of this truly saddening case in the tragic loss of an innocent man’s life and I would like to offer my sincere condolences to Kieran’s family and friends. 'Although today’s outcome will not bring Kieran back, I hope that it goes some way towards helping them come to terms with their loss.' The family of Kieran Crump-Raiswell have said his murder was 'completely senseless'. The 18-year-old was stabbed to death in the street in Whalley Range, Manchester, by total stranger Imran Hussain, 27, in January. The youngster was on a gap year ahead of his acceptance to study history at Sheffield Hallam University later this year. The Manchester City fan had just returned from the United States where he was on a three-month football coaching course in Virginia. He lived in Chorlton with father Roland Crump, 54, mother Christine Raiswell, 45, his sister Anna, 17, and brother Paddy, 14. He was heading into Manchester city centre to find a job when he was attacked without warning in broad daylight in front of stunned witnesses. His father said: 'Kieran had been into Manchester the previous day with his CVs in his bag and had been handing them out. 'He headed out into town again. He left the house and I was the last one to see him. He just said that he was going into town. 'Kieran was quiet. He never had a bad word for anyone. No one ever had a bad word for him. Five hundred people turned up to the funeral. The response from the wider community was just fantastic and we want to say thank you.' 'Mature': Kieran's mother said he was 'caring' and was just 'turning into a man' when he knifed to death at the age of 18 . Mr Crump, who works as an interpreter . and translator, added: 'He had his whole life in front of him and was . planning for the future. He was quite a mature person for his age. 'He was very family-orientated. He spent a lot of time with his family and he enjoyed his family. He would really look after Paddy and Anna. 'It is such a big loss for our other two children that they have not got him here. He was a caring big brother.' Mrs Raiswell, a public health programme manager for Manchester City Council, said: 'It is so completely senseless. People have said things like he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he wasn’t. 'He was just walking along enjoying himself and somebody has attacked him. He did not have a chance to do anything. There was no motive. It was just a random, violent assault. 'It has been very difficult as a family. We have got two other fantastic children and we do not want the impact on their lives to be worse than it has been. It is very, very hard because we feel his loss all the time, and that will continue. 'I think of him everyday and I am going to miss him everyday. People ask all the time and say they cannot imagine how we feel. 'It feels a bit like you have lost a leg. You will never be the same again and it will always be very apparent, but you learn to adapt.' She continued: 'He was never in any trouble. He did well at his exams and he was very reliable. He played for the same football team for 10 years and was incredibly loyal to his friends and his family. 'He was 18 and he was turning into a man. He had a real social conscience and did not like to see injustice. He would give his change to homeless people and he had done some voluntary work for FareShare, a food supply organisation for the vulnerable, homeless and needy. 'It was just before Christmas and he was helping fill the hampers with food and goods for the needy. 'He felt very strongly about those sorts of issues. He was quiet, but he had those great strengths.' Mr Crump also told how he has now moved seats at the Etihad Stadium as he watched Manchester City with sons Paddy and Kieran, who played for Sale Cricket Club and football for FC Bluestar in Didsbury. Mr Crump said: 'At football it is just me and Paddy now who watch City. We did have three seats in the family stand. Thanks to City we have been moved to another part of the ground because it is not the same. 'This is something that is not going to go away.'","Kieran Crump-Raiswell, 18, stabbed to death as he waited for a bus .

Police could have prevented the Boston bombings if they had been more vigorous in their investigation into a grisly 2011 triple murder that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was connected to, it was alleged today. Law enforcement authorities have accused local cops of botching the investigation after Tamerlan was flagged up to them numerous times in the wake of the killings and they failed to act on it. Had they apprehended him, the bombings that left three dead and more than 260 wounded may never have happened, sources believe. On September 12, 2011, Brendan Mess, 25, Erik Weissman, 31, and Raphael Teken, 37, were found in an apartment with their throats slit and marijuana sprinkled over their bodies. There was no sign of forced entry and $5,000 cash was still in the apartment. Involved? Tamerland, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, could have been involved in a 2011 triple murder, investigators have said. Forensic evidence and cell phone records reportedly tie them to the scene . Investigators at the time said the . murders were 'targeted and not a random act of violence' yet no one was . ever charged in the case. Following the bombings, local . investigators started looking at a connection with Tamerlan as he and . Brendan Mess had become close friends after training together in a . boxing and martial arts gym. When they did, they found forensic evidence from the crime scene that matched the Tsarnaev brothers and cell phones records show they were in the area at the time of the killings.. Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to . When police were told about Ibragim Todashev's connection to the brothers, they arrested him and believe he was in . the process of implicating himself and his friend Tamerlan in the . murders when he was shot dead by FBI agents. According to the New York Times, . federal investigators had been gathering information against Tamerlan even before questioning Todashev using 'old-fashioned' police work. They 'went through his phone, did interviews, got his contacts - a combination of all that', a senior law enforcement official said. During the initial investigation, . police concluded the murders were a professional job as a result of a . low-level drug dispute. This was due to the lack of evidence, the . savageness of the attack and the position of the bodies - all stomach . down with their heads turned to the side. But relatives and friends of the . victims have criticized this decision and said investigators failed to . do basic policing work, especially after Tamerlan was named a number of . times and was known to be a frequent visitor to the Waltham apartment. But three law enforcement officials . familiar with the case told the Times that Massachusetts state troopers . and the Waltham police never questioned him - either as a potential . suspect or as someone who could provide valuable information about the . victims. It was when Tamerlan did not show up . to Mess' funeral and seemed to show a lack of emotion when talking about . it, that mutual friends became uneasy and reported it to police. One friend, who did not want to be identified, said: 'I felt that . the police were not really looking in the right places. 'I told them there were only two Muslims I . knew of who hung around the group of friends, and because of the 9/11 . date, the fact that Tamerlan and Brendan’s last girlfriend were Muslim . stood out.' Murdered: Raphael Teken (left with a friend) and Erik Weissman (right) were also killed in the home . Scene: Investigators said there was no sign of forced entry so it is likely the men knew their murderers . After the murders no one went to the Wai Kru martial arts gym where Brendan Mess worked out with Tamerlan - and later Todashev. John Allan, the gym’s owner who first . flagged up the men's friendship, said he was shocked by Tamerlan's reaction to his friend's murder when they talked about it a few days . later. 'As I said something, there was kind . of a smile on Tamerlan’s face, and he laughed it off', he said. He laughed off the . fact that he was murdered, like: ""Aw, man. It’s crazy right? Huh huh. It’s crazy right? I guess if you do that, that’s what’s going to . happen"". 'There was no hint of grief, that really shocked me.' Brendan Mess' girlfriend, who also . did not want to be identified, said she told investigators that . Tsarnaev, who she knew as 'Tam', was at the Waltham apartment regularly . but they also did not allegedly follow up. When questioned by the Times a law . enforcement official denied they were told about Tamerlan saying: 'Don’t . you think if someone had told us to take a look at him and that he had . information, we would have talked to him?'

Wiping sweat from his forehead and tears from his eyes, a former Albuquerque police officer accused of killing his wife took the witness stand in his own defense, offering emotional testimony in trial marked by tales of steamy affairs. Levi Chavez, 32, admitted to having a string of mistresses, searching a website on how to kill someone with martial arts moves and ignoring his wife's calls for help. But the disgraced former officer strongly denied that he murdered 26-year-old Tera Chavez, his long-suffering wife. 'Absolutely not,' Levi Chavez said, when asked by his defense attorney, David Serna, if he killed her. Chavez is accused of shooting his wife with his department-issued gun in October 2007 at their Los Lunas home and then trying to make her death look like a suicide. Accused: Prosecutors have depicted Levi Chavez as a philanderer whose marriage was crumbling, and say he killed his wife after she found out he had staged the theft of his pickup truck to collect the insurance proceeds . The less-than-perfect crime: Tera Chavez was killed when her husband allegedly shot her in the mouth and tried to make it look like a suicide . During his testimony, Chavez . frequently broke down and had to take breaks when he recounted his ill . treatment of his late wife throughout their marriage. That treatment included sexual . relationships with four different women and constant breakups that began . with way back when the couple were high school students. 'I'm very embarrassed about it,' Chavez said, then later added. 'I took her for granted.' Chavez told jurors that he found his . wife dead from a gunshot wound and thought it was God's way of punishing . him. 'To say I blamed myself is an understatement,' he said. 'Guilt . doesn't even begin to describe it.' However, Chavez said his wife's death . later helped him reform his philandering ways and he later married . another police officer — two months after his wife's death. Serna's move to call Chavez in his own defense drew gasps on Wednesday from a packed courtroom. Throughout the trial — which has seen . four former mistresses of Chavez and his current wife testify — Serna . has maintained that his client was a victim of an overly aggressive . detective and a botched investigation. The OTHER side of the law: Former Albuquerque police officer Levi Chavez seen here in his mugshot after allegedly murdering his wife . By calling Chavez to the stand, Serna . opened him up to questioning from prosecutors, who say Chavez committed . the 'perfect crime' to cover up an insurance scheme involving the . staged theft of a truck. Under a testy cross-examination, . prosecutor Bryan McKay pressed Chavez to point to the 'deciding moment' he sought to stop having affairs with other women, especially since he . had sex with a woman in the home he shared with his wife just a few . weeks after her death. 'I was lonely,' he said. McKay also asked Chavez why he left a loaded gun at home with depressed wife and two children. Chavez told jurors he had no choice since their home was almost burglarized and his truck had been stolen. The affairs and the troubled marriage . left his wife volatile, Chavez said, with her often demanding that he . leave, and then begging him to come home. He also testified that Tera Chavez threatened suicide 'countless times', saying things like she couldn't live without him. His testimony was interrupted at one . point when state district Judge George P. Eichwald excused the jury when . Chavez complained that prosecutors were laughing at his testimony. Protect and serve: Levi Chavez, left, sits with his attorney at his murder arraignment in the Valencia County District Court . Eichwald gave prosecutors a stern warning and said he had noticed their snickering throughout the trial. Much of the trial has focused on the . couple's extra-marital relationships, including a love triangle at the . hair salon where Tera Chavez worked. One mistress testified she continued to get her hair cut by Tera Chavez while she was sleeping with Levi Chavez. Other witnesses said Tera Chavez was . having an affair with an Albuquerque police officer who was married to . the maid of honor in their wedding. They had sex in the back of a hair . salon where she worked, according to testimony. The case has threatened to further . tarnish the reputation of the beleaguered Albuquerque Police Department, . which already is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department . over a series of police shootings.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:47 EST, 11 July 2013 . A San Diego father of four will stand trial on charges of murder for the accidental death of his common law wife after 'drunkenly' firing a homemade cannonball. Richard Dale Fox, of El Cajon, Ca., set off the explosive device around 10 feet away from his trailer door, fatally injuring his longtime girlfriend when shrapnel blasted through the trailer wall on March 6, 2012. Jeanette Orgara, 38, died from her wounds in the small mountain community of Potrero on the Mexican border, and Fox, 40, has since been waiting to hear if he'd stand trial for murder. Murder trial: Richard Dale Fox (pictured in El Cajon Superior Court yesterday) will stand trial for murder after the accidental death of his long term girlfriend . Victim: Jeanette Ogara (pictured right) was fatally injured by shrapnel when Richard Fox (left) device exploded in 2012 near San Diego . 'She (Jeanette) stood up with her . dying breath and gasped his (Fox's) name', El Cajon Superior Court heard . yesterday during a preliminary hearing to decide Fox's fate, UT San Diego reported. Moments after the cannon went off, Fox phoned his brother Jerry and said: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it should have been me.' Witness . Thomas Mowery Jr, revealed Jeanette's last words during the emotional . hearing, where Fox was told he'd also stand trial for exploding a . destructive device causing death and child endangerment. Fox . faces life in prison without parole if convicted, Judge Evan Kirvin . concluded, despite lawyers on both sides agreeing that Jeanette's death . was accidental. Deputy District Attorney C.J Mody . stated that Fox knew his actions were dangers when he ignited the cannon . and state law allows a murder charge without intent to kill. Three . other adults and the couple's four-year-old daughter, Vanessa, were . also in the trailer at the time of the explosion, according to the . testimony. Fox was treated at a hospital for . shrapnel wounds to his right leg and arrested for investigation of . exploding a device resulting in death. The girl was being looked after by her uncle, Jerry, following the explosion. One of the witnesses and longtime friend of the couple, Paul Ruehl, said: 'I knew what he was going to do. Preliminary hearing: Richard Dale Fox sat in El Cajon Superior Court with his lawyer to find out if he'd stand trial for murder (sheriff pictured giving testimony) 'He was going to make a boom, light it off.' Ruehl was in the trailer with Jeanette at the time of the explosion and tried to resuscitate her without success. It is unclear if Fox was intoxicated during the incident, however others had been drinking in the trailer. The explosive device was filled with black powder, taken from fireworks, components called 'salutes' and aluminum foil, Retired Detective Robert Luke testified. The foil was so tightly stuffed into the device that the lack of air flow prevented the device releasing properly, Luke said. Fox's defense attorney Thomas Slattery argued that his client was unaware of the consequences because he'd lit similar devices in the past without any damage. Fox's mother, Jessica Daoodi, pleaded for her son to be punished, but not get life in prison. She does not want her four grandchildren to grow up without their father. San Diego defense attorney Gretchen Von Helms said the murder charge is disproportionate to Richard Fox's crime. Scene: Jeanette Ogara Fox was killed when her boyfriend shot a makeshift cannonball into the side of the couple's mobile home just outside of San Diego . Endangering others: There were four adults and Fox's four-year-old daughter in the trailer at the time of the explosion (trailer pictured) ‘There was no intent to kill as the facts show,’ she told NBC San Diego last year. John Arnold, a neighbor, told U-T San Diego that Fox worked as a handyman and lived in the home for about six years. 'He liked experimenting with guns, and it looks like this experiment went bad,' he told the newspaper. He added that Fox 'adores Jeanette and Vanessa. They mean the world to him. I can’t imagine how he feels right now. He probably doesn’t want to live.' The couple were apparently well known in the community, largely because of Fox's striking looks - he is tall, thin and tattooed. Brother Jerry Fox, of Redding, told the newspaper that Fox 'likes to live on the edge. 'He is one of those people who likes to take things apart and put things back together and likes to see how things work.' In a jailhouse interview with NBC San Diego, Fox expressed deep regret. 'I would have much rather died than hurt her. I didn’t even know that it exploded, I just thought it went off as normal,' he said.","Richard Fox, 40, blasted homemade cannonball into his home, killing his long term girlfriend .

"By . Associated Press Reporter and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:47 EST, 11 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:51 EST, 12 July 2013 . Microsoft’s CEO announced a broad companywide shakeup just as many tech industry analysts are proclaiming the ‘death of the PC’ amid sharply declining personal computer sales and the tepid performance of the Windows 8 operating system. Steve Ballmer said Thursday that the changes mean the company is ‘rallying behind a single strategy’ with an aim to take the unwieldy tech giant ‘in a bold new direction.' While it has been widely anticipated, it's too early to tell how well the reorganization—the company’s largest in five years—will help Microsoft compete with more nimble rivals like Apple and Google. Scroll down for video... 'Bold new direction': CEO Steve Ballmer announced the largest overhaul the tech giant has seen in five years . Some insiders weren’t wholly optimistic. ‘You don't make massive, sweeping changes like this unless something is wrong,’ said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial, pointing to Wednesday's reports of declining PC shipments around the world. Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 11 percent in the April-June period, according to data from research firms Gartner and IDC. Gartner Inc. said the PC industry is now experiencing the longest decline in its history, as shipments dropped for the fifth consecutive quarter. Kurt DelBene, the former president of . Microsoft Office, will retire. His departure follows that of gaming . chief Don Mattrick, now CEO of Zynga, and Steven Sinofsky, formerly head . of the Windows unit. Microsoft's . lackluster stock performance has amplified speculation that the company . might consider replacing Steve Ballmer, who took over when co-founder . Bill Gates stepped down as CEO 13 years ago. Bold: Ballmer says it will be bold, but others wonder if the changes aren't just a scramble to catch up with rivals in a stalled corner of the tech market . Analysts have blamed a massive . consumer migration to tablets and other mobile devices for the falloff. But many observers also believe Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system . -which comes installed on most new PCs- has turned consumers off. The company's new divisions include . engineering, marketing and business development. Microsoft named veteran . executive Julie Larson-Green head of its devices and studios . engineering group, overseeing hardware development, games, music and . entertainment. She had been promoted in November to lead all Windows . software and hardware engineering after Steven Sinofsky, the president . of its Windows and Windows Live operations, left the company shortly . after the launch of Windows 8. Terry Myerson will lead Microsoft's operating systems and engineering group, namely Windows. Qi Lu will head applications and services. Ballmer stressed the company's focus on ‘one Microsoft’ in his memo. He said Microsoft will move forward operating as a cohesive company rather than a ‘collection of divisional strategies.’ ‘Although we will deliver multiple devices and services to execute and monetize the strategy, the single core strategy will drive us to set shared goals for everything we do. We will see our product line holistically, not as a set of islands,’ Ballmer wrote. The shake-up is being driven by competitive pressures as two of Microsoft's once much-smaller rivals, Apple and Google, have emerged as the technology trendsetters. In a world that increasingly revolves around mobile devices and Internet services, Microsoft has been scrambling to adapt to the upheaval. The company wants to ensure its relevance in the future while protecting the personal computer franchise that has always generated most of its revenue. The changing of the guard has already been noted by Wall Street. Both Apple and Google boast market values higher than Microsoft, despite a surge in Microsoft's stock price during the past three months. Outdated? Microsoft hopes to condense some of its more far flung arms into a more cohesive company dubbed by CEO Steve Ballmer 'One Microsoft' to compete with nimbler rivals Apple and Google . The reorganization could be Ballmer's attempt at placating shareholders with a dramatic overhaul that appears to borrow elements of Apple's and Google's set-ups. The winnowing of Microsoft's disparate divisions and Ballmer's rallying cry for ‘One Microsoft’ suggests the company is trying to make its products work together more seamlessly, much like Apple has been doing since the late Steve Jobs returned as that company's CEO in the late 1990s. At the same time, Ballmer appears determined to eliminate bureaucracy in hopes of making Microsoft operate more like a nimble startup able to quickly innovate - a goal that Google CEO Larry Page set out to achieve when he took over leadership of that company two years ago. Janney Capital Markets analyst Yun Kim said the reorganization helps align Microsoft's various divisions around its devices and services strategy, but he added that he's taking a ‘wait and see’ approach. ‘We continue to look for signs on how the company can leverage its success in the Xbox business to re-energize its current efforts in the tablet and smartphone markets,’ Kim wrote in a note to investors. BGC Financial's Gillis noted that major reorganizations ‘can serve as a negative distraction for months before potentially offering benefits.’ Microsoft shares rose $1.01, or nearly 3 percent, to close at $35.71 on Thursday. The Redmond, Washington-based company's stock is up 32 percent since the start of the year, compared with a 17 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. More woes: In addition to its industry-wide woes, Microsoft's Windows 8 is widely seen as a flop and likely added to pressures leading up to the shakeup .","CEO Steve Ballmer announced the unwieldy tech giant is headed 'in a bold new direction' as some herald the 'death of the PC'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:05 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 10 July 2013 . China's trade declined abruptly in June in a sign growth in the world's second-largest economy might be cooling even more sharply than expected. Exports fell by 3.1 per cent compared with a year earlier and imports contracted by 0.7 per cent, customs data showed today. Both were below forecasts of growth in the low single digits. China's economic growth has slowed this year and is expected to fall further due to weak global demand and an effort by the Chinese central bank to cool a credit boom. Slump: A view of the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai. Exports from . China have fallen by 3.1% and imports contracted by 0.7% . 'The export sector is faring very badly. It does suggest overall growth momentum is going to be weaker than we initially expected,' said Societe General economist Wei Yao. New communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment. But some analysts say the latest slowdown might be so deep they could be forced to temporarily reverse course and boost lending or government spending to stimulate growth. A decline in Chinese economic activity could have global repercussions, denting revenues for suppliers of commodities and industrial components such as Australia, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Lower Chinese demand already has depressed global prices for iron ore, copper and other raw materials, cooling an economic boom for exporters. The ruling party's growth target this year is 7.5 per cent, down by almost half from 2007's staggering growth rate of 14.2 per cent. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7 per cent in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7% in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards . Some private sector forecasters cut their growth outlook for the year, though to still robust levels above 7 percent, after a credit crunch hit China's financial markets last month. That came as the central bank tried to rein in a lending boom regulators worry could spiral out of control. 'The most likely outcome, in our view, is the Chinese economy going through a period of sluggish growth and adjustment,' said UBS economist Tao Wang in a report this week. Communist leaders have promised to promote private businesses that generate most of China's new jobs and wealth but have yet to make major changes. Retail sales have fallen short of official forecasts and a HSBC Corp. survey of manufacturers showed activity contracted in June for a second month. Still, Chinese leaders are unlikely to back away from efforts to overhaul the country's growth model, said Societe Generale's Yao. 'The plan is still to induce some short-term pain in exchange for long-term sustainability,' said Yao. 'That is still the most sensible choice, but sure, they need to make some marginal adjustments to make sure the economy doesn't slow too fast.' China's new communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment . Analysts expected China to report slower growth in trade due to a crackdown on misreporting of data by exporters as a way to evade currency controls and bring extra money into the country. But even with that taken into account, Wednesday's figures were below forecasts for exports to rise by up to 3.5 percent and imports to grow by up to 1.5 per cent. June's export growth was down from May's year-on-year gain of 13.5 per cent and import growth was down from 8.2 per cent. China's politically sensitive global trade surplus contracted by 12.4 per cent compared with a year earlier to $27.1 billion. Exports were $174.3 billion while imports were $147.2 billion. Growth in exports to the United States, China's biggest foreign market, fell to 1.8 percent from May's 3.5 percent. Exports to the 27-nation European Union contracted 3.9 per cent. The trade surplus with the U.S. contracted by 15.5 percent from a year earlier to $17.5 billion, but still one of this year's highest levels. The surplus with Europe shrank 20.3 per cent to $10.2 billion.","Exports have fallen by 3.1 percent and imports contracted by 0.7 percent .

"By . Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 14:08 EST, 11 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:01 EST, 11 July 2013 . A gossip website has been ordered to pay $338,00 in damages today after it defamed a former Bengals cheerleader by posting anonymous comments about her sleeping with the entire team and having STDs. Sarah Jones, 28, said outside the Kentucky court on Thursday that she was grateful the jury had taken all evidence into account. She added that 'the whole story will eventually come out' - but refused to elaborate. A jury of eight women and two men found that the 2009 posts on website thedirty.com about Sarah Jones were substantially false at federal court in Covington, Kentucky on Thursday. The posts were not related to the former teacher's 2012 guilty plea to charges she had sex with an underage former student Cody York to whom she is now reportedly engaged. Big win: Sarah Jones looked delighted outside the Kentucky court today after she successfully sued a gossip website for defamation and walked away with $330,000 . Success: Ex-Bengals cheerleader and teacher Sarah Jones won her defamation trial against a website which claimed she had sex with every football player on the team . Love affair: The posts on The Dirty were unrelated to the former high school teacher's guilty plea last year to having sex with 17-year-old student Cody York (right) The jury found website operator Nik . Richie acted with malice or reckless disregard in posting anonymous . submissions on his Arizona-based site. One of the posts alleged Jones had sex with every Bengals player, and the other said she probably had two sexually transmitted diseases. Jones had argued that the posts were false and malicious and caused her severe mental anguish. Richie denied any malice and said that he didn't write the posts and was not required to fact-check submissions before posting them. Pay-out: The posts on thedirty.com in 2009 claimed that Jones had sex with every player in the Bengals team and had STDs . Out of pocket: Website operator Nik Richie was ordered to pay ex-Bengals cheerleader Sarah Jones $338,000 in damages today after he defamed her . Jones cried at times during the trial, testifying that she at one time had thought about committing suicide. The jurors' ruling in favor of Sarah Jones in the defamation suit could have wide-ranging effects on freedom of speech online - if the decision is upheld. Website operator Nik Richie's attorney had argued that holding his client responsible for anonymous posts created by a third party would have a negative impact on the First Amendment right to free speech of other people and other websites. Following the ruling, Jones' lawyer Eric Deters said the decision 'changed America for the better'. Richie plans to launch an appeal immediately with his lawyer citing improper use of legislation. Speaking to TV cameras outside court, the lawyer said that Congress passed the Communications Decency Act in 1996 to prevent people in his client's position from being liable for third-party content. He added that hundreds of lawsuits similar to Jones have never made it court because of this legislation. She said she hoped the jury would award damages large enough to force the website to shut down and help prevent other people from being hurt by it. Jones filed the lawsuit more than three years ago. A January trial resulted in a hung jury. Jurors in the retrial deliberated almost 11 hours over two days before reaching the verdict. Outside court on Thursday, Jones said: 'I'm thankful for the jury that they took all the evidence into account today. Not everybody has the whole story and the jury was able to hear all the evidence. She added that the whole story 'will eventually come out', WLWT reported. David Gringas, attorney for Richie, said outside the Kentucky court that he and his client would seek a retrial after he believed jurors were given an incorrect decision by the judge. Jones’ lawyer Eric Deters told jurors on Wednesday in his closing arguments . they had a chance to send a message to sites across the country that . they should be careful and 'it's not right to defame people'.

Controversial: Jones, 28, and her 18-year-old former student are said to be engaged . The posts were unrelated to the former high school teacher's guilty plea last year to having sex with an underage ex-student. Gingras told jurors that lies Jones acknowledged she told involving her relationship with the teen were relevant to her credibility. Deters countered that Richie was the one on trial and jurors shouldn't consider Jones' previous actions related to the criminal case. Jones was allowed to avoid jail time with her plea, but was forbidden from teaching again. The 28-year-old still has a relationship with the now 18-year-old former student, and the two are said to be engaged. Jurors have to determine whether the posts were false and whether Richie knew the comments were false or had doubts about their truthfulness when they were posted.

'You might put him out of business, but . you’re not going to put the entire Internet out of business.' Gingras . said Jones did not suffer financial loss or medical problems from the . posts and had asked that the jury award a nominal amount of $1 if they . find for her. Deters said they are not seeking a specific amount but said Jones suffered mental anguish. 'Deliver justice to him,' Deters said, pointing to Richie. 'Deliver mercy to her.'

As a flash flood raged down a Colorado highway and swept dozens of cars away, one driver caught on tape his wild ride down a river of mud. John Schroyer was among those stranded by the relentless, black water after the devastating Black Forest fires left water with nowhere else to go but down a mountain road after a storm Wednesday. At least 25 drivers were left stranded in on highway 24 in Manitou Springs, but only Schroyer caught his terrifying experience on video. Scroll down for video... Roller coaster: John Schroyer was caught in a raging river of black mud, which he in turn caught on video . Cars littered a four-mile stretch road and traffic was brought to a halt after an everyday storm near a scar left by wildfires turned into something totally out of the ordinary. ‘I was driving up 24, and it wasn't raining that hard, and then all of a sudden, cars just started stopping in front of me,’ Schroyer told the Colorado Springs Gazette, where he happens to be the video editor. What would have been a dream moment for some journalists became a nightmare as Schroyer quickly became his own subject. ‘I looked down for a minute, and when I glanced back up, a giant black wave of mud slammed into my car,’ he said. More problems: Highway 24 in Manitou Springs, Colorado was totally washed out when floods in part caused by a the nearby Black Forest forest fires crashed down the mountainous road . 'Oh my god!': Schroyer was overtaken by the waters, which came down the road all at once, washing out the highway for three hours . Doing his job: Schroyer, a video editor for the Colorado Springs Gazette, dutifully kept taping as he was washed further down the mountain . The dutiful Schroyer continued taking footage as a drive in his Subaru became a flume ride. Whisked from side to side without coming to a halt, Schroyer’s car smashed into the side of the mountain and into light poles repeatedly. Muddy waters splashed onto his windshield as he tried to keep steering through the onslaught before finally coming to a halt in the middle of the waters. Like toys: As many as 25 cars littered the side of Highway 24 Wednesday, though no one was injured . Thankful: Amazingly, no one was injured, though the storm continued into the night . Unexpected: Mud covers the ramp leading from Manitou Springs, Colorado after the flash flood and mudslide Wednesday . ‘The flood waters kept going and going, and I was stuck in my car for probably half an hour,’ he said. Eventually, Schroyer was able to climb atop his car, as bystanders and fellow stranded drivers stood by helplessly, and then leap to solid ground. Despite the unbelievable footage, no injuries were reported following the flood, though Highway 24 was completely shut down for three hours. Helpless: Bystanders watched helplessly as other cars were tossed down the road . Waist deep: A man digs his van out after Wednesday's flood. Muddy waters as high as 2.5 feet swept dozens of drivers down Highway 24 . Getting out: Firefighters help parents and children cross floodwaters by laying down a makeshift bridge . Stuck: Cars were tossed down a four-mile stretch Wednesday. On Thursday, teams with snow plows began digging out cars that remained stuck . An area church became a shelter for those left stranded on the side of the road as thunderstorm warnings continued into the evening. According to the National Weather Service, the flooding was the result of both the recent devastating Black Forest fire and last year’s Waldo Canyon fire. Homes in the area, after so many were lost to the fires that contributed to the flood, were nonetheless all spared any damage, authorities said. ‘I think the lesson learned here is that this was a demonstration of the speed and the power in which that water can move,’ El Paso County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Jeff Kramer said. ‘Be very aware of the weather forecast and weather in the area,’ he said, ‘and be mindful of the dangers that we're going to continue to face from the threat of flash flooding up in that area.’ Safety: A bulldozer moves away mud after feet of mud crashed down the mountain in Manitou Springs, Colorado.

"By . Lucy Cavendish . PUBLISHED: . 16:57 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:57 EST, 11 July 2013 . Last Saturday evening she started terrorising us again. I was in the sitting room with my three sons, Raymond 16, Leonard, ten, and Jerry, eight, when the all-too-familiar wailing started. We'd just settled down with a Chinese takeaway to watch Batman Returns, excited about a lovely evening together after seeing off the smallest member of our family, six-year-old Ottoline, on a sleepover. 'See you tomorrow,' we trilled at her, waving her off. Then, out of earshot, the boys let out a whoop of delight. My little madam: Lucy with her six-year-old daughter Ottoline . Ottoline would undoubtedly have started screaming before we'd even sat down. She would probably have refused the meal before announcing she wouldn't watch a 'boys' movie - demanding something like Barbie instead. Because although Ottoline may look angelic, she acts like a little demon. She bites. She scratches. She shouts and wails, caterwauling for hours if she doesn't get what she wants. And she never wants to go to bed. After hours spent coaxing and cajoling her, I inevitably lose my temper, possibly even pushing her up the stairs, from where her screams can last up to an hour. So, most Saturday nights, we run out of time to do anything together at all. But this time I had managed to persuade a friend to take Ottoline for the night - promising endless babysitting (in fact, almost having to pay her). She has a daughter the same age (a lovely, well-behaved one) and, weirdly, our two girls seem to get on. What could go wrong? I was so looking forward to spending time with my sons. The boys and I are a harmonious unit when left alone, but we had only just settled down for some crispy duck when we heard it outside: the unmistakeable sound of my daughter shouting her head off. 'What's that?' asked Jerry, nervously. 'Is it Ottoline?' said a panicky Leonard. Raymond calmly reached for the remote control and turned the volume up. 'Just ignore it,' he said. 'It's our ears playing tricks on us.' A little demon: She scratches, she shouts, and wails. And she never wants to go to bed. Two minutes later there was a frantic banging on the front door. And there, on the doorstep, was my little girl, red-eyed and screaming. 'I WANT COME HOME!' she wailed, inconsolably. My friend, standing beside her, shrugged, looking desperate. 'Sorry,' she said. 'She just wouldn't settle.' In one fell swoop our lovely evening was destroyed - just like every other evening and almost every other day. I couldn't help reminding myself, I had wanted this - I did everything I could to ensure I got a girl after three boys. Although every expectant mother insists she doesn't care what sex her child is, when surveyed last year, 45  per cent of women admitted they longed for a girl. I even bought a DIY gender selection 'kit' off the internet, containing a thermometer so I could plot my ovulation days and strict advice on my diet and even the position in which I had sex. Did it work? Who can tell . . . all I know is that Ottoline, my longed-for little girl, arrived nine months later. This all came to mind when I was listening last week to a debate on whether gender selection, for social reasons, should be made legal in the UK. A leading medical ethicist feels it should. 'Be careful what you wish for!' I shouted at the radio. My Ottoline seemed to hit the terrible twos and never leave them behind. Whereas my sons are sweetness and light, Ottoline is loud, noisy, screechy and demanding. We live in a state of shock - a six-year-old girl's version of martial law. Everything with her is a trial: from washing her hair (she hates that) to cutting her nails (she hates that even more) to getting her dressed (this invokes hours of screaming). And so we all creep around her - it's like treading on eggshells stuffed with Semtex. I've tried to put my foot down, but Ottoline has defied everything. One day I yelled (in extreme frustration): 'Right that's it! I am going to smack you!' 'Oh are you?' she said, cool as a cucumber. 'Go on then - and see if I care.' She then proffered up her bottom in such an insouciant way that the fire in my belly was quenched. But we still all love her to death. She is the apple of my eye, and her brothers could not be kinder. But how does she repay them? With routine physical and verbal abuse. Jerry, she attacks - biting and scratching. Leonard is so kind to her it makes me want to weep when she turns on him and screams: 'Go away, Piggy!' Even Raymond, who is possessed of almost super-human levels of sangfroid, has given up on her. This is not how it was supposed to be. For years, all I ever wanted was a baby girl. I had visions of us shopping together, reading Flower Fairies, pressing blossom, maybe riding ponies and horses. So I was in shock when I had Raymond. I was even more in shock when I had two more boys. My life turned into one long paean to Thomas the Tank Engine and pulling legs off spiders. Oh brother: Ottoline's brothers are well-behaved, in contrast to their out-of-control sister . I'd almost given up on having a girl until I stumbled on a website filled with old wives' tales that promised to guarantee one. Soon, I was cutting down on protein and bulking up on carbs and dairy to decrease the acidity of my womb, before insisting my then-husband and I (we separated 18 months ago) made love in the missionary position - afterwards lying prone for an hour to give the 'female' swimmers the best chance of success. When I found I was pregnant with a daughter, I was so happy I cried for days. And after I gave birth in April 2007, I spent days on end marvelling at her. A girl! A girl! Yes, Ottoline has completed our family, but not quite in the way I expected. I love her so much my bones hurt, but I have never experienced anything as exhausting as her. I thought I knew how to do this mothering lark, but Ottoline's behaviour drives me to tears. I am sure she has been sent here to teach us all a lesson. I'm just not sure what that is. Now, I have been through all the reasons why she might be such a handful. Is it because she is the only girl? She complains she has 'no one to play with' and wishes she has a sister. But I am 46. This is not going to happen. It's not as if she wants for attention. Her brothers think she is spoiled because I spend so much time and money satiating her desire for pink plastic tat. Her room is full of dolls and dressing-up clothes. Bossy: There's no doubt Ottoline is a handful - but why? She has a constant stream of friends round for playdates and sleepovers - although she often screams at them so badly that they ask, tearfully, if they can go home. I wonder if it's all because she's the baby of the family. But I am the youngest of four and not at all like that. My mother says I was a bit bossy, but not in Ottoline's league. Then I feel the terrible guilt at the fact that her father and I have separated. She is very much a Daddy's girl, and the past 18 months must have been terrible for her. But Ottoline sees her father a lot and her behaviour is no worse than before we split. I have done a straw poll of other mums and the simple answer seems to be that it is an age thing. Three friends of mine have told me how bossy their daughters are compared with their sons - so much so, that one of them is even sending her girl off to boarding school as soon as she turns seven. When I tell my male friends about her behaviour, they snigger: 'Do you know yourself at all?' one said to me, raising an eyebrow. Perhaps I was a little horror and my mother just doesn't want to tell me. Or maybe I was so dreadful, she's simply blocked it all out. We'll always love Ottoline to bits. But I wish she would carry on being herself - only less so. We all need some peace.","Lucy pined for a daughter and was overjoyed when she gave birth to one .

The civil service chief is understood to have lost the confidence of the Prime Minister and Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary. Sir Bob Kerslake (left) is understood to have lost the confidence of the Prime Minister David Cameron (right) This week a progress report on the Government’s civil service reform plan found that only seven of 18 targets had been met since it was unveiled last year. There are rumours Mr Cameron has asked Sir Jeremy to move Sir Bob aside amid fears he was not pushing the agenda hard enough. Sir Bob has two jobs – he is head of the civil service but also permanent secretary of the Department for Communities and Local Government. It has led to concerns that he does not have enough time to devote to both tasks. Downing Street denied the rumours last night, and said Sir Bob had Mr Cameron’s full support. But other sources said that, although Sir Bob is safe for now, he could be given the chop as civil service head late on – while keeping his local government department position. One source said: ‘There is some disappointment about the progress that has been made on civil service reform. ‘Progress has been slow and some have questioned whether the right leadership is in place.’","Sir Bob Kerslake is taking the flak for the perceived failure of mandarins to modernise .

The teen was rushed to Broward Health Medical center after the horrific accident. Cunningham said his prognosis was grim when he arrived. The next few days would be critical for the 14-year-old. 'After the fifth day he woke up. He opened his eyes,' his father said. 'That day the doctor said it's a 50-50 chance. So we've been waiting day by day.' On June 13, Jerry was transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital. 'On the second day that I was here, he called me Dad. On the second day he called Mom, Dad, so he started talking and I saw him, he walks, he laughs,' Cunningham said. Miracle: The teen, pictured, was given a slim chance of survival by doctors . Injuries: Cunningham, pictured left and right, suffered fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and he was put in a medically induced coma . Emotional: Jerry's father, Gerald Cunningham, pictured, became emotional talking about his son's recovery at a press conference . Jerry suffered a severe traumatic brain . injury and the damage to his left leg meant he couldn't put weight on. He had to be fed through a tube. 'He didn't know where he was, who he was, what was going on. He didn't know anything,' said Seema Khurana, director of pediatric rehabilitation at Jackson, according to the Miami Herald. After a week at Jackson, the teen was sleeping, answering some questions and had put weight on his foot. He was improving every day. 'He is a miracle,' she told the Sun Sentinel, adding that his parents have been at Jerry's bedside and at his therapies sessions every day, which has made a big difference. Cunningham makes his son a special breakfast every morning and quizzes him on the menu to help with his memory. 'That's part of the therapy. They do their part and I do mine,' Cunningham said. When he gets home, Jerry will begin . stage two of his recovery as an outpatient. This involves three sessions . of therapy a week and lessons with a teacher. He has already learned to walk again by himself, though he's still shaky and requires supervision. 'He's like a baby,' his father said. 'He's not a 14-year-old boy, but rather a baby that has to learn everything again.' His . memory, however, is the biggest deficit, speech pathologist Jennifer . Rey said. She said he was able to remember things right away, but . forgets after a few seconds. But his long-term memory remains intact and . doctors are hopeful his retention will improve.

According to the Sun Sentinel, the . tragedy took place at around 9 a.m. on May 10 in front of scores of . horrified passengers, and was filmed by the Broward County Transit bus's . security cameras, which cover eight angles.

From the moment of his ill-fated operation in 1953 Henry Molaison became world famous, yet few people knew his name. Until his death at the age of 82 in 2008, the Connecticut man who had lost his ability to form and store new memories was known simply as HM to the scores of scientists and researchers studying his case. Although he had been a willing test subject for neurologists since 1957, Mr Molaison's unique condition whereby his memory is wiped after about 30 seconds, was protected by those who researched him and the nursing home staff who cared for him. Present tense: Henry Molaison lost the ability to form and retain new memories after experimental brain surgery in 1953 . 'His case appeared in so many textbooks . they inspired students to pursue careers in neuroscience. The world's . fascination with memory took off,' Suzanne Corkin, who studied . Mr Molaison from 1962 until his death, said. 'Everyday people wanted to know what it was . like to always live in the moment ... He touched an unknown number of . lives,' she told the Hartford Courant. Mr Molaison, who had suffered from epilepsy when he was a teenager, was 27 when a famous surgeon removed part of his brain in the belief that it would ease his seizures. From the moment William Beecher Scoville operated on Mr Molaison, he lost the ability to retain new information after about 30 seconds. While Mr Molaison may have lost the ability to learn, his condition helped move forward knowledge of the brain. Family: Henry Molaison with his parents Lizzie and Gus, who cared for him before he moved into a Connecticut nursing home . Lifetime's work: Suzanne Corkin has written about her decades of studying Henry Molaison . Bright: Henry Molaison was 27 when surgery to help ease his epilepsy robbed him of his memory-making ability . 'Henry taught us so much about the . brain. He taught us that you can be smart and still have a horrible . memory. He taught us that memory was localized in the hippocampal area,' Ms Corkin said. 'He taught us that not all kinds of learning memory was . impaired in amnesia. In Henry, what was preserved was motor skills, . conditioning ... and procedures.' The surgery that was supposed to ease Mr Molaison's epilepsy instead trapped him permanently in the moment. Although he was never able to form a new memory, Ms Corkin said that he was nearly always happy, friendly and was enthusiastic about helping researchers. 'He . always lived in the moment, fully accepting the events of daily life. From the time of the operation, every new person he met was forever a . stranger, yet he approached each one with openness and trust. He . remained as good natured and pleasant as the polite, quiet person his . high-school classmates knew,' Ms Corkin wrote. She added that he also liked to make jokes, telling NPR: 'He had a wonderful sense of humor, and he would come up with little quips that were appropriate to a specific moment, nothing that he had made up before, rehearsed or he knew from his preoperative life.' Ms Corkin, who studied Mr Molaison's case until his death, and who was also raised in Hartford, Connecticut, has now written a book about the man who had such a lasting impact on memory research. Long term loss: Henry at his family home in 1958, four years after experimental surgery led to memory loss . Her book, Permanent Present Tense, gives more details about Mr Molaison's life and her observations of him during the time she knew him. Ms Corkin also has a connection to the doctor who performed the ill-fated surgery on him. Her family lived opposite him when she was a schoolgirl. When the surgeon operated on Mr Molaison however, he damaged his hippocampus, which is responsible for long-term memory. 'We didn't know that memory was . localized in that particular part of the brain. That was one of the big . discoveries that came from studying Henry,' Ms Corkin said. Her book includes research findings as well as details of Mr Molaison's daily routine and his brief thoughts on his life. One of the first aspects of his conditions scientists noticed was that intelligence and memory are separate entities. After the operation his IQ remained slightly above average and his ability to solve problems was unaffected by the operation. Scientists discovered that although he could not remember the tasks they had set him, his ability to complete them improved each time. And, although he met Corkin after his operation, over time he became familiar with her, believing that he had known her at high school. One of his favorite pastimes was also completing crossword puzzles in the nursing home where he lived, after his parents were no longer able to care for him. Unchanged: Henry pictured in the 1970s. His inability to form new memories left him trapped in the life he lived before the 1953 operation . However, he was aware he had trouble remembering and once said: 'At this moment everything looks clear to me, but what happened just before? That's what worries me. It's like waking from a dream. I just don't remember,' according to The Daily Telegraph. Although Mr Molaison was considered one of the most important case studies in brain research, Dr Corkin said the sense of his importance was lost on him. 'Every now and then I would tell him he was very famous and a lot of people knew about him in the world of scientists,' Dr Corkin told NPR. 'He would get this little sheepish grin and say, ""Oh, you know, isn't that nice"". You could see that it was heartwarming for him. But... of course, as soon as he was distracted, he forgot.' Mr Moliason is still making a contribution to science. His brain was donated for research purposes after his death.","Henry Molaison was studied by hundreds of scientists .

But to the fury of victims and justice campaigners, he was sentenced to just 15 months’ imprisonment, of which he will serve half – meaning barely two weeks inside for each victim. The Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC, said he had to sentence Hall, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, according to the guidelines in place at the time of the offences. But even then the maximum sentence for the most serious offences he committed was five years. Today it would be ten years. The Government’s most senior law officer, Attorney General Dominic Grieve, was deluged with more than 150 complaints about the sentence. Mr Grieve, who has the power to send cases to the Court of Appeal if he considers the sentence ‘unduly lenient’, announced yesterday the Hall case would be referred. A spokesman for Mr Grieve said: ‘Having carefully reviewed this case, the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC MP, has decided to refer the sentence of Stuart Hall to the Court of Appeal for review. Locked up: Hall is desperately scrambling to save his fortune by trying to pay off victims of his sexual abuse, including Susan Harrison (right) with 'paltry' out-of-court settlements . ‘The case will in due course be heard . by three Court of Appeal judges who will decide whether or not the . sentence is unduly lenient and whether they should increase the . sentence.’ The case is expected to be heard in around six weeks’ time. When the claims against Hall, 83, first emerged he flatly denied them and protested his innocence. After he was first arrested last . December, he told police his victims were all lying as part of a . ‘vendetta going on against people in the public eye’. But the publicity generated by his arrest led to more victims coming forward with overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Convicted: The former It's A Knockout presenter is being sued by at least 17 women in relation to harm and injuries they suffered at his hands . The court heard his crimes spanned . nearly 20 years, between 1967 and 1986, with assaults taking place on . BBC premises and at his home. He even abused family friends. On Wednesday, the Mail revealed the . former It’s a Knockout presenter was trying to pay off his victims with . ‘paltry’ out-of-court settlements. The multi-millionaire signed over the . deeds of his £2million house to his wife just before he was jailed, and . is now offering those he abused as little as £2,000 to prevent them . claiming compensation.

Susan Harrison, who was 16 when Hall . lured her to BBC premises on the false pretext of helping her record a . song, before attacking her in his car, has been offered just £5,000 in . an out-of-court settlement.

Leon Quarless was arrested after he had been handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers on a flight from Palma, Majorca, to Blackpool . A drunk man who handed out money to fellow passengers on a flight from Majorca has lost nearly £5,000 which he had on him at the time. Police have claimed Leon Quarless, 46, who was arrested after his Jet2 flight from Palma, Majorca, touched down at its destination in Blackpool, Lancashire, had the money because he was involved in drug dealing. During the flight the pilot had radioed ahead and reported how Quarless had been drinking and then went up and down the aisle handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers. He was later fined in June last year £320 for being drunk on an aircraft. Now, a court has ruled police can keep the rest of the money which was found on him - a total of £4,972. Following his initial fine, Lancashire Police started a Proceeds of Crime Act into Quarless, from Formby, Merseyside, Blackpool Magistrates heard. Police financial investigator Alan Todd told how when Quarless was questioned about his money giveaway he suddenly removed a SIM card from his phone and put it in his mouth and crunched it up with his teeth. He was also found to be carrying a driving licence under the name Joseph Noone. The investigator told the court: 'This man does not appear to have a job. The Inland Revenue has never heard of him and has no records on him whatsoever. 'He has however boarded 50 flights in two years out of the UK mostly to Spain and Holland. '£70,000 in cash has gone through his various bank accounts during that time. 'Merseyside Police have intelligence that he may be involved in drugs and we believe this money has come about because of drug dealing.' Prosecutor Sue McLane said : 'It is fair to say that if this money we wish to seize came about legally he would have been banging on our doors to ask for it back.' Magistrates agreed to the seizure of the money found on Quarless which will now be going into a real charity fund run by the Chief Constable.

A BMW driver and an accomplice are believed to be deliberately injuring cyclists by pushing them off their bikes before driving away. Three cyclists from Leicestershire have reported being forced from their bikes by an old-style silver BMW in three separate incidents in less than a week. Police are now investigating the recent spate of attacks - the latest victim was left with a broken collarbone when he was forced off the road on Saturday afternoon. The lorry driver from Stoney Stanton broke his collarbone as he came off his bike at 25mph and has to take 12 weeks off work . Cyclist Martin Webster was riding his bike and got pushed off by a passenger in a passing car . All three cyclists reported that a silver BMW had driven up to them before each incident - two of the cyclists said a passenger in the car reached out and pushed them. Andy Limb, 55, was riding his bike at about 25mph during a training run in Croft on Saturday afternoon when a BMW car swerved and slowed to his speed. 'The car pulled up alongside and then dived into me, forcing me on to the gravel and sending me over the handlebars,' he told the Leicester Mercury. 'I didn't really hear him coming and I didn't see who was in the car because they appeared from behind,' he said. The lorry driver from Stoney Stanton broke his collarbone as he came off his bike at 25mph - he has to take 12 weeks off work and can't attend a cycling holiday in France. Martin Webster suffered bruising and grazing to his leg and shoulder after he was shoved off his bicycle . Attack: Mr Limb 55, was riding his bike at about 25mph along Standton Road, pictured, in Croft on Saturday afternoon when a BMW car swerved and slowed to his speed . 'There is a big cycling community around here and all of them are now very nervous. Now every time they get on a bike they are looking over their shoulder,' he told The Independent. Two days earlier Martin Webster, who runs a bicycle shop in Wigston, was also attacked. 'Somebody from the car pushed me on to quite a deep grass verge,' he told the BBC. 'I was going quite fast, doing about 30mph and I went flying over the handlebars. 'I don't think they realise the seriousness of what could happen. I could have had a broken neck.' Mr Webster suffered bruising and grazing to his leg and shoulder. Last Monday Colin Haynes, 48, from North Kilworth, was cycling home after work along at about 4pm when he experienced a similar attack. He fell from his bike after a silver BMW pulled up next to him, and the passenger leaned out and pushed him. 'They need to be caught because someone . could so easily be killed. You wouldn't jump out of a car at 15 or 20 . miles-an-hour, and this is the same thing,' Mr Limb said. A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said: 'We are taking these reports very seriously.

A policeman's daughter accidentally killed a celebrated opera singer and herself when she drove away sobbing from a break-up with her boyfriend, an inquest heard. Father-of-two Robert Poulton died after Jessica Christie-Sturges, 19, drifted onto the wrong side of the road and smashed into his car head-on. Baritone Mr Poulton, 55, who sang at the Royal Opera House and Glyndebourne, was heading to his home in Heathfield, East Sussex, when his Fiat was hit by Miss Christie-Sturges' Ford. Opera singer Robert Poulton, 55, and sales assistant Jessica Christie-Sturges, 19, both died in the accident . She died from multiple injuries at the scene and Mr Poulton died after suffering a heart attack on his way to hospital, an inquest heard. The first paramedic at the scene was delayed because his sat-nav sent him the wrong way, the hearing was told, and another doctor called was then diverted to another incident. When emergency workers did arrive at the accident on the B2102 at Cross-in-Hand, near Heathfield, Mr Poulton, who did not realise the severity of his internal injuries, told them to tend to Miss Christie-Sturges first. He died later after suffering a heart attack caused by internal injuries suffered as a result of his ribs being broken by his seatbelt. Ten minutes before the accident, Miss Christie-Sturges had been told by her boyfriend Alex Bland that he was ending their nine-month romance because he felt it hard to trust her. Mr Bland said Jessica left his home in Cross-in-Hand around 8.30pm on the night of the crash last October. Bariton Robert Poulton, 55, seen here in La Traviata, died in a head-on smash in Sussex in October last year . Country road: The fatal crash happened on the B2102 at the village of Cross-in-Hand in East Sussex . He said: 'We discussed how it [our . relationship] did not work. 'She was lovely to be around and very . genuine but at times I felt hard to trust.' He said around 7pm she left his home . for around ten minutes before returning. At this stage, he said, she was . 'sobbing' and very upset but calmed down. He offered to drive her when she left his home for the second - and final - time but she said no. Ten minutes later, he sent her a final text saying 'I'm sorry Jess. Take care of yourself', but by that time she was already dead. The inquest in Eastbourne heard that sales assistant Miss Christie-Sturges, whose father is a Metropolitan Police officer, was three-quarters on the wrong side of the road when she hit Mr. Poulton's car. Mr Poulton, who had two sons, Thomas, 22, and William, 13, was driving home after leaving his family at their holiday home in Wales to prepare for a performance the next day. Tragedy: The 19-year-old died at scene in the crash . The first people at the scene found . Mr Poulton talking, the inquest was told. He described hearing a 'bang' and then waking up, and anxiously asked after Jessica repeatedly. Accident investigator PC Paul Banks said both cars were travelling at about 60mph. He said it was likely Jessica . 'drifted across' the carriageway and added: 'Miss Christie-Sturges was . almost entirely on the wrong side of the road.' The inquest also heard how the initial paramedic at the scene had gone to the wrong location because of a sat nav blunder. Chris Wilkinson, the assistant coroner for East Sussex, said he believed Jessica had been 'distressed by her break up' and suffered a 'momentary lapse in concentration' and recorded a verdict of accidental death. Philippa Poulton, Mr Poulton's widow, said: 'Rob was wonderful. He was a loving father and a great man. 'Asking how the other driver was when he was injured - that was him in a nutshell. He was a wonderful singer, but he was so much more than that. 'I still listen to his music. We had 30 years together. A love like that doesn't die; it is an enduring love.' Miss Christie-Sturges' family previously described her as 'a fun-loving 19-year-old who touched the hearts of so many'.","Robert Poulton, 55, died after Jessica Christie-Sturges, 19, crashed into him .

Former director general: Mark Thompson claimed the BBC Trust was aware of a controversial payoff worth almost £1million given to a senior executive . The BBC’s former director general Mark Thompson yesterday accused its governing body of misleading MPs over a £949,000 severance payoff to one of its top executives. A war of words – described by MPs as a ‘soap opera’ – exploded between Mr Thompson and the BBC Trust as emails emerged that cast doubt on the evidence given by its chairman Chris Patten to a Commons inquiry. Lord Patten told the public accounts committee on Wednesday the Trust had not been given details of the  massive payment to former deputy director Mark Byford, who was made redundant in 2010. Asked whether he felt he should have been told the details of the deal, Lord Patten said: ‘Yes, and if you call in due course the previous director general of the BBC I will be as interested as you are as to why we didn’t know.’ However correspondence has now emerged showing Mr Thompson, head of the BBC executive at the time, informed the Trust that Byford and his colleague Sharon Baylay, director of marketing, would be given ‘maximum payments’. An email from his office, dated October 8, 2010, stated they would not be served formal notice of their redundancy until ‘calendar year 2011’, despite being informed of their departure months earlier. The revelation triggered a war of words between Mr Thompson and the Trust – prompting the public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge to brand the whole affair a ‘soap opera’. She said: ‘There are serious accusations flying around about whether or not the director general was open and honest with the Trust, and counter-accusations about whether the Trust was open and honest with us. ‘It is becoming a soap opera, and we need to get to the bottom of it.’ Hearing: Asked yesterday why he did not know some payoffs had gone beyond what was contractually needed, Lord Patten appeared to suggest to the Public Accounts Committee that Mr Thompson should give evidence . Miss Hodge said she now plans to hold a . fresh inquiry with a raft of current and former executives – including . Mr Thompson and former chairman Sir Michael Lyons – expected to be . called as witnesses. The hearing follows a devastating report by the . National Audit Office, which found the BBC handed out £369million to its . staff over eight years. In it, the Byford deal was held up for special . criticism. The NAO found he was wrongly paid . £474,500 for 12 months’ ‘pay in lieu of notice’, despite serving eight . months of his notice period on full pay. It meant he was effectively . paid twice for that period and pocketed almost twice what he was . contractually entitled to. Lord Patten admitted to MPs the Trust . had been made aware of the pay-off in Mr Thompson’s email, but claimed . it had been assured it was ‘within contractual terms’. But yesterday, Mr Thompson, who left . the BBC in September to become CEO of the New York Times Company, . accused the Trust of ‘inaccuracies’. A close friend said he was . ‘gobsmacked and surprised’ to hear Lord Patten’s evidence. Big payoff: Former deputy director general Mark Byford left the BBC after 31 years of service with around £950,000 when his post closed . Mr Thompson said the Trust was ‘fully . informed in advance, in writing as well as orally, about the proposed . severance packages for Mark Byford and [marketing director] Sharon . Baylay’. He added: ‘Specifically, they were . told it was proposed that in both cases formal notice would not be . served immediately but in the following year… I had made sure the Trust . were aware of and understood all potentially contentious issues. The . Trust had every opportunity to express any concerns about the proposals . before they were approved.’ Trust member Anthony Fry had told MPs yesterday that members of the Trust were not always included in decision-making. Appearance: BBC Trust member Anthony Fry (front right) had told the Public Accounts Committee that members of the Trust - chaired by Lord Patten (centre right) - were not always included in decision-making . Mr Thompson, who had been expected to . appear before the public accounts committee in November, is now likely . to be called to give evidence earlier. A Trust spokesman said: ‘The material . being quoted today was shared with the NAO in the course of their . review. They noted that the Trust had no role in the approval process . but were being given this material for information and to provide . assurance that payments to Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay were to be made . on the basis of contractual terms. ‘The NAO’s conclusions were the basis . for our evidence given to the PAC yesterday and like the NAO, we see . nothing in this correspondence which disproves any of their . conclusions.’ Salary: Head of HR Lucy Adams was branded as 'disingenuous' about her own pay . The Corporation’s director of human resources was branded as ‘disingenuous’ about her own salary while giving evidence to MPs. Lucy Adams signed off many of the most contentious pay-offs, including the Byford deal. When Margaret Hodge quizzed her on her own £320,000 salary, she said she had accepted a  ‘significant drop’ to join the BBC. However, documents seen by the Daily Mail reveal she was given a ‘higher level of guaranteed salary’ than in her previous job as HR head of legal firm Eversheds. Yesterday, Tory MP Richard Bacon said: ‘Do I find it surprising some witnesses are somewhat disingenuous? No.’ Minutes from the BBC remuneration committee in February 2009 said: ‘Although the total proposed is lower than the package Lucy can currently potentially earn, it has a higher level of guaranteed salary and lower element of variable pay.’ Miss Adams told MPs she felt ‘uncomfortable’ signing off the Byford deal, but said it was in line with a ‘pervading culture’, adding: ‘I think as an organisation we made a number of decisions which were not in the best interests of the licence fee payer.’","Mark Thompson takes issue with claims Trust wasn't aware of package .

Kevin Gifford starts each working day with a spring in his step and a tune in his head as he completes his morning milk-round. But the cheerful father of three has been told to pipe down by his employers after five residents on his delivery route of around 340 houses complained about his whistling. Dairy bosses have issued Mr Gifford with a formal warning to curb the habit – a decision he condemned yesterday. Mr Gifford, who delivers to homes in Leicester, said: ‘A whistling milkman is part of British life but they want to stop it. It’s madness.’ He told the Sun newspaper: ‘I think they were claiming breaching the peace or something ridiculous. They say I woke them up. ‘They should just roll over and go back to sleep, but these people decided to phone the dairy. ‘Are they going to complain about the birds singing as well? They make more noise than I do.’ Mr Gifford, 52, listens to songs such as the hit 500 Miles by The Proclaimers on his headphones to perk himself up in the morning. He added: ‘If I know the words I sing and if I don’t, I whistle. ‘I think I cheer people up because I’m not very good at singing – I won’t be going on X Factor, that’s for sure. ‘Lots of my customers love it. One lady came out of her house at 4.30am to say she thought it was wonderful, but I guess another tradition is getting a kicking.’ Mr Gifford has been told that he can resume singing and whistling after 8am, when his round is finished. ‘All the other milkmen think it’s stupid. I just think it’s a storm in a teacup,’ he said. ‘When I was a kid the binman, the postman and everybody made a noise and nobody complained. ‘I’m . always in a good mood in the morning.

The quango chief promising MPs a £7,600 pay rise faced a furious public and political backlash yesterday – with one Cabinet Minister telling him to ‘stick it’. Sir Ian Kennedy was lambasted by voters during a radio phone-in after confirming plans to give MPs an 11 per cent pay rise, and suggesting it was a ‘very good deal’ for the taxpayer. Callers to Victoria Derbyshire’s Radio Five show branded the proposals ‘obscene’ and ‘outrageous’, and asked Sir Ian: ‘What planet are you living on?’ Sir Ian, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), also came under fire from leading politicians. Asked whether the increase should go ahead, Education Secretary Michael Gove said: ‘Absolutely not. MPs are incredibly well paid at the moment anyway, as are ministers. 'Ipsa is a bit of a silly organisation anyway. Pay rise? They can stick it.’ Nick Clegg, who will refuse the rise, said the proposal was not ‘remotely justifiable’ at a time when public sector wage increases were capped at 1 per cent. Ed Miliband put pressure on David Cameron by saying he too would refuse the rise. Downing Street refused to say whether the Prime Minister would take the pay increase, but said he thought MPs’ pay ‘should not be going up while public sector pay is being constrained’. Ipsa wants to introduce the pay rise, along with a package of cuts to MPs’ pensions and perks, after the 2015 election. But there were growing indications last night that it could be delayed until at least 2016, when the public sector wage cap is due to end. A government source said party leaders were likely to order MPs to refuse the rise if it is brought in before 2016. ‘Hopefully Ipsa will see sense and . either abandon this proposal or at least delay it,’ the source said. ‘If . they don’t, you will see the parties lay down the law to MPs that they . cannot take it while pay restraint in the public sector is continuing.’ Trade unions reacted angrily to the . proposal, and warned a wave of industrial action could follow if MPs . were handed an 11 per cent rise. RMT general-secretary Bob Crow said: . ‘If inflation-busting pay increases are good enough for the political . class then they are good enough for nurses, transport workers, . firefighters and the rest of the working class.’ The rise would leave MPs three times richer than the average person in Britain . The proposals would see MPs’ basic pay rise from £66,396 to £74,000. But they would also have their . gold-plated pensions cut back, see reductions to their controversial . ‘golden handshake’ payments, and lose perks such as free TV licences. These cuts will partially offset the cost of the pay rise, leaving taxpayers with a total extra bill of £500,000. MPs would also be paid to produce an . ‘annual report’ on their activities to help ‘inform’ voters about their . jobs. Critics said the reports were likely to be taxpayer-funded ‘puff . pieces’. Sir Ian, who is paid £700 a day to . advise on MPs’ expenses, said it was time to allow their pay to ‘catch . up’ after years of being suppressed. Ipsa said the £74,000 was at the . ‘lower end’ of what it thought MPs deserved to be paid. Its review had . concluded MPs might deserve as much as £83,430 but decided to recommend . the lower amount because of the ‘current difficult circumstances’. An Ipsa survey found that two-thirds . of MPs believe they are underpaid. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said politics . would struggle to attract high-calibre people unless MPs were given a . major pay hike. He added: ‘MPs are paid about the . same as a junior school headmistress or headmaster. I’ve got lots and . lots of those in my constituency, there is only one MP. ‘It is public service. We expect that . we are not going to earn the money that we could have earned in the . private sector but there has to be some balance in there.’ Many MPs have attacked Ipsa for being . bureaucratic and costly. Tory Douglas Carswell said the pay proposal . underlined the case for the quango to be scrapped. He added: ‘Faced with . a choice between taking a pay hike, or taking the axe to Ipsa, I would . vote to scrap Ipsa every time.’ David Cameron has previously called a large rise 'unthinkable' while Nick Clegg said he would not accept one .","Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will take pay to £74,000 .

A prolific thief who raided the hotel suite of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and stole more than £100,000-worth of his wife's designer jewellery was on licence at the time, it has emerged. A court heard Jamie Filan, 32, had also targeted the suite of a wealthy businessman in the Savoy just three days before he crept into Mourinho's penthouse at the five-star Wyndham Grand Hotel in Chelsea, stuffed the gems into one of the manager's Louis Vuitton suitcases, and left the scene in a taxi. Filan, who was jailed for 31 months in May after he admitted burgling the suite while Mourinho was on business and his wife and daughter were out shopping, was brought back to Southwark Crown Court today and jailed for a total of four years after owning up to a string of other raids on five-star hotels. Prolific: Thief Jamie Filan, 32, has had his jail time extended after it emerged he targeted a businessman staying at the Savoy three days before he raided Jose Mourinho's Chelsea hotel suite . 'Persistent offender': A judge told Filan he had an 'appalling' record of convictions as jailed him for four years at Southwark Crown Court today . Filan, described in court as having an 'appalling' record of convictions, was on licence when he targeted Mourinho's suite after having been released earlier this year from a sentence for a domestic burglary in 2012. He bypassed tight security to help himself to gold jewellery, a diamond pendant, computer equipment, and an Ermenegildo Zegna coat, worth £1,850, belonging to the Chelsea boss. Victims: Filan stole jewellery worth tens of thousands belonging to Matilde Mourinho (pictured leaving a London restaurant with the Chelsea boss last night), the wife of football manager Jose . Burgled: Filan left the five-star hotel in a taxi after stealing a haul that included a designer coat worth almost £2,000 belonging to Mourinho (pictured left in London last night), and jewellery he had given to his wife (right) Prosecutor Usha Shergill said today Filan . posed as genuine guest at the five-star Savoy Hotel to get into the room . of businessman Soven Hansen. 'He approached two members of staff who were part of the cleaning team and casually asked them what time they would complete cleaning the room', she told the court. 'It led them to believe he was the occupant of room 421. 'He entered the room and later seen leaving the room with an orange plastic bag containing quite a significant amount of property.' Filan stole a Louis Vuitton purse worth £100, Sony photographic equipment, a Tom Tom sat-nav system, and a brand new iPad worth £2,000. He later told police he sold the goods on Edgware Road in a bid to clear £7,000 worth of debt. Thief: Filan posed as a guest at the Savoy Hotel in order to sneak into the suite of businessman Soven Hansen . Lavish: Jose Mourinho was away on business and his wife and daughter were out shopping when Filan burgled their suite escaping with more than £100,000 worth of goods . Filan had scoured the hotel looking for a way into the room, and is thought to have found a keycard in a janitor's cupboard. 'CCTV footage shows Mr Filan entering the hotel, and he was then seen to enter a blue lift up to the fourth floor', Ms Shergill said. 'Earlier footage shows Mr Filan entering the janitor's cupboard, and the only inference for this is he managed to obtain a swipe card to gain access to the room in question.' She added: 'One can only imagine the tremendous inconvenience the loser of the property must have experienced, having lost not just personal items but also a computer containing lots of information and data. 'He planned the burglary and clearly went with the intention of stealing, embarking on some form of deception.' Filan confessed to that raid on March 23, and asked for two other raids - on the Renaissance Hotel in St Pancras, on February 28 and the Landmark London Hotel in Marylebone, on March 27 - to be taken into consideration. Targeted: Filan raided Mourinho's five star suite while he was away on business and his wife Matilde and daughter Tita were out shopping . During those other burglaries, he got away with £3,800 worth of goods, but was later identified on CCTV as a well-known thief. Filan had targeted Mourinho, then still in charge at Real Madrid, on March 26, just three days after he and his family checked in to their hotel suite. In that raid, he helped himself to a Cartier pendant, earrings and a ring worth £51,450, which the soccer star had given to his wife Matilde as gifts. A Bulgari white gold watch and earrings worth £30,450, together with a £14,900 Van Cleef and Arpels gold bracelet; a Tiffany 18ct white gold diamond cross pendant, worth £2,450; a Boucheron yellow, white and pink gold ring, valued at £4,600; and a pair of Chaumet 18ct white gold diamond earrings, worth £2,750, were also taken. Wealthy clientele: Three days before the raid on Mourinho's suite in Chelsea, Filan had targeted a wealthy businessman at London's Savoy Hotel, a court heard . Brazen Filan then stuffed the haul into one of Mourinho's Louis Vuitton suitcases and casually asked hotel staff to order him a taxi. In 2007 Filan was jailed for five years for running over and killing dental nurse Michelle Dever in Lancing, West Sussex. Filan was then let out in June 2009 and hit the headlines after bragging on Facebook about jet-skiing, quad-biking and nightclubbing in Ibiza while on licence. The court heard Filan has 22 previous convictions for 55 offences, and is currently a serving prisoner at HMP Wandsworth. His latest crime spree finally came to an end on April 13 when he raided a suite at the exclusive Four Seasons in Hamilton Place, Park Lane. Security staff spotted him returning the following day to try to break into another room at the same hotel, and detained him. Filan, who was known to use the alias 'Jimmy Dormer', is already banned from entering any hotel in the City of London and the City of Westminster for five years upon his release from jail. Judge Stephen Robbins jailed him for four years today, to run concurrently with his existing 31 month jail term. 'Your antecedents show an appalling record of convictions', said the judge. 'You are a persistent offender.' Filan, formerly of Westminster and now of Peterborough, admitted one count of burglary with two other offences to be taken into consideration.","Jamie Filan, 32, crept into suite at five star Wyndham Grand in Chelsea .

Waring: NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson said the health service could not be allowed to 'muddle through' The NHS is on the verge of running out of money and will face a £30billion shortfall by the end of the decade, health officials warned today. Bold changes will have to be made to services, including closing hospitals and merging GP surgeries, to end the culture of ‘muddling along’ which threatens the existence of free healthcare in England. NHS England boss Sir David Nicholson warned of ‘really difficult choices’ about what care is available to cope with an ageing population, more long-term conditions and tighter budgets. A major report by NHS England warns that if the health service continues operating as it is there will be a funding gap of £30 billion between 2013 and 2021. Without a major overhaul of treatment and services there could be a repeat of the Mid Staffs scandal in which up to 1,200 patients needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect. ‘Without bold and transformative change to how services are delivered, a high quality yet free at the point of use health service will not be available to future generations,’ NHS England warned. Officials have not yet decided how the health service must change and have decided to open up national debate to ‘flesh out the no-go areas’. Sir David, who is due to retire next year, said the NHS was in danger of ‘sleepwalking its way to a place where we are presiding over a general reduction in standards.’ After the public debate on the challenges, local health authorities will develop plans on how the health landscape will change in each region. He added: ‘We need to create £30 billion worth of resource in the NHS by cutting off the increase in demand through things like prevention, we need to do it by changing services so that they are delivered in different environment and we need to drive efficiency in the system. ‘The reason it is so important that we have this conversation now is at the end of this year, we are going to have to make some really big, serious decisions about the way in which we invest and allocate resources in 2014-15 and 2015-16. ‘We don't believe (those decisions) can be made in isolation at the centre, nor without proper discussions with the public and patients on how we make that happen.’ He said the health service cannot ‘muddle and sleep walk’ through the challenges it faces or there could be more instances of care failing such as those witnessed in the Stafford Hospital scandal. He added that the current regulatory system around making changes is ‘very slow’ and said that he will be asking the Government to assess how the process can be sped up. Without a major overhaul of treatment and services there could be a repeat of the Mid Staffs scandal in which up to 1,200 patients needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect . However, plans to make changes to health services have been ferociously opposed in the past. For instance, the streamlining of children's heart surgery services ended up in a bitter legal dispute. Campaign groups in Stafford are battling to maintain services at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust - even though Stafford Hospital was at the centre of a care scandal that rocked the system to its core. NHS England said that moves such as the centralisation of services - where care is concentrated in a few specialist centres to ensure quality of care - would form part of the transformation. Medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said that a number of services had the potential to be concentrated at fewer specialist centres, such as treatment for heart attacks and strokes, operations on veins and arteries and bowel surgery. He said that some services would only need be centralised for a limited time, giving the example of pacemakers - in the past the devices, which regulate a patient's heartbeat, could only be implanted by specialist doctors in a small number of centres, but now the procedures are conducted regularly in any hospital which employs a cardiologist. Pressure: The health service needs to adapt to cope with an ageing population and more people living with long-term conditions . Officials also said that patients will also have to take ‘greater control of their health’ - particularly those with long term conditions such as diabetes, depression, dementia and high blood pressure. The new design must provide better services for preventing disease, they said. At present only 4 per cent of the budget is spent on prevention but officials want to examine whether this can be ‘scaled-up over time’. They also said health systems would have to harness emerging technologies more ""efficiently and effectively"" and hospitals will also have to look at delivering care differently. For instance, at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London experts have developed a ""e-intensive care unit"" where specialists remotely monitor patients using high definition cameras, two-way audio systems and other instruments that keep track of patients' vital signs. In a new document, titled ‘A Call to Action’, officials said: ‘The NHS is one of our most precious institutions. We need to cherish it, but we also need to transform it. ‘Future trends threaten its sustainability and that means making some tough decisions now to ensure its future is guaranteed. ‘Even protecting the budget will not address the financial challenges ahead. If the NHS is to survive another 65 years it must change. ‘Preserving the values that underpin a universal health service, free at the point of use, will mean fundamental changes to how we deliver and use health and care services.’","Shortfall looms as health service struggles to cope with ageing population .

But that was until a virtually unknown Australian teenager named Ashton Agar – dubbed ‘Ashton Who?’ – strolled in to bat with his team nine wickets down. And after a stunning innings in which the rookie humbled England and smashed cricketing records in the process, it was more a case of ‘Ashton Wow!’ Remarkably, 19-year-old Agar was playing league cricket for Henley just a few months ago, as a way of learning about English pitches and conditions. Didn't see that one coming: Ashton Agar scored 98 runs as number 11 batsman - a record-breaking feat - yesterday's test match (left). A month ago he was playing for Henley Cricket Club  in Henley on Thames (right) The experience clearly served him well yesterday as he scored 98 runs, tantalisingly short of becoming the first Number 11 batsman to score a Test century but still the highest in that position. His partnership of 163 with Phil Hughes was the highest for a 10th wicket in Tests. The predominantly English crowd at Trent Bridge in Nottingham gave the youngster a standing ovation as he left the pitch and even former England captain Michael Vaughan confessed that he was ‘disappointed’ when Agar was out. And it left England, the clear favourites to keep hold of the Ashes trophy, facing something of a challenge. Support: Agar is congratulated by his parents John and Sonia and brothers Wesley (left) and William (right) after his incredible performance on day two of the Ashes Test match between England and Australia at Trent Bridge . And by the time he was eventually caught out, Australia were 65 runs ahead of England - and Agar had etched his name into the record books. Australia’s delighted prime minister Kevin Rudd hailed his ‘stunning’ performance and jokingly declared an ‘Ashton Agar Day’ in honour of the nation’s newest hero. Agar’s Sri Lankan-born mother Sonia and brothers were in the crowd at Trent Bridge, having flown from Australia to witness his debut. Wait for it: Ashton Agar's mum, Sonia, thought he had scored his . century (left)... before realising her celebration was premature (right) Sonia leaped out of her seat in joy when she thought her son had smashed a four to reach his century - but he was caught out by an English fielder. His father John revealed that Agar had rushed up to his family and apologised for failing to make the magical 100 runs. ‘He came over to his brothers and said sorry. That is so him. He still had a smile on his face. He often looks up to us when we’re in the stands,’ he said. Agar had caused eyebrows to be raised simply by being picked to play in the opening Ashes Test. He had only ever previously played ten games of first class cricket in Australia.","Ashton Agar, 19, was an unknown when was picked for this week's Test .

The taxpayer has picked up the bill for private contractors to spend hours trying to persuade ducks to leave the Treasury, it emerged today. The extraordinary farce of how Labour’s £1billion PFI deal to refurbish the ministry reveals how the firm which now owns the building is crippled by bureaucracy while trying to rid a fountain of their feathered friends. A logbook of 24 hours in the bizarre world of Whitehall includes conflicting advice about whether an order can be given to scare the ducks and who is responsible for removing bird's mess. Duck bill: The taxpayer is paying for the private finance contractor who spent 24 hours trying to remove two birds from the Treasury . Quackers: The £1billion PFI deal signed by Labour put the Treasury building in the hands of a contractor . Chancellor George Osborne revealed the absurd contract signed by the Labour government was still tying the Treasury up in knots. ‘It all started eight years ago when two ducks landed in the fountain, do what ducks and there was suddenly nine ducklings,’ the Chancellor said. At the time a whole team of PFI contractors, civil servants and the RSCPA were called to remove the ducks from the Treasury’s ‘rather expensive water feature’ and take them to Surrey. In June last year the ducks returned, sending the Facilities Management Help Desk into meltdown. To much laughter, Mr Osborne proceeded to read the detail of the logbook to a press gallery lunch for journalists in Westminster. The logbook details the extraordinary level of detail and effort the Treasury staff went to, before discovering that the ducks had removed themselves more successfully than any contractor could manage. Dismay: Chancellor George Osborne told journalists: 'That ladies and gentlemen is how your money is spent' Bird's eye view: The Treasury's 'rather expensive water feature¿ has been plagued by ducks for up to eight years . The Facilities management help desk logbook for incident number 177853 on 20 June 2012 reveals that at 9.02am the initial request was created: ‘Ducks in the courtyard garden. Request presence of an operative.’ By 9.22am an ‘operative was attending incident’. At 10.11am the contractor reported: ‘I attended area and confirmed this is a male and female duck. Issue has been discussed previously with RSPCA, they won’t attend the building for ducks, and I called Royal Parks but they also won’t come remove  ducks as it may cause injury to the duck and people in this area. ‘They have advised us to put signs requesting that people do not feed the ducks, and also to frighten them frequently so they don’t feel comfortable here, they should then leave of their own accord. Advised seniors of the above.’ The problem then seemed solved, but by 10.40am there was a u-turn. ‘Please ignore previous,’ the logbook stated. Nest: Eight years ago two birds arrived in the Treasury, and before long nine ducklings had appeared . ‘Have been advised that signs should not be put up yet without permission, and that the birds should not be frightened – we are responsible for guano only, not removing the birds. Awaiting further instructions.’ Several hours later the situation escalated, with a plan to remove the ducks altogether. ‘Have been advised that previous instances required the ducks to be caught and removed as there is insufficient space in the courtyard for ducks to take off,’ the contractor wrote at 1.10pm. ‘Message left for operative to contact the Help Desk.’ The drama rolled into the next day, when an update was posted at 9am. ‘No ducks in the pond and disturbed all the bushed. No ducks present. Seems they have left on their own.’ To huge laughter, Mr Osborne told journalists: ‘That ladies and gentlemen is how your money is spent.’ Soon after the coalition was formed in 2010, the Chancellor revealed that the PFI deal meant that a Christmas tree for the Treasury had cost £800. PFI schemes allow governments to put off raising upfront money for new buildings. Instead, a private company is given a lengthy contract to build a school or hospital and then provides related ‘services’ to the public sector. The Government leases the building for the length of the contract before it reverts to public ownership. Earlier this year it emerged the contractor which owns the Treasury building had rented it out for a scene in Fast and Furious 6. Cinemagoers did not realise that the supercars and scantily-clad partygoers in Fast and Furious 6 were partying at the heart of the Treasury . The owner of the building hired it out to producers as a location for the Hollywood blockbuster, featuring fast cars and dancing girls . The circular court of the Treasury building was transformed into an underground nightclub in the latest movie in the series starring Vin Diesel. Producers used it as a dramatic location for the Hollywood blockbuster, featuring fast cars and dancing girls. Official figures show that 544 PFI projects such as new school and hospital buildings were launched since 1997. The original capital cost of the projects agreed under the Labour government was £51.5billion. But repayments for these will have rocketed to an eye-watering total of £245billion by 2047/8, according to the Treasury.","Health and safety rules leave private firm in charge of building floundering .

Cheng Tan is suing the law firm McDermott Will & Emery for unfair dismissal, sex discrimination and maternity discrimination . A high-flying lawyer claims she was 'ambushed', forced out of her £100,000 a year job and ordered to pay back her maternity pay after she took more than six months leave because of medical problems, a tribunal heard. Cheng Tan, 40, who had a complicated caesarean section, was head-hunted to join the London office of the prestigious American law firm McDermott Will & Emery as a trademark specialist. But the mother-of-two claims she was made the sole victim of redundancy from the firm after she told her bosses she needed more than six months' maternity leave to recover after a series of operations. And she alleges that at one point bosses even demanded that she pay back £18,000 maternity pay. In a witness statement to the Central London Employment Tribunal she said: 'I was made redundant because I had had a baby, taken maternity leave and suffered illness as a result of the birth.' Ms Tan gave birth on 5 May 2011 to a baby girl through emergency caesarean section, but there were complications and both Ms Tan and her newborn needed continued hospital treatment. The Malaysian-born lawyer underwent two gruelling operations to repair organs that had been damaged during the childbirth. Initially, she hoped to return after six months because she would be eligible for a bonus. But she claims after she told bosses she was suffering complications from the surgery they selected her for redundancy. She was called to a meeting on 3 November 2011 and told she faced redundancy. In her witness statement Ms Tan said: 'I felt ambushed. 'I had no one accompanying me, was still not fully well following the complications that had followed the birth of my second child, and at the meeting that I had asked for to discuss my return to work I was suddenly being faced with what appeared to be a pre-prepared meeting to tell me that I was redundant.' And the Leicester and King’s College London graduate said that she had been made to feel sidelined by the firm before she had even taken her maternity leave. The firm moved to the Heron Tower where offices were handed out depending on status, but the heavily pregnant lawyer was given a windowless room because she was about to have her baby. She claims her boss made the decision because she was only going to have to ‘sit in there’ for 4-6 weeks before having her baby. She claims after she told bosses she was suffering complications from the surgery they selected her for redundancy (posed by models) Ms Tan told the tribunal: 'I strongly believed I was being treated unfairly and unfavourably regarding this issue because of my imminent maternity leave.' While on leave she discussed her . return with her boss Gary Moss and other senior staff, but received no . indication that there were any problems until she told them about her . surgical complications. She . said: 'Gary said it was important that I should concentrate on getting . well and, as and when, I was ready I would be welcomed back to the . department and I was a valued member of the team.' But Mr Moss left the company while she was away. 'I felt tricked, cheated and betrayed'- Cheng Tan during her employment tribunal . During the redundancy meeting Ms Tan wondered aloud why she was being got rid of and mentioned it felt like 'anyone who is not white will be fired' by her boss Hiroshi Sheraton. She insisted it was not a formal allegation of race discrimination but the firm used it to keep her out of the office until they had finished an investigation, it is claimed. Ms Tan said she was thrown into a 'nightmare' and that her boss even tried to get her to hand back £18,000 worth of maternity pay she had received, it is alleged. She said: 'I could not believe that this was being asked of me. I was shocked and frightened by the prospect as I had not budgeted for it.' She added: 'Needless to say, I felt tricked, cheated and betrayed. I could not shake off the notion that Hiroshi did this deliberately to victimise me since I challenged his decision on redundancy and had not ‘gone quietly’.' The firm also told her that she would only get her full redundancy pay - the equivalent of seven weeks wages - if she agreed not to bring any claim against them, it is alleged. She was formally dismissed on redundancy grounds on 29 November last year. She is suing the firm for unfair dismissal, pregnancy, maternity and sex discrimination, indirect age discrimination and victimisation. McDermott Will & Emery strongly deny the allegations and in a statement to the tribunal they claim she was made redundant because there wasn’t enough work. They claim they had provisionally earmarked Ms Tan’s job for redundancy but 'the decision was made not to raise her provisional redundancy with her while she was suffering the significant ill effects of the birth.' They deny 'that there was any link between the claimant’s provisional selection and her maternity leave or related illness.' Instead they say she was axed because her charge-out rate was higher and she didn’t have the breadth of experience of others at the firm. The tribunal continues.

Tech giant Apple conspired with publishers to raise electronic book prices, a US judge has ruled . Apple was found guilty yesterday of conspiring with publishers to increase the price of ebooks. The tech giant played a ‘central role’ in a plot to break Amazon’s price-cutting dominance of the ebook trade, a court in New York  heard yesterday. District judge Denise Cote quoted evidence from Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011, as saying he understood publishers’ concerns that Amazon’s low price for new books was eroding the perceived value of their products. He also said Apple was willing to try pricing them higher. The ruling is likely to cost Apple hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, although it plans to challenge the ‘false accusations’. The publishers – Penguin, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, Macmillan and Hachette – had already settled ahead of the trial. Apple denied the charges, but the judge insisted there was ‘overwhelming’ evidence that it enabled publishers to dictate the price of ebooks on Apple’s own iBookstore. The California-based firm settled a separate case over ebook pricing last year with the European Commission. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company planned to appeal. 'Apple did not conspire to fix e-book pricing and we will continue to fight against these false accusations,' he said. 'We've done nothing wrong.' Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer called the ruling 'a victory for millions of consumers who choose to read books electronically.' He said the judge agreed with the Justice Department and 33 state attorneys general that executives at the highest levels of Apple orchestrated a conspiracy with five major publishers. 'Through today's court decision and previous settlements with five major publishers, consumers are again benefiting from retail price competition and paying less for their e-books,' he said. The judge said . Apple knew that no publisher could risk acting alone to try to eliminate . Amazon.com's $9.99 price for the most popular e-books so it 'created a . mechanism and environment that enabled them to act together in a matter . of weeks to eliminate all retail price competition for their e-books' Apple attorney Orin Snyder had told . Cote previously that she would set a 'dangerous precedent' if she . concluded that Apple manipulated e-book prices as it entered the market . in 2010. He did not immediately respond to a message for comment . Wednesday. Neumayr said . Apple's introduction of the iBookstore 'gave customers more choice, . injecting much needed innovation and competition into the market, . breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip on the publishing industry.' The government claimed Apple and the publishers agreed to a pricing policy that forced millions of consumers to pay several dollars more for most online books. In her ruling, Cote said 'compelling evidence of Apple's participation in the conspiracy came from the words uttered by Steve Jobs, Apple's founder, CEO and visionary.' She quoted Jobs, who died in 2011, as saying he understood publishers' concerns that Amazon's $9.99 price for new releases was eroding the perceived value of their products and that Apple was willing to try pricing e-books at $12.99 and $14.99. She noted that Jobs bought an e-book for $14.99 at the launch of Apple's e-book store and told a reporter that day that Amazon's $9.99 price for the same book would be irrelevant because soon all prices will 'be the same.' The Manhattan jurist, who did not . determine damages, added: 'The evidence is overwhelming that Apple knew . of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy and joined the conspiracy with . the specific intent to help it succeed' 'Apple has struggled mightily to . reinterpret Jobs's statements in a way that will eliminate their bite,' Cote wrote in the 160-page opinion. ""Its efforts have proven fruitless."" Cote said damages could be determined at a later point, though she did not immediately schedule a trial on them. The state attorneys general are seeking unspecified damages. The federal government is seeking an order that Apple be banned for two years from agreements that let publishers rather than retailers set prices and that the company be prohibited from future antitrust law violations. The Justice Department also is asking Apple to establish an antitrust compliance program and antitrust training for executives and to put in place an independent monitoring trustee. The trial had featured testimony from executives for Apple, publishers and Seattle-based Amazon.com. Witnesses from the publishing industry conceded that they were disappointed that Amazon.com was selling e-books so inexpensively when Apple came along in late 2009 with plans for its e-book store. 'Through their conspiracy they forced Amazon (and other resellers) to relinquish retail pricing authority and then they raised retail e-book prices,' Cote wrote. 'Those higher prices were not the result of regular market forces but of a scheme in which Apple was a full participant.'","U.S court ruled that Apple 'created environment' that enabled it to act with others to eliminate price competition .

A man died after he was shot with a Taser by police responding to reports of a row between neighbours. Jordan Begley, 23, is suspected to have had a heart attack after being hit by the 50,000 volt charge outside his home. His mother Dorothy had called police when the disturbance threatened to get out of hand. Jordan Begley was hit with a stun gun when he went back inside his house. The 23-year-old had a heart condition and is believed to have had a heart attack . Up to a dozen officers – some of them . armed – turned up in the quiet residential street following reports . that the ice cream factory worker had a knife. He was hit with a Taser stun gun when he went back inside his house, and collapsed on the floor. Officers and paramedics tried to resuscitate him before he was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. It . later emerged that Mr Begley of Gorton, Manchester, had a heart . condition and the electric charge from the Taser may have caused a . massive heart attack. There . were initial reports that officers may have confused him with a wanted . criminal with exactly the same name in the area, but this was . strenuously denied by the police. His . distraught mother, a 50-year-old café owner and well-respected . community figure, told friends: ‘They’ve killed my son, they’ve killed . my son.’ Yesterday the shutters were down at Dot’s Café with a sign . saying: ‘Cafe closed due to bereavement.’ Jordan Begley's mother Dot's cafe was closed today following the death of the 23-year-old . A sign was posted on the cafe's door this morning informing customers of the incident . A mourner lays flowers at the scene on Beard Street where 23-year-old Jordan Begley died. Paramedics tried to resuscitate him at the scene . The . incident – the latest to raise serious questions about the increasing . use of Taser weapons – is being investigated by the Independent Police . Complaints Commission. In 2011 in the UK, Tasers were fired by police at least 1,081 times, compared with 744 in 2010 – a 45 per cent rise. One . victim, a blind man who was Tasered in the street in Chorley, . Lancashire, last year after officers mistook his white cane for a . samurai sword, accused police of indiscriminate use of a ‘killing . machine’. Retired architect . Colin Farmer, 62, said: ‘It is absolutely devastating that another . person has lost their life as a result of officers’ Taser use. This is . yet another reminder that we need to change the Taser laws in this . country and officers need to be held properly accountable when they pull . the trigger.’ The tragedy . involving Mr Begley occurred at 8pm on Wednesday after he returned home . to Gorton from his job at Sivori’s ice cream factory in nearby . Levenshulme. It is . understood he became involved in a row with a neighbour outside the . terraced home he shared with his mother and brother Jake, 17. The incident is the latest to raise serious questions about the use of Taser weapons. It is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission . Best . friend Adam McAllister, 22, said: ‘It was just a domestic and then the . police arrived. There was some discussion outside before Jordan went . into the house. ‘These . officers followed him into the house, turfed his mother out and then . they Tasered him and now he’s dead. I feel like my friend has been . murdered. Police are saying he had a knife and was dangerous but no one saw him with a knife.’ He . said Mrs Begley had gone to see her son at the hospital and was shocked . to see he had two black eyes and strangulation marks around his throat . and bruises all over his body. Mr . McAllister added: ‘This is a rough neighbourhood but Jordan was one of . the good ones.’ Kirstie Porter, 21, said: ‘I can’t believe this could . happen to such a nice lad.’ Mr . Begley’s boss Peter Sivori, 77, was driving past when he saw Mr Begley . who waved at him. Mr Sivori said he told a policeman he was Mr Begley’s . employer and asked the officer if he wanted him to ‘come over’, but was . told to move on. He added: . ‘Jordan has always been respectful to me so I would have asked what’s . wrong. All I can say is that if I would have been able to speak to him I . think I would have calmed him down.’ Police said the man 'suffered a medical episode' before being taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead . Mr Sivori, who drove off before the incident escalated, added: ‘He was first class, a bit quietish but he was hard working.’ Greater . Manchester Police assistant chief constable Garry Shewan said: ‘Police . received a 999 call reporting a disturbance on Beard Road in Gorton . where there was a man with a knife. ‘Officers . were dispatched immediately and arrived in eight minutes. On arrival, a . Taser was discharged to detain a 23-year-old man. At this time it is . unclear what happened, but at some point afterwards the man suffered a . medical episode.’ Campaigners say Tasers can cause cardiac arrhythmia in people who have heart conditions, leading to cardiac arrest. In . June last year the Police Federation, which represents rank and file . officers, wrote to the Prime Minister calling for every frontline . officer to have access to a Taser. There are 12,000 Tasers on UK streets, but under the federation’s plans that would rise to 36,000.

If you are short of something to do this weekend and grimly looking forward to another night in front of the TV you are not alone. Brits are much less happy with their social lives than most of Europe, according to new analysis of how we spend our free time. People in the UK get less satisfaction from time partying or socialising than the likes of Luxembourg, Austria and Denmark. Staying in: A new league table released in Parliament shows how the UK lags behind most of Europe for satisfaction with our social life . Figures released in Parliament reveal Denmark tops the European league table for socialising. People in Turkey and Bulgaria, by contrast, are least happy with their lot. Brits abroad might have a reputation for partying hard, but long working hours and raising children are taking their toll. People across the continent were asked to rate how happy they were with . their social life out of 10, with one being very dissatisfied and 10 . being very satisfied. The UK average was only seven out of 10, almost 20 per cent lower than Denmark’s 8.3. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics director general Glen Watson, were published by the Cabinet Office this month. Contrast: Britain might boast some of the biggest clubs in the world, including Ministry of Sound in London (left), but people in Luxembourg (right) are happier with their social lives . Austria and Cyprus recorded 8.1, with Finland and Luxembroug on 7.8. Anyone looking for a good time might want to give Bulgaria a miss, where people scored their social life at just 5.9 out of 10. Experts suggest levels of satisfaction with social life could be linked . to not having enough time because of work or family commitments. New parents often fear that children will spell the end of their social life, and they could be right. More than three-quarters of couples with no children are happy with how . often they go out with friends, compared to just two-thirds of those . with young children and half of single parents. More than two-thirds of under-25s see their friends every day or most days, compared to just a third of people aged over 65. Rows: Barely two-thirds of parents are happy with their social life, compared to three-quarters of couples without children . Earlier studies suggest a quarter of people in the UK are unhappy with . the amount of leisure time they have, while 15 per cent are 'completely . satisfied'. And in an alarming warning, having a poor social life can be worse for your health than eating badly. The Office for National Statistics points to research by the . Universities of Exeter and Queensland, Australia which states: ‘The . quality of a person’s social life could have an even greater impact than . diet and exercise on their health and well-being’. Almost three quarters of those aged 16 to 24 and the over-55s are most satisfied with their social life, the ONS says. This compares with 58 of those in the 35-44 age bracket, 62.1 per cent . of those aged 45 to 54 and 63 of those aged 25 to 34-year-olds.","League table reveals people in the UK get less satisfaction from socialising .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:21 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:54 EST, 9 July 2013 . Anatoly Iksanov, former head of St Petersburg's Bolshoi Drama Theater . The chief of Moscow's Bolshoi Theater was fired today after months of infighting following an acid attack on its artistic director that has stained the reputation of one of the legendary names in world ballet. The departure of Anatoly Iksanov, the theater's director general, comes just a few weeks after the ouster of his rival, principal dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze. Both men have enjoyed the backing of senior government officials and Kremlin-connected tycoons, and their successive dismissals appear to reflect high-level intrigue and score-settling. Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said only that the 61-year old Iksanov, who led the Bolshoi for nearly 13 years, was dismissed because of a 'difficult situation at the theatre'. He told a news conference that the head of Moscow's No. 2 ballet company, the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater, would succeed Iksanov. The Bolshoi has been shrouded in scandal for years but a fierce conflict erupted in January after an assailant threw acid into the face of Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin. After numerous eye and facial surgeries, Filin has remained at a German clinic where doctors are trying to save his vision. The Bolshoi has named an acting artistic director. Iksanov accused Tsiskaridze of creating an atmosphere of discord that set the scene for the attack. The 39-year-old dancer rejected the claims and argued that the theater has plunged into crime and violence under Iksanov's watch. Iksanov managed to cling to his job for months despite fierce attacks from Tsiskaridze. He seemed even to have won the battle when Tsiskaridze was forced out after his contract expired on July 1. But Alexei Pushkov, a powerful Kremlin-connected lawmaker, suggested that a high-level power struggle was under way when he tweeted that Tsiskaridze's dismissal was ""the last straw"" that led to Iksanov's ouster. He added that an ex-culture minister who has been Iksanov's patron is trying to prevent Tsiskaridze's return to the theatre. Acid attack: Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin was blinded when after having acid thrown in his face . The decision to purge both men also appears to reflect the Kremlin's dismay over the infighting that has dented the nation's prestige. In March, police arrested Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko on suspicion of involvement in the acid attack. Dmitrichenko admitted that he had agreed to an offer from an acquaintance to rough up Filin, but he insisted that the man had used acid on his own initiative. Despite Dmitrichenko's confession, many in the ballet company have stood by him, saying they do not believe him capable of staging such a crime. About 300 dancers and staff, led by Tsiskaridze, signed an open letter claiming that Dmitrichenko had slandered himself under police pressure. Dmitrichenko has remained in custody pending trial. The Bolshoi has served as a top symbol of the nation's artistic achievements since the czars. Its annual budget stands at an impressive $120 million, 10 times more than a decade ago. The Bolshoi reopened in 2011 after a $1billion renovation. Despite the lavish sum, some of the work was of poor quality, with cracks appearing in the walls and gold leaf crumbling away. Tsiskaridze has accused Iksanov of mismanaging the reconstruction, ruining its repertoire and abusing dancers' rights. Iksanov and his backers have dismissed the criticism. Some said that a recent conflict involving prima ballerina Svetlana Zakharova may have contributed to Iksanov's downfall. Last week, Zakharova refused to dance in Eugene Onegin following a rift over parts with the management. Vladimir Urin, the new Bolshoi chief, is widely respected in Russia's theater world. He sought to quell passions, voicing hope for a 'calm and business-like' climate and saying that he doesn't want any 'revolutions'.","The Bolshoi has been surrounded by scandal in recent years .

But seven-year-old Dexter Anderson was determined to turn his dream in to a reality by writing a letter to his future employer. And the schoolboy from England was left stunned when he received a detailed response from NASA - which encouraged him to pursue his dream of visiting his favourite planet, Mars. Inspired: Delighted seven-year-old Dexter Anderson with the materials on Mars he was sent by NASA . The adorable handwritten letter reads: 'Dear NASA, My name is Dexter I heard that you are sending two people to Mars and I would like to come but I'm 7.' He then adds that he would like to go in the future though, and asked whether NASA could give him any tips about becoming an astronaut. NASA replied to Dexter with a note encouraging him to pursue his space dreams as well as a detailed package about Mars complete with posters and stickers. In its letter back to Dexter, NASA told the boy that he could someday become a space pioneer, telling him: 'Just think - in a few years, you could be one of the pioneers that may help lead the world's activities for better understanding of our earth and for exploring space.' Dear NASA... Dexter Anderson's letter about his dream of becoming an astronaut to the space agency . The space agency closed the letter by saying: 'Your interest in NASA is appreciated. NASA wishes you every success in earning good school grades and encourages you to keep reaching for the stars!' Dexter's delighted mother Katrina Anderson posted both letters on the website Reddit and they quickly went viral. She said that Dexter decided to write the letter after becoming inspired by a trip to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Ms Anderson told the Huffington Post: 'His initial reaction was shock. He couldn't believe he got a package that big from NASA, honestly I thought he'd only get a letter at best. 'Then he excitedly tore open the letter somewhat carefully and read the letter out loud. He then looked at the pictures then put them in his room for safe keeping. He loves science and maths and after visiting the Kennedy Space Centre last year his interest has known no bounds!' NASA's Office of Public Inquiries, which replied to Dexter's letter, responds to hundreds of thousands of public inquiries every year on a variety of topics. But Press Secretary Lauren Worley told website Mashable that the team particularly enjoys responding to aspiring astronauts. She said: 'NASA is working to send humans farther into space than ever before, first to an asteroid and on to Mars.

A Massachusetts woman is facing an attempted murder charge after police say she has attacked her 9-year-old daughter with a pair of electric hedge clippers, nearly severing the child's thumb. Both the mother and the girl were hospitalized with serious but non-life threatening injuries following the incident that took place in the family's Westwood home early Monday morning. Chief Jeff Silva said the 9-year-old's father stepped in to stop the attack reported at about 5am by the young victim, who told police that her mother was trying to kill herself. The couple's younger child who was in the house was unharmed. Bloody scene: Police responding to a domestic disturbance report at this home on Pond Street in Westwood came upon a blood-spattered woman being held in a bear hug by her husband and the couple's 9-year-old daughter with a nearly severed thumb . Weapon: Maureen Mullin is accused of injuring her daughter with this set of electric hedge clippers . Maureen Mullin, 39, was ordered held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing at an arraignment on charges including of attempted murder, assault and battery on a child and mayhem at her bedside at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston on Monday. Police received a call at around 4.51am Monday from a young girl reporting a domestic disturbance at her home at 126 Pond Street in Westwood. When officers arrived at the house, they discovered that Maureen Mullin had attacked her 9-year-old daughter with a gardening tool. Both the mother and daughter sustained serious injuries and were taken to area hospitals for treatment. An arrest report cited by the Boston Globe painted a horrific . scene inside the Mullins’ residence, with blood staining the walls, . floor and bedding of the 9-year-old’s bedroom and other rooms upstairs. Police have credited the actions of Mullin's husband with saving his daughter from the brutal attack launched by his wife. Anthony Mullin, 39, told investigators that he was awakened just before 5am by the screams of his two daughters, ages 9 and 5, coming from a bedroom. Moments later, he heard one of his children say, 'Why are you doing this, mommy?' According to the arrest report, Mr Mullin also heard the sound of a machine running behind a locked door. The . father quickly jumped into action, forcing his way into the room, only . to discover his wife holding a hedge trimmer next to the face of their . 9-year-old child. An orange . extension cord ran from the wall to the gardening tool, so the . 39-year-old man quickly unplugged it before wrestling the trimmer from . his wife's hand. The report states that Anthony Mullin then encircled his wife in a bear hug and led her downstairs into the living room. Heroic actions: Anthony Mullin, the suspect's husband, heard his daughters screaming and was able to force the clippers out of his wife's hand . Motive: Mr Mullin said that his wife has been taking medication for depression . The couple's 5-year-old daughter escaped the gruesome ordeal unharmed, but her older sister sustained injuries to her hand, face and neck. The 9-year-old suffered a severe laceration to her thumb, which was described in the arrest report as a 'near amputation.' She was taken to Boston Children’s Hospital. Responding officers found both the girl and her mother covered in blood. The woman, still in her husband's embrace, was heard repeatedly saying, 'I just wanted us all to be together.' According to Mr Mullin, before police arrived, his wife grabbed a kitchen knife and threatened to stab him and take her own life. Police have yet to determine the motive behind the attack, but Mr Mullin said that his wife has been taking medication for depression and had an appointment for an unspecified mental health issue. The family’s neighbors in Westwood were stunned by the sudden outbreak of violence in the quiet community, describing the couple and their girls as seemingly happy and friendly.","Maureen Mullin, 39, faces attempted murder and assault charges .

The Obama administration said Monday that U.S. diplomats are working behind the scenes to make it difficult for NSA leaker Edward Snowden to find safe harbor in any of the nations that have offered him asylum. Snowden has received a temporary travel document to fly to Caracas, Venezuela, and both Bolivia and Nicaragua have also offered him political asylum, but White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters during his regular briefing that the United States will do what it can to stop him. 'The United States has been in touch via diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries through which Mr. Snowden might transit or which might serve as final destinations for Mr. Snowden,' Carney said. U.S. diplomats, he added, have 'made very clear that he has been charged with a felony, or with felonies, and, as such, he should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than travel that would result in him returning to the United States.' Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden will be pursued no matter which country gives him safe harbor . It's not clear whether the Obama administration is hoping a Latin American nation will double-cross Snowden and offer him up to Washington after he arrives from Russia. But the U.S., Carney said, is still working to persuade Moscow to short-circuit the process and turn the fugitive over before he can leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo-2 airport. Still stuck: Edward Snowden made one of the biggest US intelligence leaks in history. His pleas for asylum have finally been accepted in three Latin American countries, but leaving Moscow is proving problematic . 'While we don’t have an extradition treaty with Russia, we believe that there is a strong legal justification for Russia to expel Mr. Snowden, and given that he is wanted here on felony charges, that he should be returned to the United States,' Carney told reporters. Russia, too, seems interested in finding Snowden a destination. 'He needs to choose a place to go,' insisted deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov. But . sources say Snowden will not be allowed to board the only Aeroflot . plane that offers direct connections to Caracas, a regular service to . Cuban capital Havana. The . routing overflies both the EU and the US and there are fears the plane . will be denied rights to Western airspace, and forced to land, leading . to Snowden's arrest. The direct distance from Moscow to Caracas is 6,175 miles but last night it appeared too far for Snowden. Indeed, unless Russian secret services . actively connive with his escape by a clandestine route, it is looking . hard to see how he can flee Russia. 'Venezuela . is waiting for an answer from Snowden. This, perhaps, is his last . chance to receive political asylum,' said Russian MP Alexei Pushkov, . seen as close to the Kremlin. Otherwise his only option would be to remain in Russia and accept glamorous spy Anna Chapman's offer to marry him, he joked. Venezuela . president Nicolas Maduro has vowed to  grant asylum to Snowden, to . protect him 'from the global persecution of the empire', meaning the US. Sticky situation: Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has vowed to grant Snowden asylum, but getting to Caracas involves a logistical and political nightmare that the Obama administration is trying to make even more difficult . With . Russia getting publicly impatient with the US whistle-blower's presence . in its transit zone, his escape route is a logistical nightmare. 'Instead . of going west to Venezuela, his obvious option is east to Vladivostok . and then across the Pacific to Caracas,' said one source.

Taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘phantom’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead, in jail or had left the country. Two private firms, G4S and Serco, are accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which had either been removed or simply never fitted. Estimates suggest up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the Ministry of Justice was billed for every day were not real. Taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals . Last night ministers asked fraud . investigators to look at G4S, after the company refused to allow . forensic auditors access to its books and emails between senior . executives. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling took the dramatic step after pledging to recover ‘every last penny’ owed to the public purse. He told MPs the scandal could date . back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and . Wales. Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and . monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005. Mr Grayling condemned the . overcharging as ‘wholly indefensible and unacceptable’. In some cases, . bills were paid for months or years after tags were taken off, he said. OLYMPIC SECURITY . Just two weeks before the start of the 2012 Olympic Games, G4S admitted it was unable to supply more than 10,000 security guards it had promised.Army and police personnel were drafted in to fill the gap (pictured above), with the company eventually picking up the £88million bill. PROSTHETIC TAGIn 2011, two G4S workers placed an electronic tag on an offender’s false leg, meaning he could simply take it off.Christopher Lowcock wrapped his prosthetic limb in a bandage to fool staff who set up the device in his home. PRISONER DIES Angolan prisoner Jimmy Mubenga died in 2010 after being restrained by G4S guards on his deportation flight. Three G4S staff were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but charges were not brought because of a lack of evidence. BIRMINGHAM KEYSIn 2011, a set of keys went missing at Birmingham Prison, a jail managed by G4S. Inmates were locked in their cells for an entire day, and new locks had to be  fitted at a cost of £250,000. He also launched a disciplinary . investigation into former officials in the department after discovering . contract managers were aware of billing issues in 2008, but ‘nothing . substantive was done’. Details of a ‘significant anomaly in . billing practices’ within the deals emerged during a routine review as . ministers prepared to negotiate contracts for satellite tags. It found ‘charges for people who were . back in prison and had their tags removed, people who had left the . country and those who had never been tagged in the first place’, Mr . Grayling said. Charges were also made in a ‘small number of cases when the subject was known to have died’. He added: ‘In some instances, . charging continued for a period of many months and indeed years after . active monitoring had ceased.’ The bill to taxpayers is put in the ‘low tens of millions’. Tags are put on criminals after their early release from prison or as part of their community service. Most involve a 12-hour curfew from . 7pm to 7am, allowing the criminal, in theory, to work. A box in the . offender’s home sounds an alert if the tag goes out of range or stops . working. Audits have also been launched into . all other contracts between the Government and the two firms, both major . suppliers to Whitehall. G4S received £1billion in revenue from UK . Government contracts last year, while Serco made £2billion. Serco has withdrawn its bid from the . current tendering process for new satellite tags, while G4S is expected . to be excluded after refusing to pull out. Serco agreed to co-operate with a new audit but has said it does not believe ‘anything dishonest has taken place’. G4S rejected the new audit and last night a spokesman insisted it has ‘always complied totally with the terms of the contract’. The Serious Fraud Office will consider whether an investigation is appropriate into what happened at G4S, Mr Grayling said. Indefensible: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said G4S had rejected a demand for a new forensic audit . The firm’s reputation was shredded . last year by its failure to fulfil the security contract for the . Olympics. Thousands of armed forces and police personnel were called in . to fill the gap and the company was forced to pick up the tab. In May, G4S chief executive Nick . Buckles quit with a £1.2million payoff. Several senior managers were . sacked in the wake of the Olympic fiasco. The price of shares in both firms . plunged yesterday following the announcement, wiping £176.4million from . G4S’s value and £269.6million from Serco. G4S group chief executive Ashley . Almanza said: ‘We place the highest premium on customer service and . integrity and therefore take very seriously the concerns expressed by . the Ministry of Justice.’ Serco group chief executive . Christopher Hyman said: ‘Serco is a business led by our values and built . on the strength of our reputation for integrity.

Concerns: Sweeteners used in diet drinks to help weight loss can be just as harmful as full-sugar versions, a food expert has warned. A can of diet Coke is pictured . Sweeteners used in diet drinks to help weight loss can be just as harmful as full-sugar versions, a food expert has warned. Aspartame is put in fizzy products such as Coke, Pepsi, 7UP and Sprite as a healthier option. But a study claims that some drinks containing the ingredient are linked to weight-gain, diabetes and heart disease – with just one can a day said to increase risks of high blood pressure. Professor Susan Swithers said that it was not uncommon for people to be given messages that artificially-sweetened products are healthy. But she claimed: ‘The data to support those claims is not very strong, and although it seems like common sense that diet sodas would not be as problematic as regular sodas, common sense is not always right.’ Professor Swithers, of Purdue University in Indiana, US, claims that one possible explanation is that having a low-calorie drink or two is treated as a licence to over-indulge in fatty or sugary snacks. Another is that artificial sweeteners fail to trigger the brain regions and hormones that tell us we are full and so we eat more. The drinks may also double the odds of developing metabolic syndrome – a cluster of symptoms that greatly increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Writing in the journal Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, she said: ‘The current public health message to limit the intake of sugar needs to be expanded to limit intake of all sweeteners, not just sugars.’ But British experts said that diet drinks do no harm. Findings: A study claims that some drinks containing Aspartame are linked to weight-gain . Sue Baic, of the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘There is a large body of evidence that shows that diet drinks can be really useful.’ Gavin Partington, of the British Soft Drinks Association, said that the professor had produced an opinion piece that ‘runs contrary to decades of scientific research’.","Aspartame is put in fizzy products such as Coke, Pepsi and 7UP .

Survivors of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 have made an emotional pilgrimage to the site of the crash, which killed two Chinese schoolgirls on Saturday. A group of passengers from the flight, which lost its tail in the fatal landing in San Francisco, were taken to the runway to see the wreckage on Wednesday. Three buses carried survivors to the Boeing 777, which is still in the spot where it came to rest after hitting the seawall and catching fire as it skidded across the runway. Scroll down for video . Survivors: Passengers of Flight 214 are shown the wreckage of the Boeing 777 . Crash tour: The survivors were escorted on to the runway where the burnt out plane has remained since Saturday . They were seen touring the outside of the wrecked plane that they had fled from only a few days before. In the moments after Flight 214 crash landed in San Francisco on Saturday, passengers were told to remain in their seats while the crew contacted the control tower. It was not until 90 seconds later that the plane was evacuated after a fire was spotted, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. At that point, the doors were opened and . the escape slides were inflated as passengers fled the plane, which clipped a seawall and snapped off its tail as it landed on Saturday. Site visit: The Asiana passengers are taken away from the airport on a bus after visiting the crash scene . Evacuation: Passengers flee from the burning wreckage of Flight 214 after it crash landed in San Francisco . Two flight attendants were trapped by . slides, which had inflated inside the aircraft during the crash. As more details about the aftermath of the crash emerge, the NTSB has said that the pilot who was making his first landing in a Boeing 777 at that airport reported being blinded by a light at about 500ft. which was 34 seconds before the impact. It was also the first time that Lee Gang-kuk, a 46-year-old pilot with 35 hours' experience flying a Boeing 777, had been paired with his trainer Lee Jeong-Min. Although the men had years of aviation experience, the flight on Saturday involved unfamiliar duties, and it was the first time they had flown together. NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman said the pilot told investigators he was blinded by a light at the point when the aircraft began to slow and drop. She said lasers have not been ruled out, and it was unclear if the flash might have played a role in the crash. Injured: A member of the cabin crew is pushed through San Francisco airport. Three flight attendants are still in hospital . Crew: Cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye and other flight attendants from Asiana Airlines Flight 214 at a press conference today . Experts say investigators trying to piece together what went wrong will consider the report about the light and many other factors, including the pairing of the pilots, who were assigned to work together through a tightly regulated system developed after several deadly crashes in the 1980s. The NTSB 'is definitely going to focus on what type of policy Asiana had in terms of crew pairing,' former NTSB chairman James Hall said. 'That's what the airline needs to do, be responsible so that in the cockpit you're matching the best people, especially when you're introducing someone to a new aircraft.' Pilots are typically paired by management and are not allowed to choose their partners in the cockpit. Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor Mary Cummings said it was common for two commercial pilots to be assigned to the same flight without working together before. Airlines have standardized, formal procedures to help teams who have not worked together before. 'Research would tell you that crew pairing with the same people over longer periods of time is safer,' she said. 'When two people fly together all the time, you get into a routine that's more efficient. You have experience communicating.' Jeff Skiles, a US Airways first officer, said that with the right training it should not matter if a pilot new to a plane is paired with a pilot making his first trip as a training captain. Wreckage: A fire that started near the front of the plane quickly spread . 'Everybody had to have their first time,' Mr Skiles said. 'You can't show up and have 500 hours experience in aircraft.' Mr Skiles was the co-pilot of the jet that was landed on the Hudson by Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, after it lost thrust in both engines after colliding with geese. The skillful flying of Captain Sullenberger and teamwork between him and Mr Skiles was credited for a near-perfect water landing on the Hudson in New York that saved the lives of everyone on board. The January 2009 accident happened after the pilots had been paired together only four days before. Details emerging from pilot interviews, cockpit recorders and control-tower communications indicate that Lee Gang-kuk, who was halfway through his certification training for the Boeing 777, and his co-pilot and instructor, Lee Jeong-Min, thought the aircraft's speed was being controlled by an autothrottle. Teamwork: Captain Chesley Sullenberger and copilot Jeffrey Skiles had only been flying together for a short time when they successfully crash landed on the Hudson . Fortunate: Captain Sullenberger stands next to the passenger plane he landed on the Hudson without killing anyone on board . Inspectors found that the autothrottle had been 'armed', or made ready for activation, Ms Hersman said. However, it has not yet been determined if it had been engaged. When the pilots realized the plane was approaching the waterfront runway too low and slow, they both reached for the throttle. Passengers heard a roar as the plane revved in a last-minute attempt to abort the landing. The two pilots at the controls during the accident had also been in the cockpit for takeoff. They then rested during the flight while a second pair of pilots took over. The two pairs swapped again about 90 minutes before landing, giving the trainee a chance to fly during the more challenging approach phase. The investigation is ongoing, and Ms Hersman cautioned against speculating about the cause of the crash. She stressed that even if the autothrottle malfunctioned, the pilots were ultimately responsible for control of the airliner. Investigation: NTSB crash experts examine the wreckage of Flight 214 which crashed on Saturday . 'Let me be very clear: The crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft,' she said on Tuesday. Airspeed is 'one of the very critical things that needs to be monitored on the approach to landing', she added. 'So we need to understand what was going on in the cockpit and on the aircraft.' A third pilot who was in the cockpit jumpseat to monitor the landing told investigators he could not see the approach because the tail was so low the aircraft's angle had blocked his view of the ground. The tail ultimately smashed into a seawall and broke off before the rest of the fuselage hit and ground and spun across the tarmac. Survivor Brian Thomson, who was returning from a martial arts competition in South Korea and walked away without injury, said he was not concerned about lack of experience in the cockpit. 'Everyone starts a career someway, somehow. Starts a new plane someway, somehow. They have to have training,' he said. The Air Line Pilots Association, a union representing more than 50,000 pilots at 33 American and Canadian airlines, has complained that the NTSB is releasing incomplete, out-of-context information that could lead to unfair characterizations of Asiana's pilots. 'Without the full body of facts surrounding a catastrophic event, partial or incomplete information can lead to erroneous conclusions and, in turn, skew the perception of individuals' behavior. This could then lead to misguided assessments of the crew's intentions and actions,' the union said in a statement. Progress: NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman is giving regular updates on the investigation . However, Ms Hersman said the NTSB was representing passengers and trying to be transparent. Nearly 20 survivors remained in hospital on Wednesday, and families have started arriving to be at their bed sides. Three flight attendants who were thrown from the aircraft during the accident were among those hurt. One of them has been identified as 25-year-old Maneenat Tinnakul, whose father has been given a visa so he can visit her. Another flight attendant, identified as Sirithip Singhakarn, was reportedly in intensive care. Fire officials have also continued their investigation into whether a fire truck may have run over one of the two teenagers killed in the crash. Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan were part of a larger group of students due to attend a Christian summer camp.","Details of escape comes as NTSB examines pairing of pilots .

Britain had to rely on maps from Germany in its support for the uprising against Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. In an embarrassment for British spies, they ended up depending on help from a country that refused to back the rebels. It was the first time the UK had to rely on Germany for military assistance since 1815 when the Prussian army of Gebhard von Blucher helped Wellington defeat Napoleon at Waterloo. Scramble: An RAF Tornado is seen taking off from an Italian airbase to support Libyan rebels. British forces used maps of the North African country supplied by Germany . Intelligence officers revealed the problem in talks with MPs on the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. The committee’s annual report published yesterday revealed that the Defence Intelligence Agency has had to fall back on the expertise of allies in countries where they have greater experience. And in Germany’s case, it certainly did. Rommel’s Afrika Korps spent long periods of the Second World War in Libya before its ultimate defeat by Montgomery’s Desert Rats. The committee said it accepted the general principle of accepting such help from allies.

A pretzel bag available only in the U.S. has become an unlikely clue in the hunt for a suspected child abuser. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has released five photos of a man carefully taken from four videos in which he can be seen sexually assaulting a young girl believed to be between seven and nine years old. Because the videos were so graphic, the images had to be 'sanitized' so they could be fit for public release. All four videos, which were filmed in April, appeared on the internet on May 2 and were discovered by Danish police who contacted U.S. authorities. Authorities have released images of a man (right) they would like to speak to in . connection with a video which shows a child being sexually assaulted. A packet of Rold Gold pretzels can be seen in the video . The man has been identified by the ICE as 'John Doe' and a warrant for his arrest was signed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Authorities believe the acts were committed in the U.S. because a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels, made only in the U.S., can be seen in the videos. Rold Gold pretzels are packaged differently within the U.S. and Canada, as those in Canada have different packaging and French language descriptions. In each of the four videos - which are all one or two minutes in length - several items of musical equipment can be seen. - guitars, speakers, a keyboard, electronic equipment and a musician stand and stool. ICE Special Agent Neil O' Callaghan told the MailOnline their biggest challenge was to ascertain if the video was filmed in Canada or the U.S. as there are so many similarities between the two countries in terms of electrical outlets, brands, furniture etc. But it was the pretzel's packaging that acted as the key component in this. Authorities are now appealing for members of the public to help identify the man, who is described as being between 45 and 55 years old with a heavy-set build. He is balding with a wreath of light brown hair and a brown mustache and appears to have what is commonly referred to as a 'beer gut'. Authorities believe the acts were committed in the U.S. because a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels, made only in the U.S., can be seen in the video (not seen in this video still) Do you know this man? Police are appealing for members of the public to come forward with information . Brian Korzak, a special agent with the ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, said: . 'It looks like our suspect is either a musician or collects musical . instruments', referring to images of guitars and mixers in the room . where the videos were made. 'We're not sure what the relationship . (between the man and girl) is because unfortunately there is no audio. So we couldn't tell any interaction between the two. 'But, having access to the child, so . to speak, on April 14, and then having access again on April 27, . obviously there's some sort of ongoing relationship or personal . knowledge between the suspect and the victim. 'Without the public's help, we may not be able (to find the man) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim'. Special Agent Patrick Redling added: 'Since the videos were created so recently, we feel there's a child in danger right now. 'And so we're looking to your help to get the word out about this particular investigation so hopefully we can catch this child sexual predator, take him off the streets and save this child from more harm.'

A Massachusetts mother who has been stranded in Brazil with her six-year-old daughter amid a custody dispute with the South American father expects to return home soon. Representatives for both sides said today that a Brazilian judge has decided to return the U.S. passports that federal police had seized from the American visitors. Shauna Hadden, a 33-year-old social worker from Agawam, says she brought her daughter Ava to Brazil in May so the girl could reconnect with her father. Trapped: Shauna Hadden, 33, pictured left, has created a Facebook called 'Trapped in Brazil' to draw attention to her plight and beg for help from American authorities to get her and her daughter, Ava, pictured right, home . But a lawyer for the 32-year-old . father, Donizete Machado, had said he had authorities seize their . passports because Hadden hadn't let him visit with Ava. The lawyer also claims Hadden used airline tickets Machado paid for to fly over and meet a boyfriend. Shauna's mother, Linda Hadden, says her daughter hopes to be home this weekend. Shauna had . created a Facebook called 'Trapped in Brazil' to draw attention to her . plight and beg for help from American authorities before the . breakthrough in the case. On . the page, which has more than 12,000 likes, she claims her ex-husband, . Donizete Machado, filed a custody suit for Ava in the Brazilian court as . soon as they touched town in the country and police officers with guns . confiscated their passports. Shauna met and married Machado in the U.S. They had Ava in 2007 and divorced in 2009, before he was deported in 2010 for being in the country illegally - something Shauna knew nothing about. Battle: The custody battle began when the mother and daughter touched down in Brazil in May . Scared: Shauna, pictured with Ava, was frightened that she'll be forced to leave Ava in Brazil . Since then, Shauna has rebuilt their . relationship for Ava's sake, and the father and daughter have had . regular contact over Skype. As such, she thought it would be OK to organize a visit. 'She . has full custody of Ava. He lives in Brazil. Shauna planned a trip on . May 21 where she would take Ava to visit her father and extended family . in Brazil,' her mother, Linda Hadden, told ABC News. 'We thought it was a great opportunity for Ava to learn about her heritage.' Machado bought flights for the two of them and they set off. But when they arrived the mother received a call from a man who lived in Machado's town warning her not to come. 'Her ex-husband was planning to take Ava from her,' Hadden said. Divorce: Shauna met and married Ava's father, Donizete Machado, in the U.S and in 2007 Ava was born . Help: Shauna said she has spent more than $6000 in lawyers' fees . Instead, Shauna took Ava to stay with friends in the north, which made Machado even more angry. 'He and his sisters started sending my daughter nasty messages saying things like 'You're going to have to stay in Brazil forever,' she said. Frightened, Shauna decided to get on a plane back to the U.S. but Machado had cancelled their return tickets. On June 6, she discovered Machado had filed for custody and the same day officers showed up at the friends' home with guns. 'They had guns and demanded that they . take Ava's passport,' she said. 'They said they were carrying out an . order from a judge to get Ava's passport. Shauna was scared and didn't . know what to do. She gave them Ava's passport and her own too,' Hadden . said. The U.S. Embassy in Brazil told Shauna to get an attorney, which she did and has spent more than $6,000 on lawyers fees so far, she claims. Visit: Shauna took 6-year-old Ava to Brazil so that Ava could see her father . Missing home: Ava's grandmother is in touch with her congressman about getting them home . Machado's initial request for . immediate custody was denied by the court and a request for someone to . bring Ava to him was also refused. Then he wanted a supervised visit with Ava, which the judge granted. Shauna has been gathering media interest through her Facebook campaign and, fluent in Portugese, she has does numerous Brazilian interviews explaining her plight and the community has been very supportive, her mother told ABC. Meanwhile, Hadden said she had been working with her congressman Senator Elizabeth Warren, the State Department and the Brazilian government, to try get the mother and daughter home. 'We just want them both to come home . safely,' Hadden said. 'We have . no ill will towards anyone.'","A Brazilian judge has decided to return U.S. passports to Shauna Hadden and daughter Ava .

Ambushed: This is the moment a groom was kidnapped by a gang as part of an elaborate stag-do prank . Surrounded: They gang shouted 'get out of the f****** car, get on the floor!' as they pounced on their friend . He was transported more than 100 miles to the Devon countryside where he was stripped and told to wear a lime green Borat-style mankini. Ollie was then handed a rusty bike and map and ordered to cycle ten miles before reaching the venue for his stag party - an outdoor activity 'boot camp' centre. But the stress of the prank left Ollie suffering shingles - an illness often found in combat veterans. Ollie, of Bath, Somerset, was so contagious he couldn't go near Clair for a month in the run up to the wedding. Luckily he recovered in time and the pair tied the knot last Saturday in front of 130 guests.

They told me I would have to stay away from Clair until I got . better and I was really worried I would miss the big day.' The gang struck on a country lane outside Bath as Ollie headed out on what he thought was a day trip with Clair. Wicked wife-to-be: Fiance Clair Hart, who was in on the joke, pretended to be terrified but is later seen laughing as her fiance is driven away . Elaborate: The gang, pictured driving their friend on a 100-mile journey, wore ski masks and balaclavas . It was the week before the planned date of his stag do - but unbeknown to him his stags had brought the date forward. The prank was planned with . military-style precision - including codenames and a 14-page plan for . the 'elite strike team' on how to apprehend the 'target'. Called 'Operation Haggis', the plan . detailed a 'non-elite strike team to intercept and kidnap the subject . and deliver safely to rendezvous point'. The plan said: 'Balaclavas are to remain on for maximum effect and 'fear factor' 'Supersoakers and other non-'pro' equipment is to remain hidden in bags until the subject has been removed from his vehicle. 'Once subject is secured, he is to be . dressed in an orange jumpsuit, restrained with handcuffs and 'bagged.' Subject will then be transported to Stag Party RV point.' Ollie quivered in the back of the van for nearly two hours before his pals finally revealed it was a joke. Prepared: One of the planning documents produced by the gang showing the proposed point of contact . Organised: Another document detailing the code names and roles of members of the gang . But he then had to endure the humiliation of riding a bike into Exeter, Devon, on a busy Bank Holiday weekend.

A shocking video has captured the heartbreaking moment a teenage boy is run over by a 20-ton bus while trying to hold it for his mother, leaving him fighting for his life. Jerry Cunningham, 14, from Pompano Beach, Florida, is seen in the Broward County Transit surveillance footage sprinting to stop the bus as it begins to move away from the curb. But the boy's arm gets caught in the automatic doors, and the driver, who is distracted chatting to other passengers, drags him along the road for a number of seconds and then underneath the bus. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Transit horror: This grab of the shocking footage shows Jerry Cunningham the moment before he is pulled under the bus . Cunningham suffered fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and has been in a medically induced coma at Broward Health Medical Center's pediatric ICU since the devastating May 10 incident, according to the Sun Sentinel. The tragedy took place at around 9 a.m. in front of scores of horrified passengers, and was filmed by the Broward County Transit bus's security cameras, which cover eight angles. Two of the angles captured the young boy as he gallantly ran towards the bus for his mother. After he gets his arm caught, he is seen sprinting for some seven seconds to keep up with the bus while banging on the door for attention with his other arm. He then disappears out of sight.

When he slips out of sight, several passengers scream and one woman is seen hitting Soto as the bus stopped. The driver and a group of passengers then rushed off the bus to help the boy with his mother who, by that point, had caught up with the bus.

The video zooms in and out on the planet as Mars spins on it's axis. The Express satellite was launched in 2003 and started taking data on the planet in early 2004. The main goal of the mission was to figure out if there is or was ever any water on the planet. Originally the structure had two parts, the satellite and a lander called the Beagle 2. Beagle 2 was supposed to land on the planet on December 25, 2003 but failed. It wasn't too much of a surprise though, since nearly half of all landing attempts have failed.

Set in the Caribbean, Richard Branson's holiday home Necker Island is a by-word for luxury and has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities and royalty. But the 74-acre paradise was severely damaged in a 2011 fire that devastated the island's Great House. Two years later, Branson has announced the extensive restructure of the house is almost complete and will soon be available for exclusive hire once again - for a staggering £40,000 per night. Paradise: Sir Richard Branson has spent two years refurbishing the Great House on Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands . Stunning: The new master bedroom in the Great House will have unbelievable panoramic views of Necker Island . Luxury: The new Great House was modelled on the original, which burned down in the 2011 fire, and has retained the same Balinese design . Premium: Enjoying the private sandy beaches and gorgeous swimming pool comes at a premium price - a staggering £40,000 per night . Nice if you can get it: For those that can afford to rent the island, guests have the use of Necker's have the use the swimming pool on the Island¿s Bali Lo, Buah and Kukila . Opulent: As well as sleeping 20 people in the Great House, guests also have access to the beach houses (pictured) The private island house, which Branson has owned since 1979, boasts eight guest rooms, each with a balcony, king-sized bed and en-suite bathroom. A 1,500 square feet master suite sits upstairs that has been specifically designed to give panoramic views of the Caribbean, the Atlantic Ocean and neighbouring islands. It includes a two-person Jacuzzi, stand-alone outdoor bath and a kitchenette area with a fully-stocked fridge. The island can be hired exclusively for up to 30 adults but this kind of luxury comes at a price per night that few people earn in a year. An exclusive week's rental, that includes six individual Bali Houses dotted around the island and two tennis courts, costs £275,800. The Great House was gutted by the fire on August 22, 2011, which was believed to have been caused by lightning from Tropical Storm Irene. Kate Winslet, who has since married Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll, was in the house at the time and helped carry the business tycoon's 90-year-old mother Eve. He told ITV News shortly after the fire: 'She [Winslet] said it was like being on . a film set where you’re waiting for the word 'cut’, but it just didn’t . come.' Romantic: For even more privacy, guests can choose to stay in the secluded beach house on the 74-acre island that straddles the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean . Al Fresco: Outside a table is laid big enough to seat all the guests on Necker at the same time . Fireside: Guests can lounge by the sea on the beach in hammocks, ornate sofas or eat and drink on the sand . Leisure: Necker boasts two tennis courts and guests can also exercise in the opulent pool or relax in the outdoor spa . Decadent: As well as chefs on the island providing top quality food, the Great House comes with fully-stocked fridges for midnight feasts . The Virgin boss said guests, including his son Sam and daughter Holly, were woken at about 5am after hearing loud bangs as gas canisters exploded. He said: 'It was terrifying for me . because my daughter and nephews, nieces, friends were all in the house, so I just ran, naked, towards the house to try to . make sure I could get people out.' The new house, which has followed the original's Balinese design, is due to reopen on September 2013. The rest of the island has remained open to visitors since the fire. New features include an expansive outdoor terrace with hammocks and sofas and a large dining table for guests to eat together al fresco. There is also a fully-stocked bar for cocktails and a crow’s nest on the roof has amazing views. Sir Richard Branson said: 'Necker . Island has been my home for more than 30 years and for me it is the . most beautiful place in the world. Phoenix from the ashes: Sir Richard Branson, pictured with his wife Joan, and daughter Holly, said he is 'thrilled' with the refurbished house . Devastated: The Great House was totally gutted in the 2011 blaze that is believed to have been caused by a lightning strike . Rescue: Kate Winslet, the wife of Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll, is credited with helping to rescue the billionaire's mother Eve from the blaze . Ablaze: The Great House was gutted by the inferno but all the guests, including Sir Richard Branson's children, managed to escape . 'The . brand new Great House is the heart of the island and I am thrilled with . the results so far. 'The opening of the Great House in September signals . a new dawn for Necker which I’m very excited about.' Branson was only 28 when he bought the island for £180,000 and turned it into the superstar resort. Necker Island - aptly for the Virgin boss - is located in the British Virgin Islands. It is a surrounded by turquoise . waters, coral reefs and white sandy beaches and as well as celebrity . guests is also home to diverse wildlife including flamingos, iguanas, . lemurs and giant tortoises. Powerful friends: Sir Richard Branson has known to have hosted Prince Harry and Tony Blair at Necker Island .

Prince's favourite: Prince William (centre) and Prince Harry (right) arrives at Necker Island by boat during the 1989 trip . Over the years it has attracted royalty such as Princess Diana, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, who visited during her split from Prince William, who took advantage of the privacy the island provides. The list of megastars from Hollywood and the world of sport to have holidayed there is seemingly endless and includes Harrison Ford, Robert De Niro, Oprah Winfrey, the Rolling Stones and the likes of John McEnroe and Novak Djokovic. More surprisingly, it has also been a haven to some of the biggest names in politics such as Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair. Sir Richard Branson, pictured with his infant son Sam on Necker Island in 1986, bought it when he was just 28 . The 74-acre island of Necker is part of the British Virgin Islands and sits on the boundary of the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean. It was named after the 17th century Dutch squadron commander Johannes de Neckere but remained uninhabited during the early 20th century. It was bought by Sir Richard Branson in 1979 after he heard some of the Virgin Islands were being sold. Branson was just 28 - and only six years after starting the Virgin Group. He offered a very low bid of £100,000, which was rejected, but eventually secured the paradise island for £180,000. He was forced to build a resort within five years of taking ownership, otherwise the government said it would be taken back by the state. According to reporters, Branson spent about £6.5million creating the luxury resort over the next three years. It has played host to an array of the world's most powerful, rich and famous. Princess Diana chose the island for her holiday with Prince William and Prince Harry. It was also a haven of privacy for the Duchess of Cambridge when she fled Britain during her temporary split from Prince William. Google founder Larry Page even chose it for his wedding to Lucy Southworth in 2007. It was also the site of Sir Richard's daughter Holly Branson's wedding to shipbroker Fred Andrews just months after devastating fire. Her wedding was on the same spot as that of Sir Richard and his wife Joan Templeman's in 1989 when Holly was eight and her brother Sam was four. In April 2011, Branson offered the island to his close friend Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for the royal couple honeymoon.","Necker Island's Great House burned down in 2011 after an apparent lightning strike .

Checks: Landlords will have to verify the immigration status of every new tenants or risk fines of thousands of pounds . Landlords who fail to check that their tenants are not illegal immigrants face being fined up to £3,000 under plans unveiled today. Ministers want to make it more difficult for people without permission to stay in the UK to carry on with their lives. But landlords warn they are not ‘immigration experts’ and cannot be expected to do the work of border police. The move comes as a new report reveals the impact of immigration on different parts of the country. The Home Office study shows half of people in England and Wales live in an area hit by high levels of migration from 2001-11. Immigration minister Mark Harper said: 'If we do not implement the proper controls, communities can be damaged, resources will be stretched and the benefits that immigration can bring are lost or forgotten.' Under new reforms all private landlords will have to carry out checks on the migration status of every tenant before renting out a room or house. First time offenders will be fined £1,000 per illegal immigrant in their property. But those sent an ‘advisory letter’ or warning about failing to make proper checks within the last three years will be forced to pay £3,000 per tenant. The rules could also be extended to cover families who take in lodgers, although the fines would be between £80 and £5000 per illegal immigrant. Mr Harper said: ‘The Government is determined to build a fairer system and to address the public's concern about immigration. ‘ . The proposals, set out in a consultation today, form part of the Immigration Bill which will be introduced later this year to ‘tighten immigration law, strengthen our enforcement powers and clamp down on those from overseas who try to abuse our public services’, Mr Harper added. Controversially landlords will not have to contact the Home Office if they suspect someone is in the UK illegally, but can do so voluntarily if they want to. When the idea was floated in the Queen’s Speech, Labour’s housing spokesman Jack Dromey said: ‘Tackling illegal immigration must not take us back to the days when my Irish father was turned away from boarding houses displaying “no dogs, no Irish” signs.’ But the guidance published today states: ‘Landlords must make checks on a non-discriminatory basis, i.e. they should not make any assumptions about a person’s migration status based on their ethnicity, name, accent, etc.’ Warning: Immigration minister Mark Harper said the government was determined to 'clamp down on those from overseas who try to abuse our public services' The Labour party today dismissed plans to stop foreigners ripping off the NHS as 'xenophobic'. Shadow health minister Diane Abbott claimed limiting access to free healthcare to permanent British residents risked 'stigmatising foreigners' and threatened public health. Controversial new proposals include a new ‘healthcare levy’ for anyone coming to the UK for more than six months, a charge to see family doctors for anyone here for less than six months, and a system to track migrant workers’ use of the NHS. Last night the plan was backed by Liz Kendall, a Labour shadow health minister. But today her colleague Ms Abbott wrote on Twitter: 'What price xenophobia? Stigmatising foreigners accessing NHS creates a public health risk.' Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Our NHS should be a national health service, not an international health service.' The rules will not apply to social housing rented to tenants nominated by local councils. Homeless hostels, university halls of residences, boarding schools and children’s homes will also be exempt. The checks landlords will have to make are the same as those employers have to make before hiring staff, but there are fears it will create increased paperwork for part-time landlords. Would-be tenants will have to produce evidence from a checklist of documents that they have permission to be in the UK, and landlords will have to take a copy for their records. Valid documents include a British passport, or a combination of birth certificate, national insurance number and driving licence, naturalisation certificate or right of abode certificate. Landlords will have to check the papers of all adults who will be living in the property. ‘If a person cannot produce satisfactory evidence, the landlord should not rent accommodation to them,’ the Home Office consultation said. The Home Office report found asylum seekers and refugee families are 'likely to have the highest impact on services'. The biggest impacts of immigration have been felt in market towns and rural areas least used to an influx of people. Urban areas, particularly in London boroughs are most likely to have seen high levels of immigration up to 2011. Ministers have also foreigners coming . to Britain will have to pay at least £200 to access free hospital care . and pay a charge every time they visit a GP. Health . Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants only permanent British residents to qualify . for anything other than emergency care free of charge. Mr . Harper added: ‘By reducing access to free NHS care and rented . accommodation for illegal migrants, we will make it more difficult for . them to stay in the country, leading to more returns and removals. ‘This . Bill is the next step in the radical reform of the immigration system . which has led to a reduction in net migration - now at its lowest level . for a decade.’ However the National Landlords Association also voiced concern. 'If this is to work, it is vital that the system is simple, straightforward and easy for landlords to use and understand,' a spokesman said. 'It makes sense to base the requirements on the established system used by employers to verify that individuals have the right to work in the UK, not least because there is a clear acknowledgement that employers, like landlords, are not immigration experts. 'They can only be expected to carry out reasonable checks that someone is who they say they are, and that they have the documentation to prove they have the right to be here.'","Crack down will force landlords to check immigration status of all tenants .

Missing: Terry Dewayne Smith Jr went missing Saturday night while his step-brother was babysitting . Police in Southern California have made an arrest in the case of an 11-year-old autistic boy who went missing over the weekend after a child's body was found partially exposed in a shallow grave today. Police found the body, believed to be little Terry Dewayne Smith Jr, when they searched his family's home in Menifee, California, in Riverside County. After the grim discovery, officers arrested a 16-year-old family member - thought to be his half-brother, who was the last person to see Terry alive. Terry's mother and other family members were taken in for questioning. The body was found under a tree about 75 feet from the house, which sits in a rambling, weedy lot off a remote road. About 1,000 people, including sheriff's deputies on horseback, emergency workers and volunteers, hunted for Terry on Tuesday. Authorities . were concerned that he wandered away without food, water or his . medication in an area 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles where . temperatures have topped 100F. Riverside County sheriff's detectives were led to the home shortly after 1am on Wednesday based on evidence indicating there might be a body there, Deputy Albert Martinez told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. Shallow grave: Investigators found the boy buried under a tree just 75 feet from his house . Investigators started searching Terry's family home after receiving a tip that he might be buried there . In danger: Terry, who weighs 76 pounds and is 4'8"", most likely did not take his medicine with him which will cause problems because he is a high-functioning autistic . The 4-foot-8 boy with sandy brown hair and brown eyes was last seen wearing blue basketball shorts. Local children were asked to not wear blue, to help avoid confusion. Terry was last seen when he followed his 16-year-old step-brother to the store on Saturday. The teen said he told the boy to go home, the Desert Sun reported. The boy's mother said she didn't realize he was missing until 10.30am the next day as she was out for the evening. Terry's mother shared details of the boy's habits on the searchers' Facebook page. Without his medication, Terry may be 'over sensitive and may be walking on his tiptoes', the page said. Searchers were also instructed to call him by his nickname 'Juju' because hearing his full name called out might cause him to believe he's in trouble and flee. Neither Terry's mother nor his . 16-year-old step brother have spoken out publicly, nor have the police . said why the teenager did not notice that his brother was missing . sooner. Investigators took . quick action sending out the first search party on Sunday morning . shortly after the boy's mother called to report him missing.

A massive mountain wildfire that was visible from Las Vegas on Wednesday has destroyed residential and business properties as it nears Nevada's casino capital. The first home - a ranch together with the main lodge and several outbuildings - has been destroyed by the blaze, while other commercial buildings had already fallen victim to the inferno. No one was injured at the ranch, which is about five miles southeast of housing developments in Kyle Canyon, according to local media. Glowing in the distance, the Nevada blaze ravaged for the 10th consecutive day. While now visible from Las Vegas, firefighters say they have mostly contained the flames . Too close for comfort: Flames from the Carpenter 1 Fire were visible from Nevada's casino city Las Vegas late on Wednesday as firefighters continued to battle to contain the blaze . Quoted in the Las Vegas Sun, ranch owner Barry Becker, who offers the lodge to a group of friends and family for a getaway, said: 'We were hoping it would skirt north or go around us.It didn’t.' The blaze, which was sparked by lightning striking dried woodland on July 1 and has so far destroyed 25,524 acres, lies around 25 miles east of the Sin City. On late Wednesday it was 15 per cent contained. The U.S. Forest Service says on this side of the fire, it has burned into flatter terrain and 'fire managers are optimistic about containing this fire edge'. A public meeting will be held today to discuss further action. The Mount Charleston forecast on Wednesday afternoon said today would see highs of nearly 28 degrees (82F) and westerly winds from seven to 13mph. James Stone, public information officer for the National Incident Management Team, told Las Vegas Sun the somewhat cooler temperatures still made for tough conditions for firefighters, who have been tackling the fire in heat close to 40 degrees - or three-digit highs in Fahrenheit. 'The weather is continuing to be not good for firefighting,' Stone said. Relative humidity is low on the mountain, adding to the extremely dry conditions. The National Weather Service on Wednesday afternoon issued a flash-flood watch warning for the Spring Mountains, throughout Thursday and Friday. In the mountains they forecast a 50 per cent chance of rain; in the valley there was a 30 per cent probability. Health risk: Smoke from the Carpenter 1 fire in the Spring Mountains range billows behind hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada yesterday . Warning: Officials have issued a health warning as large smoke clouds from the wildfire called Carpenter 1 surrounds Las Vegas . But the possibility of rain also comes with a sting - the chance of further lightening strikes. The Carpenter 1 blaze is one of . scores of wildfires being watched and assessed by the Forest Service, . across Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and other . states. Hundreds have been evacuated from . their homes as the deadly mountain wildfires continue to rage through . parched woodland in northern and southern Nevada. The 24-square-mile blaze near Vegas has forced more than 500 people out of homes in Mount Charleston, 25 miles . northwest of the city, while other fires have broken out near Reno and Kearn . A total of 1,264 personnel are . tackling the mt Charleston blaze - which has grabbed media attention due . to its proximity to urban areas - including more than 750 firefighters . and 18 . elite Hotshot crews. Smoke created a towering white cloud that stretched northeast, . visible from downtown Las Vegas. The Clark County Department of Air . Quality has issued health advisories due to the relentless smoke. An . influx of firefighters and equipment including bulldozers, seven . helicopters, four air tankers and a DC-10 jet fire retardant bomber . arrived in the area as other fast-moving fires were reported across the . state. On Tuesday, helicopters flew more than 43 hours and dropped 162,000 gallons of water on the fire. Meanwhile, 700 miles away, near Yarnell, in Arizona, the funeral for 19 firefighters who lost their lives battling wildfires on June 30 took place. Further north, a 26-square-mile fire has burned through the Pine Nut Mountains southwest of Reno while further south salt cedar trees have caught fire along the San Pedro River bed outside the remote community of Kearn. On fire: Smoke from the Carpenter 1 fire in the Spring Mountains range is illuminated by the setting sun last night as it billows behind the Stratosphere Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada . Hidden under a smoke cloud: Smoke pouring from the fires in the Mount Charleston area west of Las Vegas can be seen over the city yesterday morning as more than 750 firefighters continue to battle the blaze . Ongoing battle: More than 750 firefighters, including 18 elite Hotshot crews, were battling the Carpenter 1 Fire some 25 miles northwest of Las Vegas, pictured . Pinal County Deputy Chief Steve Henry . said the new fire had claimed a home and two other structures. It also . threatened the local airport in the town of some 2,000 residents. Residents of a trailer park were evacuated as a precaution. It was unclear how it started. The Arizona Republic reported the fire had spread across 300 acres by late last night. In northern Nevada, the Bison Fire in the Pine Nut Mountains straddling the Douglas and Lyon county lines nearly doubled in size yesterday from a day earlier as it burned through tinder-dry brush, dead trees and pinion-juniper forests. By afternoon the fire was estimated at 17,500 acres, or more than 27 square miles. The mountain range also stretches into Carson City. Late in the day, fire officials closed popular back-country roads leading from the state capital into the mountains because of the fire's path. The blaze broke out on July 4 and firefighters initially hoped to have it contained Monday. But those ambitions were dashed Sunday when strong winds fanned the fire into an inferno that pushed to the northeast and created a towering, swirling smoke plume seen for miles. Spark: More than 9,000 acres of woodland has burned since lightning sparked the blaze in Carpenter Canyon on the Pahrump, Nevada side of Mount Charleston on July 1 . Raging wildfire: Smoke and flames from the Carpenter 1 fire are seen along a ridge-line in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, Nevada, on July 6 . Badly hit: This map shows the areas in Mount Charleston affected by the Carpenter 1 fire and the temporary flight restriction zone over Las Vegas . No homes have been lost, but officials said several old structures burned in the Slater Mine area. More . than 700 firefighters battled winds, low humidity and steep terrain to . clear fire breaks through grass, pinion and juniper. Firefighters . lost ground yesterday on all of the Nevada fires, which each were about . 15 per cent contained. Fire managers expecting crews to spend a week on . both fire lines. No injuries were reported in the southern Nevada fire and no structures burned in the fire since it started on the west side of Mount Charleston near Pahrump and quickly spread east into rugged terrain reachable only on foot. Officials said yesterday that some $2.4 million had already been spent fighting the fire. Mount Charleston is a popular weekend getaway, where summer temperatures can be 15 to 20 degrees cooler than in Las Vegas, which has sizzled in the triple digits for more than 10 days. More than 400 homes in Trout, Kyle, Lee, Harris Springs and Lovell canyons were evacuated during the weekend, along with a Clark County-run youth correctional camp that houses 98 teenagers at a mountain elevation of almost 8,500 feet above sea level. Wildfires: This image shows the two large wildfires which have broken out in Reno and Mount Charleston in Nevada as firefighters have just managed to bring a huge blaze in Yarnell, Arizona, under control .

State highways 156 and 157 were closed into the canyons, and evacuation shelters were set up at schools in Las Vegas and Pahrump. Crews were also working to protect about 100 non-residential structures including barns, sheds and corrals, Nichols said. Daytime high temperatures on the mountain were expected to decrease over the next few days after peaking at 90 degrees on Saturday, but firefighters were hampered by gusty winds and humidity levels in the single digits. The fire, named Carpenter 1, was declared a top priority nationwide due to its size and the value of homes and structures at risk, said Suzanne Shelp, a Forest Service spokeswoman. 'This fire, these last few days and going forward, is going to depend on the weather,' Shelp said.

People in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff and nine other UK cities are set to get double their 4G internet speeds as broadband provider Everything Everywhere (EE) turns on its superfast network. The speed boost - which is twice as fast as current average 4G speeds and 10 times as fast as 3G - will make it easier to watch HD videos without buffering, share high-resolution pictures and send large files in seconds. The rest of the cities set to receive the boost are Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield. Network provider Everything Everywhere has announced it is rolling out its double-speed 4G network to 12 UK cities including Bristol, Derby, Birmingham and Cardiff. The boost will make the UK 4G network the best in Europe and equal the fastest speeds in South Korea . EE launched its 4G network in 16 UK cities and 12 of those are now set to get the double-speed boost . The plans will give the UK a 4G network that is unrivalled in Europe - faster than the U.S. and Japan, and equal to the world's fastest speeds in South Korea. EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK. The company said its double speed will see EE’s network reach a theoretical maximum top speed of 150Mbps. EE will be making double-speed 4G available to all existing 4GEE customers while they remain on their current 4GEE plan. Chief executive Olaf Swantee said: 'Last year we launched the first superfast 4G and Fibre broadband network in the UK. 'Now we’re staying one step ahead with the launch of double-speed 4G and a range of new innovative plans and services designed to transform the way our customers connect and share content. 'Our new double-speed 4G technology means that we have the biggest, fastest and best network in the UK, and now the equal fastest in the world. 'With our superfast network, we have a unique opportunity to introduce a new era of customer-friendly pricing models based on speed, and we’ll be revealing further details of this later this year. EE also announced it is to launch a new range of services later this month, aimed at making it as easy as possible for people to access its superfast network. The services include Shared 4GEE Plans, . allowing customers to connect up to five separate devices to one plan, . with one bill for all their devices, as well as a new range of . pay-as-you-go 4GEE mobile broadband plans. A South Korean model shows off Samsung's smartphone displaying the wireless data speed of SK Telecom's LTE-Advanced network in Seoul today. SK Telecom announced last week that its network offers speeds twice that of its existing long term evolution (LTE) network and 10 times faster than 3G services . The firm is also launching Cash on Tap, in partnership with MasterCard - a way for customers to make payments via their mobiles - as well as the Bright Box 2 wireless router, designed to offer a stronger Wii-Fi signal, for fibre broadband customers later this summer. Commenting on the plans, Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: 'I think it's an incredible roll-out, and a testament to the network that it has met – and in some instances exceeded – what were seen as incredibly ambitious plans for a 4G network back in September. 'Test speeds of 150Mbps, translating into real world figures of 24 to 30Mbps, rival the latest technologies – the likes of LTE-A (LTE Advanced) – and would certainly see the UK rubbing shoulders with the Far East and eclipsing Europe and the US alike. EE's double speed plans match those recently announced in South Korea. South . Korea's largest mobile operator., SK Telecom Co, is launched what it . said was the world's fastest wireless network last week. The . LTE-Advanced network can download data at speeds twice as fast as 4G . networks and 10 times faster than 3G services, according to SK Telecom . Co. With a transfer rate of 150 megabits per seconds, the network can download an 800 megabyte movie in just 43 seconds. This compares with around 80 seconds on the current LTE network. The service will be initially available in Seoul and its suburbs. 'Not only is EE bumping up speeds, it is also doubling the breadth of 1800Mhz spectrum supporting 4G, which will hopefully head off the chance of congestion on the network. 'All we hope is that these developments and advancements within its 4G infrastructure are not to the detriment of Orange and T-Mobile customers still using their 2G and 3G services.' Elsewhere, Sony has teamed up with mobile payments platform Boku to let customers pay for items from the Sony PlayStation store and Sony's Entertainment Network using their mobile phones. Sony users will be able to buy content using their phone number, without having to enter credit card details, and the charges will be added to a customer's mobile phone bill.

Under threat: A classical country scene with a large Oak in the Lake District National Park near Hawkshead . The Government is spending £1.1 million on an emergency project to save ancient English oaks from a mysterious disease that is causing the trees to ‘bleed to death’. Thousands across the UK have already been infected, with the disease so serious that oaks are being felled and their bark stripped and burnt to prevent it spreading. One theory is that a beetle may be responsible for the threat to the historic trees. Researchers are now involved in a race against time to develop a way to stop the disease that, once it takes hold, kills the oaks within four years. The Government has ordered a huge survey of trees across Britain to try to understand and track the new threat. Many of Britain’s ash trees are already doomed by the rapid spread of a fungal infection. Scientists are also trying to isolate and identify a bacteria found on the dying oaks that was previously unknown and might be behind the infection. The three-year project is an effort to stem the spread of  so-called ‘acute oak decline’,  or AOD, which is identified  by dark weeping patches on  stems of older trees. Oaks more than 50 years old are at the greatest threat. Researchers believe the disease may be linked to the oak jewel beetle because the diseased trees’ bark is often pitted with the insects’ distinctive  D-shaped exit holes. The beetle’s larvae have also been found in or near the ‘bleeding’ patches on the trunk of dying trees. It is not known  if beetles are attracted to the scent of the infected trees or if they are carriers of the disease that is killing them. Attack: The oak jewel beetle that feeds on oak timber . Using advanced sequencing technology, scientists will  analyse the DNA of bacteria,  fungus and insects found on healthy and infected trees to isolate the cause. The Forestry Commission and bioscience experts at Bangor and Cambridge Universities are leading the project, which will take samples from up to 200 woodlands. Estates belonging to the National Trust are among the hardest hit. At Blickling Hall in Norfolk, the majority of the oaks within its 950 acres of historic parkland are suffering from the disease. Ancient trees at Attingham Park in Shropshire are also affected. According to a Forestry Commission document, estate workers should ‘strip the outer bark and sapwood of heavily infected and dying or dead trees after felling and burn on site’. ‘Rapid destruction of stripped bark is recommended to prevent the possibility the disease spreading,’ it adds. Mysterious disease: Thousands of oaks have already been affected, which kills them within four years . Dr James McDonald, from Bangor University, is carrying out DNA research using forensic science techniques pioneered in medical research to try to identify the bacteria. He said: ‘It is affecting older trees, some hundreds of years old, and whatever is behind it  is causing the decline of something that has been here for so long, is much loved, and is difficult, if not impossible,  to replace. ‘It is a very complicated issue. It could involve new bacteria that have been isolated from the lesions on the stems or the oak jewel beetle. We are looking at their involvement but both could be passive bystanders in the process. We don’t know.’ Dr John Morgan, head of the Forestry Commission’s Plant Health Service, said: ‘We are determined to do everything possible to protect our trees. AOD is a complex condition and this new funding will enable us to better understand it, and the number and distribution of trees affected.’","Thousands of oaks have already been affected by a mysterious disease .

British astronomers are joining forces to hunt for ET – or at least signs of his existence. Scientists from 11 institutions, including the renowned Jodrell Bank observatory, have launched a network that will help those working in different fields of research to share their expertise. Telescopes will listen in for radio and light ‘broadcasts’ beamed out by TVs, radios, satellites, radar and lasers from other worlds. British astronomers are joining forces to hunt for ET - or at least signs of his existence. Scientists from 11 institutions, including the renowned Jodrell Bank observatory, have launched a network that will help those working in different fields of research to share their expertise . And should a message from little green men be intercepted, we might be ready to reply. Communications experts more used to working on intelligence of chimpanzees and dolphins are tackling how to decode any messages and put together a response. The network, which is being coordinated by Dr Alan Penny, of the University of St Andrews, was officially launched today at the National Astronomy Meeting, organised by the Royal Astronomical Society, at St Andrews, Scotland. The UK SETI Research Network, or UKSRN, will bolster Britain’s long-running involvement in the US-based, Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, project. Dr Penny said that the interception of light and radio signals that are wholly artificial and could not be made by nature would be proof that we are not alone. He said: ‘If ET fired a powerful laser through a big optical telescope to send a signal or announce their existence, those pulses could be detected over many thousands of light years. The scientists, including those from the Jodrell Bank observatory (pictured), have launched a network that will help those working in different fields of research to share their expertise. Telescopes will listen in for radio and light 'broadcasts' beamed out by TVs, radios, satellites, radar and lasers from other worlds . ‘It's the same with the radio search. we don't know if they are emitting signals, but if they were then we have the equipment to pick them up. We need to get more time on telescopes for the project and then we'll get a flood of data. ‘At the moment if we detected a signal that was unambiguously artificial that would be it. You wouldn't need to understand the message - its nature would tell us that we are not alone. ‘Then again once you've found it then you can look more closely to see if there is a message. If it looks as though there is, then GCHQ can get going and try to decode it.’ Others believe that that a new level of code-breaking will be required. Dr John Elliott, an expert in human and animal communication from Leeds Metropolitan University, said: ‘Standard decipherment and decryption techniques used by the military and security agencies are not going to help much. Some scientists argue that if ET has the technology to cross space to reach us, any defences we have will be all but useless. Stephen Hawking (pictured) has warned that aliens may plunder Earth for its resources. But not everyone is convinced that the threat is real . ‘To put the challenge into context, we still have scripts from antiquity that have remained undeciphered over hundreds of years, despite many serious attempts.’ However, scientists are divided about whether we should be should advertise our presence by responding to any message. Some say that if we alert hostile aliens to our existence we risk an invasion that could lead to the end of life on Earth. They argue that if ET has the technology to cross space to reach us any defences we have will be all but useless. Stephen Hawking has warned that aliens may plunder Earth for its resources. But not everyone is convinced that the threat is real. Spaceships: Stevie Nicks believes she saw alien life while living in Arizona . It is an admission that might not have been too surprising if she were still hooked on drink and drugs. But Stevie Nicks had given up both at the time she claims to have seen alien spaceships. The Fleetwood Mac singer says she made her sightings when she was living in Phoenix, Arizona. Miss Nicks, 65, said: ‘I lived for a while underneath the famous Camelback Mountain in Phoenix and I would sit outside and see white floating objects – a lot of them obviously aeroplanes – up in the sky. 'I used to call it the Space Highway because there are just spaceships being reported in that area all the time up there. ‘It’s just like an episode of X Files sometimes. I’m sure that somewhere within the real aeroplanes I saw alien spaceships too. ‘It was that creepy. I’d given up alcohol, and drugs, so seeing little green men in spaceships probably wasn’t a good idea for me.’ Miss Nicks, who says she feels healthier than she has in 30 years, also believes that she was a Jewish woman in a concentration camp in a previous life. Fleetwood Mac’s world tour arrives in the UK in September. The new network will capitalise on existing funding for space projects, although some extra cash may be needed for new research . Professor Ian Crawford, of Birkbeck, University of London, told the conference that any aliens ‘would have made themselves known by now’. The network will capitalise on existing funding for space projects, although some extra cash may be needed for new research. Dr Robert Massey, of the Royal Astronomical Society, said: ‘If we found even one civilisation elsewhere, it would be an entirely sensational result. ‘It is just so interesting that it would be a shame not to do it just a little bit because the consequences could be extraordinary.’","Scientists from 11 institutions, including the renowned Jodrell Bank observatory, have launched a network so scientists can share expertise .

A team of suburban police officers have relived the terrifying moment they came face to face with the Boston bombers and turned a quiet residential street into a deafening warzone. Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had just murdered three people and wounded 264 at the Boston Marathon when Officer Joseph Reynolds spotted their black Mercedes SUV driving along Dexter Avenue in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts. Over the next 12 minutes, some 250 bullets would be exchanged, four pipe bombs thrown and a home-made pressure-cooker detonated in a confrontation that would leave one of the brothers dead and residents cowering under their nightstands. Warzone: Some 250 bullets were fired, four pipe bombs thrown and a home-made pressure-cooker detonated in a confrontation that would leave one of the bombers dead and the street in ruins . The bombers: Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had just murdered three people and wounded 264 at the Boston Marathon when Officer Joseph Reynolds spotted their black Mercedes SUV driving along Dexter Avenue in Watertown . 'As I drove by, I made eye contact with Tamerlan…We both kind of looked at each other,' he told the New York Post. 'Tamerlan got out and started walking toward me. He lifted up his arms and started firing at me.' Bullets whistling past him, Officer Reynolds dived behind his patrol car and returned fire, desperately hoping back up would soon arrive. A minute later, Sgt John MacLellan came on the scene, thinking he was responding to a routine carjacking. But as shots rang out, he pulled up near his colleague and reached for his gun. 'I saw . that [Tamerlan] went from Reynolds’ car to my car and shot, boom, right . through the windshield,' he said. 'I got sprayed with glass as I was putting it in . park. I said, ‘Holy s**t, they’re shooting at us.' Terror: At one point, the elder brother then threw his first pipe bomb, which exploded yards from the two officers who dived for cover behind a car, the other side of which was shredded by shrapnel . So in a bid to create a diversion . while they held out for more officers, Sgt. MacLellan put his car into . neutral, leapt out and sent it rolling towards the brothers. 'I needed to create some sort of diversion…they were engaging the vehicle and it was totally empty. It worked out great.' The elder brother then threw his first pipe bomb, which exploded yards from the two officers who dived for cover behind a car, the other side of which was shredded by shrapnel. Then another pipe bomb, which bounced into the road and failed to detonate. Heroic: The officers have been hailed as heroes for putting their lives on the line to protect the residents of Watertown . As Reynolds radioed for backup, the brothers threw a third pipe bomb which also turned out to be a dud. Finally, Officer Miguel Colon, Officer Tim Menton, and Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese, 57, a married father of two with 33 years on the force, arrived to join in the fight. As they shouted at the brothers, telling them they were surrounded, Tamerlan threw another pipe bomb which ravaged three cars, narrowly missing its cowering targets. Caught: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is searched by law enforcement officers. He had already fled the scene of the gunfight, running over his brother with a stolen SUV . Officer Michael Comick, a 25 year old with only four months on the job, pulled up next, to be met with an almighty blast. 'Just . as I'm looking up to see what's going on, the big pressure cooker went . off,' he recalled. 'That was a very loud bang, and a big glow that lit . up the entire night. 'I . felt like someone dropped a bunch of stones on my head, and it ended up . being the shrapnel from the explosion, falling down from the sky.' But by now the officers outnumbered the bombers and were gaining the upper hand. Sgt. Pugliese, meanwhile, had snuck through a back garden in a bid to surprise the brothers from behind. He saw their feet from under a car and tried shooting their ankles. But Tamerlan spotted him before he could fire a clean shot. In an apparent last stand, Tamerlan is reported to have shouted: 'You want more? I give you more.' He rushed at Sgt Pugliese, gun blazing. But then his weapon jammed so he threw it at the officer, striking him in the bicep, and fled. Quick-thinking Pugliese chased and tackled him to the ground. But at that moment he was blinded by the lights of the black SUV. He looked up to see Dzhokhar was now behind the wheel, revving the engine. Dzhokhar hit the accelerator and sped towards the tussling pair in the apparent hope of freeing his brother from Sgt Pugliese's hold. Pandemonium: Three people died and 264 were wounded when the brothers detonated two home-made devices near the finish line of the Boston Marathon . But Pugliese leapt out of the way. Dzhokhar ran over his brother, dragging him 25 yards along the street. He then sped off into the night, leaving his brother, who by now had been shot nine times, to his fate. The relieved officers cuffed Tamerlan, who was groaning in pain and read him his rights. He died of his wounds hours later. Dzhokhar was later discovered wounded and hiding under the tarp of a boat in a local resident's garden less than half a mile away. He was arrested and awaits trial for the atrocity.","Officers saw Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in Watertown, near Boston .

Whether is be the names of each of the 50 states to cities, countries, rivers, oceans and even mountain ranges, a map has been created with their etymological meanings. And so New York becomes 'New Yew Tree Village', New Jersey is 'New Isle of Spears'  whilst Pennsylvania apparently means 'Land of the Main Hill Wood'. Not all that it seems: It looks like a normal map, but once you start reading, it becomes clear that the 'Atlas of True Names' is not at all conventional . Some of the state names have meanings that are far easier to determine. The map was designed by cartographers Stephan Hormes and Silke Peust. Many of the meanings are literal descriptions of the terrain or climate of the places they describe. Virginia means nothing more than 'Virgin Land' and neighbouring West Virginia predictably means 'West Virgin Land.' Michigan, is the “Land of the Big Lakes', and Mississippi is the 'Land of the Great River.' The Northeast: Who knew that Illinois meant 'Land of Those Who Speak Normally' or that Tennessee is 'Land of the River' The Southeast: Florida is 'Blooming Land' which is understandable because of all the rain the state receives but can anyone explain 'Land of the Thicket Clearers' for Alabama? Some . import European elements. Vermont's name is derived from the French . word for Green (vert) and Mountain (mont) - hence it's nickname 'The . Green Mountain State'. Others utilise Native American Indian language. Massachusetts means 'Near the small big mountain' in an Algonquin language. North and South Dakota are literal translations with 'Dakota' being the Sioux Indian Tribe word for 'friend' or 'ally'. The map names the states as the 'Land of Friends.' Michigan means 'large lake' hence the map's creators gave the state the name 'Land of the Big Lake'. 'New York' is given as 'New Wild Boar Village' which is based on the idea that York in England derives from Old English eofor 'wild boar' and Latin vicus village. However the meaning is open to interpretation because the Anglo-Saxon name Eoferwic was itself derived from folklore. It meant 'place of yew trees' so New York could be interpreted as either a place 'boars' or 'yews'. The true meaning: The map labels states, cities, and landmarks with the literal meanings of their official names . Further west, California means 'Land . of the Successor', Nevada perhaps surprisingly is 'Snowy Land' whilst . Arizona becomes 'Small Springs'. Others are truly baffling; take Alabama's 'Land of the Thicket Clearers' 'Chicago' apparently means 'Stink Onions' - doesn't quite have the same charm as the 'Windy City' does it? The map extends further afield to other countries too spawning some charming interpretations. Cuba becomes the 'Place To Find Gold', whilst Mexico means 'The Naval of the Moon'. The cartographers, Stephan Hormes and . his wife Silke Peust, say they were inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's maps . of Middle Earth, which include names like 'Dead Marshes' and 'Mount . Doom.' Their world maps are filled with similarly descriptive toponyms. 'We wanted to let the Earth tells its own story,' says Stephan. Northwest: There's no disputing Oregon's name as 'Beautiful Land' there's no wonder rainy Washington State is 'Marsh Farm Land' Southwest: New Mexico is the poetically named 'New Navel of the Moon' and there's few who would dispute Texan hospitality with the state's meaning being 'Land of Friends' 'The names give you an insight into what the people saw when they first looked at a place, almost with the eyes of children. Through the maps, we wanted to show what they saw.' Mr Hormes says that he included numerous caveats in the introduction to the atlas: . 'Not all translations are definitive. The reader may be offered a number of possible alternatives, or the translation may be prefixed by ‘probably’ or ‘presumably’. The atlas shouldn't replace a scientific work about etymology, it is meant as an invitation to the people to start looking at the world through fresh eyes. If you're looking for mistakes, you'll always find some, even in ordnance survey maps. Just take the Atlas of True Names as an idea to visualise the world of etymology to a broad audience at a glance. And these people haven't seen such a world before.'","'Atlas of True Names' is an etymological trip around the world.
The map makers researched global place names to find their origins, and then translated them to English .
Most of the research for the names was done using books of etymology and the Internet ."

The days since a runaway oil train tragically killed 50 people in a Quebec town have proved an unmitigated PR disaster for the head of the American company which owned the train. Edward Burkhardt, president and CEO of Chicago-based Rail World Inc., has received flak from all sides for his insensitive words and actions since the derailment destroyed a large part of the border town of Lac-Megantic last weekend. With emotions running high in the town where less than half of the dead bodies have been recovered, Burkhardt has carried out a masterclass in how not to behave if you are the CEO at the center of a disaster. PR disaster: CEO Edward Burkhardt, has received flak from all sides for his insensitive words and actions since the derailment destroyed a large part of the border town of Lac-Megantic last weekend . After first blaming the local fire department, Burkhardt said the accident was caused by an employee failing to lock the brakes . Burkhadt’s missteps started soon after the crash when he began to publicly speculate about the cause of the explosion. On Tuesday, speaking on the phone from Chicago rather than at the crash site, Burkhardt blamed a local fire department for ‘tampering’ with the brakes of the train in the process of putting out a smaller fire that broke out just before the train lost control. The fire department angrily denied that charge and Burkhardt quickly changed his story, blaming an employee who he said had failed to properly set the brakes. Burkhardt told reporters that the engineer, whom he didn't name, ‘was not in jail, but police have talked about prosecuting him.’ Burkhadt’s missteps started soon after the crash when he began to publicly speculate about the cause of the explosion . The days since the runaway oil train tragically killed 50 people in a Quebec town have proved an unmitigated PR disaster for Burkhardt . On Wednesday, four days after the accident, Burkhardt arrived in Lac Megantic and gave a bizarre press conference on the street which did nothing to enhance his reputation. Seemingly on his own and unprepared, Burkhardt spoke in English - far from ideal in a town where French is the dominant language, reports Atlantic Wire. ‘People are always putting words in my mouth,’ Burkhardt told reporters during a rambling 45 minute conversation with media, as local residents shouted insults at him. 'We think we have plenty of responsibility here. Whether we have total responsibility is yet to be determined.’ Quebec Premier Pauline Marois has been a vocal critic of Burkhardt. ‘The leader of this company should have been there from the beginning,’ she said. Lac-Megantic's mayor, Colette Roy-Laroche, has revealed that a hoped-for meeting with Burkhardt hasn't materialized. Video: Watch Burkhardt's ramshackle press conference . A man sits with a sign outside the school sheltering evacuees, while Burkhardt faced cries of 'murderer' from furious town residents . 'I am angry with the fact that he did not communicate with me sooner,' she said. At Burkhardt's head office, an aide said no snub of the mayor was intended. 'There's been a misunderstanding on that issue,' said Cathy Aldana. 'Our people have been in contact with mayor's office daily, and I know Mr. Burkhardt wanted to see her personally.' Burkhardt has also been heavily criticized in the Canadian media for talking more about how he has been personally impacted by the accident rather than how it had affected the town's residents. His selfish approach has drawn parallels with Tony Hayward, the former CEO of British Petroleum when it caused an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Hayward - who lost his job soon after - was widely criticized for attending a yachting race in Europe while the cleanup of the spill was under way; he too complained about the toll of that crisis on him and told reporters he wanted his life back. Debris: Terrorism has been ruled out as a possible cause but there is still a criminal investigation underway . Burkhardt now has a lot to do to convince his critics that he doesn’t deserve the same fate for his poor display in recent days. On Thursday the coroner's office identified the first victim of the incident as 93-year-old Eliane Parenteau, who lived in the disaster zone in downtown Lac-Megantic. Conditions have at least improved enough for nearly all the 2,000 residents forced to evacuate after the crash - a third of the population - to return home. Investigators are also looking at a fire on the same train just hours before the disaster. A fire official has said the train's power was shut down as standard operating procedure, meaning the train's air brakes would have been disabled. In that case, hand brakes on individual train cars would have been needed. The derailment is Canada's worst railway disaster since a train plunged into a Quebec river in 1864, killing 99.

After the monumental ruling last month awarding unpaid wages to an intern who worked on the film Black Swan, two new lawsuits have sprung up against NBCUniversal from former interns. In a lawsuit filed July 3, two former interns of NBCUniversal are suing the media company for unpaid wages for their time spent as interns on two of the company's television shows. Jesse Moore worked as a booking department intern at MSNBC and Monet Eliastam worked as a production intern for Saturday Night Live. Unpaid: The new lawsuit is aimed at NBCUniversal by former interns from MSNBC and Saturday Night Live . The interns: Jesse Moore, left, worked as a booking intern for MSNBC, while Monet Eliastam worked as a production intern for Saturday Night Live . The lawsuit alleges that 'a key part of NBCUniversal's success are the hundreds of unpaid or underpaid interns who work for it as production assistants, researchers, and delivery-people, but receive no or very little compensation for their work.' Both Moore and Eliastam reported working for more than 10 hours a day sometimes, while the lawsuit also states that NBC 'did not provide academic or vocational training.' Their tasks as interns listed in the lawsuit - filing petty cash envelopes, fetching coffee, and booking travel - seem more like training for secretarial positions than jobs in production. If Moore and Eliastam win their lawsuit against NBC, it will mean that not just they are owed back payment - but everyone who was an intern within the state's statue of limitations. In New York, that means interns from the past six years. Both Moore and Eliastam are being represented by the employment law firm Outten & Golden, the same firm that represented Eric Glatt in his successful case against Fox Searchlight for his time spent as an accounting intern on Black Swan. The law firm: Outten & Golden has taken up the intern's plight before, having represented Black Swan intern Eric Glatt. Juno Turner, left, and Justin Swartz, right, will represent the two former interns in their upcoming case . Ross Eisenbrey, a specialist in labor and employment law, explained  why Outten & Golden keep taking up these cases even though there is little to be gained financially. Since these cases are dealing with unpaid minimum wages, the cases don't amount to much unless grouped together in class-action suits with numerous defendants. 'They are hoping that some of these suits will pay off, but I think that they're willing to take a chance and prosecute some of these without a big payoff at the end,' Eisenbrey told Bloomberg Businessweek. 'The way to stop this practice is to bring big suits and win.'","Jesse Moore worked as a booking intern for MSNBC and Monet Eliastam worked as a production intern for Saturday Night Live .

A mother of three who is awaiting a double arm transplant at a Boston hospital has had her home burglarized repeatedly since her amputations in 2010. Katy Hayes, 44, lost all four limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria and has been approved for a double arm transplant at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital in what will be the first such procedure performed in the United States. But while waiting for the operation, Katy, of Kingwood, says an intruder 'took sentimental items we can never get back'. Katy Hayes (pictured speaking at a press conference last year) is awaiting a double arm transplant . 'That really hurt us deep. They took . the necklace my grandfather wore through a Nazi prison and my great . grandmother's ring we were going to give to our daughter,' her husband . Al Hayes told KHOU.com. Katy's . specially modified van was also attempted to be stolen on another . occasion while her neighbors where out of town at the start of July. The . family then received another blow when they were asked to leave a hotel . in Connecticut on July 3rd because Katy's disability made the owners . feel uncomfortable. Her . husband said: 'I called the front desk to say the TV wasn't working and . they guys said we're really not comfortable with your wife's disability . and we'd like for you guys to check out. 'It was humiliating and frustrating', he said. The . family have continued to stay positive throughout adversity though and . Katy says the first thing she wants to do with her new arms is 'smack my . husband.' Al told the . Houston, Texas, new site: 'We're blessed. We're lucky. We've won the . lottery and we're still married even if she's going to hit me when she . gets her arms.' Katy will receive two new arms above the elbow but the former massage therapist still hasn't had a date approved for the transplant. Katy Hayes and her husband Al after he made the decision to have her limbs amputated after his wife fell into a coma as she suffered the affects of a flesh eating bacteria . Approved . by the pioneering hospital for the transplant after undergoing a . rigorous evaluation, Katy has battled through two years of . rehabilitation as a result of losing all her limbs after giving birth to . her third child in 2010. 'I want my life back,' said Hayes to reporters at a press conference last September. 'I want to hold my children, I want to hug my husband, I want to cook dinner.' Hayes . lost her arms and legs to a Group A Streptococcal infection that . accelerated into flesh eating bacteria four days after giving birth to . her third child. The former . runner and yoga enthusiast had her arms amputated above the elbow, her . legs above the knees and also lost her uterus and her large intestines . as doctors battled to keep her alive. 'I never thought about how much a gift your hands are,' said Hayes at the press conference. 'When you don't have hands, you can't wear rings.' After raising $200,000 to cover living expenses, Hayes and her family moved from Texas in July 2012 to prepare for the surgery. Before: Katy and Al Hayes with their children Amber and Jake (left) and the happy couple on their 10th wedding anniversary (right) 'She knew from day one she wanted arm transplants, not just prosthetics,' her brother-in-law Tom Phelps said to the Boston Herald. 'I’m just shocked and amazed that science has come this far. 'Katy . is just a wonderful and fabulous person, and the tragedy of her getting . the strep and how it ravaged her body was just a nightmare, but she’s . so strong, she just pulled through. 'I’ll . never forget when she woke up from the coma,' he recalled. 'She was . like, ‘OK, let’s get to work,’ and we were all saying, ‘No, you need . some down time.’ Hayes also underwent psychological and physical screening at the hospital to determine her eligibility for the grueling surgery and long recovery. The transplant could give Hayes the ability to flex and extend her elbows and to lift herself out of a wheelchair. The level of function she will acquire, especially in her new hands, is uncertain, said Bohdan Pomahac, director of plastic surgery transplantation at the Brigham. All the previous above-the-elbow arm transplants similar to the procedure being planned for Hayes have been performed in Munich, Germany, by Dr. Christoph Hoehnke. Katy Hayes had psychological and physical screenings to see if the Boston hospital would allow her to have the complicated surgery . For Katy Hayes the loss of her independence has been difficult but her husband Al has called her his hero . Katy Hayes and her husband Al on their wedding day on July 31st, 1999. Katy Hayes has said that what she is most looking forward to is wearing her wedding ring again . When the operation is carried out a team of 40 doctors will be involved said Dr. Pomhac. The double transplant will connect skin, muscle, bone and blood vessels in both arms. However, while doctors and experts do not doubt the ability of the surgical team at Brigham and Women's to attach arms onto Hayes, some are unsure whether full function will be restored. This is due to the fact that unlike internal organ transplants, hand and arm transplants are dependent on nerve regrowth to function normally said Dr. Vijay Gorantla, the administrative medical director of the Pittsburgh Reconstructive Transplant Program at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Nerves regrow at the speed of around one millimeter a day said Gorantla, who has been involved in previous Brigham and Women's surgical procedures. 'The recipient nerves have to regrow in the donor shell,' said Gorantla to ABC News. 'At this point, there's no technology to expedite that growth. 'Theoretically, there's a risk that these patients may not be functional or as functional as a distal hand transplant.' Katy Hayes and her daughter, Arielle, at home in Texas following Katy's amputations . Struggle: Despite fitted with limbs that help . her walk on her own, her struggle has been beyond difficult and she at . first wondered if it was worth it, before remembering her family . Katy Hayes relies on her family to help her around the house . Hayes has paid tribute to the medical team at Brigham and Women's as she prepares to enter the next phase of quest to regain arms. 'These doctors are true rock stars. They’re giving so much hope to people, especially veterans, who are coming home with missing limbs,' she said. Hayes touched the heart of the nation in 2010 when it was revealed she had contracted a flesh eating bacteria while giving birth to daughter Arielle. Surgeons in Houston, Texas, had no choice but to amputate her arms and legs to save her life. After returning home Hayes, a massage therapist, struggled to come to terms with the loss of her limbs. She was fitted with prosthetic arms allowing her to hold her baby daughter for the first time. Hayes learned to cope with her new life with the help of her two other children, 18 year old daughter Amber and eight year old son, Jake.

'You know — things that everyone takes for granted.' Her husband, Al, said he is also dreaming of the smaller things. 'I think about things like feeling her arms around me, or feeling her touch my hair,' he said. 'I'm looking forward to her rediscovering the joy in simple touch.'

Privileges reinstated: Dr Shakil Khan Afridi was allowed to see family last Wednesday after a 10-month ban on visitors following an interview he gave Fox News . The doctor who helped the CIA locate Osama Bin Laden is finally getting visits from his family at the Pakistani prison where he is being jailed. Dr Shakil Khan Afridi was convicted to 33 years in prison in May 2012 for 'acting against the state.' When the CIA was trying to confirm Bin Laden's presence in the Abbottabad compound, they sent Dr Afridi in under the auspices of giving out hepatitis B vaccinations. Investigators hoped the vaccinations would provide DNA evidence to confirm who was in the compound. While . Afridi was unsuccessful with the vaccinations, he was able to provide . enough details for the CIA to go through with their raid. When . the Pakistani government found out that one of their own was being used . as a spy for the U.S. agency, he was arrested and tried for treason. In . a surprising move, the Pakistanis tried him under a British-era . regulation that didn't carry the death sentence, unlike the standard . treason charge. He was convicted and has been serving his sentence at Central Prison in Peshawar. When he spoke to Fox News last year about his treatment by the Pakistanis, he was banned from all meetings. Imprisoned: Afridi is serving his 33-year sentence at Central Prison in Peshawar . Last month, that ban was lifted after 10 months. On Wednesday, Afridi was finally able to meet with his wife, Imrana Ghafur, and their three children, between the ages 10 and 15, according to Fox News. Other . sources told Fox that privileges such as being able to receive . food and clothing from family members have been reinstated for Afridi. Afridi's . brother, Jamil Afiridi has since tried to visit the prison but was told . that only the wife and children were on the list of approved visitors. Limited meetings: Afridi's brother Jamil attempted to visit him at the prison, but was turned away . Not even his lawyers are allowed to meet with their client. 'We . are not aware they met, and how did authorities get in touch with them . (the family) without notifying us?' one of Afridi's lawyers asked. But they remain optimistic that the doctor will have his sentence cut short. 'I . think things are changing and moving rapidly,' said the lawyer. 'I feel . that something good will happen soon and freedom (for Afridi) will be . achieved' Afridi's next hearing is on July 18. The U.S. has been pushing hard for Afridi's release ever since he was imprisoned. After Afridi's help with the raid, CIA agents told him that he should seek shelter in Afghanistan with his family. Pivotal: Dr Afridi gained important details from his visit to the compound where Bin Laden was hiding out - details that helped the CIA with their raid . Afridi . didn't want to risk traveling through the dangerous Pashtun tribal . region on the Pakistan -Afghanistan border, so he decided to stay in his . home country. He . didn't know that Bin Laden was in the facility he investigated, so he . didn't think he was at risk of angering the Pakistani government. Since his imprisonment several American officials have called for his release. 'The . doctor was never asked to spy on Pakistan,' a senior American official . told the New York Times. 'He was asked only to help locate Al Qaeda . terrorists, who threaten Pakistan and the U.S. He helped save Pakistani . and American lives.' Former .

The research also found that a staggering 25 per cent of Britons suffer with a sexual condition  - from painful sex to erectile dysfunction – yet do not seek treatment  because they are ashamed or  ‘too worried about the outcome.’ The study, conducted by drug supplier UKMedix.com, aimed to find out more about the sexual health of the nation, looking specifically at problems that Britons don’t necessarily seek help for. The research also found that 25 per cent of Britons suffer with a sexual condition - from painful sex to erectile dysfunction - yet do not seek treatment because they are ashamed or 'too worried about the outcome' Those taking part were asked if they had any sexual problems that concerned them, but they were yet to seek medical or professional help for. The respondents were then asked to state what they believed their ‘secret sex problem’ to be. According to the results, 35 per cent believed they had an STD, 27 per cent had occasional or frequent erectile dysfunction and 22 per cent suffered pain during sex. When asked why they had failed to seek professional or medical advice for their problem, the majority, 55 per cent, claimed they were simply ‘too embarrassed’ while 29 per cent admitted that they were ‘too worried about the outcome.’ Those with an intimate problem were then asked if they had sought advice from their partner, family or friends instead of a medical professional. Nearly two thirds admitted that they’d discussed their secret sex problem with their partner if they were in a relationship, while one in five, said they had turned to friends for advice. Worryingly, 62 per cent of respondents with a problem claimed that they attempted to self-diagnose using the internet, while 18 per cent had bought over-the-counter medication to self-remedy .

Scientists have developed a ‘no-frills’ form of IVF they claim will cost £170 and work as well as the conventional technique. The budget version, which could soon be available in Britain, economises on expensive drugs and incubators, and instead uses a cheap test-tube set and a chemical reaction inspired by Alka-Seltzer hangover tablets. Despite its basic form, tests show it to be at least as good as the normal technique, which is carried out in multi-million-pound labs and costs up to £15,000. A low-tech simplified form of IVF that makes use of baking soda has the potential to slash the cost of assisted conception, bringing it within reach of millions more childless couples around the world . In a Belgian trial, almost a third of the participants became pregnant. In total, 12 babies have been born so far, the European Society of Human . Reproduction and Embryology’s annual conference in London heard . yesterday. With the kit’s inventors believing it could replace conventional IVF in . most cases, the breakthrough could help millions of women fulfil their . dream of motherhood cheaply. Researcher Dr Elke Klerkx, of the Genk Institute for Fertility . Technology in Belgium, said the kit would ‘undoubtedly open up a new era . in the history of IVF’. The international research team’s main aim is to help couples in the . developing world, but they accept it heralds no-frills IVF in the UK. A conventional IVF lab contains expensive incubators in rooms with a . purified air supply to keep everything sterile. Costs are increased by . drugs to boost egg production, the selection of the best embryos and . freezing of the rest, and the screening of embryos for genetic defects. But Professor Jonathan Van Blerkom, the kit’s inventor, said he had gone . back to basics. One of the keys to IVF treatment is to grow the . fledgling embryo in a nutrient mixture that is neither too acidic or too . alkaline, achieved by pumping expensive, medical-grade carbon dioxide . into the incubator. But he showed it was possible to generate the gas . needed by dissolving an Alka-Seltzer tablet in water. He then moved on . to mixing baking soda with citric acid to make the gas. His kit is made . up of two 7p tubes with rubber stoppers that are connected by tubing. The carbon dioxide is made in the first and transferred to the second by . the tube. The woman’s eggs and man’s sperm are injected into the second tube, . where, if all goes well, at least one of the eggs will be fertilised. Everything remains airtight, thanks to the rubber stoppers, removing the need for purified air. The embryos grow in the nutrient mixture in the tube. After three to . five days, they are then ready to transfer to the woman’s womb. The technique, which does away with expensive labs, clean rooms, and incubators, could cut the basic cost of IVF by up to 90 per cent, experts predict . The . technique uses fewer drugs at lower doses, which costs less and leads to . fewer, higher quality embryos, meaning the costs of selection, freezing . and screening are slashed. Combined with other measures it opens up the prospect of IVF for less than £200 per treatment cycle . Professor Van Blerkom, of the University of Colorado in the US, said: ‘The basic requirements of a human embryo are very simple. ‘The embryos don’t know if they are living in an expensive incubator and . a lab with purified air or in a little tube. They don’t care. There’s . nothing magical.’ Most of the 50,000 women who have IVF each year in Britain pay for it . themselves. The Create fertility clinic in London’s Harley Street plans . to introduce the new technique as soon as it gets authorisation from the . Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority watchdog. Its medical director Dr Geeta Nargund, a member of the Walking Egg . Foundation charity, which is planning to launch the kit in the . developing world, said: ‘There are a lot of women out there who can’t . afford IVF and can’t get it on the NHS either. It is heartbreaking.’ Dr Allan Pacey, of the British Fertility Society, said: ‘It takes . someone thinking outside the box to revolutionise the way we do things. ‘If this works as well as they’re predicting, it’s exactly the sort of . thing the NHS would like to look at and embrace. It’s a no-brainer.’ The HFEA said: ‘We welcome efforts to reduce the cost of IVF. ‘We’d certainly be open to discussing any proposal to introduce this method to the UK.’ The new technique is based on a pared down incubating system consisting of two connected glass tubes. One tube generates carbon dioxide by combining citric acid and sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The CO2 keeps acidity levels stable in the second tube, which contains a culture medium and where fertilisation and embryo development takes place . A group of chemicals found in some cosmetics and plastics have a negative impact on the success of IVF treatment, according to a new study. Phthalates are thought to be responsible for a general decline in fertility in both men and women. The new study by Dr Irene Souter of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School now also suggests that they reduce the chance of successful IVF. Dr Souter studied the progress of 231 women scheduled for IVF at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 2004 and 2012. Urine samples were taken at the start of, and throughout, treatment and analysed for phthalates. The results were then compared to the number of eggs produced following ovarian stimulation, embryo development, and implantation failure. Results first showed that urinary phthalates were detected in almost all the women, reflecting the widespread level of exposure. The results also showed the odds of implantation failure increased with rising phthalate levels. The results showed that urinary concentrations of some commonly used phthalates were ‘dose-dependently’ associated with an increased risk of implantation failure. However, the results did not detect any association between levels of urinary phthalates and rates of fertilisation or embryo development. Dr Souter believes the results ‘support the hypothesis’ that phthalates are widespread in the environment and may well have an adverse effect on female fertility, particularly when tested in the model of IVF. She said: ‘We are all primarily exposed to phthalates through inhalation and ingestion. ‘It is extremely difficult if not impossible to avoid exposure to phthalates, since they are in so many products.’ However, she added that exposure can be reduced by limiting the use of personal care products with fragrances in them, including many of the modern baby care products and air fresheners, limiting the use of plastic food storage containers and plastic wraps, especially not heating food in them, and reading the labels and avoid children's toys made of plastics that contain phthalates.","Technique could bring IVF within reach of millions more childless couples .

Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has criticized the Obama administration’s decision to supply weapons to the rebels in the civil war in Syria, arguing that the U.S. should ‘Let Allah sort it out’ until there is a stronger leader in the White House. ‘Militarily, where is our commander in chief? We’re talking now more new interventions. I say until we know what we’re doing, until we have a commander and chief who knows what he’s doing, well, let these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, “Allah Akbar,” I say until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I say let Allah sort it out,’ Palin said at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference on Saturday. The White House confirmed on Thursday that it had conclusive evidence that Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime has used chemical weapons against rebel forces. Scroll down for video . Palin has criticized the Obama administration¿s decision to supply weapons to the rebels in the civil war in Syria . The use of weapons such as the nerve agent sarin crosses what President Barack Obama has called a 'red line' that would trigger greater American involvement in the crisis. Obama discussed the civil war in Syria with European leaders in a teleconference on Friday, and the issue is expected to dominate much of the conversation at next week’s G-8 Summit in Northern Ireland. The White House is now considering arming the opposition fighters and enforcing a no-fly zone that could cost an estimated $50 million a day. The final speaker at the three-day Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference, former Alaska Gov. Palin rejected calls for an immigration overhaul that includes a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. Palin, who is rejoining Fox News Channel as an analyst on Monday, described Washington as 'one hot mess' The White House says it has conclusive evidence that Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime has used chemical weapons against rebels . Palin, who is rejoining Fox News Channel as an analyst less than half a year after they decided to part ways, also called Washington, D.C. ‘one hot mess,’ reports ABC News. She also offered a warning to 'the good old boys' in the GOP leadership who are calling for conservative activists to tone down aggressive rhetoric. 'You do not marginalize, you don't discredit and dismiss, every day average hard-working Americans - those who are part of that grass-roots tea party movement,' she said. 'Just let them tell us to sit down and shut up,' Palin said later, 'which I refuse to do.' She also took a swipe at another speaker at the conservative forum, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who argued Friday that one of the reasons to support the Senate’s immigration reform plan is because ‘Immigrants are more fertile.’ Palin and husband Todd, top left, greets supporters after speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority 2013 conference on Saturday . ‘I think it’s kind of dangerous . territory, territory to want to debate this whole one race’s fertility . rate over another, and I say this from someone who’s kind of fertile . herself,’ Palin said. ‘I don’t think that’s where we want to go in deciding how will we incentivize the hardworking responsible families who want to live in the light, follow the law, become Americans, versus those whose very first act on our soil is to break the law? There are different ways that we can debate this.’ As she warned the conservative crowd of ‘tyranny’ in government, Palin said that the recent scandals involving the Internal Revenue Service and the National Security Agency make the country feel ‘so Orwellian around here, you know, “1984.’” Palin's first appearance since returning to Fox is scheduled for Monday on the 'Fox & Friends' morning show – on the same day CNN is premiering a morning show to great fanfare. Fox and Palin parted ways in January after she had worked there for three years as a contributor. They had talked about renewing their contract, but it didn't happen. Palin said that recent scandals involving the IRS and the NSA make the country feel 'so Orwellian around here, you know, ""1984'"" Money may have been a factor: Palin was . signed for a reported $1 million a year when she originally joined Fox . less than two years after being John McCain's running mate. Fox News chief Roger Ailes said in a statement: 'I've had several conversations with Governor Palin in the past few weeks about her rejoining FOX News as a contributor. 'I have great confidence in her and am pleased that she will once again add her commentary to our programming. 'I hope she continues to speak her mind.' Palin also hit headlines this week for blasting comedian Bill Maher on Twitter Wednesday, saying she hopes his 'lily white a**' gets flattened, after he reportedly made a joke directed at her 5-year-old special needs son. Palin learned of the alleged joke from a conservative writer for Breitbart News, who attended Maher's stand-up show in The Pearl concert venue at The Palms Hotel in Las Vegas on Saturday. The writer, Ron Futrell, wrote in a blog that he attended the show with friends and became inflamed when Maher made a comment referring to Palin's son Trig, who has Downs Syndrome, as 'retarded.'

Identified: Éliane Parenteau-Boulanger has been identified as the first victim of the Quebec train derailment disaster. Up to 49 other victims are yet to be named . The first victim of a runaway oil train's explosive derailment in a Quebec town has been identified, more than five days since the disaster. Eliane Parenteau, 93, lived alone in her home right next to the railway line, in downtown Lac-Megantic. She was a high-spirited woman, the only remaining survivor of 11 siblings, and still lived in the family home where she raised her own children. Defiant Mrs Parenteau had told her family that she did not ever want to end up in a nursing home, preferring to die in her own home. Her son Michel Boulanger, described his mother as 'kicking and alive' and always had a humuorous approach to life. In an interview with The Star prior to the coroner having identified her as a victim, he said: 'She had a spirit like David Letterman. She makes you a part of the joke.' He said his mother was an industrious home-maker, taking pride in making her garden look nice by placing painted stones along the border with the footpath. She was renowned for her strawberry-rhubarb pies and would always serve up generous portions when cooking for others. In the summer she would set up chairs on her lawn so she and the neighbours could sit and listen to the town's frequent outdoor concerts. She was a sociable and deeply spirited woman, who attended church regularly until she broke her hip. From then on she would watch mass on TV. She still rose at 4am every day to pray for those she loved. Mrs Parenteau was born in the small and remote town of Wotton, in Quebec. The large family had to take a horse and carriage 16km every week to church. When her brother became a priest at of Saint-Jean-Vianney Church, just outside Lac-Megantic, she started to work there as a chef and usher. Scroll down for video... Inferno: 15 people are now confirmed dead and 45 are still missing as the train company president said the accident was caused by an employee failing to lock the set the brakes . Debris: Terrorism has been ruled out as a possible cause but there is still a criminal investigation underway . Shells: Burnt cars are seen near the train wreckage which was traveling far too fast when it went off the rails, investigators told reporters on Tuesday . It was while working at the church that she met her husband; he used to deliver the groceries to the church. During the Second World War, Mrs Parenteau had worked in a factory making parachutes. Mr Boulanger never gave up hope that his mother may have survived, telling The Star earlier this week, perhaps she was playing a trick and 'hiding somewhere'. He last spoke to his mother on Thursday evening and he had told him she had had a senior citizens' meeting that day. He tried to call her Saturday but the phone was dead. The incident left behind a scorched scene so dangerous that it has slowed the search for 50 people presumed dead. Quebec's premier toured the town and sharply criticised the U.S. railways chief for not responding in person more quickly to Canada's worst railway disaster in nearly 150 years. Police said four more bodies had been found, bringing the total found to 24. The devastated downtown area remained dangerous for days after the crash as emergency crews put out fires and struggled to keep the remaining oil tankers cool so they would not explode. The hazardous conditions delayed the search for the missing - and now for bodies. Still standing: The Sainte-Agnes Catholic Church stands unscathed next to the derailment and blast site . Vast devastation: A police officer walks amongst axle gear and the battered tankers which careered downhill . Officials also have warned that identifications would be made more difficult by the incinerated scene. Conditions had at least improved enough for nearly all the 2,000 residents forced to evacuate after the crash - a third of the population - to return home, the town's mayor said. Quebec premier Pauline Marois arrived in the town and renewed her criticism of Edward Burkhardt, president and CEO of U.S.-based Rail World, which owns the runaway train. 'The leader of this company should have been there from the beginning,' she said at a news conference. Mr Burkhardt arrived in the town for the first time on Wednesday with a police escort, facing jeers from residents. He has said he delayed his visit to deal with the crisis from his Chicago office, saying he was better able to communicate from there. 'I understand the extreme anger,' he said. 'We owe an abject apology to the people in this town.' He has blamed the engineer for failing to set the brakes properly before the unmanned train hurtled down a seven-mile incline, derailed and ignited. All but one of its 73 cars was carrying oil, and at least five exploded. Rail World Inc. president Edward Burkhardt, pictured speaking to the media in Lac-Megantic on Wednesday, said an employee responsible for the train's brakes had been suspended and is being investigated . Mr Burkhardt's arrival in the devastated town was met with much anger by residents . A woman was overcome with grief as she sat outside the school sheltering evacuees in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, on Wednesday . Mr Burkhardt said the engineer had been suspended without pay and was under 'police control'. Anger at the railway officials among residents appeared to mount on Thursday. Lac-Megantic's mayor, Colette Roy-Laroche, said a hoped-for meeting with Mr Burkhardt did not materialise. 'I am angry with the fact that he did not communicate with me sooner,' she said. At Mr Burkhardt's head office, an aide said no snub of the mayor was intended. 'There's been a misunderstanding on that issue,' said Cathy Aldana. 'Our people have been in contact with the mayor's office daily, and I know Mr Burkhardt wanted to see her personally.' Investigators are also looking at a fire on the same train just hours before the disaster. A fire official has said the train's power was shut down as standard operating procedure, meaning the train's air brakes would have been disabled. In that case, hand brakes on individual train cars would have been needed. The derailment is Canada's worst railway disaster since a train plunged into a Quebec river in 1864, killing 99. The crash has raised questions about the rapidly growing use of rail to transport oil in North America, especially in the booming North Dakota oil fields and Alberta oil sands far from the sea. Shell-shocked residents of Lac-Megantic in Quebec took a small step toward normalcy on Friday after homes and businesses reopened just yards away from the lakeside town's devastated centre. Police erected an 8-foot (2.5-meter) fence blocking from view what was once a downtown core of restaurants, bars and shops - but which now resembles a blackened warzone after a train pulling 72 cars of crude oil jumped the track and exploded into flames there on July 6. Bells from the town's main church, whose spire towers over the treetops in this normally quiet town in Quebec's eastern hills, could be heard ringing out for the first time since the incident as residents prepared to bring in mementos of the dead for a memorial. 'It is good to be home, even if we're near a disaster area,' said Andre Gabouri, 47, as he stood on his doorstep peering over the police barricade across the street and into the warped pile of train cars. In a testament to the intensity of the blast, which killed an estimated 50 people in Canada's worst train incident in years, the vinyl siding of nearby houses was curled outward and the leaves in the trees blackened.","Éliane Parenteau-Boulanger, 93, is the first of 50 victims to be identified .

Outrage: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has unwittingly sparked a rush of cleavage photos on social media . Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has unwittingly sparked a rush of cleavage photos on social media after a commentator said it was wrong for her to show too much of her breasts in Parliament. Outraged women have sent images of their own cleavage to a Facebook page, the organiser telling the commentator that it was time 'everyone accepted that women have breasts and got over it, to the best of their ability.' The outrage was triggered by columnist Grace Collier who said on a radio programme: 'I don't think it's appropriate for a a Prime Minister to be showing her cleavage in Parliament.' Within hours women around the country hit back, sending images of their bosoms to the Destroy the Joint Facebook page under the hashtag #convoyofcleavage. Miss Jenna Price, a spokeswoman for the Destroy the Joint page, said she was building up a compendium of cleavage pictures which might be sent to Miss Collier as 'a humorous way of telling Grace Collier that she's an idiot.' Miss Price, who is a media academic at Sydney's University of Technology, howled: 'Here's news for Grace: women have breasts.' The flood of breast photos came in after blogger Jennifer Wilson encouraged women to tweet a picture of their cleavage. Movement: Outraged women have sent images of their own cleavage to a Facebook page, the organiser telling the commentator that it was time 'everyone accepted that women have breasts and got over it, to the best of their ability' 'It seems to me that if we are to stamp out this irrational horror of the female breast…we have little choice but to use immersion therapy in which we expose Ms Collier and fellow sufferers to images of that which they so fear.' She added that this would result in 'the informed hope that they may become desensitised and return to their normal, hinged lives.' Miss Collier outraged women when she said on a programme on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Miss Gillard's cleavage was 'not something I want to see.' She added: 'In my opinion as an industrial relations consultant, it is inappropriate to be in Parliament, it is disrespectful to yourself and to the Australian community and to the Parliament to present yourself in a manner that is unprofessional. Questions: Miss Gillard Was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay because he was a hairdresser . 'In every Australian workplace we have certain standards of presentation and conducts. It's not just about personal presentation. It's about conduct.' Sexism is a word that has been hovering around the Australian Prime Minister in recent times. She has accused Liberal opposition leader Tony Abbot of being a misogynist and only last week she was asked by Perth radio presenter Howard Sattler - who has since been sacked because of his question - whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay as he was a professional hairdresser. In a  vulgar incident last week . it . emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party . included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail', . described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'. Details of the menu at . a fundraising event in Brisbane were revealed after Miss Gillard's . warning that if her Labour Party lost the general election in September, . the incoming Liberals would be 'dominated by men in blue ties' and . women would be given only minor roles. Furious: Former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (right), who was also . targeted in the menu, described the stunt as a 'snide, dirty and sexist . trick'","Outrage sparked after a columnist said on radio: 'I don't think it's appropriate for a a Prime Minister to be showing her cleavage in Parliament.'

"By . Esther Rantzen . PUBLISHED: . 17:26 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:11 EST, 31 May 2013 . The bad fairy at my birth cursed me with fine hair. Ever since, I have longed to be like my friends who all have thick, lustrous locks. Their hair bounces into a glorious frame for their faces, while mine lies flat and shapeless, clinging to my skull, making my big face look even bigger. I have tried ‘volumising’ shampoos — what a con. I have slathered my follicles with ‘root lifting’ mousses and sprays — another waste of money. For the past 30 years Esther Rantzen has been wearing wigs on television and the red carpet . I watch my friends effortlessly shake their hair into shape, and try to sympathise when they claim they have had a ‘Bad Hair Day’. Come on, girls, you have no idea what it is like to have a Bad Hair Life. And so I have a confession to make. For the past 30 years plus, if you’ve seen me on the television or on the red carpet, it’s likely I’ve been wearing a wig. I first took the desperate step of buying one when I was in my early 30s. Since then, I’ve often worn one when presenting a show or at an event or job that needed a bit of bounce, a bit of glamour. Today, I have seven wigs, because each time I’ve changed the colour of my hair, I’ve had to buy a new one in the same new colour. God forbid a real tendril should escape from underneath the wig, exposing my terrible secret. Wigs can be terribly expensive — thousands of pounds if they are made from real hair. But aside from the expense, I’ve . never liked the idea of real hair. It feels tasteless and exploitative . to wear tresses cut from the heads of nuns or penniless Chinese farmers’ wives. So I’ve gone for . the cheap and cheerful nylon variety — the kind that costs around £80, . that you can pack at the bottom of a suitcase, then shake out and pull . on like a hat. Alas, I . have eventually learned that on me, it looks exactly like what it is — a . cheap wig on a desperate woman with baby-fine hair. This is why I’ve decided to come clean about my secret wig addiction — and give them up from now on. Esther decided to go for the cheapb and cheerful nylon variety - the kind that costs around £80 . When I started wearing them, I took as my role models the famous, glamorous women, the sex symbols, who are quite open about the fact that they spend their lives in wigs. I recently saw Joan Collins at a party, now a glorious 80 years old, wearing a hugely exuberant head of hair. It must have been heavy and hot, but the lady wore it with style — though I slightly prefer the shorter, more businesslike wigs she wore to villainous effect in Dynasty. Carry On actress Barbara Windsor wears wigs and extensions — she has soft, fine hair that refuses to frame her face, like mine. I once shared a hairdresser’s salon with Dame Shirley Bassey. Not the whole diva, mind you — just her wig. And when Michael Parkinson interviewed Dolly Parton, gazing with awe at her ornate construction of ringlets and asking, ‘Dolly, how long does it take to do your hair?’ she replied, ‘I don’t know. I’m never there.’ Good for her. When I bought my first wig, I was working as a television presenter for That’s Life. I had just been arrested for handing out bat stew to passers-by in the street as a stunt for the show (not because the stew was dangerous, but the police said I was causing an obstruction). The paparazzi gathered round me as I was released from the police station. As it was raining at the time, my . thin hair was left straggling over my face and head. When I saw the . pictures, enough was enough. I was then a regulation television-presenter streaky-blonde colour, so I bought myself a blonde wig. My . late husband Desmond hated it. He declared it looked like a shaggy . mountain goat, and would even wear it himself, claiming it suited him . better than it did me. But I thought from a distance it was passable, so I persevered. Such was my fear of showing off those thin strands again. But . my wig was a nightmare in a high wind — I thought it might take off at . any moment — and no good at all in my open-top car. I once had to slam . on the brakes and chase it down the road, hoping the neighbours would . think I was saving the life of a much-loved chihuahua. Did you spot the difference? Esther shows off her real hair now she has decided to ditch the wigs . Barbara Castle, the famously red-haired politician who often wore a wig for public occasions, once warned me how important it is to anchor your wig with pins. She described the time she was asked to lay a foundation stone on a building site, and a piece of wire protruding from a door frame hooked the smart red wig, leaving it swinging over her head while she had to carry on without it. But I could never find the right pins to use as anchors — no matter how spiky or painful, they would never stick the wig to my head. I soon got caught out. One red carpet awards ceremony I was presenting took place in a faraway seaside town. The organisers sent a stretch limo to take me there and bring me home. I dragged on a wig and hoped for the best. My first hurdle was getting in and out of the limo. If I hit my head on the door-frame, I knew the wig would topple off. By bending double, I somehow managed to keep my hair on. But it was a long night and I fell asleep on the way home. I woke to see the driver pointing a camera at me. The wig had revolved, so the hair at the back now covered my face. I tried to smile while pulling nylon hair out of my teeth. I still dread those pictures emerging somewhere. But that first blonde wig did have its fans. Magician Uri Geller once told me how much he liked my new hairdo — illusionist he might be, but he certainly fell for my illusion. By contrast, the late Michael Winner . saw through it at once. ‘That’s a wig,’ he bellowed at a film premiere. ‘No it’s not,’ I said weakly. Why . did I lie? Because wearing fake hair makes me feel guilty, even . ashamed. But I was desperate. I learned to live with the feeling. When . I appeared on Stars in Their Eyes, I bought a jet-black wig to help me . look like singer Edith Piaf, whom I was impersonating. To this day, I . call that wig Edith. Piaf must be revolving in her grave. With . Strictly Come Dancing, the thought of having to dance the rumba, the . ‘dance of love’, with Anton du Beke, sent me running to the wig . department in Selfridges. Anything to distract the judges from my feet. Red hair is a nightmare to keep dying so Esther decided to grow it out for the first time in 40 years . I found a bright red number (which I christened ‘Sharon’ after Mrs Osbourne) and had my own hair dyed to match it. Sadly, my wig failed to distract the judges from my rumba — ‘disaster, darling’ was their verdict. In real life, too, Sharon fooled nobody. I was wearing Sharon when I met comedienne Ruby Wax. She looked straight at my hairline. As my wig was approximately Ruby’s colour I hoped she might approve. She didn’t. ‘Is . that a wig?’ she said accusingly. This time I decided to be honest. ‘Of . course,’ I said, feeling embarrassed as she tried to contain her . laughter. Red hair is a nightmare to keep dying, so finally I decided to let it grow out for the first time in 40 years. As my real colour emerged after so long under wraps, I expected it to be grey or white. Grey would have been fine — it’s supposedly slightly thicker and coarser. For once, I thought, I might have a frame to my face. But lo! It turns out that, like my father, I haven’t gone grey. My hair is still brown and as wispy as ever. So now I’ve had to buy myself a brunette wig, this time from a wig specialist in London’s Notting Hill. I wore it for the first time in earnest at a recent ITV Audience With. I washed my hair, did what I could with rollers and mousse, decided it wasn’t enough, and at the last moment, on went the wig. It was hot and itchy, but once it was on, it was there for the whole night. The show was followed by a party with the cream of show business. As I greeted each one, I saw to my horror that their eyes were fixed on my hairline. When I went to the loo I saw why. The wig had lifted so that it looked like a hairy balloon on the back of my head, with my real fringe poking out at the front. It was the final humiliation. After many years and many hairy incarnations, I have to conclude that wigs are a total nightmare. My advice is that if you have your own hair — any amount of your own hair — stick with it and find a good hairdresser. And so, for the first time in more than 30 years, I’m going to try to manage without the wigs I’ve become so peculiarly reliant on. Looking back, I don’t think really they’ve ever done me any favours. My hair may be flat, fine and limp, but it’s still my own. And I’d rather have the shame of a flat do than constantly live with the fear of a gust of wind revealing my terrible, hair-raising secret.","Esther Rantzen first took the step of buying a wig in her early 30s .

John Franklin Riggs left family members clinging to a capsized boat in a sea of stinging jellyfish. After swimming for five hours and climbed over rocks at the shoreline in the pitch black to reach help for his family who was still out at sea. Off the coast, his sister tried to keep her family alive as they clung to their boat that had capsized. Contessa Riggs, 43, of Washington D.C. was fishing off the coast of Deal Island, Maryland when her brother, John Franklin Riggs, her 70-year old father, 9-year-old niece and 3-year-old son, were caught up in a thunder storm. Their boat was only 16 feet long and Riggs and her brother immediately knew they were in trouble. Hero: 46-year-old John Riggs, of Salisbury, swam five hours against strong waves in the middle of a storm for help . 'It was sundown. The water suddenly became very choppy and a wave crashed into the boat, filling the boat with water,' Ms Riggs told ABC News. 'John started to bucket the water out and I grabbed life jackets and made sure everybody had one, but then there was another wave. In a second our boat was upside down in the water,' Ms. Riggs said. When their boat capsized, Riggs' brother and father swam under to get lifejackets. 'My father wears a pacemaker, and we had very young children with us, so we made sure everybody stayed near the boat,' said Ms. Riggs. Rescued: Emily Horn, 9, was among those saved from a capsized boat . 'I had my son between me and the siding. John did the same thing for my niece,' Riggs continued. 'The children took turns sitting on the boat.' The family clung to the boat for an hour and a half in cold water infested by jellyfish and sea nettles. Contessa Riggs said the boat capsized about two miles from shore, and drifted about five miles in a parallel direction when the tide turned. John Riggs' father, whose name also is John Riggs, is a 70-year-old retired commercial waterman from Salisbury, Maryland, who organized the fishing trip. Also aboard the vessel were the waterman's daughter, Contessa Riggs, and her 3-year-old son, Conrad Drake, both of Washington; and his granddaughter, 9-year-old Emily Horn, a fourth-grader visiting from San Francisco. Man on a mission: John Riggs swam for five and a half hours to shore to raise the alarm and get help . 'There was only a little bit of light left, and the storm was still in the distance. We could see the lightening hit the water and we knew there would not be another boat that late in the evening,' Riggs explained. 'It was so cold. My son was shivering and shivering and shivering against me. He kept repeating 'I don't like this,' 'I don't like this,' 'This is no fun',' she remembered. Riggs knew that nobody was going to start looking for them until the next day, so she and John decided they had to act. 'Our family wasn't expecting us back until tomorrow, and we didn't think we'd be able to make it that long,' Riggs said. 'John and I looked at each other and he said, 'Should I try it?' I knew he was talking about swimming to shore. So I told him to try it. But we had no idea if he would make it to shore,' she added. The sun had set by the time Rigg's brother left his father, niece, nephew, and sister on the capsized boat. He swam for almost five hours, reaching shore around 1 a.m. Near tragedy: The boat overturned two miles from short. After calling 911, John Riggs went on a rescue boat with volunteer firefighters to find his family in the pitch black . 'John made it to the beach but he was so tired, he could not walk. So he crawled to the nearest house he saw. Luckily they had dogs, which woke the family up. And even luckier for us, that family had the personal number for the fire chief,' Riggs said. Meanwhile, Ms. Riggs and her family had been clinging to their rocking boat for almost eight hours. 'It was absolutely horrible,' Riggs recalled. 'Our legs were getting stung over and over again by the jellyfish. We had cuts and bruises. My son was crying. Waves kept crashing over our heads.' Riggs started to worry about her father. 'He had been in the water the longest. And I realized that if anything happened to him, I'd have to choose between helping him and leaving the kids and staying with the kids. It was such a hard choice to make peace with.' But Ms. Riggs found ways to keep everybody's spirits up. 'I kept saying, 'They're coming for us, we're going to get rescued, don't worry,'' she said. 'We talked about stupid things like eating ice cream and watching movies.' Back on dry land: On the boat were Riggs¿ 70-year-old father, a 9-year-old niece, Riggs¿ sister, Contessa Riggs, and her 3-year-old son . It was as they were talking that she noticed lights in the horizon. 'Suddenly we could see the boats and a helicopter and we just started screaming and waving.' 'There were a few storms in the area, and the boat turned upside down,' said Sgt. Brian Albert at the Maryland Natural Resources Police. 'Mr. Riggs swam to shore. These people are very lucky. No one was injured.' A Maryland State Police helicopter hovered above the 16-foot Carolina Skiff as firefighters from Deal Island, Mount Vernon and Fairmount in Somerset County and Westside in Wicomico County pulled alongside. The U.S. Coast Guard also was on the scene, Mr Albert said. Volunteer firefighters pulled Riggs and her family onto a boat but it was only until they were taken to a second boat that she was reunited with her brother. 'It was the most amazing feeling. I ran up to John and said you are my hero.' The family is safely back on shore, with no significant injuries. Perhaps someone would have located the fishing party, eventually, even if Riggs had not swam for help. What is certain is that wearing life jackets saved their lives, Mr Albert said. 'It is lucky they put life jackets on,' he said. 'The life jackets are what saved their lives.' Ms. Riggs' 9-year-old niece, Emily, called her uncle a 'real hero.' 'Everybody is fine. But really, there were some very beautiful moments in the water. We were terrified, but the sky had never been clearer and we could see all the stars in the Milky Way. There was no light pollution,' Ms Riggs said. 'The water was glowing blue with the fluorescent jelly fish.' 'I'm so grateful to the first responders that came and helped us out. I was so happy to see them and I love all of them. And I am so proud of my family, especially my brother. We survived together.' Friends and family are taking care of the survivors. 'Everybody has just been great,' Ms Riggs said. 'My friends have been cooking for us,' she said, 'They said I shouldn't have to worry about dinner after all of this. And I think they're right.'","Fishing party consisted of Ms Riggs and four other family members .

A Canadian railway is suing the mother of man killed by one of its trains – giving the heartbroken woman until exactly two years to the day of the accident to answer the suit.Sharon Jobson, of Glencoe, Ontario, has until July 29 to answer a $500,000 lawsuit from CN Rail brought against the grieving mother for damages and train delays incurred through her 22-year-old son John Jobson’s negligence despite the crossing still not having adequate signage and warnings, according to reports.‘We thought we had a happy ending. Lights and gates are going up in the next two weeks — they’ve already been delivered . . .  I think everyone thought it was a good ending to a tragic story. This is just really a shock to everyone,’ Sharon Jobson told the Toronto Star. Dead: John Jobson, 22, died six days after his pickup truck was struck by a commuter train, now the railroad is suing his mother for damages . Despite Sharon Jobson, 50, persuading the rail operator to budget over $400,000 to install signs and warning gates at rail crossings, the one her son was killed at still has inadequate signage and no gates, yet the CN Rail felt it proper to serve her with the lawsuit since she is the executor of his estate, according to CTV.John Jobson is ‘wholly responsible’ for costs related to rail repair and a ‘bottleneck of rail traffic,’ according to a copy of the suit obtained by the Toronto Star. The suit goes on to say that Jobson failed to obey a stop sign and was traveling ‘at an excessive rate of speed’ over the rail crossing when his pickup truck was struck by a passenger train, the paper reported. John Jobson died six days later at a local hospital. ‘He created a situation of danger . . . (and) had a history of failing to stop at this crossing,’ the paper reported the suit said.Of the 116 passengers on-board the VIA train, six sustained minor injuries when the locomotive and all four train cars derailed after the collision, according to a report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Pay up: CN Rail says negligence caused the collision and that the $500,000 in repairs and inconveniences should be paid by his mother Sharon Jobson . Unsafe: The suit was brought against Sharon Jobson despite the crossing having inadequate signage at the time of the collision that has yet to be upgraded . The history of failing to stop at rail crossings alleged in the suit is an incident in which John Jobson had to drive into a ditch to avoid colliding with a Canadian Pacific Railway train at a separate crossing just north of where the collision occurred, according to the TSB report. Adequate signage and warnings were installed at the CP crossing shortly after the incident, the TSB report noted.Despite a train previously killing a driver in a 1998 collision at the same crossing where John Jobson’s pickup truck was hit, CN Rail neglected to upgrade the crossing’s warning systems, which the TSB said were ‘situated too low,’ to sufficiently warn drivers.Also a hindrance to John Jobson being aware of the oncoming train was the train horn’s position – instead of being at the front of the locomotive, it was in the middle of the head car, making it harder to hear, according to the TSB report. Crushed: Sharon Jobson's son is dead because a train hit him, and now the railway wants her to pony up $400,000 . The devastated mother even declined last year to sue the railroad, saying it was never about the money.‘We were happy with getting some safety measures in place. We never were seeking anything financial,’ she told the Star, adding ‘I was hoping to have some peace with the lights and the safety measures in place but that won’t be happening too soon.’Both the railway and Sharon Jobson are declining to comment publicly on the suit, with Sharon Jobson only telling CTV ‘I don’t want to be doing this at this time.I just want to have a peaceful time.'","The lawsuit seeks damages related to the deceased man's negligence .

A new mother has shed almost four stone of baby weight after she overheard colleagues gossiping about her expanding waistline.Stunning Claire Hamilton, 29, shrank from a size 14 to a size 8 after cutting out comfort food after bitchy colleagues left her devastated.Claire, from Gillingham, Kent, piled on the pounds after giving birth to her daughter, Isla, in November 2011. New mother Claire Hamilton lost almost four stone after hearing workmates gossiping about her size . Claire lost four stone after hearing colleagues talking about her weight gain when she was in a toilet cubicle . Despite the new mother making several attempts to shed her baby weight, it wasn’t until she heard colleagues laughing about her looks that she was spurred into starting a serious diet. And after just over three months on a strict diet plan normally recommended only to obese people, Claire dropped three dresses sizes. Claire, who works as a window dresser . for a department store, said: 'I knew I’d put on weight after I had . Isla, and I wanted to lose it, but it just never seemed to be a . priority. 'I . wasn’t happy with how I looked, but it was only when I heard other . people talking about me that I got the kick up the backside I needed to . do something about it. 'I was in a toilet cubicle at work when I heard two other girls that I work with talking about me. Claire shrank from a size 14 to a slinky size 8 after ditching the comfort food and said picturing herself in a bikini helped to keep her on track . 'They were saying that I’d really let . myself go since I’d had my little girl. I heard one of them say: ‘Maybe . she just doesn’t realise how fat she is now?’ 'I was devastated. I had always been very slim and really taken pride in my appearance. 'That . was the motivation I needed to lose the baby weight. That night, I . logged onto mumsnet and asked people how they’d lost the baby weight - . and loads of people recommended the Cambridge plan. Claire says that having the same colleagues who she had overheard gossiping about her weight gain tell her how good she looked made her feel good . 'It’s a very strict diet which is . just what I needed. I’m all or nothing, so as soon as I committed to a . diet where I was only allowed to eat shakes and soups, I was really . committed.' Claire, who is 5’4” tall, managed to shrink from tipping the scales at 11st 13lb to a tiny 8st 4lb in just over three months. The Cambridge Weight Plan is a diet based on meal replacement products. Using the brand bars, soups and shakes, people following the diet eat a meal plan consisting of between 440kcal to 1500+kcal per day. The meal replacements can also be combined with normal foods on the diet for a slower weight loss. The diet programe is generally only suggest for those with an 'over-weight' BMI (over 25). Claire said: 'Those girls really upset me on that day, but they really did me a favour. 'I didn’t recognise the person they were talking about. 'My partner always told me that I was beautiful, but I worried that one day he would be thinking the same as they had done.

Ann Brennan, 49, died after becoming trapped under a forklift truck loading pallets of Pringles in Bristol, an inquest has heard . A woman was crushed to death by a forklift truck loading packets of Pringles, an inquest has heard. Ann Brennan, 49, died following the accident, where she became trapped under a forklift truck loading pallets of the snacks in Bristol. An inquest into her death heard that the warehouse, in the Avonmouth area of the city, had several previous 'near-misses'. Coroner Gail Elliman today recorded a death of accidental death after half an hour of deliberation from the jury. Annie’s sister Deborah Teagle, 51, said: 'Annie was such a bubbly, selfless character and she was a rock for the family, looking out for us all and caring for our dad. 'She enjoyed her job at the factory and had been there most of her working life. She was very loyal. 'When we received the call to say what had happened we were just in complete shock. It didn’t feel real that Annie, who was always so full of life, was gone. 'The emergency services and air ambulance were amazing and did everything they could to try and save her and we want to thank them for the amazing service they provide. Sadly, nothing could be done for Annie, but they save thousands of other lives every year. 'It has been very difficult to hear that safety precautions were lacking at the warehouse which may have saved Annie but we hope changes have been made at the warehouse and are working to protect other employees. 'Nothing will bring Annie back but it would give us some peace of mind to know her death was not completely in vain.' A Bristol City Council investigation into health and safety at the warehouse is on-going and is likely to take another several months to conclude. During the inquest a safety inspector said he had seen staff using loading equipment as scooters at Booker Wholesale cash and carry, in Avonmouth, as he studied CCTV recordings after the death of the warehouse assistant in 2011. There was no speed limit and no segregation between pedestrians and vehicles in the loading bay where the fatal incident occurred. Ms Brennan, a keen amateur rugby player, died after becoming trapped under a gas-powered forklift truck as it reversed in the warehouse in December 2011. A safety inspector told the inquest he had seen staff using loading equipment as scooters at Booker Wholesale cash and carry, in Avonmouth, as he studied CCTV recordings following Ms Brennan's death . Paramedics found her heart had stopped when they arrived and she was not breathing. She was resuscitated on the way to Frenchay Hospital in the air ambulance but died from multiple fractures and internal injuries shortly after arriving. An inquest at Flax Bourton Coroner's Court yesterday heard that Ms Brennan was struck by a forklift truck driven by replenishment supervisor Ben Morris. Mr Morris described how he was loading pallets of Pringles into the back of a lorry ready for delivery when the incident happened. He said: 'As I was reversing round I looked over my shoulder and I couldn't see anything. Then I felt the rear left wheel lift up in the air. 'I slammed the brake on and I jumped out of the forklift and started screaming and that's all I can remember.' Booker area manager Stephen French said he was at the store's front reception when he heard what had happened. When he arrived he found staff trying to lift the forklift off of Ms Brennan, which he said would have been impossible. The inquest at Flax Bourton Coroner's Court (pictured) heard that Ms Brennan was struck by a forklift truck driven by replenishment supervisor Ben Morris . He said: 'It couldn't be done, but under the circumstances people were just trying to do whatever they could.' Mr French was then questioned about health and safety measures in the warehouse, admitting there was 'no segregation policy at that time' between pedestrians and vehicles. He added there was 'no existing policy in the goods-in area' and 'no speed limit'. Ronald Crandon, the driver of the lorry which was being loaded at the time of the incident, told the court he had witnessed incidents in the past. He also added that he believed there were safety measures in place. Mr Crandon said he had seen a 'near miss' and had a 'bump' with a forklift while using a pallet truck, which had led to lines being drawn to segregate pedestrians. Ms Brennan died after becoming trapped under a gas-powered forklift truck, which was carrying Pringles, as it reversed in the warehouse in December 2011 . But Bristol City Council health and safety inspector Paul Tregale said there were no such measures in place. He told the coroner it was the responsibility of the employer to prepare their work place to avoid contact by separating pedestrians from vehicles. Mr Tregale said: 'There were no specific walkways for pedestrians and no marked areas. 'As far as I am aware there was nothing to separate the vehicles and pedestrians. 'Most of the staff weren't aware of the risk assessment in that area. The only control measure, if you can call it that, is to be aware that forklifts are operating.' During his investigation Mr Tregale looked back at a random sample of working days through the company's CCTV. He noted an 'untidy' warehouse with 'vehicles working in very close proximity to pedestrians'. He added that there were no high visibility jackets being worn in the heavily stocked area and on one occasion he saw members of staff 'using a hand truck as a scooter'.

"By . Michael Zennie . PUBLISHED: . 13:03 EST, 7 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:44 EST, 7 August 2012 . Mitt Romney is courting General David Petraeus, the hero of the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, to be his vice presidential pick, it was claimed today. In spite of speculation on The Drudge Report which cited an unnamed source who overheard President Barack Obama talking about the Republican candidate's desire to name Petraeus as his running mate, Petraeus released a statement denying the rumor. 'Director Petraeus feels very privileged to be able to continue to serve our country in his current position, and, as he has stated clearly numerous times before, he will not seek elected office,' CIA spokesman Todd Ebitz told Reuters. It remains to be seen whether the four-star general, who is currently the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, would even agree to such a proposition. In previous interviews he has said he has no interest in jumping into the political arena. If Petreaus were tapped to be the Republican vice presidential nominee, it could shift the entire balance and momentum of the election -- electrifying Romney's campaign by picking a man regarded by most of the nation to be a war hero. The pick: The Drudge Report says President Barack Obama believes Mitt Romney wants CIA Director David Petraeus to be his vice president . And Obama could find a fearsome political enemy in the retired general. The two men had a falling out after the president declined to follow Petreaus' advice on keeping American forces in Afghanistan longer. The president is said to be nervous about giving Petreaus too much political power in his administration -- while at the same time worry about the damage he could mete out if he becomes an administration critic. Drudge quotes an anonymous Democratic fundraiser, who says he overheard the president whispering this week about Romney courting Petreaus for the number two spot on the Republican ticket. 'The president wasn't joking,' the fundraiser told Drudge. Romney is said to have met with Petraeus in New Hampshire, where both men have homes. The White House swiftly batted down the report and said the president believes no such thing. Game change: Picking the general, who has bipartisan popularity, could change the momentum of the race for Romney . 'Warrior scholar': Petraeus, who holds a PhD in international relations from Princeton University, is regarded as the greatest military strategist so far this century . David Petraeus, 59, has become one of the most prominent military figures of the 21st century, thanks to a combination of political prowess and military savvy. He was born in upstate New York and attended the West Point, where he graduated near the top of his class in 1974. He quickly rose through the ranks as a promising Army officer and continued his education by earning a PhD in international affairs from the prestigious Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. His degree, along with combat command experience, led politicians and military officers to begin calling him the 'warrior scholar.' In 1991, he was shot in the chest by an M-16 rifle when a soldier tripped during a live-fire exercise. After he recovery, he earned an early release from the hospital by impressing the doctors with 50 sit-ups. He first gained combat prominence in 2003, when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during the invasion of Iraq. He became the father of modern American counterinsurgency after he oversaw the writing of the Army manual on the subject in 2007. That spring, he was tapped by President George W Bush to employ his new tactics during the Iraq War 'surge,' which has been credited with stabilizing the country and allowing US forces to pull out. The success of Petraeus' strategy, combined with his calm and diplomatic public persona, have made him enormously popular in Washington -- on both sides of the aisle. In 2010, President Barack Obama tapped Petraeus to employ a similar strategy in Afghanistan. He was appointed director of the Central Intelligence Agency and retired from the Army in 2011. The US Senate confirmed in with a 94-0 vote. 'I can say with absolute confidence, such an assertion has never been uttered by the president.' press secretary Jay Carney said during a daily press briefing. 'And again be mindful of your sources.' The former Massachusetts governor overtly dodged a question about Petraeus while speaking with reporters this afternoon. Allies describe Petraeus as a 'good soldier' who follows orders, but he and Obama had a falling out of sorts over the troop draw down in Afghanistan. Petraeus opposed pulling American forces out of the war-torn nation when he was the top general in the country and asked the president to give the military more time to beat back the Taliban. However, the president is believed to have listened to polls from a war-weary nation instead of his top general. Petraeus confirmed that revelation during US Senate hearings on his appointment to the CIA. The Romney campaign has been mum about its vetting process for the Republican vice presidential nominee. Numerous names have been bandied around Washington, some seen as reasonable, others are long shots. Petraeus, whose name had been mentioned by pundits but only in passing, is considered one of the long shots. Ohio Sen Rob Portman is viewed as one of the most likely vice presidential picks. Other possible names in the hat include: Florida Sen Marco Rubio, Virginia Gov Bob McDonnell, former Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan. Petraeus could be a game-changer for Romney, who is beginning to trail Obama in some key battleground states. The general hold a PhD in international relations from Princeton University and is celebrated as one of the greatest military strategists in a generation -- earning him the nickname the 'warrior scholar.' He is wildly popular on both sides of . the aisle. When Obama nominated him to lead the CIA, he passed senate . confirmation with a 94-0 vote -- a nearly unprecedented unanimous vote . in the heavily-divided Congress. Petraeus . is the author of the counterinsurgency strategy that turned the tide . against insurgents in Iraq -- allowed US forces to leave the country . with relative stability. He also deployed the tactic in Afghanistan, to less success. However, in 2011, he retired from the Army after a career that spanned four decades and assumed a post at the CIA. When he took the CIA post, The Daily Beast speculated that Obama fears the political power Petraeus could wield. Critics suggested promoting him to . chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the most powerful military . officer in the nation, would have given him too large a podium -- one . where he could control military policy by threatening to make . disagreements public. The Daily Beast also speculated that . Obama feared Petraeus could become a deadly critic of the administration . if he retired and entered public life. Despite this, Petraeus has repeatedly denied he has political ambitions.","Drudge Report says Barack Obama was overheard saying Romney was courting the popular general .

Michelle Knight, the longest-held and abused Ohio kidnap victim has broken her public silence to bravely face the cameras for the first time since her rescue from the Cleveland house of horrors in May. Her captor Ariel Castro is accused of starving and punching Knight until she miscarried during her decade-long ordeal, but the 32-year-old sought to reassure the public saying: 'I want everyone to know I'm doing just fine.' She admitted in the video released onto YouTube on Monday that she had been 'through hell and back, but I am strong enough to walk through hell with a smile on my face.' Denying Castro any further control over her life, a smiling Knight speaking directly into the camera said,'I will not let the situation define who I am. I will define the situation.' It was not even known that Knight had been kidnapped until she was found in Castro's home on Seymour Avenue on May 6. Scroll Down for Video . Bravery: Michelle Knight made her first public appearance since her dramatic rescue from the clutches of Ariel Castro in May - to declare that she 'had been through hell and back' 'I don't want to be consumed by hatred. With that being said, we need to take a leap of faith and know that God is in control.' Appearing alongside Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, who Knight refers to her as 'her best friends', the three women each appeared separately in the three-minute, 33-second clip, as they thanked those who helped them and to request their privacy be respected. All three women appear healthy and flashed their warm smiles to the camera. The set-up interviews, were recorded on July 2 and filmed at the law offices of Jones Day in Cleveland, Ohio and put together pro bono by PR firm Hennes Paynter Communications. Frequently referring to her faith during her brief statement, Knight expressed her dearest wish to now help others who have been through similar horrific ordeals of captivity. 'To know that there is someone out there to lean on and to talk to,' said Knight. 'Thank you for all your prayers. I'm looking forward to my brand new life.'

Michelle Knight, who is now 32, is pictured as a teenager before her disappearance in 2002. She was finally released from hospital today and is staying with Gina DeJesusariel castro amanda berry . He . fathered a 6-year-old daughter with Berry and is accused of starving . and punching Knight, causing her to miscarry - for which is facing the . charge of aggravated murder of a fetus - which could carry the death . penalty. He was arrested on May 6th, shortly after Berry broke through a door at the home and yelled to neighbors for help. Berry's frantic 911 call was immortalized with the words, 'Help me, I'm Amanda Berry.... I need police.... I've been kidnapped. I've been missing for 10 years; I'm here, I'm free now.' Berry was 16 when she disappeared on April 21st, 2003. DeJesus was 14 when she went missing a year later. Knight was the first to vanish in 2002 at age 20. Kathy Joseph, an attorney for Knight, said in a statement that the . three women wanted to 'say thank you to people from Cleveland and across . the world, now that two months have passed.' She said they're being recognized in public, 'so they decided to put voices and faces to their heartfelt messages.' James . Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, also issued a statement saying . Knight and his clients thank people for the privacy they've been given . and do not want to discuss their case with the news media or anyone . else. Released from hospital five days after DeJesus and Berry, Knight has by all accounts been staying with Gina DeJesus' family because of Knight's own fractious relationship with her own. 'Thank you everyone for your love and support and donations which helped me build a brand new life.'I want everyone to know I'm doing just fine.'I may have been through hell and back, but I am strong enough to walk through hell with a smile on my face and with my head held high and with my feet firmly on the ground.'Walking hand-in-hand with my best friends, I will not let the situation define who I am. I will define the situation.'I don't want to be consumed by hatred. With that being said, we need to take a leap of faith and know that God is in control.'We have been hurt by people but we need to rely on God as being the judge.'God has a plan for all of us. The plan that he gave me is for me to help others that have been in the same situations I have been in.'To know that there is someone out there to lean on and to talk to.'I am in control of my own destiny with the guidance of God.'I have no problem expressing how I feel inside. Be positive. Learn that it is more important to give than to receive. Thank you for all your prayers. I'm looking forward to my brand new life.' According to a friend of Gina's parents Felix and Nancy DeJesus, Knight initially rejected a meeting with her own mother, Barbara Knight, in the days after her dramatic rescue, though it is unclear whether they have met since. Lupe Collins, a neighbor who helped the DeJesus family search for Gina since her disappearance in 2004, said in May that the family might even try to adopt Knight. House of Horrors: Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were found at this house in Cleveland, Ohio . 'She was Georgina's sister for ten years in that house and she's still her sister now,' Ms Collins said . 'They're going to take her in as their own family member and help her. 'Michelle . doesn't want to go back to her own family because they abused her . before she was kidnapped and they only want the money now.' In May Ms . Collins said the DeJesus family could offer Knight the loving . household that she never had even before she was allegedly kidnapped by . Ariel Castro. 'They're a . loving family, a giving family. Felix and Nancy will take care of her . and make sure she gets the helps she needs,' Ms Collins said. When Knight finally left hospital in mid-May, she thanked the public for their support and the fund created to aid the victims. A . hospital statement said 'Michelle Knight is in good spirits and would . like the community to know that she is extremely grateful for the . outpouring of flowers and gifts. 'She . is especially thankful for the Cleveland Courage Fund. She asks that . everyone please continue to respect her privacy at this time.' It was revealed she is reportedly suffering hearing loss and facial bone damage after years of vicious beatings to her head. Recovering: Amanda Berry, now 27, (left) appeared on camera along side Gina DeJesus, 23, (right) and Michell Knight, 32 . Knight was 20 when she was taken off the street in 2002 and little was made of her disappearance. Her family told police that she had run away after her young child was taken from her by the Ohio Department of Family Services. Action News19 reported in May that Michelle's mother, Barbara returned to Cleveland after she moved to Naples, Florida, but that Knight refused to allow her mother to see her. 'I just wish that my daughter would reach out and let me know that she's there... She's probably angry at the world because she thought she would never be found but thank God that somebody did,' said Barbara. 'I don't want her to think that I forgot about her... Hopefully whatever happened between us, if something did - I hope it heals because I really want to take her back to Florida with me.' It is still not clear if mother and daughter have reunited. No contact: Barbara Knight, pictured, was not immediately reunited with her daughter following the rescue after Michelle refused to see her . Ms Collins said Knight, who was the first of the three women to be kidnapped, was abused the most during her 11 years in captivity. It has been claimed that she requires facial reconstruction surgery to repair the damage of repeated beatings. 'She's the most broken down physically. He broke other down the most emotionally. And he broke her down the most mentally,’ she said. Ariel Castro appears with one of his attorneys Jaye Schlachet (R) for a hearing in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court on July 03, 2013 in Cleveland, Ohio. Castro was ruled as competent to stand trial . High-profile: The missing person cases of Amanda . Berry, left, and Gina DeJesus, right, were well-known to people in . Cleveland - but the disappearance of Michelle Knight drew little . attention . Found: The women were found at this home in Cleveland on Monday after Berry managed to escape . Michelle was the first of the three victims to be abducted. She was last seen at a cousin's house near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue in Cleveland in 2002. But her disappearance did not receive much publicity as she was classed as a runaway and her name was taken off the missing person's database just 15 months later. In the aftermath of her rescue it also emerged that Michelle was gang-raped and impregnated in junior high - a year before she suffered more than ten years of abuse under a kidnapper. Her mother also said at the time of her rescue that she was looking forward to being reunited with her son, now 13, after she left hospital.

A dental therapist who was diagnosed with skin cancer has decided to chart her life by taking a picture every day.

She originally planned to continue the project for 365 days to mark a new chapter in her life after getting divorced and turning 40, but after receiving a positive feedback she decided to continue taking and publishing the pictures.

The 41-year-old amateur photographer from Accrington, Lancashire, said: 'Sometimes it was hard to come up with a good photo each day and I fell back on taking pictures of food or flowers. 'I ended up setting a reminder on my phone so I wouldn’t forget to take one because maintaining it for a whole year was a challenge.' Ms Holden, who is recovering from basal cell carcinoma, which is a superficial, non malignant form of skin cancer, said the task had been a welcome distraction.

A teenage father killed himself when his girlfriend discovered he was swapping obscene messages with a male teacher, a court heard. Anthony Stubbs, 16, vanished following the confrontation with 18-year-old Charlotte Mason, who had just given birth to their daughter Lily. He was later found hanged in woodland. The primary school teacher, 34-year-old Iwan Harding, appeared in court yesterday accused of sending him indecent messages. Anthony Stubbs hanged himself after his girlfriend Charlotte Mason, pictured with baby Lily, found the messages . Iwan Harding appeared at Caernarfon Crown Court accused of sending indecent texts . The court was told he had asked Anthony about the size of his manhood, described him as a ‘horny lad’ and offered sex. He also sent indecent images of himself to the teenager along with an explicit video of two men performing a sex act. The pair met through Love Leap, a dating website. Although users must be 18 to register, Anthony was able to set up an account under the tag ‘young, sexy gay’. Julie Hughes, prosecuting, said Anthony went missing on November 24 last year following the argument with Miss Mason. ‘The messages themselves are obscene and indecent and, to an extent, that is conceded by the defendant in interview,’ she told Caernarfon Magistrates’ Court in north Wales. Detective Sergeant Richard Horton, of Lancashire police, said that although Anthony’s body was not found until January 14 he had killed himself in woods near his Leyland home soon after he vanished. His mobile phone showed he had contacted 14 people through Love Leap, including a 47-year-old Manchester man. He also spoke to 12 others via the internet video telephone service Skype. Tudur Owen, defending, said the case raised ‘issues of public concern’ because the Crown was alleging that the sending of salacious texts between two individuals amounted to a criminal act. Mr Owen said: ‘It’s a tragic case [but] there were no fixed plans for the men to meet. A lot of it is effectively fantasy.’ Harding, who has been suspended by his school, accepted he sent images and a video to Anthony who, he said, had claimed to be 17. But he denies sending grossly offensive or indecent, obscene messages between October 7 and 19 last year. Harding denied sending grossly offensive or decent, obscene messages at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court . District judge Andrew Shaw reserved his judgement until next month. He said he wanted more time to reflect because the case was an ‘important’ one which could have ‘substantial implications’ for future hearings. Harding, of Llanberis, north Wales, was granted bail with a condition not to have unsupervised contact with a child under 18. Anthony discovered he was going to be a father when he was 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born last September.

A mother-to-be who was part of a lottery syndicate at work had an extra reason to be feeling queasy after suffering morning sickness. Louise Whitby missed out on her share of a £28million jackpot of the EuroMillions because she couldn't get in to work at a recruitment firm in Kirkby, Merseyside, due to illness. When she returned to the office the next day 10 of her colleagues had failed to turn up after the winning numbers were announced on Tuesday. Winners: Ten members of a lottery syndicate have quit their jobs after they scooped a £28million jackpot in the EuroMillions draw. This is the offices where the syndicate worked . Miss Whitby, 31, last night claimed she has missed out on her share of the jackpot because she was off work with morning sickness when payments to their syndicate were collected. She has now hired a solicitor to try to get her portion of the EuroMillions fortune that has been shared by ten workers at employment advisers A4e. It is understood that Miss Whitby and the ten syndicate members were the only employees in the office. Last night she told the Daily Mail that she had been paying into the syndicate for the past two years and had asked to put in her £2 weekly stake before their win on Tuesday, only to be refused. The ten workers understood to make up the syndicate – who have all told Lottery organisers they wish to remain anonymous – will each pocket £2.8million. Had Miss Whitby been awarded the share she claims, she and her colleagues would have each received just over £2.5million. Jackpot: The ten workers understood to make up the syndicate - who have all told Lottery organisers they wish to remain anonymous - will each pocket £2.8million . ‘That money will never buy them happiness,’ she said last night. ‘I considered them my friends, but I can never speak to them again.’ The winners are believed to have quit their jobs after their numbers – 16, 18, 31, 38, 49, and lucky stars 4 and 10 – came up. Miss Whitby, from Liverpool, added: ‘I’ve paid into that syndicate every week for the past two years, but last week I was off work with morning sickness. ‘When I came back in this week, I said I still wanted to pay in, but they said I should just buy some lucky dips with the money instead. Now they’ve won it, they’ve said I can’t have a penny – it’s unbelievable. 'I was away because I’m pregnant with my first child, it doesn’t get worse than that. I don’t think I can face working there ever again.’ A worker at the industrial park said: ‘Hardly any of the staff arrived for work – it looks like other people were drafted in to cover for them.’ Past winners: Adrian Bayford, and wife Gillian, . of Haverhill in Suffolk, won the second-largest jackpot yet in the UK . after taking home £148 million last year . Yesterday an A4e employee tweeted: ‘In recruitment hell....all our staff in Liverpool office have left after winning lottery.’ The tweet was removed a few hours later. A4e is advertising for three jobs in its Kirkby office, including two adviser roles and an administrative role on the company’s work programme, which aims to guide individuals back into employment. While the two adviser posts are advertised with a salary of between £17,850 and £24,000, the full-time administrator is for a salary of between £12,150 and £16,425. A spokesman for A4e said the company did not wish to comment on the matter. The total jackpot was £28,847,237, making the ticket-holder the 16th biggest National Lottery winner. A National Lottery spokesman would say only that the winner had claimed their prize and decided to remain anonymous. He added: ‘It is fantastic to have another EuroMillions jackpot winner from the UK. This country’s run of luck since the beginning of 2012 is amazing – this is the 11th jackpot winner.’","Group of ten failed to turn up for work after numbers were announced .

Died: Police believe Katharine Hooper, 24, killed herself and her two young sons . A young mother killed herself and her five-year-old son by jumping 100ft off rocks at a beauty spot on Dartmoor yesterday. Police believe Katharine Hooper, 24, also killed her younger son Samuel, aged two. The toddler’s body was found at her home 20 miles away. Tourists said they saw Mrs Hooper put Joshua, five, on her shoulders before jumping off Haytor in Devon, a spot popular with ramblers. Police opened a murder inquiry, but said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Friends claimed Mrs Hooper had serious problems in her relationship, which were known to authorities. She had gone missing a few weeks ago, prompting Devon and Cornwall police to launch a public appeal. Last night serious concerns were raised about why officers and social services had not acted sooner to protect the children. Mrs Hooper was last seen alive . yesterday morning. She was walking with Joshua by a cliff at Haytor, . which is almost 1,500ft above sea level and one of Dartmoor National . Park’s most famous landmarks. Shortly afterwards, horrified . onlookers saw the pair lifeless on the ground below, after what they . believed was a tragic accident. Police, paramedics and search teams . rushed to the scene and air ambulances were dispatched to airlift the . pair to hospital, but both died shortly after the fall. Later, officers travelled to Mrs . Hooper’s home in Paignton, Devon, and found the body of a two-year-old . boy, also thought to be her son. It is unclear how he died but a murder investigation has been launched into the deaths. Killed: Joshua, five, (left) died after falling 100ft from the Dartmoor beauty spot, while a body thought to be that of Sam, two, (right) was found at Mrs Hooper's home in Paignton . Flowers: The house in Paignton, Devon, where the body of the two-year-old was found . Dartmoor: Police stood guard near the spot where the pair tragically plunged to their deaths . Detective Superintendent Paul Burgan, . of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: ‘We are keeping an open mind about . all three deaths, but at this stage we are not looking for anyone else . in connection with the incident. ‘We are keen to speak to anyone who may have any information or might have been in the Haytor area on Friday.’ Adrian Leisk, acting chief inspector . of the force, added: ‘On examination of the scene it appears they have . fallen 80 to 100ft, quite a substantial fall.’ He said that the family’s next of kin had been informed, and post-mortem examinations will now be carried out on all three. Neighbours said Miss Hooper had been . experiencing problems in her relationship with the boys’ father, her . long-term partner Neil Patterson, 52. One neighbour, Johnathan Grant, 28, said the couple were both due at a court case in August following an incident in May. Found dead: Katharine Hooper, who went by the name of Kat, and her son Samuel both died on Friday . Investigation: Police are treating the deaths as murders but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident . Sons: Joshua, five, (left) and Samuel, two, (right) are both believed to have been killed by their mother . Search: Police outside the Paignton home of Katharine Hooper where the body of a two-year-old boy was found . Mr Grant, who has known Miss Hooper and her children for three years, said the boys were taken into care after the altercation, and stayed there for six weeks while their mother recovered. She lost her job at a local hotel during the breakdown of the relationship, he said. But he explained that she and the boys moved back into their home only two weeks ago, and she was just beginning to rebuild her life. Mr Grant said: ‘She was good-looking, chatty, funny, she would play with the kids outside a lot.  She was generally just a lovely lady. ‘This is a massive shock to us, it hasn’t sunk in yet. They were very sweet, very well behaved boys.’ He added: ‘I am horrified what has happened. Kat could not drive so I don’t know how she got up to Haytor with Joshy. It’s a mystery. 'Samuel was meant to be starting his first day at the local nursery yesterday. The boys were lovely and played with my girls. Kat was bubbly and laughing and had come out of her shell.’ His partner Tracey Cole, 42, described how Miss Hooper had struggled financially. She said: ‘Kat did not have a lot of money and she asked me if I could look after her cat as she could not afford to keep it.’ 999 call: Emergency services rushed to Haytor on Dartmoor, but could not save Mrs Hooper and Joshua . Tragedy: The body of a two-year-old body was found at Katharine Hooper's home in Paignton hours after she and her son Joshua died at Haytor, Dartmoor . The tragedy unfolded at 11.50am on Haytor as temperatures rose to close to 30C at the tourist spot . Haytor, a steep granite tor, is . considered Dartmoor’s most famous site and is popular with coach . parties, walkers and sightseers. During the 19th century steps were . cut into one side of the tor and a metal handrail fixed to allow . tourists easier access to the summit. At its highest point it reaches . 1,499ft (457 metres) above sea level, providing panoramic views of the . south coast, the Teign Estuary and the rolling countryside. Mike Nendick, from the Dartmoor . National Park Authority, said there had been accidents  at Haytor before . but they were ‘not commonplace’. ‘When you have an attractive . landscape, whether it’s on the coast or moors, it attracts people.

The gym where George Zimmerman trained before allegedly murdering black teenager Trayvon Martin has been accused of trying to cash in by offering to supply information on the killer's training routine. Zimmerman is accused of murdering the unarmed black teenager after following him with a gun and provoking him into a fight. Kokopelli's Gym in Longwood, Florida, have posted an online request form on their website offering to supply information about Zimmerman's Mixed Martial Arts training program after the trial. Publicity stunt? The request form for information on George Zimmerman's training program posted on the Kokopelli's Gym website . The gym is offering to supply details of the MMA training George Zimmerman received before allegedly murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin . But since the form was put up the gym has received a flurry of negative messages on its Yelp social media page, with the owner Adam Pollock of being accused of racism. One user Michael L wrote: 'This place is a dump . Owned by a big racist. Don't go here.' Another post read: 'Bunch of losers crooks and downright horrible people capitalising off the death of a young man.' Mr Pollock had earlier testified to the trial how Zimmerman was an utter novice at martial arts and described him as being 'grossly obese'. He said that in terms of physical ability, he would rate Zimmerman as 1 out of 10 and no higher than a 1.5 out of 10 as a wrestler, suggesting the form may have been intended for media requests. The trial has heard from a witness who claimed the 17-year-old had overpowered Zimmerman during their struggle and had pinned him to the ground moments before he was shot. The witness said: 'Where I first walked out there, the black guy was on top and the only reason I can tell that was because the guy that was on the ground under him at that point wrestling was definitely a lighter color.' Gym owner Adam Pollock (left) told the trial that Zimmerman (right) was a novice martial artist and described him as being 'grossly obese' Zimmerman, who has been described as a 'wannabe cop' had reportedly been training intensely in Mixed Martial Arts three days before the shooting. In his closing arguments, Florida state prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jury: 'A teenager is dead. 'He is dead through no fault of his own. He is dead because another man made assumptions. Because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin will no longer walk on this Earth.' Mr de la Rionda portrayed Zimmerman as a predator, not the good citizen who, as portrayed by the defense, was attacked by a 17-year-old whose actions led to his own death. Victim: Zimmerman is accused of murdering the unarmed black teenager after following him with a gun and provoking him into a fight . Defense lawyers are due to present their . closing arguments today, followed by a final prosecution rebuttal, after . which the jury would begin deliberating a case that has captivated and . polarized much of the U.S. public. Time and again, de la Rionda accused Zimmerman of lying about what happened the rainy night of Feb. 26, 2012, when he spotted Martin inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford. Zimmerman called police, saying he believed Martin was suspicious and noted that there had been break-ins in the neighborhood. But Martin was a guest in the home of his father's fiance, who lived inside the gated community, and was returning from a nearby convenience store with a snack in preparation for watching the NBA All-Star game. Mr de la Rionda tried to undermine Zimmerman's claim that he was not following Martin but looking for a street address to relay to police. The prosecutor sought to reveal inconsistencies in Zimmerman's statements and repeatedly quoted him speaking in police jargon. Pointing at Zimmerman, who was seated at the defense table, de la Rionda asked the jury to use common sense to answer the question: 'Do you believe there's an innocent man sitting over there?' 'Who started this?' he asked. 'Who followed who? Who was minding his own business? And of the two, who was armed?' Mr de la Rionda avoided mentioning race but said Zimmerman 'profiled' Martin, suggesting he assumed Martin was a criminal because he was black. If convicted, Zimmerman could be sentenced to life in prison for second-degree murder and up to 30 years for manslaughter.","Kokopelli's Gym in Longwood, Florida, .

The Russian secret services are deploying an innovative new weapon in the age of cyber-spying - the almost forgotten typewriter. Kremlin counter-intelligence officers reckon this is the only way to prevent their most classified information being stolen by the kind of computer-based data theft exposed by renegade U.S. agent Edward Snowden. An order for 20 typewriters has been made by the elite Federal Guard Service, known by the acronym FSO, which is in charge of protecting Russian president Vladimir Putin, his prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, and other senior officials, it was disclosed on Thursday. Untraceable: Using typewriters, the Kremlin hopes to put an end to confidential documents being leaked and its staff being spied on . 'After scandals with the distribution of secret documents by WikiLeaks, the exposes by Edward Snowden, reports about Dmitry Medvedev being listened in on during his visit to the G20 summit in London, it has been decided to expand the practice of creating paper documents,' said a source. Snowden's presence with his laptops - said to be bulging with U.S. secrets - in the transit lounge at Moscow's Sheremetyevo, brings the threat of cyber-spying home to Russia, explained pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia. Unlike printers, every typewriter has its own individual pattern of type so it is possible to link every document to a machine used to type it, said the newspaper. Typewriters rather than computers are already deployed, described as 'normal practice to ensure security', to record Putin's deepest secrets, said another source. The decision to revert to typewriters among Russia's elite guards follows revelations that U.S. spies intercepted top-secret communications of the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, right, during his visit to London for the G20 summit. he is pictured with U.S. President Obama, left, during a bilateral meeting at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, in March . Files leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, right, were given as a reason for the switch to typewriters. He remains stuck in transit at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where some local Russians have shown their support for his cause, left . 'Typewriters are still used in Russia's power structures, like the Defence Ministry, the Emergencies Ministry, and the security services,' said news agency RIA Novosti. 'They are used predominantly for top secret messages addressed to the president or the defence minister.' An order for the 20 new typewriters and 600 ink cartridges costing 486,500 (£9,880) by the FSO is shown - ironically - on a government website. Putin has insisted that his secret services have not taken advantage of Snowden's almost three weeks in Russia to grab his cache of intelligence.","Kremlin placed orders 'after scandals with distribution of secret documents' and reports that Dmitry Medvedev was being listened to during G20 summit .

Doctors in Albuquerque, New Mexico say it is a miracle that a newborn baby girl survived after her mom was struck by lightning on July 4. Heavily pregnant Kendra Villanueva and her boyfriend Ian Gordon were watching the Independence Day fireworks with friends when a storm approached. As the couple made their way indoors they were struck by lightning underneath a tree in Gordon’s mom’s front yard. Heavily pregnant Kendra Villanueva and her boyfriend Ian Gordon were struck by lightning underneath a tree in Gordon's mom's front yard . Miracle baby: Kimberly Samantha Rose remains in hospital, but is expected to be okay . ‘I had turned and started walking,’ Gordon told KCCI. ‘And next thing I remember, I woke up on the ground. My car alarm was blaring and I was dazed. I didn't know what happened.’ Fortunately firefighters who were nearby at another call were able to arrive at the scene within minutes. Villanueva said she woke up to find her hand was bleeding from where electricity left her body, but her main concern was for her unborn baby. The couple were rushed to hospital where doctors carried out an emergency C-section on Villanueva who was two weeks and half weeks away from her due date. Both parents face long-term muscle spasms as a result of being struck by lightning . Miraculously, baby Kimberly Samantha Rose Gordon survived the ordeal. She remains being monitored in hospital and is expected to be okay. An EMS doctor who treated the couple at the scene said there have only been 11 recorded incidents of a pregnant woman being struck by lightning - anywhere - and only about half of those babies survived, reports KRQE.

The trial of the captain of the . wrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner has begun in Tuscany, but was postponed immediately due to an eight-day nationwide lawyers' strike. The sole defendant, Francesco . Schettino, his eyes shaded by sunglasses, slipped in through a back door . and made no comment to reporters as he arrived on charges . of multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing the shipwreck . near the tiny island of Giglio. The trial in . Grosseto is being held in a theatre . converted into a courtroom to accommodate all the survivors and . relatives of the 32 victims who want justice over the 2012 tragedy. Facing the music: The captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise ship, Francesco Schettino, arrives at court  in Tuscany for trial. Proceedings were postponed as a result of an Italian lawyers strike . Passengers and crew aboard the Concordia were left to their fate by Schettino. The trial in Grosseto is being held in a theatre converted into a courtroom to accommodate all the survivors and relatives of the 32 victims . Schettino's lawyer, Domenico Pepe, said some 1,000 witnesses are . expected to eventually give evidence. Many of them are expected to be . from among the 4,200 passengers and crew on board the ship which struck a . jagged reef off Giglio, took on water and capsized. Schettino, who has denied wrongdoing, could face up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted. The wreck of the ship lies on its side . and half-submerged off Giglio, blighting the seascape for another . summer in an otherwise pristine part of the Mediterranean, a daily . reminder of the slow progress Italian authorities have made in handling . the aftermath of the disaster. The remains of two of the 32 dead have . yet to be found. The timetable to salvage it has stretched on. Only now . is anyone facing trial for the catastrophe - and even that process is . expected to be immediately delayed. Captain Francesco Schettino was at the command of the cruise liner in January 2012 when it hit rocks off the coast of Tuscany and sank, killing 32 people . A lifeboat is prepared after the ship run aground off Italian island . Giglio's coast in January 2012. A report demolished Schettino's claim . that he saved thousands of lives, by steering the ship into shore . Though court-appointed experts . concluded that the crew and owner Costa Crociere SpA, a unit of . Miami-based Carnival Corp, committed blunders and safety breaches which . contributed to the tragedy off the island's rocky coast, only Captain . Schettino has been ordered to stand trial. Prosecutors contend that on the night . of January 13 2012, he steered the ship too close to the island's . coastline in a publicity stunt for Costa Crociere and accidentally . rammed the jagged reef. The cruise company denies that scenario. On trial: Captain Francesco Schettino arrives for his trial in Grosseto, Italy . Survivors described a chaotic and . delayed evacuation, with crew allegedly playing down the seriousness of . the collision, which caused a 230ft (70m) gash in the Concordia's side . and let seawater rush into the ship. Schettino has protested his innocence, . insisting that his skilful steering of the liner to just outside the . port saved thousands of lives. He also contends that the ship's . navigational charts did not indicate that the reef was in its path as it . cruised near the island on part of a week-long Mediterranean tour. A recording of a phone conversation . between Schettino and an exasperated Italian coastguard official who . repeatedly ordered the captain in vain to scramble back on board the . ship to direct the evacuation was played again and again in broadcasts . around the world. In interviews, Schettino insisted he . is no coward. He claimed he had to leave the capsizing liner before it . was impossible to launch any more lifeboats and that in the darkness he . did no see a ladder he could have used to climb back on board. The captain has depicted himself as a . scapegoat. Five other defendants - two ship officials, a helmsman, the . hotel director aboard and the director of the cruise company's crisis . unit - successfully sought pleas bargains. Yesterday, the lawyers' strike prompted the postponement of a hearing to announce their . sentences, likely to be a fraction of what Schettino could get. On Giglio, where residents depend on . tourism and fishing for their livelihoods, the wreckage still mars the . panorama from the island's port. Salvage experts had originally . predicted the ship could be tipped upright in an ambitious operation so . towing could begin in spring of this year. But that timetable has . slipped away. The removal project involves some 400 . workers representing 18 nationalities, including engineers and divers. Yesterday, crews were busy securing some of the caissons being attached . to one side of the crippled ship, which, the planners hope, will help . the wreckage stay afloat when eventually righted so it can be towed to . the mainland. Islanders are impatient for the removal of the eyesore. Schettino slipped in through a back door and made no comment to reporters as he arrived on charges of multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing the shipwreck near the tiny island of Giglio . Schettino (centre) faces 20 years in prison for his part in the maritime . disaster off the island off Giglio. Some 1,000 witnesses are . expected to give evidence at the trial . 'We want our island back as it was,' Giglio's mayor, Sergio Ortelli, told The Associated Press as he looked . at the blue cove where he used to swim. Now, towering cranes and . platforms of the removal team loom over the shipwreck. Mr Ortelli said authorities told the islanders the operation to bring the wrecked ship upright again will begin in September . The island is still awaiting . compensation for damages caused by the shipwreck, he said - 'Our image . was internationally damaged, and tourism figures have dropped off . noticeably.' Meanwhile, the remains of an Italian . woman who was a passenger and of an Indian man who worked as a waiter . have still not been recovered. 'The saddest thing is to pass by on . the ferry and think that two bodies are still there, or will never be . found,' said tourist Patrizia Giovanelli, who was making her second . visit to the island.","Francesco Schettino was at the command of cruise liner in January 2012 .

A baby born a week before the legal abortion limit has defied expectations to battle back from the brink of death and make a miracle recovery. Safari Hutchinson was born just 23 weeks into his mother’s pregnancy - weighing just over 600g - just over half a regular bag of sugar. Doctors battled to save his life, and were forced to break his ribs as they gave him CPR seconds after birth in a bid to keep his tiny heart beating. Safari Hutchinson was born just 23 weeks into his mother Nadine Osbourne's pregnancy. People can legally have an abortion until they reach the 24th week of pregnancy . But now, six months after he was born, he has finally been able to go home with mum Nadine Osbourne, and dad Aubin Hutchinson, both 31. Ms Osbourne, from West Bridgeford, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I had already suffered a miscarriage at 19 weeks in a previous pregnancy, so when I went into labour at 23 weeks, I feared the worst. 'After he was born, the doctors said they didn’t know whether he would survive. I went from being on the world’s biggest high to the world’s biggest low. 'It was a fight for his life. I was losing a lot of blood too, but I didn’t care about me, I could only focus on him. 'But he came through it - it’s a miracle. He is so strong and I’m so so proud of him. I wasn’t allowed to hold him for five weeks, which was heart-breaking but I understood. 'We’re so happy just to have him home.' When he was born, Safari weighed just over 600g - just over half a regular bag of sugar. Doctors had to perform CPR to save his life. In the process, a number of his ribs were broken . Nadine tragically miscarried in 2008 after a 19-week pregnancy, but was overjoyed when she and Aubin found out they were expecting a baby boy, last August. However, her pregnancy this time only lasted 23 weeks and five days. The latest an abortion can be carried out in the UK is 24 weeks - two days after Safari was born. Shortly after his birth, Safari had to have a life-saving operation to close a valve near his heart. He was was transferred from Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham to Glenfield Hospital, Leiceister, for the high-risk operation, which left his blood pressure severely low. Safari had to have surgery shortly after his birth to correct a heart murmur. Image shows his hand shortly after his birth (left) and now (right) However, Ms Osbourne says she is now ecstatic about her son’s miraculous recovery. She said: 'He’s absolutely wonderful now. We can’t believe it. He’s showing all the signs of a happy and healthy baby. 'He’s awake every three or four hours, because he needs feeding - but that’s a good sign. 'I’d thought about the name anyway while I pregnant. Safari means to ""go on a journey"" and that’s exactly what’s happened. It’s been emotional. 'It all happened so quickly once he was born. I had to have steroids before I gave birth to help with a problem with his lungs. Ms Osbourne first conceived in 2008 but she had a miscarriage when she was 19 weeks pregnant. When she went into labour with Safari, she feared that she would lose him too . 'Once I hugged him, it was amazing. I was over the moon and took pictures and sent them to everyone. 'He had a ventilator in his throat which got dislodged and he nearly died because he stopped breathing. The doctors had to give him CPR and I went from the biggest high ever to rock-bottom. 'He had to have an operation too when they discovered he had a murmur after three days. He wasn’t getting enough blood to his kidneys and we were all so worried for him. 'The doctors said he might not survive. A premature baby’s blood pressure is supposed to be above 35. Doctors worry between 20-30, and his got to as low as 13. 'He’s been on a journey - I’m so happy and so proud.' Grandma Beverley Osbourne, 55, said: 'I remember that day when he nearly died. Six months after his birth, Safari has now been allowed to go home. His mother says he is showing every sign of being a happy and healthy baby . 'I got to the hospital after I saw the photo of Nadine giving him a cuddle, and at that point I was so happy. 'But it got worse quickly. The sister of the ward said to me, once they saved him, ""that was close"". 'But he’s gorgeous now. I know every grandma will say that about their own grandchild, but it’s true. 'We all pulled together as a family, and that helped. A pastor came to say prayers and our prayers were answered.' Dr Stephen Wardle who treated Safari said: 'We are doing something right. 'We are one of the biggest trusts in the region but statistically premature babies are more likelyto survive here in Nottingham than any other hospital in the region.'","Safari Hutchinson was born just 23 weeks into his mother's pregnancy .

Speaking out: Moors murderer Ian Brady has described the decision to keep him detained in a maximum security hospital as 'politically motivated' Moors Murderer Ian Brady has branded a mental health tribunal's decision to keep him detained at a maximum security hospital as 'politically motivated'. Last month, Brady lost his legal bid to be transferred to a prison and was told he will instead remain a patient at Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside for the foreseeable future on the grounds that he is mentally insane. In reaction to the decision, Brady wrote a 700-word letter to Channel 5 News in which he criticised the decision of the mental health tribunal, the witnesses who gave evidence and the public money spent on it. He said: '£250,000 wasted by Ashworth medical mediocrities manipulating a politically motivated tribunal... designed to distract public attention from the lack of reasoned argument and pertinent evidence.' Brady - who has long-term paranoid schizophrenia - also criticised the health professionals who gave evidence at the tribunal. 'The pathetic petty abuse... rubberstamp witnesses employed to smear, discredit and distract, revealed more about Ashworth's collective culture of applied ignorance and malice than it did about me. 'Those listening in the real world would have doubted their senses.' Speaking to Channel 5 News, Terry Kilbride, brother of John Kilbride who was 13 when he was strangled and buried by Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley, said: 'He shows how twisted he is... in letters that he writes and the way he speaks like he spoke at the tribunal - not answering the questions. 'He wants to be there again - in the public eye, saying ""It's all been a fix"" so he can have an appeal and do it all again and waste another £250,000.' In the two-page letter, Brady also reveals he is a keen viewer of the satellite news channel Al Jazeera and refuses to watch the BBC. New controversy: Brady sent the 700 page letter from Ashworth hospital on Merseyside to Channel 5 . Rant: In the letter, Brady criticised the decision of the mental health tribunal, the witnesses who gave evidence and the public money spent on it . He said: 'The daily format of PC dumbed-down pulp has even infected the BBC, especially after the Blair/Campbell ""sexed-up dossier"", a criminal attempt to destroy and control. Al Jazeera and text are my news sources now.' Victims' families have criticised giving Brady, 75, the opportunity to 'grandstand' at the mental health tribunal, while others described the hearing as a 'circus' and a 'complete waste of taxpayers' money'. The tribunal was the first time Brady had been seen in public since the 1980s, when he was taken back to Saddleworth Moor in the search for the bodies of two of his victims, and the first time he had spoken in public since being jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966. New details: In the two-page letter, Brady also reveals he is a keen viewer of the satellite news channel Al Jazeera and refuses to watch the BBC . Brady and his partner, Myra Hindley, were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s. They lured children and teenagers to their deaths, with their victims sexually tortured before being buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. Pauline Reade, 16, disappeared on her way to a disco on July 12, 1963 and John Kilbride, 12, was snatched in November the same year. Keith Bennett was taken on June 16 1964 after he left home to visit his grandmother, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day 1964, and Edward Evans, 17, was killed in October 1965. Hearing: A court artist sketch of Ian Brady at his unsuccessful tribunal last month where he demanded to be moved from a maximum security hospital to a prison . Brady was given life at Chester Assizes in 1966 for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward.

While labour is often a intense experience, few mothers can boast of such a dramatic track record as one mother-of-seven. Sheep farmer Amanda Owen has had three of her babies - including her latest - in motorway laybys while en route to the hospital, and a fourth in an army garrison she was passing when the baby put in its speedy appearance. It is little wonder she struggles to make it to the maternity ward: Amanda, 38, lives on a remote sheep farm in the Yorkshire Dales which is two hours' drive from the nearest hospital. The latest addition, a little 7lb girl . called Annas, arrived at 1.25am last Wednesday after the ambulance . pulled over in a layby . Amanda with (L-R) Sidney , 18 months, baby Annas and Edith, 4, all of whom were born on road laybys after Amanda's labour progressed suddenly . Add to this the fact that Amanda often has extremely fast labours - sometimes giving birth in as little as eight minutes. Amanda has been told by her doctors she can’t give birth at home, because she lives too far away from medical help if anything goes wrong. She has also been instructed not to call for an ambulance until she is certain the baby is on its way, meaning she has frequently made her own way to the hospital. Amanada Owen, seen here with baby Edith, has been told that she can not have home birth because she is at a higher risk and her home is too far from medical help . 'It is a catch-22 situation,' said Amanda, who runs the 2,000-acre, 900-sheep Ravenseat Farm, near Kirkby Stephen, with husband Clive. 'Because where we live is so remote, ambulances will not come unless they are sure I am in labour and I cannot have a home birth because I am deemed high risk,' she explains. The latest addition to the family, a 7lb girl called Annas, arrived at 1.25am last Wednesday after Amanda had, in fact, been picked up in an ambulance after she woke in the night with labour pains. Baby Miles is held by big sister Raven after his dramatic birth in an army garrison after rather confused soldiers found a room for Amanda when her ambulance was forced to pull in en route to hospital . The ambulance pulled over in a layby at Keld, just down the road from her home. The ambulance had come from one of the nearer ambulance stations, at Bainbridge, North Yorkshire, 40 minutes away. It was on its way to the Friarage Hospital at Northallerton. The family live on a remote sheep farm in the Yorkshire Dales which is two hours' drive from the nearest hospital . Despite her colourful history of giving birth, Amanda has not ruled out having another child in the future . North Yorkshire, more than 50 miles away along winding country roads. 'I have a history of quick labour,' she said. 'I’m not allowed to come into hospital by myself. 'On Tuesday I ran around after the sheep, had some pork scratchings and my contractions started without warning. Baby Annas with her father Clive, who was in the ambulance when it pulled over and Amanda gave birth . 'I woke up at midnight, poked my husband and told him to get an ambulance. We only got as far as the layby at Keld three miles away. 'It only took ten minutes from stopping to having a new baby. I told the ambulance to just take me home but I had to go to hospital.' Edith, four, was also born in an ambulance at a layby. She arrived about an hour into the journey at West Witton, North Yorkshire. And Sidney, aged 18 months, arrived in a layby at Reeth, about half an hour from home. Before she was banned from driving to hospital her husband was driving her to hospital in his Land Rover when she realised she wouldn’t make it. Seven-year-old Miles was born at the vast Catterick Garrison, near Richmond, North Yorkshire, after bemused soldiers found a room for her. Her first child, Raven ,12, was planned as a home birth because of the foot and mouth epidemic, but it was a difficult birth and in the end she had to be rushed into hospital for a C-section. Then came Reuben, 10 weeks premature, born at home. And Violet, three, who made her big entrance at hospital, after a super-quick eight-minute labour. 'We had a nurse come around to show me some exercises,' said Amanda. 'I said I will just carry on working because it is the same movements for sheep shearing.' Despite their already large family, Amanda remains coy about adding to the brood. 'We don’t plan things like this, there may or may not be more.'","Amanda Owen, 38, lives on a sheep farm in the Yorkshire Dales .

A woman claims she was raped in an impromptu campsite for fans queuing for tickets to see the Wimbledon final. The 34-year-old called police while spending the night in a tent in a park just yards from the tournament. Hundreds of people gathered in the open public space late last Saturday night in the hope of getting last minute tickets to watch Andy Murray. Police arrested a 30-year-old man after the woman dialled 999 in the early hours of Sunday morning. Hundreds of fans camped on Wimbledon Park during the tournament in a bid to get tickets on the day (file photo) The alleged victim told them he subjected her to a serious sexual assault after she joined him in the makeshift tent. A witness said his wife heard a commotion and another man trying to help the victim. He told the BBC his wife heard a woman say: ‘Have you had your fun? I’m calling 999.’ Two tents were later taped off by the police so they could be examined by forensic experts. It is believed that neither had met each other before the evening and both had been drinking alcohol. The alleged attack took place in Wimbledon Park, off Church Road, a stone’s throw from the All England Club. A Met spokesman confirmed detectives from its specialist Sapphire unit are investigating. He said: ‘We are investigating an allegation of serious sexual assault in the early hours of Sunday July 7. ‘We have arrested a 30-year-old man who has been bailed to September. Fans were queuing for tickets to see Andy Murray's final against Novak Djokovic - which he went on to win in straight sets . ‘A 34-year-old woman is the victim. Inquiries are ongoing.’ Camping out overnight for tickets is one of the . great traditions of Wimbledon finals. Queues of tents and makeshift shelters build up around the club throughout the two-week tournament. Wimbledon is one of a handful of major global sporting events where fans can buy the best tickets on the day of play. As a result hundreds choose to camp out overnight in the hope of catching a glimpse of their heroes on finals day. But Championship stewards enforce a strict code of conduct, backed by police, council officials and staff from Wimbledon Park golf club. They will refuse entry to anyone acting antisocially, unreasonably or is heavily under the influence of alcohol. Queuing for tickets on the day has been a Wimbledon tradition for decades (file photo) This year the single queue for the men’s singles final snaked back hundreds of metres from the gate three turnstiles. Officials patrol the queue 24 hours a day and publish detailed advice on how to make the best of the experience. Those staying overnight are only allowed two-person tents. Barbecues and gazebos are banned as is music and balls games after 10pm. On arriving, fans are issued a dated and numbered, non-transferable queue card showing their position in the queue. They are woken up at 6am and asked to dismantle tents and other equipment, shortening the queue before being issued with wristbands. Organisers set up a left luggage facility in Wimbledon Park, which is often used by fans to store their tents and camping equipment.

Iconic: The Shard was designed by architect Renzo Piano to resemble a shard of ice - which made it the 'perfect' site for an Arctic art installation, Greenpeace said . Pioneering: If the group had managed to hang the Arctic artwork, it would have been the highest successful installation of an art project since Philippe Petit tightrope-walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974 .

Two cases of tampering are currently being investigated - the first time in the event's 155-year history that such allegations have come to light. Bill Cowling, honorary show director of the Great Yorkshire Show, described the practice as 'despicable and heinous' and warned a screening system is in operation. On the second day of the event, he confirmed investigations were underway into two suspected cases after checks by the Yorkshire Show's vets when animals were brought out of the ring.

Secret magazines written by British soldiers held in a Japanese prisoner of war camp have been discovered after more then 60 years hidden in an attic. The 'Jungle Journals' were produced by inmates to lift fellow soldiers’ morale as they struggled to survive the horrific conditions in the labour camps during the Second World War. Anyone caught reading them faced severe punishments from the prison guards on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies. The handmade journals, filled with . jokes, colour drawings and short stories, were the idea of survivor . Lieutenant Ronald Williams, who took them home after the Japanese . surrendered in 1945. The Jungle Journals were started by Lieutenant Ronald Williams to keep the spirits of other prisoners of war up in a Japanese labour camp . The cartoons and humour in the journals were designed to help morale in the camps, where prisoners suffered daily beatings and the deaths of their friends . One cartoon noted the difference between the garden parties of 1939 and 1942 . 'You are now reading the first issue of ""The Jungle Journal"". 'This . paper is produced in the hope that it may help pass the time for us. Facilities being what they are, don’t expect too much. 'If this . production can make one gunner forget for five minutes the . disappointments and discomforts of his present position, then our . editorial efforts will not be in vain. 'The editorial policy of this paper is very simple. We try to entertain. 'The only promise we make to our readers is this - this journal will remain free and independent or cease publication. 'There will be no propaganda matter printed under the present editorship. 'Will anybody and everybody who has a story to tell or a verse to work off, please submit it for publication. 'Like the Salvation Army we say ""All contributions will be gratefully received"". 'We will endeavour, however, in this world to give some reward, maybe a packet of rokkos. This means YOU! 'We ask you to give us frank criticism of this issue and to tell us what to do with the . future issues. But not too frankly please! 'This space in our first issue is dedicated in true humility to the memory of the . gentlemen of this Regiment who died on active service on this foreign soil.' Taken from Dr Frank Williams' book: ‘The Jungle Journal: Prisoners of the Japanese in Java 1942-45’ The soldier, who died aged 58 in 1969, kept his collection in a suitcase in the attic at his home in Powys, Mid Wales. On the 60th anniversary of VJ day, his widow Margaret, now 95, passed the papers on to their youngest son Frank, a retired consultant radiologist. Dr Williams, 63, said: 'The journals were a distraction from the awful time they were living in. 'Stories kept the men’s minds off other things. 'I think they felt they needed to keep human spirit. It was a way for them to stay sane. 'You can see hatred all the way . through. They detested their captors but the men kept a level of . humanity which I think is incredible really.' The magazines, which have now been published in a book by Dr Williams, give a rare insight into life on Java, now part of modern Indonesia, from 1942 to 1945. They showed the boredom and horror of day-to-day life in the camps, as well as the humour that helped the men survive beatings, deprivations and the deaths of their friends. They even included a  ‘My Part of the World’ section about home and hobbies - such as stamp collecting, chess and fishing. The first issue carried the message: . 'If this production can make one gunner forget for five minutes the . disappointments and discomforts of his present position, then our . editorial efforts will not be in vain.' Lt Williams, an officer in the 77th . Heavy Anti Aircraft Royal Artillery, edited the journals, which were . first produced on stationery then thin tissue paper once supplies ran . out. They were passed around the camp under the noses of their Japanese guards. Contributors wrote under pseudonyms and as the journals increased in popularity the number of pages expanded from ten to 50. One cartoon, captioned 'Leave it to the . skipper', showed a captain on board his boat smoking a cigar while . battleships sank in the distance, while another illustrated the big band . favourite Deep Purple with a boxer, right . Another 'well known songs illustrated' showed a prisoner working in the camp telling a guard: 'The Things You Are' Regimental Rhymes described the inmates of different ranks held inside the camps . Lt Williams' son Frank, 63, has published the journals in a book after his widow Margaret, 95, revealed their existence in 2005 . Cartoons included jokes about the strange and frightening situation the soldiers had found themselves in . Contributors who drew cartoons or wrote short stories used pseudonyms to protect themselves from their captors . A July 1942 editorial said that the journal proved 'once again that barbed wire does not by any means make a cage' and celebrated the 'boys of this regiment who have so splendidly represented us in the Football Championship' While many prisoners were worked to death in factories or coal mines, Lt Williams remained in . Java for more than three-and-a-half years. Dr Williams said: 'I was a teenager when my father died . and it was only the last six to nine months of his life that he started . telling me about his time during the war. 'He told my mother a few things but he didn’t tell other people very much about his experiences.' Dr Williams, from Llangattock in Powys, said: 'He always came across to me as a troubled man. A illustrated poem written by Lt Ronald Williams celebrated the life of chess, from its creation in Persia 2000 years ago to British prisoners playing it in the 'far, Far East!' Another of Lt Williams' poems talked about 'Home', where: 'There's a little housewife waiting, For a ship to sail the foam, Across ten thousands miles of ocean, And bring her loved one home!' Lieutenant Williams and his wife Margaret, pictured in the late 1930s before he was sent away to war . Lt Williams, pictured on home leave in 1941, took the journals back to Wales after the end of the war and kept them in a suitcase . 'My mother always said he was a different person from when he went to war and when he came back. 'It was the experience, he didn’t really want to talk about it or remember it. 'He had lost a lot of his friends who died in the Far East.' After he came across his father's papers, Dr Williams got in touch with Java 42, a club for prisoners of war who survived the camps in the Far East. He discovered that other Jungle Journals were kept at the Imperial War Museum in London. His father's records suggest there were up to 11 journals but four editions are still missing. He said: 'It has been great that it has all come together but I am sure there must be more journals out there. 'To find the rest of the excerpts would be fascinating.' Japan's forces had invaded Hong . Kong, Thailand and Malaya in December 1941, following the country's surprise attack on the . American base at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. Britiain lost lost battleships HMS . Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse to attacks from Japanese planes that . month, and did not have enough military power in the region to stand up to attack. The British commander in Singapore . surrendered in February 1982 and some troops managed to escape to the . islands of Java and Sumatra, part of modern Indonesia. Indonesia, then a colony known as the Dutch East Indies, was invaded in January 1942. By March, the Dutch commanders . surrendered, and all Allied troops on the island became prisoners of . war, where they suffered starvation, disease and exhausting labour in . the many Japanese camps across the Far East. Japan surrendered on September 9 1945, four months after the end of the war in Europe. The date is now commemorated as VJ Day.

Head of the IFS Paul Johnson warned health spending could not be protected . NHS funding could have to be cut after the election following George Osborne’s move to rule out further tax rises, it was warned today. Ring fence protection for the health service and pensions will come under ‘additional pressure’ after 2015, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. The Chancellor drew the battle lines for the 2015 campaign yesterday, insisting that he can get the deficit under control with spending cuts alone. Under Mr Osborne’s austerity plans, a further £23billion of savings must be found in 2016 and 2017. But questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, he insisted: ‘I’m clear that tax increases are not required to achieve this. This can be achieved through spending reductions.’ Mr Osborne went further when he . addressed a lunch of Westminster journalists, saying that he is . advocating a ‘100 per cent spending mix’. However the IFS said that the decision would mean a further £6 billion being slashed from public spending - leaving budgets for many areas of Government spending one-third lower than they were when the coalition came to power in 2010. IFS director Paul Johnson added that Mr Osborne’s pledge would break his previous rule of thumb that 80 per cent of the deficit-reduction programme should be funded by cuts and 20 per cent by tax hikes. And he made clear that it would become increasingly difficult for the Government to maintain the so-called ‘ringfence’ protecting areas like the NHS, schools, overseas aid and pensions from cuts. This week NHS England warned the health service would face a £30billion black hole by 2021 without fundamental change to the way services are offered. Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘One of the difficulties that governments are in at the moment is that if you ringfence health and pensions - and obviously you can't do anything about what you are spending on debt interest - that's a very, very large chunk of spending that is just out of the picture. ‘Therefore, everything else - if you are going to do it all through spending - has to be cut a lot. ‘If you are going to do it all through spending that does put additional pressure on the ringfence.’ Shortfall: After the 2015 election big savings will have to be made, which could need taxes to rise by £6bilion to Institute for Fiscal Studies said . Mr Johnson cautioned that it would be unusual for Mr Osborne to forswear tax hikes altogether in the wake of the election. ‘Chancellors don't tend to warn the electorate before elections that they are going to raise taxes or not,’ he pointed out. ‘The position whoever wins the next election is going to face is a really big additional consolidation, either further big spending cuts or some tax increases. ‘The choice that is open is to continue with spending cuts such that a whole range of bits of public spending will end up being one-third lower than they were in 2010, or to do some of it through tax increases. ‘In previous post-election budgets - think of 2010, 2001, 1992 - all of those post-election budgets have seen tax rises. ‘Six billion pounds would be the sort of level of tax increase you would want in order to keep to the 80/20 spending-tax rule that he sort of set for himself back in 2010. ‘Coincidentally, it's also the average increase in taxes we've seen after each election over the last 30 years.’ Pledge: Chancellor George Osborne said there was no need for more tax rises . However Mr Osborne has made clear that it is possible to find the money from more cuts instead increasing taxes. Tory ministers have already suggested . they will look at banning under-25s from claiming housing benefit and . limiting child benefit payments to the first two children. ‘We’ve just demonstrated that we can . deliver £11.5billion of spending cuts in the spending round,’ Mr Osborne . said. ‘This can be delivered through spending savings, both in welfare . and in departments and there is no need for tax rises to contribute to . that consolidation.’ He told the Treasury Committee: ‘I don’t think we have reached the end-point in reforming welfare.’ His bullish approach comes as the . outlook for the economy is improving. Mr Osborne claimed that . ‘opposition to what I am doing in the economy is crumbling’ after Labour . agreed to accept departmental spending limits he has set in 2016 and . 2017.","Chancellor says deficit reduction will be done through spending cuts alone .

Deputy Petrash said, in theory, the teenage girl could have swallowed the drugs when the traffic cop first signaled for their vehicle to stop. It took around one mile for their vehicle to pull over after the officer had flashed his lights, Deputy Petrash said. Tragic end: Miss Richardson, pictured with her boyfriend Mason, died in hospital after she swallowed a baggie of meth when arrested on July 5 in a car that was speeding . She was taken to Scott & White Hospital-Brenham but pronounced dead at 4.30am on July 6. It . is not clear the quantity of drugs that the 19-year-old girl swallowed. The results of an autopsy have not yet been released. The Texas Rangers were investigating the young woman's death in custody as part of standard procedure. Deputy sheriff Petrash added: 'It's a tragedy when it is such a young person. I don't know, maybe  she panicked or got scared.' Possession of methamphetamine is classed as a felony under Texas law and can carry a prison sentence. Shock: The sheriff said that Miss Richardson's death in police custody was 'tragic' Life cut short: Miss Richardson (pictured left) had been in a car with friends when she was pulled over during a traffic stop and appeared to make a split-second decision to swallow the meth . In an obituary Miss Richardson was described by her distraught family as a 'beautiful young lady, inside and out, who had a love for her family that exceeded all'. It read: 'A daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, and cousin, all of which she was proud to be.' The 19-year-old, who was born in Humble, Texas, graduated from Kingwood High School last year and had been attending SFA University and Lone Star College. She excelled at swimming in high school and had been coaching the MBW Marlins Swim Team while also working at a local Italian restaurant. The teenager is survived by her parents Rick and Suzanne Richardson and her sister Aubrey. Her funeral is due to be held on Thursday at St Martha Catholic Church in Porter, Texas.

EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey was also abandoned with one reader saying: 'I am embarrassed for us all' One commenter said she had to put it down because 'I'm a bit of a lit snob', while another simply said 'I am embarrassed for all of us.' The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Wicked Years and Eat, Pray, Love completed the top five books reading website Goodreads' 19million-strong community shelved before the end. Readers said the Stieg Larsson classic, which has spawned a series of films, had a 'slow beginning and hard to wait for something to make me care'. Those that abandoned Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert said they found the heroine too unlikeable to read on. Suzanne Skyvara, from the website, told The Independent that the issue of giving up on a book split their readership.

Drug dealers quite literally framed themselves after brazenly posing for photographs while kissing and counting their dirty money. Gang leader Michael Adegoke and mule Peter Cavanagh were part of a mob who netted £30,000-a-month from selling heroin and cocaine. Adegoke - nicknamed Flakey - used Cavanagh to deliver the drugs to the West Country and return to London with the profits. Busted: Drugs mule Peter Cavanagh pictured himself on a train holding a bundle of cash from a recent deal . Trail of evidence: Michael Adegoke, who led a gang which netted £30,000 a month from selling Class A drugs, counts his ill-gotten gains . Cavanagh, 26, took photos of himself brandishing a wad of cash on one of his train journeys back to the capital. They were caught when two of their female dealers were busted on the streets of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Addicts Tracey Carter, 37, and Isabel Cristiano, 46, were caught with cocaine hidden in their underwear and private parts. Police linked them to Adegoke and Cavanagh and found the damning photos on their mobile phones. All four pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. Adegoke, 21, from London, was jailed for five years. Sentencing of Cavanagh, of no fixed abode, was adjourned. Mule: Cavanagh would deliver the drugs to the West Country and return to London with the profits . Carter and Cristiano, both from Weston-super-Mare, were given two-year suspended sentences. Judge Julian Lambert told them: 'Each of you played a different role in what is a highly corrosive trade. 'Those of you who are addicts know the degradation that accompanies addiction. All of you bear a heavy burden of responsibility.' Charles Thomas, prosecuting, said the gang distributed Class A drugs into Weston for two months at the end of last year. Brought to justice: Cavanagh and the three other gang members pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine . He said: 'The drugs would be delivered from London to members of the conspiracy who lived in Weston. 'Once sold at street level, the profits generated would be returned to the suppliers in London, either in cash or by the money being paid into specific accounts. 'Adegoke was the leading figure of the conspiracy, giving orders and instructions to others involved and receiving much of the cash that was generated. 'Carter and Cristiano, who were both drug addicts at the time, were street dealers in Weston. 'Cavanagh’s role was to act as a go-between from London to Weston and was the general factotum of Adegoke. 'He brought drugs to Weston and collected cash to take back to London and passed instructions to others.' Robin Shellard, mitigating for Adegoke, said he was an intelligent man 'in conflict between right and wrong.' Paul Cook, for Carter, said her beautician business foundered and she was looking for cash to buy Christmas presents for her children. Harry Ahuja, for Cristiano, said she was now drug-free.","Michael Adegoke and Peter Cavanagh used female dealers to peddle drugs .

Every government contract with the two security firms accused of overcharging for tagging criminals is being reviewed to see if the taxpayer has been ripped off across Whitehall. Ministers ordered wholesale checks to be carried out after it emerged taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘phantom’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead, in jail or had left the country. G4S received £1billion in revenue from UK Government contracts last year, while Serco made £2billion. Taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals . The Serious Fraud Office has been asked to examine charges made by security giant G4S, which together with rival company Serco is accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which did not exist. Business Secretary Vince Cable today said ‘something bad’ had happened after it emerged up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the government was billed for every day were not real. Multi-million pound contracts across Whitehall are now being scrutinised to see if the problem is more widespread, including in the Business department. Mr Cable said: ‘We are reviewing them. We haven't yet identified any contracts that are a problem, but certainly we are going through this very carefully now. ‘The Government has been looking very carefully at how it gets value for money and has judged that there is some overcharging taking place and we are trying to get down to competitive costs. ‘So there is now very tough auditing of funding and these companies [Serco and G4S] have been found to be overcharging and we are doing something about it.’ Alarm: Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) said 'something bad' had happened with the tagging contracts after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling asked the Serious Fraud Office to investigate . The tagging revelations have raised fresh doubts about government plans to outsource more state work to private firms. But Mr Cable insisted: ‘There are lots of success stories that you don't hear about, but where there is bad practice and lack of care then obviously we've got to tighten up. ‘I think one of the good side-effects of the financial crisis is that the Government has been forced to look much more carefully at public spending across the board and squeeze out value for money in every corner. ‘That's what we are now doing and we've identified these areas where there were bad contractual arrangements and they are being toughened up.’ However, there are growing questions about the role of senior civil servants for failing to spot the problem with the tagging contracts sooner. The Government spent more than £394 million on contracts with security giant G4S last year. The . figure soared by more than £65 million in a year, leading Labour MP . Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) to brand G4S the 'private army' of the . state. Most of the increase . was down to a £51 million hike in spending by the Ministry of Justice, . the department now facing questions over its contracts for electronic . tagging. Mr . Sheerman uncovered the figures in a series of parliamentary questions . and received answers from all departments apart from the Department for . Communities and Local Government. Here . is a summary of Government department spending on G4S contracts in . 2012/13 (excluding the Department for Communities and Local Government . and departments who did not spend any money on G4S contracts): . A disciplinary investigation has been . launched into former officials in the Ministry of Justice  after . discovering contract managers were aware of billing issues in 2008, but . ‘nothing substantive was done’. The scandal could date back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and Wales. Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005. In . some cases private contractors charged the Government for years after . tagging had stopped and cases included being charged for tags for dead . people. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling yesterday condemned the 'wholly indefensible and unacceptable state of affairs'. In May it emerged auditors had been . called in to examine payments to Serco and G4S, which monitor around . 20,000 criminals at any one time. But Mr Grayling told the House of . Commons that G4S has refused to take part in an additional audit so the . Government can rule out the possibility that that dishonesty was . involved in any of the contracts, while Serco has agreed to this demand. He added: ‘It included charges for people who were back in prison and had had their tags removed, for people who had left the country and those who had never been tagged in the first place but who had instead been returned to court. 'There are a small number of cases where charging was known to have continued for a period where the subject was known to have died. 'In some instances charging continued for a period many months and indeed years after active monitoring had ceased.’ The use of firms like G4S have been thrown into the spotlight after it failed to provide thousands of guards to provide security for the London Olympics, leading to the arm to be called in. A Downing Street spokesman said the row would not lead the Government to give up the practice of outsourcing public service activities to the private sector. 'This hasn't changed the overarching view that when it comes to reforming public services, it is important to look at the best way to deliver public services, whether by the state, private sector organisations or voluntary sector organisations,' he said. The revelation is potentially embarrassing for Mr Grayling as he prepares to roll plans to hand out up to 70 per cent of probation services over to the private sector or charities. An urgent review of contract management across the Ministry of Justice's major contracts has also been launched and will report by autumn. Ian Lawrence, general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers (Napo) trade union, said: 'We've long maintained that these companies are unfit for purpose when it comes to holding important public contracts. 'The outcome of the initial investigation into G4S and Serco suggests a good deal of malpractice has been discovered.' Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the ‘revelations are truly shocking’. ‘Given the scale of the allegations, the Government must immediately call in the police and the Serious Fraud Office to investigate both companies as fraud has potentially taken place. 'There can be no cosy relationships with either company if we are to truly get to the bottom of these very serious allegations. If it was anyone else the police would be asked to investigate potential criminality. Why isn't this happening now?' G4S, which saw its shares fall nearly 4 per cent after the announcement, is no stranger to controversy after its London 2012 Olympics contract fiasco. Bungle: The army had to be called in to provide security to the London Olympics after G4S failed to recruit enough guards . It was left nursing losses of £88 million after it failed to provide all of its 10,400 contracted employees last year, prompting extra military personnel to be called in to fill the gap. G4S group chief executive Ashley Almanza said: ‘We place the highest premium on customer service and integrity and therefore take very seriously the concerns expressed by the Ministry of Justice.’ Serco group chief executive Christopher Hyman said: ‘Serco is a business led by our values and built on the strength of our reputation for integrity. We are deeply concerned if we fall short of the standards expected.’","Whitehall review ordered into every deal with two security firms .

It already boasts the world's largest free-standing building, and of course the world's most famous wall, but now it seems China is planning the world's longest undersea tunnel. The tunnel will link Dalian and Yantai and will reportedly cost 260 billion yuan, almost £28billion, and replace the Channel tunnel as the world's longest undersea structure. Architects from the Chinese Academy of Engineering are expected to submit finalised blue prints of the tunnel to the State Council next month, it has been reported. Not content with the world's longest wall, China is planning the world's longest undersea tunnel. It will be about 123 kilometres long and link Dalian in Liaoning province to Yantai in Shandong province under the Bohai Sea . This will take the ambitious project, which will be about 123 kilometres long and link Dalian in Liaoning province to Yantai in Shandong province under the Bohai Sea, a step closer to implementation, the South China Morning Post said. If it is approved it is believed the resulting structure will be longer than the Seikan Tunnel and the Channel Tunnel combined- which are the world’s two longest tunnels. It would also make it more than 10 times longer than any other tunnel in China. While the cities only lie 170 kilometres away from each other - across the sea, on land the journey is more than 1,680 kilometres, and travel can take about 6.5 to eight hours. Plans say the tunnel could take six years to build and once completed would be linked with China’s high-speed train system, Wang Mengshu. It would mean the journey between the two cities would be cut to 40 minutes. China already boasts the world's longest wall, which runs along it's historical northern borders .

Rowers thought it was safe to return to the river after a swan, named Mr Asbo, who terrorised them three years was finally moved. But now people living by the River Cam in Cambridge say his son is following in the aggressive swan's footsteps - and they have already nicknamed him Asboy. They say the young swan is taking an active interest in boats and has the same 'cocky' nature as his dad. Mr Asbo was moved to a secret location by the river authorities last year after his attacks on rowers escalated. Oarsmen reported he would plough into them in 'drone-style' attacks and bite their arms and legs. Although Asboy is yet to attack any rowers, some believe it is only a matter of time. Steve Austin, 65, who has lived near The Plough pub in Fen Ditton, Cambridge for about 10 years, believes Asboy is capable of the same level of violence that his father was known for. He said: 'We know this river, and it might sound stupid but we know all the animals. We see them grow up and this is the son of Asbo, no doubt about it, and we call him Asboy. 'He's just started taking an interest in the boats and he is so cocky. 'He walks into my garden, just like Mr Asbo used to, and we spar. He walks up to me with his wings out just like his dad did. 'He's not attacking the boats at the moment, but maybe that's because they did not have any young this year. He's still a young-un himself.' The Conservators of the River Cam decided to move Mr Asbo because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. Mr Asbo (pictured) was removed after he dive-bombed rowers and chased boats up the river . Mr Asbo (pictured) was known as Britain's most aggressive swan and was moved 60 miles away . The move, to a secret location about 60 miles away, was approved by Natural England. The conservators declined to comment on whether they were keeping tabs on Asboy or any of Mr Asbo's other offspring. Bill Key, president of the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association, said he had not heard of any reports of attacks on rowers. He said: 'That part of the river has been a pleasure to row in. You might get the odd swan fluttering their feathers during mating season, but compared with what we went through it's nothing. 'That was unbelievable. I was physically attacked on more than one occasion from a height.' Locals were repeatedly attacked by the notorious swan before he and his mate were transferred .

Britain is bathed in sunshine at last - but the soaring temperatures may be too little too late for ice cream sellers. The slow start to the summer, together with declining numbers of ice cream vans, rising prices, and health concerns have all seen demand for ice cream fall, market research analysts have said. Britain's ice cream consumption has dropped by 11 per cent since 2007 - and demand could fall by another nine per cent within the next four years, according to Mintel. Decline: This ice cream van was doing a roaring trade in Hyde Park at the weekend, but the growing rarity of the vehicles is contributing to a fall in sales of the frozen treat, analysts say . Britons are eating 333 million litres of ice cream tubs, blocks, lollies or cones every year, according to a report in the Telegraph. Where once they flocked to ice cream vans for a cheap, refreshing treat in the summer months, now Britons are more likely to indulge in the occasional tub of luxury ice cream from the likes of Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs, said Mintel consumer analyst Peter Ayton. Sales of 'stick' ice creams such as Cornettos or 99 flakes have dropped by almost a third over the past three years he said, adding that impulse buys from mobile sellers are down. Just a quarter of people buy from an ice cream van now, compared with nearly 40 per cent in 2010. 'Ben & Jerry's have brought out their Core range and Haagen Dazs their Secret Sensations which cost around £3.50, so people have cut down on the amount they eat,' Mr Ayton said. 'When I was young, ice cream vans used to come round and there was a 'push' for parents to buy. That simply isn't happening now.' Melting away: Sales of 'stick' ice creams like lollies, Cornettos and 99 Flakes have fallen by almost a third in three years, according to consumer research experts . Mintel said a quarter of increasingly health-conscious consumers were preoccupied by the high fat and sugar content of ice cream. The ageing population is also impacting on sales, Mr Ayton said, as people over 55 are less likely to indulge in the traditional treat on a frequent basis.","Sales of lollies, Cornettos and 99 Flakes down by a third in three years .

Assistant District Attorney Jayson Criddle, who prosecuted the case, described the result as ‘fair.' ‘She’s going to serve a very significant sentence for somebody who’s never been in jail before, which is nothing to sneeze at. I wasn’t going to agree to anything that didn’t include jail time,’ she told The Tennessean. DePriest was a music teacher at Rucker-Stewart Middle School, pictured, and also instructed the Gallatin High School band . DePriest’s charges included four counts of statutory rape for having sex approximately 20 times with a 16-year-old boy in 2010 in Hendersonville. At the time, the boy was a member of the Gallatin High School band, which DePriest, then 25, was instructing. She was also teaching music at Rucker-Stewart Middle School. Her other charges included 10 counts of statutory rape and one count of sexual battery for having sex with a 17-year-old boy, also a member of the GHS band, in 2009 in Gallatin. ‘I’ve spoken with both (victims) and their families, and they’re satisfied with the outcome,’ said Criddle. ‘They’re relieved to not have to go through a trial.’ DePriest's 10 year probation includes not having access to a computer; using drugs or alcohol; going near areas with children and no contact with minors other than relatives . The terms of DePriest's 10 year probation includes not having access to a computer; using drugs or alcohol; going near areas with children and no contact with minors other than relatives. She is also required to pay a $1,200 fine and make a $500 donation to Ashley’s Place, a local nonprofit that helps child victims of sexual crimes and abuse. Her probation deal is also conditional on completing her jail time with good behavior. DePriest is scheduled to next appear in court on January 6, two days after her release, for approval of her plea deal.","Devri DePriest agreed to a plea deal that involved pleading guilty to six counts of statutory rape .

The parents of a 15-month-old child who weighted only 9lb when she died, have been arrested in connection with her death. Ernest Ingram, and Denise Snow-Ingram, who are both 38, told police they had never taken their daughter to see a doctor because of religious beliefs. The tiny girl died at a children's hospital on Wednesday morning, after an ambulance was called to the parents' Phoenix home after reports of a child not breathing. Arrest: Ernest and Denise Ingram have been charged with count of child abuse each over the girl's death . Her parents were arrested on child abuse charges on Wednesday. As well as being malnourished, the toddler had several fractures to her ribs, Phoenix police told Az Central. A healthy weight for a 15-month-old girl is about 22lb but the child weighed 9lb - the same as some newborns. The Ingrams told police they were the only people to have ever looked after the child, who had not seen a doctor since her birth because of their religious beliefs, Fox 10 reported. They have not yet stated what their religion is. When they appeared in court today, where they were each charged with one count of child abuse, Mrs Ingram denied that they had harmed any of their seven children. She said: 'We have never committed a felony, any type of anything as far as criminal activity before, and also we need the opportunity to be able to collect evidence to show, to prove that we didn't do ... what we are being accused of.' Investigation: Police vehicles can be seen at the couple's Phoenix home, where they lived with seven children . Prosecutors claimed that the girl's low weight contributed to her death, according to KTAR. A post-mortem examination was due to take place on Thursday. The couple remain in jail on a $250,000 bond. 'They have claimed it is their religious right to raise their kids as they please,' Sergeant Trent Crump of Phoenix police, said. He added that the parents had been the sole carer for the child and believed she had been developing slowly. There was no record of police calling at the couple's home before the death of their child, and Sergeant Crump said the house did not appear to be uninhabitable. He added that the 'living standard is not something at this point that we're looking at as being a factor in all this'. Abuse charge: Paramedics were called to the Phoenix home after the 15-month-old girl stopped breathing . Police were first alerted to the child's welfare after paramedics received a call of child not breathing. The toddler was rushed to Phoenix Children's Hospital at about 10am on Wednesday, but she died. Six other children, aged between 3 and 12, who lived in the same house have been removed. They did not appear to be harmed in any way, but will be examined by doctors.
